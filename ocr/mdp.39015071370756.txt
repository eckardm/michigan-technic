of the underseas. Unlike the famous bathysphere, which dangled at the end
of cables, Deepstar has no strings attached. She will rise, dive, turn and back
at will, self-propelled and independent. Her 3-man crew will be able to
set instruments, sample the bottom at depths of two miles, salvage, photograph,
and most of all, explore the vast oceanic world that has hidden itself so long from man.
Captain Jacques-Yves Cousteau, the undersea pioneer who created
the basic concept, is collaborating with Westinghouse on the vehicle. Deepstar will be equipped
with the controls, instruments, mechanical "hands" and everything else
needed for the deep swim. You can be sure ...if it's Westinghouse

Floating on air...cushioned in foam
Sleeping is like floating on air, when the mattress is made of urethane foam ... a mattress that "breathes"
air through every cell, and weighs so little that a housewife can lift it over her head! ► By combining
exact proportions of five chemicals from Union Carbide, this versatile foam can be made soft, firm, or rigid.
Mattresses, upholstery, and pillows can be given their own degrees of resilience. Other formulations pro-
duce superior insulation in the form of prefabricated rigid panels or foamed in place. In a refrigerator trailer
body, this insulation can be used in much thinner sections than conventional materials, so cargo space is in-
creased substantially. ► Recently, Union Carbide introduced "climate-controlled" polyether, which results
in uniform foam properties despite such curing variables as summer heat and humidity. Another Union
Carbide development is production of the first polyether for flame-lamination of thin foam sheets to cloth,
adding warmth without noticeable bulk. ► In their work with chemicals, the people of Union Carbide have
pioneered in developing polyethers and silicones for urethane foam, found new uses for the foam, ^
and shown customers how to produce it.

The Michigan Technic was founded in 1882 by the En-
gineering Society of the College of Engineering at the
University of Michigan. That makes it the oldest engineer-
ing college maga2ine in the country. Every year since 1882
the staff of the Michigan Technic has been striving to make
a better magazine. After eighty-one years of making this a
better magazine, we of the Technic think we have one of the
best. Yet this is not a sufficient reason for us to spend our
time writing it. There are many reasons for writing the
Technic, and there are many reasons for reading it. In this
our first issue for the current academic year, we want to tell
you why we publish the Technic and why you should read it.
A few people are on the Technic staff because they feel
they need to be well rounded and have an extracurricular
activity. There is no doubt about it, the Technic is a good
activity. Some of us are here to work our way up through a
challenging organization, for the Technic offers a true
challenge with every deadline and every decision. Our
faculty advisors have given us almost complete control, and
it's up to us to manage the magazine.
Actually, each person on the staff could list his own rea-
sons for being there. Essentially, we're all students who
enjoy putting out a magazine that we hope everyone enjoys
reading. To make our magazine more enjoyable, we try to
print a little bit of everything. There are editorials on con-
troversial issues of the day; articles on technical and non-
technical topics; jokes; features on Michigan's educational
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


facilities and research projects at Michigan and around the
world; and, beginning this fall, interviews with recent grad-
uates of the University of Michigan to help give you an
idea what you might be doing when you graduate.
The thought of graduating from Michigan and finding
a job brings to mind another very good reason for reading
the Technic. A graduate student once said, "by the time I get
my Ph.D., I'm going to be obsolete." What he said would
be very true except that he can stay abreast of his chosen
field by reading technical journals. Unfortunately, many stu-
dents leave here and don't stay abreast of their field. This
is because they never took the time to read technical maga-
zines and have no intention of turning over a new leaf after
they leave. If you want to stap abreast of your field after you
graduate, you can develop the good habit of reading a good
magazine, the Technic, before you leave. Remember, our
articles are written by students who see a subject from ap-
proximately the same point of view that you do. We won't
print an article that you as a student, regardless of back-
ground, can't understand. We all enjoy being engineers,
and we want to help you enjoy it by giving you interesting
material on your field.
All in all, we like our magazine, come around and become
a part of it. If you don't like it, come tell us why. Maybe we
can talk you into helping us improve it.

Arm yourself with facts about DuPont
These booklets helped persuade some 700 new B.S. graduates
to join us in 1963. It was mostly a matter of getting facts.
For example, if you want to start your career in a certain
section of the country, you'll find that Du Pont—with facilities
in 28 states—will try to accommodate you.
If you're interested in growth for what it can mean to you
personally, you'll be interested to know that our sales have
increased 750% since 1937. You've probably heard that R&amp;D
expenditures are a good indicator of a company's future success.
We spend $90 million a year on it, $60 million of which goes
straight into "pioneering research" — the discovery of new
scientific truths and new materials.
Our booklets will answer most of your preliminary questions.
Later—or even now if you wish—we can talk specifics by letter,
or face to face. Why not write us or send our coupon? We'd
like to know about you.

ENCE
AND
RING
by Todd Pierce
DISCOVERY . . .
Michigan scientists employ new chem-
ical concepts to create more powerful,
more efficient propellants to boost
rockets into space.
14
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Michigan engineers developed, assem-
bled, and fired this three stage rocket
loaded with University of Michigan in-
strument packages. The instruments took
samples of the atmosphere 350 miles up.
The layman often fails to make (he cor-
rect distinction between science and en-
gineering. The scientist seeks radically
new concepts while the engineer exploits
the proven facts for the benefit of man-
kind.
When we compare science and en-
gineering we are not dealing with two
entirely different fields, but rather
with interrelated arts. Both science
and engineering can be classified as
art if we consider an "art" as an
activity which skillfully creates. But
further classification than this is nec-
essary, because we realize that all
science is not engineering, though we
may also hesitate to specify whether
or not all engineering isn't, in fact,
pure science. That is, we may tend to
conclude that if science is an art and
engineering a science, then the differ-
ence between science and engineering
is simply in the rank of classification.
Engineering, however, is not a sub-
division or an area of pure science. It
is a subdivision of applied science,
along with such other applied sciences
as medicine, dentistry, computer tech-
nology, and so forth. Thus in our
classification, we define pure science
and applied science as two large cat-
egories under "art," and engineering
as a particular field of applied science.
Very generally speaking, pure sci-
ence is the art which relates universal

and specific phenomena in organized,
systematic terminology. It is divided
into three large categories: biology,
chemistry, and physics, each of which
is further subdivided. An interesting
note is that each of these subdivisions
in pure science has a corresponding
subdivision in engineering. To illus-
trate, we need only look at bio-en-
gineering, chemical engineering, and
physical engineering, whose very titles
indicate the correlation.
But here the similarity between
science and engineering ends. Let's
look at the differences. Science en-
compasses all previously tabulated
knowledge and with this as a tool
seeks new knowledge only for the
sake of expanding its own scope. En-
gineering, on the other hand, utilizes
all of the information obtained from
science and seeks new methods of ap-
plying it to practical use. For ex-
ample, if science were to discover a
new material capable of withstanding
high temperatures and stresses, en-
gineering would incorporate this ma-
terial in a new design for a more
powerful rocket or a stronger bridge.
From this prototypical example we
can also see that all engineering is re-
stricted by scientific progress, since
engineering certainly cannot apply
undiscovered facts to any practical
advantage! Science, however, is unre-
stricted in this sense, because science
has no limits to its range or scope.
The engineer must depend on the
scientist for his materials far more
than the scientist must depend on the
engineer.
Engineering is further restricted by
the elements of time and budget. Vir-
tually all engineering projects have a
deadline for completion and must be
accomplished within set financial
boundaries. Science, however, is again
unlimited here, because it is rarely
placed on a time schedule. Nor is
science generally restricted financially,
because what one scientist cannot
complete, another will. Budgets may
delay discoveries in science, but they
will never restrict them.
Finally, the temperaments of en-
gineers and scientists differ. A scien-
tist is a radical, or at least he is in
his work. Scientists look for radically
neu&gt; concepts; the very nature of
their endeavors requires that they de-
part from customary ways of thinking
and exploit new areas of thought.
The engineer, on the other hand,
must by virtue of his vocation re-
strict or "conform" the range of his
thinking to accepted facts, and can
change his mode of thought only
when science makes a new discovery.
In a word, when science introduces,
engineering develops.

THE GRADUA
EDITOR'S NOTE: In order to increase student awareness
of the opportunities available for engineers in industry, the
Technic has initiated this feature on University of Michigan
engineering graduates. We plan to publish this feature on a
monthly basis, and we hope that our readers will find this
addition both interesting and informative.
Lorf.n de Groot, who earned both his BSME and
MSME degrees from the University of Michigan's Col-
lege of Engineering, is a project engineer assigned to
indicator and mechanisms development at the Instru-
ment Division of Lear Siegler, Inc., in Grand Rapids,
Michigan.
During his senior year in '56-'57, DeGroot assisted
Professor G. V. Edmonson at the Engineering Research
Institute (now the Institute of Science and Technology)
in a study of transient pressure phenomena during re-
fueling of military aircraft.
After graduation, Naval reservist DeGroot resumed
active military duty and was commissioned an Ensign
and assigned to a destroyer as navigator and gunnery
officer.
In June, 1960, after discharge from the service, De-
Groot returned to the University to earn a Master's
Degree in mechanical engineering. While working to-
ward the degree, he was employed as a teaching fellow
in the Mechanical Engineering Department, teaching
courses in manufacturing, production engineering, and
the kinematics and dynamics of machines.
DeGoot was elected both to Tau Beta Pi and Pi Tau
Sigma during his college days.
Upon earning his MS in June, 1961, he accepted a
position with the Instrument Division of Lear Siegler,
Inc. After completing a three-month orientation pro-
from campus .

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


gram for newly-graduated employees, Loren was assigned
to the preliminary design section of the Instrument and
Mechanisms Engineering Department as a project en-
gineer.
Since 1961, he has been aiding in the development
of airborne navigation computers for both present and
future aircraft. More specifically, he has been working
on the development of a hyperbolic coordinate converter
which converts electronic signals indicating aircraft po-
sition in hyperbolic coordinates to the latitude and
longitude of the aircraft in geographic coordinates. He
served, too, as senior project engineer on the Division's
incremental velocity indicator, an instrument designed
for the Project Gemini spacecraft, which indicates to
the astronaut the changes he is effecting in the ship's
velocity in all three axes. Since Gemini is intended to
meet and dock with a second orbiting vehicle, the astro-
naut must consult the incremental velocity indicator to
change Gemini's orbit to coincide with that of the
rendezvous vehicle.
Although he has entered industry, DeGroot continues
to maintain school ties. Under Lear Siegler's employee
development program, he returned to the Ann Arbor
campus in 1962 to attend a summer engineering confer-
ence in digital computer engineering conducted by the
Engineering School. In addition, DeGroot is associated
with the Navigation and Guidance Lai) of the Univer-
sity's Institute of Science and Technology through an
industry-education information exchange program.
In June, he will present a paper on hyperbolic co-
ordinate conversion before the Institute.
DeGroot is a member of the Institute of Navigation
and the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers.
A native of Grand Rapids, he is a graduate of Cen-
tral High School and Grand Rapids Junior College. He
is married and has three children.

AN OVERVIEW
by Lloyd Nirenberg
Technical literature is overflowing
with books and papers on the subject
of stability theory. Consequently this
article should have a good "raison
d'etre" if it is to join the ranks. What
1 hope to accomplish is present a solid
foundation for understanding this
"business" of stability.
Let the input to a linear system be
a function of time, Xj (t). Let the out-
put be represented by x„ (t). We re-
quire a functional relationship be-
tween Xj (t) and x0 (t) to design sys-
tems with particular uses.
Unfortunately there is no time
function, h (t), such that x0 (t) = h (t)
X! (t), i.e., there is no direct relation
between the input and output time
functions.
If, however, we review some of the
properties of the Laplace transform,
we will discover the solution to the
problem. For if
JC{h
m- X. o
AND
put Laplace transforms and indirectly
relates the time functions.
But the most important property
about H (s) is that it is dependent
upon each particular system. There-
fore, specifying H (s) specifies what
the system will do.
H (s) is a mathematical model of a
system, and is termed the system
transfer function.
This transfer function is easily
determined if we are analysing a
given system. Since all linear systems
can be described by linear differential
equations, we can take the Laplace
transforms of the equations and solve
for H (s) = X„ (s)/X, (s). For example,
if

tice into algebraic functions of s, a
complex variable, we can write

IVHERE rp AND Wp ARE REAL NUMBERS
Since the constants dp must occur
as real numbers and pairs of conju-
gates, the output x„ (t) will be real;
i.e., the terms of form
will cancel each other to zero.
Now let us consider the terms

then we can have X„ (s) = H (s)X, (s).
From the convolution theorem we
know that
%o(t)~~ f°h(t-r)x(rUr
HENCE H(S)=/[h(t)'
is the best functional relation we can
have between the input and output.
H (s) directly relates input and out-
where N and D are polynominals in
s of degree k and m respectively, C
is a constant, and n, . . . nk, d, . . .dm
are the zeros and poles of H (s).
Now

where the constants K,

Op
We note that if &lt;rp&lt;0, xop is a damped
oscillatory component. If o-p = o,
xop is a pure oscillatory component.
But if (tp&gt;0, xop is a rising oscillation.
See figure 1.
The last case is clearly intolerable.
If the system has H (s) such that this
rising oscillation can result, then the
system will soon go out of control
and its usefulness will be nil. This is
called an unstable condition. In reali-
ty, however, physical devices are
slightly non-linear, and hence the
18
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


bound will tend toward an oscillatory
form. This is caused by "saturation"
in the non-linear device.
It is now apparent that H (s) must
be of such form that the sysem re-
mains stable and retains the ability
to perform as designed.
The determination of stable forms
of H (s) is one of the major problems
of the system designer. The remain-
der of this paper will examine vari-
ous methods for determining the sta-
bility of a given transfer function.
Recall that we had instability
when (tp&gt;0. If we plot the poles of
H (s), or dp, in the "s-plane", we see
that in order for H (s) to be stable,
there must be no poles of H(s) in the
right half of the s-plane. Refer to
figure 2.
It will be instructive at this point
to examine the simple control system
in figure 3, derive its transfer func-
tion, and test it for stability.
Immediately we can write
X. ($)* G(S)R(S)
from the definition of a transfer
function. Then
R(S)*%*($)- x0(5)
and
Y0(S)-F(S)K(S)
K(S)= e(S[*i(S)-F(6)XAS)]
*'(V- Tr?&amp;-^(S)
Therefore
&amp;(b)
N(S)
The problem remains to test H (s)
for stability. Since H (s) must have its
poles in the left half plane, we have
to determine the location of the zeros
of D (s) = 1 + G (s)F (s).
If D (s) is a simple function, then
we can factor it, and by inspection
locate its zeros. This is rarely the
case, though, and D (s) is often of
order five or greater. We must resort
to "high powered" methods.
The first formal test we will use is
the Routh Rule. This an algebraic
method applicable when D (s) is a
polynominal.
We can write
a.

where an, . . .

the poles of H (s), is determined as
follows:
If the signs of all the terms in the
first column are the same, all the
zeros of D (s) lie in the left half plane
and H (s) is then stable.
If the signs are not all the same,
H (s) is unstable, and there are as
many zeros of D (s) in the right plane
as there are sign changes in the first
column.
The Routh Rule is a rather dry
approach to the problem of stability.
It is best used by a computer since the
terms in the array can get very large
and difficult to compute for high or-
der D (s). The rule is often applied
to get a quick "yes" or "no" answer
to the stability question.
The next two methods are used
most frequently because they are
relatively easy to apply and they give
information as to how the system
must be modified to get desired re-
sults.
The first is the root locus method.
Note that if D (s) = 1 + G (s)F (s) =0,
then G(s)F(s) = -l.
Since s is a complex variable, the
above relation means
WHERE (Ji - ANGlf OF b(s)F(s).
For (1) to hold,
i | G(s) F(s)| = I
V^i i (f) = ~-7T = -)8Cf
The system will be stable for those
values of s that satisfy (2) and lie in
the left half s-plane. The proper val-
ues are found by drawing the locus
of solutions to (2) and picking the
ones that lie in the left half plane.
The details of finding the locus of
s are too involved to be presented
here. Instead, a simpler approach
based on the root locus method will
be explained.
The system is unstable if | G (s)
F (s) | = 1 and * = - 180°. So if
| G (s)F (s) | is one before $ is - 180°,
then H (s) is stable. This condition
for stability can be easily observed if
we plot | G (s)F (s) | and &lt;J&gt; each vs.
some parameter.
These terms are plotted in figure
4. The curve * vs log w is a simple
approximation and is also included
in the figure.
From the curves it is obvious that
the system is stable for the value of
K chosen, because G (s)F (s) is 1 be-
fore &lt;J&gt; is — 180°. But also observe how
this method shows that K can be in-
creased a great deal without the sys-
tem becoming unstable.
The root locus method is a quick
and informative device for testing
stability.
The method proposed by Nyquist
in 1932 remains in the author's opin-
ion an exceedingly elegant approach
to the problem. To understand why,
let us examine some of the properties
of analytic functions.

Figure 5(A)—By multiplying D(s) by a
constant, the D contour can be shifted
along the real D(s) axis. In certain appli-
cations it is necessary for D to be a
given distance from the imaginary axis.
Or, the excess of zeros over poles of
W (s) enclosed in C equals the total
angular change of W (s) over C, di-
vided by 2n. This relation is the basis
of the Nyquist stability criteria.
If C is a contour in the s-plane,
1 + G (s)F (s) = D (s) assigns a unique
value to each s on C. We make a plot
ot these assigned, or mapped, values
on a new plane, called the D (s) plane.
These values will form a new contour
D in the D (s) plane. Since
the number of times the curve D
encircles the origin of the D (s) plane
equals N„ — N„ within the chosen C
in the s-plane.
By choosing C to be a contour en-
closing the entire right half s-plane,
the number of revolutions of D
around the origin of the D (s) plane
will equal the excess of zeros over
poles of D (s) that lie in the right half
s-plane.
It turns out, due to the nature of
the physical system, that D (s) can
have no poles in the right half s-plane.

Since a stable system requires that
no poles of H (s) be in the right half
s-plane, N0 must equal zero. So for a
system to be stable, the plot of D (s)
in the D (s) plane must make no en-
circlements of the origin.
The utility of the Nyquist test is
that one can determine stability when
D (s) can't be factored, and in addi-
tion can tell by now how much a
system parameter must be varied in
order to obtain stability. Figure 5
gives explanatory examples.
The motivation for the major sta-
bility tests has been presented in this
paper. It is hoped that the reader now
has a more general understanding of
a few of the methods of system anal-
ysis.
The author wishes to express appre-
ciation for Prof. Louis J. Catrona's
instructive criticisms of this article.

Tom Thomsen wanted challenging work

He found it at Western Electric
T. R. Thomsen, B.S.M.E., University of Nebraska, '58,
came to Western Electric for several reasons. Impor-
tant to him was the fact that our young engineers play
vital roles right from the start, working on exciting en-
gineering projects in communications including: elec-
tronic switching, thin film circuitry, microwave systems
and optical masers.
The wide variety of Western Electric's challenging
assignments appealed to Tom, as did the idea of ad-
vanced study through full-time graduate engineering
training, numerous management courses and a com-
pany-paid Tuition Refund Plan.
Tom knows, too, that we'll need several thousand
experienced engineers for supervisory positions within
the next few years. And he's getting the solid experi-
ence needed to qualify. Right now, Tom is developing
new and improved inspection and process control
techniques to reduce manufacturing costs of tele-
phone switching equipment. Tom is sure that Western
Electric is the right place for him. What about you?
If you set the highest standards for yourself, enjoy
a challenge, and have the qualifications we're looking
for—we want to talk to you! Opportunities for fast-
moving careers exist now for electrical, mechanical
and industrial engineers, and also for physical science,
liberal arts and business majors. For more detailed

ability to think ahead of the situation and be ready
for the problem when it occurs.
Celanese happens to be a young company. Much
more important, it's a modern company.

Like everyone else who must meet the
expanding challenges of science and in-
dustry today, IBM banks heavily on
initiative. By initiative, we mean the de-
sire to forge ahead. We believe this kind
of initiative benefits not only a corpora-
tion and its customers, but the individ-
ual as well.
For IBM, the exercise of initiative re-
sults in an expanding line of products
ranging from electric typewriters to
complete computer systems. It is evi-
dent, too, in the advanced systems for
space programs and national defense
which IBM also produces.
For our customers, it brings new
methods, new efficiencies, and new di-
rections for expansion in step with the
growing economy of our nation.
For the individual, encouragement of
initiative means the fullest possible
growth of personal talent, ability, and
stature. In the course of building their
professional careers, IBM's engineers
and scientists are given all the respon-
sibility they are ready for. In fact, IBM
encourages each individual to tackle
progressively tougher problems by pro-
viding the stimulating associates, pro-
fessional atmosphere, and educational
opportunities that form a sound basis
for career growth. There are no barriers
to individual achievement at IBM.
For example, the story of Oliver W.
Johnson, the young engineer pictured
here, demonstrates how an individual
can apply his full range of talents and
interests at IBM to further his profes-
sional career. Since he first joined IBM,
he has been assigned to several differ-
ent project areas, including: special

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC



transistor circuits, cryogenic develop-
ment, experimental studies on voice
output from computers. He is now be-
ing recognized for his success in devel-
oping a new method of compressing
speech by which time might be saved in
voice transmission of data.
His colleagues in development, re-
search, and manufacturing are making
the same kind of individual progress,
for at IBM the accent is on initiative-
no matter what type of work, or what
field of interests. Broad education pro-
grams, among the finest to be found in
industry, enable each individual to study
in his field of specialization or range be-
yond it as he desires. These educational
programs are designed for the individ-
ual's personal satisfaction as well as
professional advancement.
IBM offers graduates with degrees in
Engineering, Mathematics, and the Sci-
ences exciting assignments with room
to move ahead. IBM is an Equal Oppor-
tunity Employer.
Education programs are conducted
along the following lines: initial training;
continuous education to stimulate de-
velopment and help prepare for ad-
vancement; master's and doctoral study
with company support.
See your college placement officer to
determine when we will be interviewing
on campus. We will be glad to discuss
typical openings and opportunities at
IBM. If you prefer, you may write, out-
lining your education and interests, to:

EDUCATION
AND
RESEARCH
by Karl Legatski
r
THE INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND
TECHNOLOGY
The University of Michigan's Insti-
tute of Science and Technology is a
highly diversified organization that
promotes research all over the world.
This year, projects are being conduc-
ted in fields all the way from proteins
to earthquakes.
Astronomical Observatory
The 1ST is preparing to build and
operate a $5 million "space age" astro-
nomical observatory on 10,000-ft. Mt.
Haleakala in Hawaii to study the
Mights of ballistic missies and orbit-
ing satellites, and to provide astron-
omers with a new range of research
tools to explore the heavens.
Dr. James T. Wilson, Acting Di-
rector of 1ST, announced that the
University has been awarded a three-
year contract by the Advanced Re-
search Projects Agency (ARPA) of
the Department of Defense to con-
struct, maintain, and operate the ob-
servatory on the Island of Maui, on a
site provided bv the University of
Hawaii.
"The station will be the first in the
world to make extensive use of in-
frared sensing, measuring, and record-
ing devices to track midcourse missiles
and satellites," Wilson said. "It will
also be the first astronomical observa-
tory to conduct full-scale astrophysical
and geophysical studies in the infra-
red portion of the electromagnetic
spectrum."
Infrared devices permit detection
and identification of objects by non-
visible properties. The earth and most
things on it radiates large amounts
of energy at infrared frequencies, as
do many bodies in space. This radi-
ation is invisible to the human eye,
but can be readily detected and mea-
sured by special instruments.
"The observatory will carry out a
fundamental infrared research pro-
gram comparable with others current-
ly attempting to solve problems in
radio and radar astronomy," Wilson
explained. "The optical equipment
will include one 60-inch reflector tele-
scope and two 48-inch reflector tele-
scopes, which in themselves will rep-
resent a significant increase in the as-
tronomical capabilities of the United
States."
Other unique features, he said, will
include (1) the ability to furnish ob-
servers with accurate and comprehen-
sive on-the-spot information about
the position, behavior, and identity of
missiles and satellites as they are be-
ing tracked; and (2) the ability to
direct all equipment—including the

Wilson said the University was
chosen "because of demonstrated cap-
abilities in the area of infrared re-
search and technology, because of a
number of ballistic missile defense
studies conducted by the Infrared
Laboratory of 1ST, and because of
the University's well-recognized de-
partment of astronomy."
The University has been a recog-
nized leader in the field of infrared
physics for more than 30 years. The
department of physics, under Prof.
Harrison M. Randall, its chairman
from 1917 until 1940, established an
international reputation through its
extensive theoretical investigations of
molecular structures on the basis of
their infrared spectra.

Laboratory today is the Infrared In-

national clearing house for research
information on infrared phenomena.
"The new observatory will enable
University students and scientists to
engage in studies which are funda-
mental to our understanding of the
universe and the solar system, while
at the same time providing useful

Wilson continued.
Manager of the project is Dr. Rob-
ert L. Boggess of the 1ST Infrared
Laboratory, which will carry on the
largest share of the work in coopera-
tion with the U-M department of
astronomy. Other 1ST facilities in-
volved will include the Computation
and Radar Laboratories.
IST's Infrared Laboratory operates
two national research and informa-
tion exchange centers whose work
was important to the new project.
The Infrared Information and Analy-
sis Group (IR1A) collects, evaluates,
and issues information about infrared
science and technology. The Ballistic
Missile Radiation Analysis Center
(BAMIRAC), operated under ARPA
sponsorship, is a similar clearing
house for information on ballistic
missile phenomenology. Both centers
also conduct research programs.
The choice of the site on Kole
Kole peak of Mt. Haleakala, just out-
side Hawaii National Park, was de-
termined ideal because it is near
routes followed by many test missiles,
in a good latitude for observing most
satellites, and at a high altitude where
stable climatic conditions make ob-
serving conditions predominantly
good and often exceptionally good.
Mt. Haleakala is the highest non-
active volcano in Hawaii, with three
peaks above 10,000 feet. Roads and
power lines already go to the top
near the selected site.
Seismology
Seismologists of the 1ST have col-
lected data which they believe may
help to solve the problem of whether
underground nuclear explosions can
be distinguished from earthquakes.
A new data analysis method devel-
oped at the 1ST Acoustics and Seis-
mics Laboratory shows that there are
frequently recognizable differences be-
tween the seismic waves generated by
earthquakes and those underground
nuclear blasts which have been re-
corded from the Nevada Test Site.
Studies conducted by the laboratory's
research teams, which include record-
ings from hundreds of earthquakes
and 26 underground nuclear shots,
indicate that the method will produce

It takes an average of 7 horsepower to air condition an automobile. You'd think the complexities of
keeping an astronaut cool and comfortable would require at least as much power. But Garrett-AiResearch
designed and built a system that requires about the same energy as a 60-watt light bulb. And
that's important in space, where power is at a premium. □ The Garrett system takes advantage of the
low boiling point of water in space to absorb heat from the astronaut's space suit and spacecraft. The system
is tiny, lightweight, and works in zero gravity. □ This remarkable cooling unit is part of the entire

EARTHQUAKE'S SIGNATURE—This graph drawn from data collected by Uni-
versity of Michigan seismologists dramatically shows how one spot on the earth's
surface moved during a quake. It represents about a second's time and a shifting
of approximately one-millionth of an inch, a tremor no human being could detect.
between the two types of seismic
events if recording equipment is lo-
cated within a distance of (i00 miles
from the source. Within the 600-mile
distance measurements could be ob-
tained on about half of all recorded
seismic disturbances to determine
whether they were of natural origin
or man-made.
Earthquake data was obtained in
the United States, Chile, Puerto Rico,
Hawaii, Samoan Islands, Pakistan,
and Greece. The scientists have also
recorded several hundred chemical
explosions fired in the air, under-
water, and underground.
Nuclear data were collected from
shots fired in the United States only,
and there is as yet no certainty that
the same results could be obtained in
other areas with different geological
conditions.
The work carried on by 1ST is part
of the VELA UNIFORM project of
the Advanced Research Projects
Agency Department of Defense. It is
sponsored by two research facilities
of the Air Force Office of Aero-space
Research: the Office of Scientific Re-
search, and the Cambridge Research
Laboratories.
Proteins
Of the three key compounds in all
living things—proteins, carbohydrates
and fats—proteins are perhaps the
most essential to animal life. The
unique flexible strength of these
molecules permitted animals to evolve
with the ability to move about, and
diseases, essentially, are simply dam-
aged proteins.
Like most things in the realm of
science, the basic parts of proteins
are comparatively few and simple.
The big protein molecules consist
primarily of just 20 different kinds
of amino acids. Yet proteins are
incredibly complex in structure, in
how these amino acids combine to
form materials of which cells are
built. Complex as they are, however,
biologists, physicists and chemists,
working together, have been able to
unravel the sequence of amino acid
components of a handful of the
thousands of proteins found in ani-
mals.
One of the groups doing funda-
mental work on the protein puzzle
is The University of Michigan's Bio-
physics Research Division, part of
the U-M's Institute of Science and
Technology.
It is directed by Dr. J. Lawrence
Oncley, former professor of biolog-
ical chemistry at Harvard University,
who came to Michigan last Septem-
ber to lead the reorganization of the
U-M's biophysics program.
So far, biophyicists and biochemists
have been able to determine the
amino acid sequence in such proteins
as the enzymes insulin and ribonu-
cleases (enzymes are molecules which
spur cellular chemical reactions).
They have learned the complete
three-dimensional structure of myo-
globin, which stores oxygen in mus-
cles, and of hemoglobin, which car-
ries oxygen around in the body.
Dr. Oncley and his group are try-
ing to fit other pieces into the puzzle
of protein structure and how struc-
ture determines protein function.
They want to learn how a protein is
changed if an active amino acid group
within a protein molecule is changed,
and they are investigating the
strength of the chemical forces that
hold the groups together.
"If you really understood the struc-
ture of proteins," Dr. Oncley ex-
plains, "and why they function as
they do, you would be a long way
toward understanding their behavior
in diseases, when they aren't function-
ing in proper fashion. If you know
this, you would really be getting at
the fundamentals of how the body
works."
To find out what they want to
know, the Michigan biophysicists
must take the complex protein struc-
tures apart. This complicates the
problem because proteins are so easi-
ly denatured or irreversibly changed
in form. Give them too much heat,
too much acid or water, and they're
denatured—just as egg white is when
warmed or cooked.
With some proteins, notably myo-
globin, complicated mathematical in-
terpretation of how x-rays are de-
flected by crystals of the protein has
revealed their structure. Unfortun-
ately, however, only a few proteins
have been crystallized, and x-ray dif-
fraction works only on crystals.
Nevertheless, this method has been
used by two members of the U-M
physics faculty, Prof. Samuel Krimni
and Assist. Prof. Charles R. Worth-
ington, on proteins found in skin and
muscle. As a result of this, Dr. Krimni
has recently published a study of the
structure of feather keratin, a pro-
tein akin to those found in the skin
and nails of mammals.
Currently, the main effort of Dr.
Oncley's group involves other pro-
teins. They are working primarily on
human serum albumin, a blood pro-

Develop a new surgical tool
to freeze tissue, save lives

You work on projects that benefit
mankind when you're with Union
Carbide's Linde Division. Con-
siderthis new cryogenic surgical equip-
ment, for example. It's used by major
hospitals in the United States, Canada,
and Europe for treating the symptoms
of Parkinsonism and other involuntary
movement disorders.
Back in 1961, a new surgical tech-
nique, using extremely cold tempera-
tures, was announced to the medical
profession.
In brief, this surgical procedure in-
volves making a small burr hole in the
patient's skull; directing the probe into
the thalamic target; and using liquid ni-
trogen to freeze the appropriate tissue.
Because of its extensive experience
and capabilities in cryogenic systems,
Linde Division was called upon to de-
velop and produce the needed cryosur-
gery device—a precision surgical probe
and a complete system capable of fur-
nishing controlled cold to the probe.
The result is the CE-2 Cryosurgery
Equipment, a fully automatic unit that
is easy to operate and maintains pre-
selected temperatures reliably.
The CE-2-permits using the ultra-
low temperature of liquid nitrogen
(—320° F.) as a surgical tool with pre-
cision and safety in a practical operat-
ing range of 98° to —240° F.
Work with Linde and you work with
heat, cold, pressure, vacuum. You have
a choice among programs in cryogen-

tein which helps maintain serum

and on lipo-proteins. Lipoproteins
are combinations of lipids (fatty sub-
stances that arc a main source of en-
ergy in cells) and proteins. While they
consist of a diverse group that make
up around 10 per cent of the proteins
in the human body, the function of
the lipo-proteins isn't clearly known.
These do carry lipids around in the
body but they seem to be more im-
portant than just being a transport
mechanism. One clue to their poten-
tial significance is that "important
age and sex differences are found in
the distribution of these lipo-pro-
teins."
Jn addition, lipo-proteins are some-
how linked with chloresterol, the sub-
stance associated with atherosclerosis,
a condition underlying high blood
pressure. But Dr. Oncley emphasizes
that "we have steered away from look-
ing at these (lipo-proteins) in disease.

PREVIEW OF McHIGAN:
A number of showgirls were enter-
taining the troops at a remote Army
camp. They had been at it all after-
noon and were not only tired but
very hungry. Finally at the close of
their performance the major asked,
"Would you girls like to mess with
the enlisted men or the officers this
evening?"
"It really doesn't make and differ-
ence," spoke up a shapely blond.
"But we've just got to have some-
thing to eat first."
Faculty advisor: "Let's not have
any more jokes about sex, drinking,
and profanity."

putting out this magazine anyhow."
dying the strength of bonds between
some of the sub-units of protein mole-
cules. In some instances, they use for
this study a solution of weak acid
(one-hundredth normal strength),
which would denature most proteins.
However, by adding this to a prepar-
ation of insulin, they obtain a solu-
tion of molecules with electrical
charges. By noting the electrical re-
pulsion the acid ions bring about be-
tween the various molecules of insulin
the researchers can get an idea of the
attractive—or binding—forces of this
molecule.
Still another approach is through
titration, in which a solution of pre-
cisely-determined acidity or alkalinity
is added, micro-drop by micro-drop,
to a solution of specific protein mole-
cules. By determining precisely when
the solution becomes neutral, the
strength of binding of each of the
groups in the solution is revealed.
This approach has been used on
insulin,, serum albumin and trans-
ferin, a protein which carries iron in
the blood. Since these may involve
25 different parts or more in the
titrated solutions, each part being
affected as another reacts, it takes
considerable time on the U-M's big
IBM 1090 computer to work out the
forces for each part.
The work of this group will do
more than answer questions about
proteins, Dr. Oncley believes. With
other lines of biophysics here, it will
help boost the University's Ph.D. pro-
gram in this field, of which he is
chairman.
"It is hoped to make this program
in the graduate school a more active
one," Dr. Oncley says, "since there is
now a great demand for research
workers trained in biophysics, to at-
tack the problems of the biological
sciences."

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Picture of a man in love!
Young engineers seldom fall in love with corporations.
But they do fall in love with their own work—when they're
given the opportunity to put their own best ideas into
action.
We are seeing these young men in increasing numbers at
International Harvester . . . men of many talents who
come to us because of our unique and growing variety of
independent engineering assignments.
Mechanical, industrial, agricultural, chemical, ceramic,
metallurgical, general and civil engineers . . . mathemati-
cians, computer technologists, program analysts ... these
are the types of graduates we need now for work in the
design, development, engineering and testing of more
than a thousand different products in nine separate engi-
neering and research centers.
International Harvester serves three basic industries:
transportation, construction and agriculture. World-wide,
the Company is the largest producer of heavy-duty trucks
as well as farm equipment. International Harvester is a
leader in construction and earthmoving equipment,
a major steel producer and, through its Solar facility, a
pioneer in gas turbine development.
With an eye to still further progress, we have doubled our
research and engineering expenditures in the past ten
years—and they are still growing!

K. M. Nelson, Manager—
Industrial Control Sales, discusses the functioning of
Cutler-Hammer's automation teams, and how
creative graduates contribute to pioneering developments.
For over sixty years Cutler-
Hammer has been a key con-
tributor in planning automatic
systems—now called automation.
To meet the pressing challenge of
rapidly expanding industrial auto-
mation, we have formed a number of
automation project teams. These
teams combine the technical and
manufacturing talents of versatile,
seasoned specialists and young, crea-
tive-minded engineering and business
administration graduates.
Their primary job: to make sure that
a customer's automation investment
pays an adequate return.
How do they meet this challenge?
By working with customer engineers
and consultants to isolate cost prob-
lems in manufacturing and ware-
housing operations. Then, by apply-
ing their individual disciplines and
creative ingenuity to build common-

too, on a Cutler-Hammer automation team
sense automation proposals that can
be justified economically.
Automation teams work together in
a modern 500,000 square foot plant
specifically designed to house every
activity involved in the evolution of
a system ... in a creative climate
that is conducive to imaginative
planning and development.
This approach has paid off! Though
industry has barely scratched the sur-
face of the automation potential, our
credentials already are quite impres-
sive. Jobs such as the U.S. Post Office
mail handling systems in 14 major
cities; a pallet handling system for a
mail-order firm; data accumulation
systems for large steel producers; a
number of automobile body-line
systems; bundle-handling systems for
30 major newspaper mail rooms; and
a package-handling system for a
prominent publisher are just a few
examples of our automation planning
skill at work.
What are the advantages to the
young, creative-minded graduate?
Short range, it's an exceptional op-
portunity for the man who responds
to the challenge of finding new solu-
tions to tough manufacturing prob-
lems. Long range, being a key
member of a Cutler-Hammer auto-
mation team is an excellent way to

essential to steady career develop-
ment and future advancement.

One night a salesman was traveling
on a deserted stretch of road. He was
shocked to see a beautiful girl walk-
ing alone down the road. Being a
gentleman, he stopped to offer her a
ride. She accepted his offer. When the
salesman asked for her name, she re-
plied, "I'm a witch!"
The salesman didn't know what to
make of this. About fifteen minutes
later he again tried to converse with
the girl. She answered his attempt by
asserting that she was a witch.
The perplexed salesman decided
that he had put up with enough non-
sense. Angrily, he shouted, "If you're
a witch, prove it!"
The girl then slid over next to him
on the car seat and whispered the
magic words into his ear.
And sure enough, he turned into a
motel.
"I've just got a bottle of gin for
my wife."
"Well, that seems like a reasonable
swap."

THE COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING

Pauline M. Sherman, Wind Tunnel Supervisor, inspects the Supersonic
Wind Tunnel here at Michigan.
On every hand, the skill and handiwork of the engineer make their imprint on the observer's eye and ear. Each year new words
spring into use because his ingenuity has added values to human kind.
Some of these values make it easier to talk or visit with one's neighbor; some reduce the load on man's muscles and give him
more leisure to enjoy the aesthetic ambrosio of the setting sun; some values simply make living more comfortable or more healthful;
yet others release man from the slavery of spending all his time to provide the necessities that merely sustain life—they give him
time to explore the unknowns that envelope his every glance and step.
In selecting the profession of engineering as your career, you accept a very real responsibility for the well-being of your fellow
man. This is not an easy path to choose but is one filled with thrilling satisfactions. The horizons are unlimited for the student who
has the qualifications and the will to succeed. Whether in space science or in the building of highways and bridges; whether you
design automatic guidance systems that defend the American way of life or make group living more healthful with better sewage
disposal systems; whether you find your place in the application of lasers to an optical communication system or in the development
of a more efficient deep-freeze for the ever lovable housewife—you will use your talents and knowledge to provide useful things
and services.
The prospects are that capable young men and women will find excellent opportunities in the various field of engineering. A
great need exists for engineers with education at advanced levels—with attractive compensations for the effort expended to achieve
at a high level, and for the extra years in graduate study.
The College of Engineering provides opportunities for a variety of interests and capabilities, for preparation in a variety of
fields, and to continue studies in engineering to the completion of a Ph.D.

WHO'S FOR A CARPETED OFFICE?
A man's first tank car is seldom a piece of gravy
train. If it were easy, he wouldn't have been needed.
Goodbye, 5-liter-flask days. In the majors, this is
how they keep score. The kind of chemical engineer
who is fool enough to choke up with sentiment at
this bittersweet image may look down one day and
note that there is thick carpet on his office floor and
that other men take pains to shine their shoes well
before standing on it.
We also need chemical engineers who get their
kicks from very beautiful chains of analytical thought
wherein differential equations, solved on our analog
and digital computers and pneumatic simulators,
link the flows of heat, liquids, solids, gases, chemical
bonding energy, and money. These chaps may also
wind up with the same carpet in their offices, along
with the intellectual satisfaction of having figured
out how to make the carpet fiber more attractive,
longer-lasting, and cheaper than anybody else's
carpet fiber.
We need all kinds. We need conservatives who
make their mark by steady progress in one of our
chemical engineering specialties, such as laying down
a dozen or so layers of various materials atop one
another with enormous precision for endless miles
of color film. We need imaginative ones who will
thrive in the intricately diversified atmospheres of
our non-photographic plants by showing us how the
solution to one problem solves several entirely dif-
ferent ones, too.
Whatever kind you like to think you are, whether
chemical engineer or other technical graduate, one
principle seems obvious to us: if you come with us,
we must do everything in our power to develop the
very best that lies within you.

An Interview
with G.E.'s
F. K. McCune,
Vice President,
Engineering

At Vice President—Engineering,
Francis K. McCune is charged with
ensuring the effective develop-
ment, use and direction of General
Electric's engineering talent. Mr.
McCune holds a degree in elec-
trical engineering and began his
career with the Company as a
student engineer.
For complete information on
opportunities for engineers
at General Electric, write
to: Personalized Career
Planning, General Electric
Company, Section 699-07,
Schenectady 5, N. Y.
How Industry Tempers
Theory with Practice
to Get Good Design
Q. Mr. McCune, how do you define engineering design?
A. First let's look at what engineering really is. The National Society of Profes-
sional Engineers calls it "the creation of technical things and services useful to
man." I would paraphrase that to add an industry emphasis: engineering is linking
an ability to do with specific customer needs and wants. The link is an engineering
design of a useful product or service.
Q. In the light of this definition, how can the young engineer prepare himself
for industry?
A. In college he should absorb as much theory as possible and begin to develop
certain altitudes that will help him later in his profession. The raw material for a
design, information, flows from three general funds: Scientific Knowledge of
Nature; Engineering Technology; and what I call simply Other Relevant Informa-
tion. Academic training places heavy emphasis on the first two areas, as it should.
Engineers in industry draw heavily on theorems, codified information, and signifi-
cant recorded experience basic to engineering disciplines taught in college. The
undergraduate must become knowledgeable in these areas and skilled in the ways of
using this information, because he will have little time to learn this after graduation.
He also must develop a responsive attitude toward the third fund.
Q. As you say, we learn theory in college, but where do we get the "Other
Relevant Information"—the third fund you mentioned?
A. This knowledge is obtained for the most part by actually doing engineering
work. This is information that must be applied to a design to make sure that it not
only works, but that it also meets the needs and wants that prompted its considera-
tion in the first place. For example, we can design refrigerators, turbines, computers,
or missile guidance systems using only information from the first two funds of
knowledge—heat flow, vibration, electronic theory, etc.—and they will work! But
what about cost, reliability, appearance, size—will the prospective customer buy
them? The answers to these important design questions are to be found in the third
fund; for example the information to determine optimum temperature ranges, to
provide the features that appeal to users, or to select the best manufacturing
processes. In college you can precondition yourself to seek and accept this sort of
information, but only experience in industry can give you specific knowledge
applicable to a given product.
Q. Could you suggest other helpful attitudes we might develop?
A. Remember, industry exists to serve the needs and wants of the market place,
and the reasons for doing things a certain way arise from the whole spread of condi-
tions which a given design has to satisfy. Learn how to enter into good working
relalionships with people. Much of the Other Relevant Information can be picked
up only from others. Also train yourself to be alert and open-minded about your
professional interests. In industry you'll be expected to learn quickly, keep abreast
in vour field, and to grow from assignment to assignment. Industry will give you the
opportunity. Your inherent abilities and attitudes will largely decide your progress.

Hew the Gemini Spacecraft will find its target...
Suppose you had to capture alive one little hummingbird
flying a known course high over the Amazon jungle.
Difficult? Sure, but no more so than the job assigned to a new
radar system YVcstinghouse is building for the
NASA-Gemini space program.
The bird is an Agcna rocket, orbiting the earth at 17,500 miles
per hour. The hunter, in an intersecting orbit, is the
Gemini two-man spacecraft being built by McDonnell Aircraft.
And so the hunt begins. The spacecraft radar finds
the target and starts an electronic question-and-answer game.
A computer keeps score, giving the astronauts continuous
readings on angles and approach speeds until the vehicles are
joined. The hummingbird is caught.
The Gemini experiments will be a prelude to the first
moon trip. And Wcstinghouse is already working on advanced
radar systems for lunar landings and deep space missions.
You can be sure ... if it's Wcstinghouse.

Must you join a giant company to work on exciting projects?
Take the Advanced Test Reactor—the world's most
powerful. Several giant companies are working on
this multi-million dollar project. But Babcock &amp; Wilcox
handled the most exciting part—its nuclear design.
B&amp;W is large enough to win contracts jor big proj-
ects. 1962 sales, for example, were $330 million. And
every year, B&amp;W invests millions of dollars in research
and development. B&amp;W offers many other large com-
pany advantages: training program, paid tuitions, and
a wide variety of job openings (17 facilities in 10 states).
B&amp;W is small enough to give you a chance to work
on exciting big projects early in your career. Growth
opportunities are enormous. Yet only 61 bachelor-level
students will be hired from the campus this year.
B&amp;W offers interesting careers, especially for M.E.,
E.E., Ch.E., Met.E., Cer.E., C.E., Nuc.E, and physicists.

Meet the ambassadors
Around the world, Union Carbide is making friends for America. Its 50 affiliated companies abroad serve
growing markets in some 135 countries, and employ about 30,000 local people. ► Many expressions of
friendship have come from the countries in which Union Carbide is active. One of the most appealing is this
collection of dolls. They were sent here by Union Carbide employees for a Christmas display, and show some
of the folklore, customs, and crafts of the lands they represent. "We hope you like our contingent," said a
letter with one group, "for they come as ambassadors from our country." ► To Union Carbide, they also
signify a thriving partnership based on science and technology, an exchange of knowledge and
skills, and the vital raw materials that are turned into things that the whole world needs.

Freedom &amp; Discipline
Modern physics has identified 34 elementary
particles of matter—each with its twin anti-parti-
cle. The inevitable two opposing forces that keep
the universe in balance.
We think at the heart of most well-run modern
companies there are also two opposing and equally
important forces—freedom and discipline.
Freedom to innovate, to change, develop and
invent. Plus the discipline to stick to the facts, to
stick to the problem, to stay within the budget.
At Celanese we try to combine freedom and dis-
cipline to better serve our customers, our share-
holders, and our employees.
Perhaps we are the company at which you can
best pursue your career. If you are trained in
chemical engineering, electrical engineering, me-
chanical engineering, chemistry or physics, we
hope you will stop in to see our representative
when he visits your campus. Or write directly to
us, briefly outlining your background.

BEGINNING
STEP
by Stephen S. Attwood, Dean
College of Engineering
University of Michigan

While the semester is well under way, I would still like to make a few com-
ments to our Michigan engineers, in particular to those of you who are freshmen
and transfer students.
Some of you undoubtedly came to this campus with very hazy notions of
what you are here to accomplish and just how you will do it. The many decisions
which have been required of you have been hard to make, and they have not
stopped coming. No longer are parents and other close associates of high school
days available for advice. This means that even though the Unversity has assumed
a counseling role, it remains for you to use your initiative to discover the oppor-
tunities available to you while enrolled in our College.
These opportunities may be found both in and out of the classroom. This
University offers you one of the most complete scopes of course selections any-
where, both in engineering and non-engineering desciplines. It is up to you to
review this list and choose from it those areas which will be of greatest benefit to
you in accomplishing the goals which 1 hope you have set for yourself.
Apart from academics, you will find a complete range of extracurricular
activities from which you may carefully choose and which can broaden your
overall education and make your years here at Michigan even more rewarding.
Campus activities and organizations are facsimiles of those in which you will
have opportunities to participate after graduation. With careful budgeting of
your time, you should not have to exclude yourself from these valuable experi-
ences.
There undoubtedly will be periods of indecision and soul-searching during
your years here. Learning to make decisions is an important part of the educa-
tional process that will help you throughout your professional career. But, as
you probably know by now, to learn and to make decisions, one must ask ques-
tions to which the answers rest on "facts." We have plenty of "facts" for you here
at Michigan, but you must take the initiative, the beginning step, in the search.

THE DISARMAMENT PROBLEM
The pact formed several months ago which has placed
restrictions on the testing of nuclear weapons has served to
raise the hopes of many people that eventually a total dis-
armament agreement will be signed by the nations of the
world. Such an agreement would eliminate the possibility of
nuclear war by eliminating nuclear weapons entirely, and
would allow the inhabitants of the world to live in peace with-
out the ever-present fear of nuclear destruction. However, a
more thorough exploration of the consequences of nuclear
disarmament brings to light some very disturbing problems
with which the government may someday be forced to cope.
To be more specific, at present the federal government is
spending large sums of money to develop and produce devices
of nuclear destruction, and thousands of people are employed
as a direct result of this war preparation effort. In fact, roughly
10-15 percent of our national income is spent annually for
national defense. If the government were to substantially re-
duce the amount of money spent for defense, as it might if
such an agreement was reached, what would happen to the
economy? And what would happen to all the people employed
as a result of the defense program?
To answer the first question, the amount of money in cir-
culation would be reduced by about five times the amount
for defense; this fact can be accounted for by the multiplier
effect. The national income would be noticeably reduced.
People would have less money to spend, and the propensity
of consume would diminish; consequently by the law of sup-
ply and demand, a serious deflation would result.
To answer the second question, thousands of people would
be out of work, at least temporarily. They would be earning
little or nothing, and would serve to further aggravate the de-
flated condition of the economy. If unchecked then, the coun-
try would soon find itself in a depression with the economy
visciously spiraling downward towards collapse.
So much for hypothetical examples and naive questions!
Actually if disarmament were agreed upon, the government
would be forced to spend its defense appropriations in other
sectors of the economy to prevent the result I just described.
Therefore, deflation would not result because the same
amount of money would be circulating, and unemployment
could be prevented by planning ahead for a production switch-
over from weapons to consumer or capital goods. However,
this is where another rub comes in—where should the money
be spent?
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


the government to start making the country a better place in
which to live. Money could be spent on slum clearance,
schools, and hospitals. Money could be spent to aid in the
exploration of unknowns such as space and man's afflictions,
both mental and physical, fust let your imagination go wild;
think of all of the wonderful things that could be done with
this defense spending.
Now snap back to reality! For in a society such as ours,
governed by a form of government such as ours, this type of
spending is regarded as socialistic . . . and we do not intend
to let "creeping socialism" destroy the way of life that our an-
cestors died for, do we? But we don't want to be a depressed
democracy either! So what is the answer?
Well, since the money will be appropriated by Congress,
perhaps the leaders and representatives of the land could
manage to deceive the public by fattening the "Pork Barrel."
However, the enormous size which this "animal" would as-
sume is beyond the scope of my imagination, so with tongue
in cheek, I shall just leave this answer as a suggestion (to
whom it may concern!)
My other answers to help solve this problem are slightly
more serious, and although I have already presented and la-
beled them as "creeping socialism," I should like to restate
them in question form for the reader to cogitate.
Since the country is crying for more and better engineers,
why not aid the universities throughout the land, so that they
can pay engineering professors salaries commensurate with
their abilities, so that more able and talented men can be at-
tracted into the engineering teaching profession, and so that
better and modern facilities can be erected to instruct students
in engineering?
Many sections of our nation are badly in need of repair
which cannot be financed at the state or local levels. Why
should the government be discouraged from giving funds to
restore these areas to enhance the beauty of the land and liv-
ing conditions of its inhabitants?
The government should take stock of itself too; much
graft and corruption can be traced to our public servants. Why
should the government not select higher caliber employees by
offering better pay?
In conclusion, I have attempted to present a problem
which I feel is of real significance and not a figment of my
imagination; the results and solutions which one can imagine
for it are endless and optimistic as well as pessimistic. In the
event that this problem does become a reality, then our gen-
eration may be faced with its solution and, who knows, we
may be "architects of the future."

Challenge to
Ed Whittaker
■ Edward G. Whittaker, III received his BS
Degree in Engineering Physics from Colorado
University in January of 1963. Shortly there-
after he joined the Research and Advanced De-
velopment Group at Delco as a Physicist.
As Ed puts it, "Believe me, it's a real chal-
lenge for a guy fresh out of college to see an
idea through from the development stage to the
finished product. Here at Delco in my work on
materials for new semiconductor devices the
creative experiences are endless—and the at-
mosphere seems to encourage your best efforts."
As a college graduate, you too may find excit-
ing and challenging opportunities in such pro-
grams as the development of germanium and
silicon devices, ferrites, solid state diffusion,
creative packaging of semiconductor products,
development of laboratory equipment, relia-
bility techniques, and applications and manu-
facturing engineering.
If your interests and qualifications he in any
of these areas, you're invited to write for our
brochure detailing the opportunities to share
in forging the future of electronics with this
outstanding Delco-GM team. Watch for Delco

interested in studies leading to a doctoral degree in engineering or
physics, you are invited to apply for one of the several new awards
in 1964 on the Howard Hughes Doctoral Fellowship Program.
This unique program offers the doctoral candidate the optimum
combination of high-level study at an outstanding university plus
practical industrial experience at the Hughes Aircraft Company.
Each Howard Hughes Doctoral Fellowship usually provides about
$9,000 annually. Of this amount approximately $1,800 is for tuition,
thesis and research expenses, other academic fees and books, and
from $2,000 to $3,300 is for a stipend. The remainder is composed
of salary earned by the fellow.
Howard Hughes Doctoral Fellowships are open to outstanding stu-
dents. A master's degree, or equivalent graduate work, is essential
before beginning the Fellowship Program.
HUGHES MASTERS FELLOWSHIPS. The Hughes Masters
Fellowship Program offers unusual opportunities for education lead-
ing to a master's degree... and, in addition, provides each fellow
with practical industrial experience at the Hughes Aircraft Company.
New awards will be made in 1964 to qualified applicants possessing
a baccalaureate degree in engineering, physics or mathematics.
The great majority of the award winners will be assigned to the
WORK-STUDY PROGRAM and will attend a university sufficiently
near a facility of the Hughes Aircraft Company to permit them to
obtain practical industrial experience by working at the company
at least half time. Those associated with a Southern California
facility usually attend the University of Southern California or the
University of California, Los Angeles. An appropriate stipend will
be awarded in addition to salary earned and certain academic
expenses paid by the company.
A small, highly selected group will be offered FULL-STUDY Fellow-
ships. These fellowships permit attendance at an outstanding uni-
versity on a full-time basis during the regular academic year with
a substantial stipend.
After completion of the Masters Program, fellows are eligible to
apply for a HUGHES DOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP.
For both programs, typical areas of research and development to
which fellows may be assigned while working for Hughes full time
during the summer, and where appropriate, part time during the
academic year, include: theoretical and experimental work in some
basic technology such as atomic, nuclear and solid-state physics,
chemistry and metallurgy—space technology including stability and
trajectory analysis, thermal analysis, energy conversion, and struc-
tural design and analysis—computer and reliability technology,
circuit and information theory, plasma electronics, microminiaturi-
zation, and human factor analysis — research, development and
product-design on such devices as parametric amplifiers, masers,
lasers, microwave tubes, antenna arrays, electron-tube and solid-
state displays, and components —design analysis, integration and
testing of space and airborne missile and vehicle systems, infrared
search and track systems, radar systems, communication systems,
antisubmarine warfare systems, and computer and data process-
ing systems.
The classified nature of work at Hughes makes American citizen-
ship and eligibility for secret security clearance a requirement.
Closing date for all applications: February 1, 1964. (Early appli-
cation is advisable, and all supporting references and transcripts
should be postmarked not later than February 1, 1964.)
How to apply: To apply for either the Howard Hughes Doctoral
Fellowship or the Hughes Masters Fellowship, write Dr. C. N.

Starting in a single 1956
automotive engine, pearlitic
Malleable crankshafts are cur-
rently used in eight passenger car
engines and one truck engine. With
more than 3,800,000 now in serv-
ice, these pearlitic Malleable iron
castings have compiled an excel-
lent record for field reliability.

Trunion-type rear axle differential
carriers of Malleable have been
used since World War II without
any reported warranty claims. The
carrier, which is stressed during
assembly when steel tubes are
forced into the openings on either
side, continues to absorb tremen-
dous stresses throughout the life of
the car... with complete reliability.

7 years of serv-
ice with no record
of field failure is the
enviable achievement
of these pearlitic Malleable
slip yokes and U-joint flanges.
Continuously subjected to varying
speeds and reversing torques,
these parts amply demonstrate
Malleable's capability for dynamic
applications.

Each of the five major automobile com-
panies is represented by these examples.

Not one service failure has been
reported in the period now covered
by the warranty (two years) on
these pearlitic Malleable rocker
arms. Used since 1955, field prob-
lems are termed "insignificant" by
the automotive manufacturer.

Two of the twenty-seven different
Malleable castings warranted by
one automotive company are the
transmission band lever and the
transmission torque converter hub
shown here. Both have been used
in automotive transmissions with
no warranty claims turned in to
the company in five years.
The extended warranties now being given by
automobile manufacturers are not sales gim-
micks. They are based on exhaustive statistical
studies that conclusively demonstrate the reli-
ability of each component involved.
During a single model year, these two to five year
warranties will cover 90,000,000 individual Mal-
leable iron parts of 273 different designs. The
confidence which automotive companies have in
Malleable's quality is responsible for the use of
Malleable castings for more and more applications
on cars and trucks... and throughout industry.

OF
MUSIC
by Irving Salmeen
"Of all noises, I think music the least
disagreeable."
Samuel Johnson
Musical intellectuals make great
sport of tossing about musical adjec-
tives. Great, immortal, profound, are
often associated with the works of
Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn and Bach.
Noisy, trashy, "designed for idots"
sometimes describe the sounds of rock
'n roll. The so-called great composi-
tions are subjected to study in infinite
detail with attention being focused
on movements, themes, sub-themes,
harmony, and a collection of nebu-
lous musical adjectives such as largo,
adagio, and scherzo.
Those uninitiated to this seemingly
abstruse jargon are led to wonder:
what? why? They plead, "Can't I
simply enjoy music without this con-
fusion?" But those who want to "en-
joy" are in the same category as the
musical academicians; they just don't
realize it. Both seek pleasure in music,
but those who emphasize technical
details derive a different kind of
pleasure from those who just want to
"enjoy."
Music: good, bad, and great
What makes music good or bad?
I think that the answer is simple.
Music is good when it gives pleasure.
To classify rock'n roll, for example,
as bad is an error. This form is de-
signed to give a specific kind of pleas-
ure. Some rock 'n roll numbers pro-
vide this pleasure more effectively
than others. The eggheads who cate-
gorically say that one kind of music is
bad fail to consider the pleasures it is
supposed to give. Music means differ-
ent things to different people. Conse-
quently judgements will vary as the
criterion for pleasure varies.
What makes music great? Nearly
everyone will concede that rock 'n
roll is not destined for musical im-
mortality. But what differentiates a
Beethoven Symphony from a Moon
River? Some highbrows, peering down
from their ivory towers will say,
"Structure, my boy, structure." Oth-
ers might add, "It's the message that
counts." Nonsense! Music is great
when it gives the greatest number of
pleasures. I think that five pleasures
can be pointed out.
1. Rhythmatic pleasure
2. Emotional pleasure
3. The pleasure of order
4. Dramatic pleasure
5. Intellectual pleasure.
The first two of these, rhythmatic
and emotional pleasure are the most
fundamental. Dramatic pleasure and
the pleasure of order appeal to a
higher sense of enjoyment. These four
constitute so-called listening pleas-
ures. They are the appealing factors
NOVEMBER 1963
15


The fifth is a pleasure that is derived
independently of the act of listening.
Every musical form gives one or more
of these and the great works provide
all five.
Rhythm
What is rhythm? We all have an
intuitive feeling for rhythm. We listen
to a march and tap our foot in time
to the music. An engineer slaves over
a problem and unconsciously taps his
pencil on the table beating out an
ornate rhythmatic pattern. Many cere-
monies of primitive cultures feature
complex drum beats and other rhyth-
matic ornamentation, for example
the dances of African natives or Amer-
ican Indians. Everything around us
is rhythmatic: our heartbeat, the drip
drip of a leaky faucet, the chugging
of an internal combustion engine.
Rhythm is so innate that we don't
stop to think about it.
Technically, rhythm is the relative
time value given to each note of a se-
quence of sounds. Tap a table with
a pencil and wait two seconds, then
tap again three times in succession
with only half second intervals, wait
for one second and then tap again.
Each tap has a different time value
relative to the others. That's rhythm.
Now repeat this same sequence
several times, but emphasize the tap
at the beginning of the sequence.
The emphasies of a note is called
beat. This is what people mean when
they say, "I like music with a beat."
A network of beats is called meter.
For example, a waltz has a prominent
meter of: One, two three. One, two,
three. The totality of time factors is
often categorically called rhythm.
Without it a collection of sounds
gives little pleasure.
However, rhythm can give leasure
without regard to the notes that are
played. To illustrate this are the tours
of American jazz groups through var-
ious African countries and the Near
East. It seems unlikely that the large
audiences derived much pleasure
from the melodies or the improvisa-
tions. A safe guess would be that
these audiences respond to the melo-
dies of jazz much as the Westerner
responds to Oriental sounds. The sig-
nificant feature of these concerts is
the people clapping their hands in
time to the music.
Another illustration of rhymatic
pleasures of music is the popularity
of rock 'n roll. A typical melody is
usually very simple, but there is a
dominant rhythm. It is a simple pat-
tern well suited to a variety of dance
steps. And dancing is a means of par-
ticipating in the pleasure of rhythm.
Rhythm is also present in the so-
called classical compositions. Some
people say, "I don't like Beethoven
or any of those guys because they
don't have rhythm." Those people
haven't listened carefully. Just as a
few examples of rhythm in the class-
ics are the third movement of Beet-
hoven's Seventh Symphony which fea-
tures a strong, almost militant, driv-
ing rhythm; or the third movement
:&gt;f Khatchaturian's Concerto for Piano
and Orchestra, or the unnerving de-
velopment of Ravel's Bolero. In each
of these, rhythm is the dominant
musical pleasure.
There are musical forms where the
focus is not on rhythm. An example
of this is the impressionism of De-
bussy's La Mer or Ravel's Daphnis
and Chloe. This music is dreamy,
vague; almost like looking through a
frosted window. But, although the
emphasis is on sound, rhythm is there
as in the opening of La Mer which
makes you feel the gentle lap, lap of
the ocean on an expanse of lonely
beach on a foggy morning.
Emotional pleasure
This subject of impressionism
serves as a backdoor entrance to the
second pleasure of music which I call
emotional pleasure. Psychologists rec-
ognize that certain sounds in combi-
nation with the right rhythm can
arouse various emotions. Drumbeats
and trumpets can stir up anger; soft
flowing violins can be soothing; the
harp generates mystic, etheral sounds.
There are sounds of a full orchestra
that can create a sense of overwhelm-
ing beauty, and there are sounds that
are sad and lonely. These all appeal
to our emotions.
Probably the most obvious appeal
to emotion is beauty. We don't
know why a piece of music is
beautiful any more than we know
why a certain scene is beautiful. We
don't think about beauty—we feel it.
Typical examples of beauty in music
are the works of Tchaikovsky, Rach-
maninoff, and Dvorak. Not only is
the sound beautiful, but it generates
other emotions such as the sadness of
the last movement of Tchaikovsky's
Pathetique Symphony or the melan-
choly mood of the Largo of Dvorak's
New World Symphony.
Other emotions are aroused more
subtly. For example the effects of
impressionism. This is a highly per-
sonal form of music. It is a sound
picture of something as it appears to
the composer. La Mer sounds like the
sea. Perhaps the title is a psychologic-
al kicker that tells us what we ought
to hear. I have asked a number of
people who have never before heard
La Mer, and at the time of listening
didn't know its title, to tell me what
they felt. The answers included: a
deep forest; a big field with rolling
hills; the sea shore. The point is that
music can generate a feeling about
something; an impression. Since this
impression is a function of the indi-
vidual's temperament, I include it
under the heading of emotional en-
joyment.
Emotion and rhythm are two pleas-
ures that are closely linked. The sub-
tleties of music such as harmony and
melody, the different sounds of vari-
ous instruments together with rhythm
create emotional pleasures. We can, I
think, have rhythmatic pleasure with-
out emotional pleasure, but we can-
not have emotional pleasure without
rhythmatic pleasure. These are the
two fundamental pleasures of music
which appear more or less in every
musical form.
The higher pleasures
But there are higher forms of pleas-
ure which are evident only in the
so-called serious compositions. The
first of these is the pleasure of order.
Most of the serious musical composi-
tions are divided into sections with
each section being a complete unit.
For example, a symphony is usually
divided into four movements. The
tempo of a movement is used to iden-
tify it. Beethoven's Seventh Symphony
is divided into: 1. Poco sostenuto and
Vivace, 2. Allegretto, 3. Presto, 4.
Allegro con brio. These phrases iden-
tify the general character of a section.
We expect the first movement to
be initially restrained but gradu-
ally becoming vivance or lively.
Allegretto is a moderately fast tempo,
while presto is quite fast and allegro
con brio is brisk and brilliant. This
division permits the full development
of a musical idea and provides con-
tinuity between various extensions of
a basic idea similar to the way that
chapters of a book develop various
ideas which are related to the overall
theme of the book.
The epitome of musical order is
16
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Haydn who characterize the so-
called Classical Period. They sought
ideal form and unity, trying to state
their personal musical feelings with-
in a perfect structure. Unfortunately
no one was able to say what the ideal
structure should be. But of all com-
posers, they are the most predictable
and confine themselves to the form
they saw to be ideal.
Perhaps it is pushing the point to
say that this ordering gives pleasure.
But I think it is one of the reasons
the music of these composers is ap-
pealing. The human mind loves
order. It seems that the music with
the greatest order should appeal to
those whose appreciation for order is
strongest. In twentieth century terms
this includes the large community of
scientists and engineers.
An example of a different kind of
order is the music of J. S. Bach. We
might even call this a mathematical
pleasure. Think of a Bach fugue. We
listen to the statement of a figure
in the upper register of the organ.
The figure in itself is not particularly
interesting. The sounds are not beau-
tiful; they are only single notes each
with the same time value. But then
a new melody is stated in the lower
register, while the right hand plays a
variation on the first figure. Then an
extensive development of two themes
is begun such that each hand works
independently of the other. We have
two melodies to listen to at the same
time! Each variation is very precise
and we have to strain to separate the
two themes. In other of Bach's works
we find as many as three or four melo-
dies being developed at the same
time. The intense concentration re-
quired is almost like solving a puzzle.
This is a part of the pleasure of
order: we enjoy the puzzle and its
solution.
The last listening pleasure: drama
We come now to the last listening
pleasure: dramatic impact. As an
analogy consider the development of
a good mystery story. The action may
begin slowly then suddenly someone
is murdered. We don't know who-
dunit, but the killer lurks among the
heroes. Will he strike again? Suspense
builds up as events unfold. Then in
the final chapter the action is fast
and furious as the criminal is revealed
and the conflicts in the story are re-
solved.
The same thing happens in music.
An example, is the closing movement
of Dvorak's New Word Symphony.
The movement begins quietly, and
slowly gains momentum, but before it
can reach full force the pace slackens.
You feel let down; you want some-
thing to happen, but the music is
suppressed. Then it rises again
only to fall off. Suddenly it bursts
forth—full, rich, dynamic. You feel it
building up, reaching toward some
final climax. Tension is high, but
again the musical lapses into a dis-
turbed calm. There is a final state-
ment of the principal figures that
appeared earlier in the work. Once
again momentum is increased but
with greater speed than before. Now
everything is plunging toward final
resolution. This time it does not let
up and we finally reach a conclusion.
Another kind of dramatic pleasure
is found in the "story told in music."
An example of this is Don Quixote
by Richard Srauss. This is a musical
adaption of the famous novel by
Cervantes that tells of the knight Don
Quixote and his squire in their quest
of chivalry. The theme of Don is
first stated by a viola solo, which is
followed by the theme of Sancho Pan-
za, Don's squire, carried by the bass
clarinet and tenor tuba. Each adven-
ture is a variation of these two themes
that expresses the excitement, action,
and frustrations of their travels. It is
interesting to note how the orchestra
is used to achieve this end.
For example there is the episode
of "The Battle with the Sheep." First
we hear the muted brass in the or-
chestra imitate the bleating of the
sheep. Then the orchestra, overriding
the brass, depicts the slightly mad
Don Quixote as he charges into the
Hock spearing sheep left and right.
Later is "The Contest with the Two
Magicians." Don Quixote and Panza
encounter two Benedictian Monks
and a coach accompanied by four
horsemen and two grooms on foot.
Don Quixote thinks they are abduct-
ing some princess and he rides against
the monks who flee from Quixote.
Here unaccompanied bassons play the
chant of the monks and the orchestra
follows in a storm as Quixote at-
tacks.
Intellectual pleasure
So far the discussion has been cen-
tered about the different kinds of
pleasures that are derived from hear-
ing the music. But there is a special
kind of pleasure which music gives
independently of the act of listening.
This is intellectual pleasure: the
pleasure "that those guys get out of
spending time talking about structure
and motifs and all of that."
Probably the first question to be
answered is "You call that pleasure?"
If I'm a musician I can ask a similar
question of an engineer. "You call
that pleasure—playing with those
slide rules and silly graphs?" What
pleasure is there in solving mathe-
matical problems or crossword puz-
zles? My answer is that it is the pleas-
ure of satisfying the need to exercise
the intellect.
But what do you look for in music
and what's all this about motifs and
themes? All music is the development
of a theme. The intellectual pleasure
comes from first finding the theme
and then investigating the develop-
ment of it. How does a composer ex-
press his musical ideas as revealed in
his treatment of a theme? What em-
bellishments, tricks and devices are
used to convey the four listening
pleasures? These are the kinds of
questions asked by a person seeking
intellectual pleasure from music.
What about the message hidden in
the depths of a composition? Maybe
there is one; 1 don't know what it is,
but it is fun to speculate what a com-
poser might have had in mind. Ex-
cept in specific cases when the com-
poser has declared his intentions, we
will never know what the message is.
If there is one, it is probably different
for every listener.
Another kind of intellectual pleas-
ure is provided by experiments in
sound—the generation of new kinds
of music. Examples of such innovat-
ors are Bartok and Stravinsky and the
efforts of Schoenberg and others to
develop the twelve tone system. These
are experiments designed to develop
the untapped capabilities of the or-
chestra. Admittedly some of it sounds
strange, but to see the fallacy of ignor-
ing something we need only recall
that Beethoven was rejected by his
contemporaries as sounding strange.
Music has charms, we all may find,
Ingratiate deeply with the mind.
When art does sound's high power
advance,
To music's pipe the passions dance;
Motions unwill'd its powers have
shown,
Tarantulated by a tune.

sands of years, and has long been recog-
nized as a wonderful natural tranquilizer.
More recently, the effects of music on
man have been scientifically studied, and
music is nou&gt; finding it's place amongst
the many "wonder drugs."
"When the evil spirit from God
was upon Saul, then David took up
a harp and played with his hands so
that Saul was refreshed and well, and
the evil spirit departed from him."
Music therapy, certainly as old as
the days of the patriarchs, has, how-
ever, only recently been analyzed on
scientific grounds.
Music affects you both physiolog-
ically and emotionally. It is related to
your normal physical functioning as
a human being as well as to your
moods and feelings.
When you hear the "Star Spangled
Banner," does your heart pound fast-
er? Do you feel shivers racing up and
down your spine? Most likely these
physiological reactions will be accom-
panied by an increased sense of patri-
otism and love for our country.
Not only familiar strains have the
ability to give rise to emotional and
physiological responses. You may have
never heard Tchaikovsky's "Sixth
Sympathy." Yet when the orchestra
begins to play the music is bound to
decrease the regularity of your heart
beat and blood pressure.
At the same time, whether you
know the work as the "Pathetique" or
not, you would probably associate
words such as "sad" or "depressive,"
rather than "happy" or "gay," with
the major portions of this piece.
Music Therapy
In the twentieth century music has
been called upon to play two new and
exciting roles. Many medical special-
ists look to music not as "the great
healer" but as a therapeutic aid in
treating the mentally, emotionally
and physically ill.
A second use to which music is
increasingly being put is as a pain
depressant under surgical or similar
situations involving pain or extreme
pressure.
In developing theories which show
how music may be used effectively in
medical situations, researchers set out
to prove that music does have the
ability to evoke physiological and
emotional reactions in a human be-
ing. They figured that if music was
shown to stimulate pronounced re-
sponses in an organism, they would
have laid the foundation for a theory
that music could be applied to affect
behavior in a constructive manner.
Man functions first as a living
organism and then as a thinking be-
ing with moods and feelings. In de-
termining the most basic function of
a behaviorial force or stimulus, scien-
tists must first observe whether it
elicits an internal reaction that can
be measured.
Blood circulation, pulse rate, mus-
cle tone or firmness, nerve impulses,
cardiac and respiratory behavior—
these are all internal reactions that
can be measured.
Doctors found in an experiment
which measured cardiac and respira-
tory changes that music caused fast-
er and more shallow breathing regard-
less of loudness or softness of the
music. On the whole the louder sec-
tions tended to increase irregularity
more than softer ones.
Put into practical terms, this means
that no matter what type of music
you're listening to, it is apt to increase
your normal heart beat and breathing
rates. A rapid polka would probably
decrease regularity more than Tchai-
kovsky's "Sleeping Beauty."
Lawrence Walters is a musical
therapist from New York. In 1954 he
stated that music produces measur-
able effects upon the brain and mind.
How did he reach his conclusions?
Walters began his research by
studying a now famous experiment
conducted in 1896 by an Italian
physiologist. Dr. M. L. Patrici at-
tempted to determine the influence
of music on the circulation of the
blood in the brain.
A 13-year-old boy named Emanuel
Favre had suffered a severe head
wound. His health had been restored,
although the cut, which was more
than three inches long, left a small
section of his brain exposed. It was,
therefore, possible to observe and
accurately measure the blood circu-
lation in the brain.
Earlier observers had already prov-
en that excitement of the brain by
musical sounds increases the flow of
blood in other parts of the body.
Therefore, by comparing two tracings
of blood, one from the pulsation of
Emanuel's brain and the other from
the boy's arm, Dr. Patrici was able
to determine whether the brain is
more or less influenced by music than
other body parts.
Three significant results appeared:
1. The volume of blood in the boy's
arm rose in proportion to that of his
brain. 2. At times the blood circula-
tion in the brain increased while that
of the arm slowed down. 3. At times
blood circulation in the brain in-
creased while the circulation in the
ami remained constant.
To Patrici these three phenomena
were extremely enlightening. He the-
orized that lively music, such as a
national anthem, which caused an in-
crease in the blood circulation of
both the brain and the arm, would
arouse love of one's country or other
similar emotions. He saw why more
work can be accomplished when lively
music is being played. He foresaw the
use of music therapy to arouse one
from a depressed mood or to sooth
an agitated individual.
Most psychologists are in agree-
ment that one of the major causes for
music's effect upon the living organ-
ism is its unique organization, or
rhythm, which is also inherent in the
physiology of the human and the
animal.
They say that we perceive rhythm
because the body machinery is trained
in certain reactive patterns. We walk
in a rhythmic gait. Tapping our feet
and dancing are basic responses to
music in which rhythm is dominant.
"Rhythmic responses are based
upon a primitive rate of nervous dis-
charge," Psychologist Robert Mc-
Dougall explains. He says that psy-
chological attitudes are the result
of physiological conditioning by the
strain and releases due to rhythmic
reactions.
Thus, music has a potential for use
in therapeutic situations because it
is able to alter physiological processes
closely linked with a person's emo-
tions and moods. During World War
II doctors put this theory into prac-
tice in many military hospitals. Since
then the growth in the interdepend-
ence between music and medicine has
steadily increased to the point where
music therapy is a regular program
in most large hospitals.
The Case of Frank C.
To give a better idea of how music
is used in therapy, one can look at
the case of Frank C, a nineteen-
year-old college student. He suffered
from uncontrollable, destructive phys-
ical tendencies. He became easily
angered at the slightest provocation.

MUTATION

Editor's note: Each year the Cooley Es-
say Contest gives awards to the most out-
standing research papers written on the
assigned topic for the year in hopes that
it will encourage young engineers to rec-
ognize the value of good writing. This is
the ivinning essay from last year on the
question of the proper role of the govern-
ment in industrial research.
A great new concept in government
endeavor has come to pass since the
end of World War II. This new con-
cept has placed the federal govern-
ment in the role of a patron of sci-
ences, a supporter of scientific re-
search. Before one begins to picture
the government as simply a benefi-
cent donor, it should be noted that
the official awareness of science stems
from a selfish motive: national self-
defense. During the war, science was
called to defend the nation; after
victory, due to the Communist threat,
science was asked to continue in the
public service. Today, the national
government spends unprecedented
amounts of money for scientific re-
search centered almost totally around
defense and the closely related race
into space.
The role that the federal govern-
ment has assumed in this scientific,
defensive research has had many
effects on the relationship between
public affairs, educational institu-
tions, and private enterprise. Perhaps
the most important and the most far
reaching is the new relationship be-
tween industry and government.
In the years prior to the war, the
United States government dealt with
manufacturers as suppliers. If the
government needed a certain article,
it publicly advertised for production
bids; all interested firms presented
their bids, and when the bids were
opened, the lowest bidder was award-
ed the production contract. It was a
simple example of free competition in
a free market.
The Fixed-Price Contract
The contract used in this process,
the fixed-price contract, is quite sim-
ple. It places the manufacturer in his
traditional role as the entrepreneur
and government in the role of the
buyer. The price is set by contract;
the businessman tries to produce the
article within the limits of the con-
tracted price. If he can produce
cheaper than the cost he expected,
then he makes a greater profit than
planned for in the contract. If, how-
ever, the cost of the article is higher
than he expected, he loses money.
The fixed-price contract allows any
businessman, large or small, to com-
pete in the bidding. If he can carry
out the project cheaper than his
competitors, he gets the job. Not only
is everyone given a chance, but also
the lowest price and the greatest
efficiency are attained. Government,
the consumer, is kept separate from
industry except in a formal, business
relationship.
When the Second World War
broke out, Hitler's mechanized armies
demonstrated a great superiority in
modern weapons. It was obvious that
if the Allies were to survive, they
would have to spur on research and
development of new and even more
modern weapons. Here in America
there was no time for the nation's
scientific resources to be turned over
to the government; government, in-
dustry, universities, and non-profit
organizations had to pool their efforts.
Government supplied the money, and
the others supplied the men and the
equipment. Cooperation and partner-
ship were necessities. After the war.
Communist pressure demanded that
20

research and development efforts con-
tinue. Thus, today the United States
maintains not only a scientific pro-
gram almost totally built around na-
tional defense, but also, as an out-
growth of wartime organization, a
close working partnership with pri-
vate industry.
Scientific research and development,
however, cannot be contracted in as
simple a manner as the fixed-price
contract. The government is not buy-
ing a given, definite article; it is
buying first an idea and then the
project to carry out the idea. Take,
for example, the NIKE anti-aircraft
missile; the idea for an anti-aircraft
missile was conceived at the end of
World War II and turned over to
the Army Ordnance Corps, Which
began negotiating with several com-
panies on the contract to build the
missile. It was still just an idea; the
missile had no specifications, except
that it was supposed to shoot down
airplanes. Each of the companies sub-
mitted a design, and Western Electric
was finally given the contract. The
company began the researching and
testing. When at last a prototype, or
sample missile, was developed and
found satisfactory, the government
awarded Western Electric a fixed-
price production contract.
It is obvious that the research and
development stages up through the
building of the first missile could not
have been paid for by die fixed price
method; no one knew how to design
it, how to test it, or how to build it,
let alone how much it would cost. A
new contract policy was needed. The
terms of this new contract, called a
cost-plus-fixed-fee contract, are that
the government is to pay a fixed fee
in lieu of a profit to the coqjoration
doing the research, and it is to reim-
burse the corporation for all costs in-
curred in the project.
Implications
The concept of this type of con-
tract and the organization it demands
for implementation have great impli-
cations in government, industry, and
the fields of political and economic
theory. If an example of a modern re-
search and development process, such
as the now-defunct B-70 superbomber
project is considered, these effects be-
come quite clear. Nine years ago, in
1954, the Air Force formulated a set
of general operating requirements for
a new superbomber, the B-70. Six
major aircraft corporations were in-
vited to submit general designs for
the new airplane. After two years of
judging, the Air Force awarded the
contract to North American Aviation
Corporation. This contract for Phase
I, the research and design stage, was
on a cost-plus-fixed-fee basis. The con-
tract to follow normally would be a
Phase II cost-plus contract for the
building of a prototype. The final
phase, production, would be on the
normal fixed-price contract. In the
awarding of the contract for the B-70
project, each company submitted esti-
mates of cost, but the concern of the
Air Force was not the cost, but the
design and the capabilities of the com-
peting companies.
As prime contractor, North Ameri-
can was given almost complete re-
sponsibility for the job. It had the
responsibility to award first-tier sub-
contracts, subject to Air Force ap-
proval. These contracts were awarded
on the same basis as the prime con-
tract; the subcontractors were called
together, their designs, plants, and
general capabilities were considered
and the contracts, again on a cost-plus
basis, were granted. North American
had complete responsibility to see
that the work of the subcontractors
progressed properly and efficiently.
Correspondingly, if one of the sub-
contractors had to subcontract (a
second-tier subcontract), he, as a first-
tier subcontractor, was responsible for
the work of his second-tier subcontrac-
tors; this was true on down the line,
each contractor responsible for the
one below him, all the way to fourth
and fifth tiers. In this way, the whole
project was virtually the responsibil-
ity of private industry. Only the first
level of the project was directly un-
der the eye of the Air Force: all the
rest was private enterprise.
The implications of this type of
organization, characteristic of all
types of present federal-industrial re-
search and development projects, are
myriad. The process through which
the primary contract is awarded is
almost in complete contrast to the
traditional system of a free, competi-
tive market. The firms who are con-
sidered for the contract are not those
who submit bids, but those who are
invited to submit bids. The contract
is not awarded to the lowest bidder,
but to the company with the best pro-
posed design, best plant facilities, and
best qualified personnel. Because only
those companies recognized to have
sufficient resources are considered for
invitations to bid, only the large,
recognized firms have a chance to get
the contract. This has all the under-
tones of a turn-of-the-century combi-
nation in restraint of trade; it cer-
tainly is not a free market.
Since the great equalizer, cost, is
not considered, a great amount is left
to possible subjective decisions. It is
interesting to note that in recent
years, corresponding to the increase
in government-industrial research and
development, there has been an in-
crease in the number of former mili-
tary personnel hired by defense con-
tractors. This suggests the possibility
of influence peddling, but at the same
time it also suggests greater efficiency;

rations all over the country.
relations between the business and
the government can be greatly im-
proved by people who understand
both sides.
Is It Worth It?
The possibility still remains, how-
ever, that the American taxpayer may
not be getting his money's worth. Be-
cause no price has been agreed upon
and because there is no contracted
price to act as an incentive to keep
expenses at a minimum, some type of
precaution must be taken. Congress
and the General Accounting Office,
the auditor of Congressional appro-
priations, maintain a close watch on
research and development spending,
which appears to have been quite
effective in preventing price gouging.
However, despite any threats of being
exposed as cheaters, industry has
maintained good standing through
its own responsibility.
Under the present system, the roles
of government and industry are re-
versed. The government acts as the
entrepreneur; it takes the risk, ff the
project fails, the United States loses
billions of dollars, as it did when the
B-70 proved obsolete. Yet, the busi-
nessman receives his cost and his
fixed fee; the capitalist takes no risk.
For its part in the new situation, bus-
iness acts as a government agency. It
must not only see that the taxpayer
gets his money's worth, but also, be-
cause of its specialized personnel, it
has great influence over certain policy
decisions concerning the project or
the defense effort as a whole. In an-
other way, private enterprise turns
public; since the competitive market
is side-stepped in contract awards,
government regulations require that
prime contractors and subcontractors
encourage small businesses. The big
companies work with the Small Busi-
ness Administration, publicize bid-
ding, and even solicit submissions.
Business is also asked to help relieve
unemployment and boost the econ-
omy by granting subcontracts to firms
in depressed areas.
Thus a whole new relationship be-
tween government and industry has
evolved because of science. This re-
lationship has made the government
bigger and more complex. It has put
private enterprise in the role of pub-
lic servant. It has granted wonderful
opportunities for graft and corrup-
tion with the replacement of the
fixed price and fluctuating profit by
the fixed fee and fluctuating price. It
has given rise to a new method of
government contracting. Indeed, the
ramifications of the government's par-
ticipation in scientific progress could
probably never be enumerated.
One thing is certain, the need for
trust, cooperation, and responsibility
on the part of business and govern-
ment is very evident. Science has
drawn these two together as nothing
ever has before. It has removed die
sharp distinction between public and
private affairs by casting each in the
other's role, thus giving them the
common goals of success in science, in
economics, and in politics. The possi-
bilities for wrong-doing are many, for
the controls are not many, but men
of government and men of industry
have risen to die situation and Amer-
ica has progressed as it never has be-
fore.

SALUTE: WARREN ROSKE
Whether a simple voice circuit for a small trunk line, or
a complex high-speed data circuit for the Strategic Air
Command, Northwestern Bell Engineer Warren Roske gets
the nod. Warren (B.S.I.E., 1959), and the three engineers
who work under him, design telephone facilities for private
line customers.
On earlier assignments, Warren engineered communica-
tion lines through the famed Dakota Black Hills, helped in
the Mechanized Teletypewriter cutover in Sioux Falls, S. D.,

and contributed a unique application of statistics to a
Plant Engineering study.
But Warren's greatest success has come in the Trans-
mission field where, after only seven months, he was pro-
moted to his supervisory engineering position.
Like many young engineers, Warren is impatient to
make things happen for his company and himself. There
are few places where such restlessness is more welcomed
or rewarded than in the fast-growing telephone business.

engines to today's rockets. Tomorrow will find that same Pratt &amp;
Whitney Aircraft eagle carrying men and equipment to the moon and
to even more distant reaches of outer space.
Engineering achievement of this magnitude is directly traceable to
our conviction that basic and applied research is essential to healthy
progress. Today's engineers at Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft accept no
limiting criteria. They are moving ahead in many directions to advance
our programs in energy conversion for every environment.
Our progress on current programs is exciting, for it anticipates the
challenges of tomorrow. We are working, for example, in such areas
as advanced gas turbines ... rocket engines ... fuel cells... nuclear
power—all opening up new avenues of exploration in every field of
aerospace, marine and industrial power application.
The breadth of Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft programs requires virtually every tech-
nical talent... requires ambitious young engineers and scientists who can con-
tribute to our advances of the state of the art. Your degree? It can be a B.S., M.S.

Wheat Irradiation
A world-wide savings of hundreds
of millions of dollars worth of wheat
and wheat products is now possible
following approval of an atomic radi-
ation process developed by a Univer-
sity of Michigan professor. Approval
of the process, which uses radioactive
Cobalt-60 to sterilize insect eggs pres-
ent in the wheat and hence cut the
pests' reproductive chain, was recently
announced by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA).
The FDA had ruled the technique
a food additive, thereby calling for
extensive feeding tests with labora-
tory animals. This is the first approv-
al of radiation treatment for a major
staple food item. (Precedent for the
FDA ruling was set last February
when approval was given the U.S.
Army to irradiate bacon.)
Lloyd E. Brownell, professor of
chemical and metallurgical engineer-
ing and of nuclear engineering, who
developed the technique after 12 years
of study and research, said FDA ap-
proval cleared the way for immediate
considation of construction in India
of a prototype plant which could
process some 200 tons of wheat per
hour. After irradiation wheat could
be placed in insect-proof bags for
distribution or stored in insect-proof
elevators.
Insect infestation of wheat is a
problem in all tropical and subtrop-

ical countries. For example, Indian
authorities report annual losses of
25 to 30 per cent of imported wheat,
totalling some 30 million tons com-
ing mostly from the U.S. While the
problem is met here through use of
chemicals, such methods are not cur-
rently feasible in a number of other
countries, reportedly because of the
lack of adequate chemical controls.
Irradiation on a large scale for this
purpose in the U.S. is not immedi-
ately anticipated.
Brownell indicated that inevstiga-
tions of products made from irradi-
ated flour showed no loss in quality
and that with some varieties a quality
improvement was found. However,
gamma radiation has a detrimental
effect on the sprouting and growth of
wheat if used for seed.
Brownell's 12 years of food research,
climaxed by FDA approval, has been
variously sponsored by the Michigan
Memorial-Phoenix Project (a U of M
effort dedicated to finding peaceful
uses of atomic energy), the U.S.
Atomic Energy Commission, the U.S.
Army, the U.S. Surgeon General's
Office and the General Foods Com-
pany.
Lake Michigan
The U.S. Public Health Service
has granted The University of Mich-
igan a four-year $1 million contract
for research on Lake Michigan. The
project is designed to lead to infor-
mation needed for the future man-
agement of the Lake and preservation
of its water quality. The grant from
the service's Water Supply and Pollu-
tion Control division was said by
agency officials to be the largest ever
given to a single research organiza-
tion. Amount for each of the four
years will be about $289,000.
The research will be carried out by
the Great Lakes Research Division of
the U of M Institute of Science and
Technology, using the divisions 34-,
50-, and 114-foot research ships. It
will involve four years of extensive
sampling of the Lake for chemical
and biological analysis of the water
and bottom sediments, according to
U of M Prof. John G. Ayers, the
principal investigator. The aim of the
study is to determine precisely what
has been the effect of man's uses of
the Lake, and how fast his use is
changing its water quality. Samples
will be analyzed to see if the chemis-
try of the water has changed, if or-
ganisms living in the water are differ-
ent and if the types of material being
sedimented have changed now as
compared to the past.
Results from earlier studies, dating
back to 1861, will serve as reference.
The U. of M has intensively studied
various factors in all of the Lakes,
except Ontario, since 1955, when the
Great Lakes Research Institute was
established. (This became a division
of 1ST in 1960). Other U of M re-

Ayers, and Dr. David C. Chandler,
director of GLRD, pointed out that
"We don't know whether the sedi-
ments will show changes in the 30-
year period, but if the Lake is chang-
ing in response to materials that man
is adding, then these studies consti-
tute the first complete assessment of
the rate of change. And they will
provide a firm basis for more defini-
tive future studies which could and
should involve prediction of future
rates of change in the sediments as
well as in the organisms and the
water quality."
MECHANICAL LADY
A handmade "Mechanical Lady"
at The University of Michigan School
of Public Health winks, clicks, and
rattles her relays as she merrily per-
forms one of the major routine labo-
ratory chores in the study of anti-
bodies. The table-top apparatus,
which acts like a "Rube Goldberg"
machine with sound effects, works
four times faster than people. "And
besides," reports Dr. Richard J. Por-
ter, "she's the soul of precision. The
more tired she gets, the better she
works."
Dr. Porter, U. of M. professor of
protozoology, invented and built the
Lady during evenings and weekends
over three or four months. He esti-
mates that $430 worth of solenoids,
electric motors, rocker panels, valves,
springs, suction tubing and wires
went into the construction. He cre-
ated it to solve one of the more aggra-
vating and time-consuming chores in
the laboratory study of blood pro-
teins: the precision diluting of blood
samples.
Laboratory technicians place the
basic blood samples in the first of 12
ranks of tiny wells in a 96-well sample
plate. They then combine a portion of
the first sample with diluting fluid to
fill the second well and mix it thor-
oughly. Next, they take a portion of
the second to put in the third, and
so it goes ... By the end of the run,
a sample has been diluted to a 1 to
20,000 solution.
Unlike her human associates, the
Mechanical Lady can do this job
hour after hour without getting bug-
eyed. Suction tubes automatically dip
into the tiny wells, squish the fluid
around to assure a perfect blend, then
suck up a precise amount and deposit
it in the next well. Other tubes lead-

MECHANICAL LADY, a handsome apparatus created by a University of Michigan
professor of protozoology to speed laboratory dilution of blood samples, operates
under the eye of laboratory technician Mary Lou Swager. The device, a preci-
sion instrument made up of a bewildering array of solenoids, motors, panels,
valves, wires, springs and tubing, is the brainchild of Dr. Richard J. Porter.
ing from a reservoir squirt a prede-
termined amount of dilutant in the
well. Electric motors click on to raise
and lower the sample tray and move
it along a metal track. At the end of
each run, the Lady fastidiously rinses
out her tubes and flicks on a light
to show she's ready for her next as-
signment.
Dr. Porter (who went into parasit-
ology after a brief go at engineering)
notes proudly that the Mechanical
Lady is in growing demand around
the U. of M. labs. Says he, "I think it
will prove valuable for almost any
laboratory doing large numbers of
routine tests where the time of techni-
cians is a limiting factor."
Electro-Optical Sciences
The University of Michigan's In-
stitute of Science and Technology has
established a new laboratory to con-
duct research in the important new
field of electro-optical sciences. George
W. Stroke, professor of electric en-
gineering, has been appointed head
of the new unit. Stroke, an interna-
tional authority in geometric and
physical optics, joined the U of M
faculty this fall. He was formerly at
Massachusetts Institute of Technol-
ogy-
In announcing formation of the
Electro-Optical Sciences Laboratory,
1ST acting director James T. Wilson,
said it is part of a program initiated
this year to enable graduate students
to work with modern developments
in optics which have been advanced
in industry and in defense and space
programs conducted by the Federal
Government. "The University is pio-
neering in this field," Professor Wil-
son said. "New knowledge in optics is
being developed and used in industry
with dramatic results especially in
electronic information processing,
light amplification and control with
lasers, and communications."
Professor Stroke currently is teach-
ing a course in the electrical engin-
eering department introducing the
field of electro-optical science, the
first of its kind to be given here—and
perhaps the first in any university.
The new Electro-Optical Sciences
Laboratory will conduct studies in
diffraction gratings, light propaga-
tion, speed of light measurement, elec-
tro-optical communications, and opti-
cal electronics.
Professor Stroke was with MIT
from 1952 to 1963 except for inter-
vening appointments at Boston Uni-
versity (1956-57) and the Sorbonne
in Paris (1959-60). He received his
doctoral degree in physics at the Sor-
bonne in 1960.

Making fire a back page story...
Some fires make newspaper headlines. Others barely
make the back page. And a fire sprinkler system can
make the difference!
Sprinklers are the first line of defense against fire. And
Grinnell, pioneer in sprinkler protection, is today's lead-
ing sprinkler manufacturer. Grinnell systems — includ-
ing systems engineered for such special hazards as solid
propellant manufacture — protect lives and property
the world over.
Fire protection is only one reason industry looks to
Grinnell. Whenever piping is involved — from prefab-
ricated assemblies for power plants to valves for food
process piping — Grinnell can meet the need.
Grinnell is piping. The company offers industry the
engineering (from basic metallurgy to piping systems
design and prefabrication); the production facilities
(eight large plants in the U. S. and Canada); the product
line (everything in piping); the experience (over 100
years of leadership in the field) to solve the toughest
piping problems.
Worth remembering — against the day you may have
piping problems to solve. And worth investigating now if
you're looking for the unusual in an engineering career!

automatic drive in a lighter, less expensive version!

Result: A new Ford-built 3-speed
torque converter—ideal
"traveling companion" for our new,
hotter, medium-displacement V-8 engines
A completely new Ford Motor Company 3-speed
automatic drive for 1964 delivers improved
passing performance ... smoother acceleration
. . . better start-ups (up to 35% higher torque
multiplication in Low) . . . more flexible down-
hill braking . . . quieter operation in Neutral.
With the introduction of this lighter, highly
durable and efficient transmission in 1964
Comet, Fairlane and Ford models, our engi-
neers have taken still another step toward
putting extra pep per pound into Ford-built cars.
Simplified gear case design and a one-piece
aluminum casting result in a lighter, more
compact transmission—one that has fewer
components and is extremely easy to maintain.
Built to precision tolerances akin to those in
missile production, the new automatic trans-
mission is truly a product of the space age,
and is typical of technical progress at Ford.

ing am I best suited to?" These and many other ques-
tions bother most graduating engineers.
Chevrolet soon provided answers. A two-year training
program allowed me to participate in design, develop-
ment, and production of Chevrolet vehicles. I drove
and tested cars and trucks at the G. M. Milford Proving
Grounds. This gave me an immediate feeling for the
durability and performance expected by Management.
Three months in a dynamometer room gave me a
chance to get my hands dirty and find out what made
some of those high performance engines really produce.
Six months in drafting taught me many of the drawing
procedures and gave me some background on how the
ideas originate that eventually become the automobiles
of tomorrow. Three months each in an assembly plant,
an engine manufacturing plant, and a Powerglide trans-
mission plant took me from the Chevrolet Engineering
Center in Warren, Michigan to Flint and to Cleveland
where I learned about production problems.
I was given the chance to solve assembly problems
right at the point of origination. Here there is no time
for mistakes or indecision; I soon learned that mistakes
can be measured directly in dollars and cents. Saving

just a few pennies per vehicle mushrooms into gigantic
savings when applied to units that roll down the assem-
bly line by the thousands each day.
The final assignment in a design engineer's office
helped tie all the above areas together for me. The en-
gineer must lead and co-ordinate the design and develop-
ment programs as well as approve the manufactured
parts. His office becomes a proving ground for the engi-
neering school graduate; but before a graduate can ever
be confronted with the engineer's vast responsibilities, he
must demonstrate his ability to create and adjust to new
ideas in design, as well as show a tolerance to changes,
for "change" is a part of the every day life of an en-
gineer.
The basic knowledge from my years at Michigan only
opened the door. Now I must learn, in great detail, the
operation, the materials, and the manufacturing pro-
cedures involved in producing automobiles and trucks.
Based on my two-year survey of the industry, I feel the
fastest and most efficient way to obtain this new educa-
tion is to enter design work. Under the guidance of a
qualified engineer, the young graduate soon learns the
complex language of industry.
The designer is confronted daily with selecting toler-
ances, clearances, materials, fasteners, mechanism, etc.
He is immediately faced with all areas of industrial
problems. The drawing board tests his ability to think
and to communicate new ideas for manufacture and de-
velopment. An opportunity to enter design work should
never be overlooked; in fact, it should be sought after.
Here the theory learned in school can be applied and
tested.
I feel now that my choice to work in design is not the
end of the world, as many graduates first think, but
rather the first and necessary step in becoming a quali-
fied automotive engineer, capable of recognizing and
thinking in terms of lines and points in space.

tells how creative graduates contribute to
pioneering, automation developments.
Now, to meet the pressing challenge
of industrial automation, Cutler-
Hammer has formed a number of
automation project teams.
These teams combine the techni-
cal and manufacturing talents of
versatile, seasoned specialists and
you, creative-minded engineering
and business graduates.
Their primary job: to make sure
that a customer's automation in-
vestment pays an adequate return.
How they work
How do they meet this challenge?
By working with customer engineers
and consultants to isolate cost
problems in industrial process,
manufacturing, and warehousing
operations. Then, by applying their
individual talents and creative
ingenuity to develop, design, build,
and install practical automation
systems that will insure good return
on investment.
Where they work
Automation teams work together
in a Milwaukee-based, modern,
500,000 square foot plant specifi-
cally designed to house every
activity involved in the evolution
of a complex system ... in a creative
climate that is conducive to imagi-
native planning and pioneering
development.
What they have
done already
This approach has paid off! Though
industry has barely scratched the
surface of the automation potential,
our credentials already are quite
impressive.
Profit-making automation sys-
tems such as ... a bundle-handling
system for 30 major newspaper mail
rooms ... a package-handling sys-
tem for a prominent publisher . . .
U.S. Post Office mail-handling
systems in 14 major cities... pallet-
handling systems . . . more than a
score of major steel-mill finishing

(Continued from page 19)
He entered Menninger's Memorial
Hospital and was given a full pro-
gram of manual arts, sports and mu-
sic lessons. As a young boy he had
played the clarinet, and a musical
therapist now attempted to revive
his former interest.
At first Frank, was very impatient
with the music training, often taking
out his anger on his instrument. But
one day he expressed an interest in
wanting to become a member of a
jazz combo. The therapist worried
whether he would be able to handle
himself in such a group situation and
in preparation played duets with him.
Frank had been just an average
student, with no special musical tal-
ent. After joining the combo, com-
posed of other patients from the
hospital, his work was stimulated, and
he showed an improvement in his
playing almost immediately. The
group held him in check, and he did
quite well.
Frank's playing in the combo is
thought to be the key factor which
hastened his recovery. Both the emo-
tional effect of the music upon him
and the experience of working in a
group situation were helpful in cur-
ing his psychological problems.
There are many others like Frank
who suffer from psychological or
psychiatric problems that can be
helped by music. While music can-
not in itself erase the causes for an
illness, it is often useful in aiding the
recovery process by enabling the
patient to make better use of thera-
peutic experiences.
At Menninger's, where Frank spent
several years, there are two sides to
the music therapy program: 1. Music
is used to produce or blot out various
emotional states or moods in a pa-
tient. 2. Music lessons and activities
allow a patient to develop new inter-
est and abilities and work in a group
situation.
Phychologists and psychiatrists of-
ten prescribe music to fulfill the
emotional needs of a person. It has
a universal appeal but also affords the
flexibility that is necessary in treating
different individuals.
A patient may be very difficult to
reach at first and not respond to
verbal stimulation. Music, working
either on the emotional level or as a
socializing agent, may be helpful in
producing the necessary link between
doctor and patient.
With persons such as Frank, music
can be used to stimulate pleasant or
rested feelings. And where Frank
needed music as a relaxant, others
may be able to be brought out of a
depressed state through the use of
music especially selected for the par-
ticular patient.
Music therapy is still poorly under-
stood. Confusions over the power of
music have led to unscientific pre-
scriptions, such as these:
1. To reduce headaches: Offen-
bach's "Tales of Hoffman."
2. To lower emotional high blood
pressure: Ravel's "la Valse."
3. To cure jealousy: Chopin's
"Nocturne in D-Flat."
These findings by a psychologist
are obviously results of the "rule of
thumb." They may have worked in
a single instance, but there is no
proof that they could be used as a
standard prescription.
As James Stephens said, "All art
can only remind us of something we
have done or suffered, and can convey
to no man an experience which he
has not personally fathomed."
Music, then, has no definite mean-
ing. A piece may take on a certain
significance for a particular individ-
ual, but whatever images are familiar
to one individual cannot be the same
to another. The effects a particular
selection may have on one may be
entirely different from those upon
anothers.
We do know that as a result of
physiological reactions certain types
of music have the tendency to pro-
duce certain moods. But there is no
evidence to prove that all, or even a
majority of people, will react in the
same way to a particular Beethoven
sonata.
Like other therapeutic methods,
music therapy can be employed only
in individual instances. For some pa-
tients like Frank it may be used with
much success. But like other therap-
ies, music cannot work in all cases.
Music and the Dentist
For those of you who panic at the
sight of a dentist's drill, there may
be help from music. Toned-down
stereophonic sound is a relaxant and
an effective pain killer for many den-
tal patients, and it could work for
you. too.
Don't say "No." Put yourself in the
dental chair, and le music take the
place of an anesthetic, or pain killer,
for you.
You sit down in the chair, and the
destist hands you a tray in which
there are a variety of tape recordigs.
Shall it be Tchaikovsky's "Sixth" or
the latest jazz? The choice is up to
you.
You choose one musical selection
and one tape which contains a "mask-
ing" sound which resembles the rush-
ing waters of Niagara Falls. You then
put on a pair of earphones, settle
back for the afternoon's concert, and
forget about that tooth that's going
to have to come out.
This new method of killing pain
was developed by a dentist and a
psychologist who teamed up to in-
vent the Audio Analgesic. A stereo-
tape reproduction system sends sound
directly into a patient's ear through
a specially-designed head set. The
earphone system accoustically screens
out all harmful frequencies so that
the patient's hearing is not harmed.
You are able to control the volume
of the music by turning the knobs on
a small box which you hold in your
lap. If you feel any pain at all, just
turn up the volume of the concerto or
that latest pop tune you may be
listening to. In case of intense pain,
turn the dial which regulates the
"masking" sound. This rush of falling
water gives you the added protection
against pain that you may need.
The Audio Analgesic was invented
by Dr. Wallace J. Gardner, a dentist,
and Dr. J. R. C. Licklider, a psycholo-
gist.
The device works on two levels. It
first helps to counteract a patient's
fear and nervousness, conditions
which make him more liable to be
disturbed by pain or pressure.
Secondly, the music at an increased
volume and the "masking" noise is
actually able to prevent him from
feeling pain.
When the dental patient listens
to the music, his tension and anxiety
are decreased. He can't hear the
shrill, grating sound of the drill. He
forgets the sight of the instruments.
He gains confidence because he is

Of course, you are ... and should be. But don't
overlook the fact that "thinking big" really applies
to your own personal growth and achievements.
And that's an important reason for investigating
the opportunities here at Sikorsky Aircraft.
We believe that our company offers just the
"right-sized" environment for young engineers
seeking strong personal identification and stature
opportunities. The technical talent we require can
enjoy diversified activities in a field that permits
full expression of engineering imagination and
professional competence.
At Sikorsky Aircraft, our continuing objective
is the further advancement of a new technology
. . . VTOL aircraft systems . . . providing the
world's most versatile means of transportation.
The engineering assignments are diversified
and stimulating. Our engineers work in small
interdependent groups on demanding problems
in such areas as aerodynamics • human factors
engineering • automatic controls • stress en-
gineering • weight prediction • systems analysis
• operations research • reliability/maintain-
ability engineering • autonavigation systems . . .
among others.
Your opportunity for personal growth could

able to control the volume, and this
helps to erase his feeling of being
trapped in the chair.
Relaxed, the patient finds that he
is concentrating on the music and
forgets about the cavity that's being
filled.
"Gee, Mom, you shoulda heard the
horn on that diesel train," a six-year-
old exclaimed after a compound drill-
ing.
The little boy had not had an
anesthetic, but he felt no pain. He
had been too absorbed in a recording
of common sounds and noises intensi-
fied in stereo.
On the second level, the music at
an increased volume and the "mask-
ing" noise, which resembles the sound
of rushing water, actually work as a
pain killer.
When the patient feels any pain at
all, he turns up the volume of the
music. If he feels intense pain, he
puts on the sound of Niagara Falls.
The pain is erased through a pro-
cess in the brain which works simi-
larly to the play in a football game.
Team A is composed of players, or
pain impulses. Its job is to carry the
pain into the end-zone of the other
team, or that section of the brain
where the patient will feel it.
On Team B are noise impulses that
arise when the patient turns up the
volume of the music or turns on the
"masking" sound. Team B's aim is
to prevent Team A from carrying the
pain into its end-zone. Its players are
stronger than their opponents and are
successful when they receive the sig-
nal to tackle.
The patient, then, is the captain.
He controls the mechanism which
sends out the loud music or noise
impulses to block and tackle the pain
carriers.
Dr. Gardner initially tested the
Audia Analgesic on 387 patients hav-
ing drilling, grinding, or scaling. Of
the same, 254 found it completely
effective, 87 felt some pain but didn't
think they needed any other anesthe-
tics, and only 46 said that the device
didn't work.
Gardner next extracted teeth from
136 patients, using stereophonic
sound in place of an anesthetic. No
one suffered severe pain or regretted
the use of the method.
The Audio Analgesic has four ad-
vantages over older methods of killing
pain, such as novacaine or a general
anesthetic, which puts the patient in
a state of sleep.
1. It eliminates the "waiting per-
iod" before the anesthetic takes
effect.
2. It decreases the tendency of the
patient to get his tongue in the den-
tist's way.
3. It has the ability to drown out
the sound of the drill, a chief com-
plaint of many dental patients.
4. The dentist can also wear ear-
phones which allow him constantly to
be aware of the patient's reactions by
listening to changes in volume.
Dentists have found that the Audio
Analgesic is very successful with chil-
dren because the music more readily
occupies their full attention than it
does an adult's. If it is used on young
children, the method may eliminate
the fear of going to a dentist at an
early age.
But it's not too late for you. Don't
be surprised if you are treated to a
concert the next time you visit your
dentist.

This kind of chemical engineering
is not as easy as it looks
An outmoded stereotype should not
scare a good Ch.E. off from a highly
satisfactory career in marketing. We
are proud to say that the job calls for
more than a collection of shaggy dog
stories plus a convincing manner of
taking two more strokes than the
customer on that dogleg 14th hole.
Often a marketing career in our
non-photographic operations starts
out much like the traditional concept
of chemical engineering, except that
you work on the customers' production
problems instead of our own. Then
you get to meet a few live customers
who come to see what you are up to.
Maybe you are sent to a trade con-
vention where you meet more than a
few customers. To your amazement,
they seem to regard you as a foun-
tainhead of valuable technical infor-
mation in a given area. To your further
amazement you realize it's true—they
do badly need to know exactly what
you are being paid to tell them and
show them. (Willy I.oman never had
it so good.) By and by, you may do a
tour of duty in one of our field sales
offices, or even get into the advertising
end. As another course, you may settle
down into liaison with manufacturers
of equipment that needs to be fed with
our plastics, fibers, solvents, chemical
intermediates, or fine chemicals.
We define the chemical marketer as
a chemical engineer who forges the
most rational links between what we
can most efficiently turn out and what
other companies can most efficiently
use. He is a hero of the chemical
industry today.
As for the chemical engineer of
different personality bent who, early
in his career, prefers to put down roots
in one of the three communities where
we manufacture—Rochester, N. Y.,
Kingsport, Tenn., Longview, Tex.—we
need him too. And of course, diversi-
fied as we are, we also need engineers
of other than chemical persuasion, to
say nothing of scholarly chemists and
physicists to lay down good, solid
foundations for all that engineering
and creative salesmanship.

COULD YOU OUT-THINK A COMPETITOR?
Consider a Career
in Technical Marketing
Q. Mr. Smith, I know engineering plays a role in the design and manufacture
of General Electric products, but what place is there for an engineer in
marketing?
A. For certain exceptionally talented individuals, a career in technical market-
ing offers extraordinary opportunity. You learn fast what the real needs of
customers are. under actual industrial conditions. You are brought face-to-face
with the economic realities of business. You participate in some of the most
exciting strategic work in the world: planning how to out-engineer and out-sell
competitors for a major installation.
Q. Sounds exciting. But I've worked hard for my technical degree. I'm worried
that if I go into marketing, I won't use it.
A. Don't worry—you'll use all the engineering you've learned, and you'll go
on learning for the rest of your life. In fact, you'll have to. You see, the basic
purpose of business is to sense changing customer needs, and then marshal
resources to meet them profitably. That means that you must learn to know
each customer's operations and needs almost as well as he understands them
himself. And with competitors trying their best to outdo you, believe me—
every bit of knowledge and skill you've got will be called into play.
Q. Is that why you said you wanted "exceptionally talented people"?
A. Technical marketing is not everybody's dish of tea. It takes great personal
drive and energy, and a talent for managing the work of others in concert with
your own. It takes flexibility . . . imagination . . . ingenuity . . . quick reflexes
. . . leadership qualities. If you're nervous with people or upset by quick-
changing situations, I don't think technical marketing's for you. But if you are
excited by competition, like to help others solve technical problems, and enjoy
seeing your technical work put to the test of real operation—then you may be
one of the ambitious men we're looking for.
Q. Now what, actually, does a man do in technical marketing?
A. Let me describe a typical situation in General Electric. A field sales
engineer is in regular contact with his customers. Let's say one of them makes
an inquiry, or the sales engineer senses that the time is right for a proposition.
With his field application engineer, he determines the basic equipment needed.
Then he contacts the marketing sales specialist in the G-E department that
manufactures that equipment. The sales specialist, working closely with his
department's product engineers, specifies an exact design—realistic in function
and cost. Then the sales engineer and his supporting team try to make the
sale, changing and improving the proposition as they get cues from the competi-
tive situation. If the sale is made—a very satisfying moment—then the installa-
tion and service engineers install the equipment and are responsible for its
operation and repair. With the exception of the product design engineers, all
these people are in technical marketing. Exciting work, all of it.
Q. In college we learn engineering theory. How do we get the sales and busi-
ness knowledge you mentioned?
A. At General Electric, a solid, well tested program of educational courses will
quickly advance both your engineering knowledge and your sales capacities.
But perhaps even more important, you'll be assigned to work with some of the
crack sales engineers and application and installation men in the world, and
that's no exaggeration. A man grows fast when he's on the sales firing line. As
a FORTUNE writer once put it, the industrial sales engineer needs "that prime
combination of technical savvy, tactical agility, and unruffled persuasiveness."

Why would a scientist pay $4100 for this little coil of wire from Westinghouse?

Because it is leading to new discoveries in physics, electric power and space travel.
The little coil is made with a most remark
able wire. Cooled to 452°F below zero, it
becomes a super-powerful magnet.
In labs all over the country, scientists are
using the Westinghouse super-magnet to
explore ideas like generating electric power
directly from a stream of hot gases; build-
ing new kinds of atom smashers; develop-
ing power systems for long-distance space
travel and communications.
The Westinghouse super-magnet oper-
ates on less power than an ordinary light
bulb. But it has twice the strength of an
electro-magnet weighing 20 tons and us-
ing 100,000 watts of electricity.
That's why this little Westinghouse mag-
net is a bargain at $4100.
You can be sure... if it's Westinghouse.

Instant portable power... any time, any place
In this battery-sparked new world of portable convenience, hand tools are driven by their own re-
chargeable batteries . . . toys perform their tricks by remote control ... a hearing aid with its
button-size power cell can be slipped into the ear . . . cordless radios and television sets are lively
companions in the home or outdoors .. . missiles and satellites are guided through the vastness of
space. ► Developments like these have brought more than 350 types of Eveready batteries into
use today, 73 years after Union Carbide produced the first commercial dry cell. Ever-longer service
life with power to spare is opening the way for portable power sources, such as the new alkaline,
nickel cadmium, and silver batteries, to serve hundreds of new uses. ► For the future, along with
their research in batteries, the people of Union Carbide are working on new and unusual power
systems, including fuel cells. And this is only one of the many fields in which they are meeting ^^^
the growing needs of tomorrow's world.

that could be built today!

Result: Allegro, an experiment in advanced automotive ideas
that are practical for the near future
Allegro means "brisk and lively," which certainly
describes Ford Motor Company's new dream car,
a handsome fastback coupe. More than that, Allegro
has unique functional features that could be adapted
for future production cars. (This has already occurred
in the case of retractable seat belts!)
A major innovation is a cantilever-arm steering
wheel with an electronic "memory." The steering
wheel is mounted on an arm that extends from a
center-mounted column. The wheel swings upward
for easy exit, returns automatically to its former
position at the touch of a button. Power adjustment
enables it to be moved three inches fore and aft and
five inches vertically. This, plus power-adjustable
foot pedals, permits use of a fixed seat design for
low overall height.
Basically a two-seater in present form, Allegro has
rear floor space that could be converted to carry
two additional passengers. The car could be powered
by either a V-4 made by Ford of Germany or by the
domestic 144- or 170-cubic-inch Sixes.
Allegro is one of a series of Ford-built dream cars
which will be shown at the New York World's Fair
to test consumer reaction to styling and mechani-
cal innovations. This will help determine which of
their forward-looking features are destined for the
American Road—as further examples of Ford Motor
Company's leadership in styling and engineering.

REFLECTIONS OF A SENIOR
In this, my last editorial for the Technic, I would like
to reflect somewhat upon my educational experiences over
the past four-and-a-half years here at the University of Mich-
igan, and I would like to evaluate what I consider the stronger
and weaker aspects of Michigan's system of educating engi-
neers. I might mention at the outset that my education has
been confined to mechanical engineering, and therefore, my
comments will tend to be influenced by this area of concen-
tration. However, I will try to be as general in my evaluation
as I can. My initial comments will concern what I consider
to be some of the outstanding weaknesses in the system, and
I shall then follow up with the outstanding strengths.
One of my biggest complaints is that the curriculum in
engineering lacks continuity, and my reasoning goes some-
thing like this. The initial fundamentals courses are taught by
non-engineers; that is, chemists, mathematicians, physicists,
and others. These instructors are not primarily concerned with
the engineering significance of the subjects that they teach, so
they do not impart this significance to the students . . . They
do not and in reality cannot, because these courses are being
offered in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts to
a general audience which happens to include engineers.
After the initial set of science and mathematics funda-
mentals courses are completed, the student is ready to tackle
the courses in engineering fundamentals. These courses will
overlap the previous courses to a certain extent, but they will
develop the topics more thoroughly and will be engineer-
oriented. In these courses, the student gets his first taste of
engineering.
Finally, courses in design, advanced theory, and specialized
areas of study are taken to complete the education. A certain
number of these more challenging and difficult courses are
required to give the engineer some valuable tools upon which
he may call when dealing with the complex problems which
he will encounter in the real world.
This pattern of building using separate building blocks
represents the Michigan system and I feel that this method
prevents good continuity between courses and tends to hinder
the final product—the completed undergraduate engineering
education.
I feel the continuity is destroyed because the various
courses are treated by the instructors and, therefore, inter-
preted by the students, as entities unto themselves. The overall
picture—the engineering education—is not borne in mind.
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


'Ori
Perhaps I can offer an example to illustrate my point more
clearly.
Design is an important aspect of engineering, yet it is
taught in specialized courses, called design courses, to juniors
and seniors. This attitude that design is an entity, and not
that it actually embraces all engineering, is created because of
the course sequence structure. To rectify the situation, I
would propose to introduce designing to freshmen and sopho-
mores in their early courses, as part of these courses. The de-
sign projects would be simple, perhaps intuitive, with respect
to such problems as materials, stresses, and other engineering
considerations. They should pertain to the courses and topics
being studied and should require the student to arrive at a
solution by thinking and using his ingenuity. Upon comple-
tion of the projects, presentations to the class should be made
in order to allow the prospective engineer to learn to com-
municate more effectively with his peers. Variations on prob-
lem solution could even be used; the problems could be solved
by each individual, or by partners, or in groups, and so on.
This would give the student experience in working with peo-
ple and would allow him the advantage of sharing ideas with
others in the solution of a problem.
These ideas for integrating design into the gamut of en-
gineering courses was suggested to me by Prof. Shigley of the
Mechanical Engineering Department. Surely it is not difficult
to extend this example to other areas of engineering which
could more effectively be treated as integral parts of the
system. My proposal then is that by using a more integrated
approach to teaching, continuity between the segments will
result, and consequently the product will be better.
The second outstanding weakness in Michigan's engineer-
ing curriculum, I feel, is the length of the undergraduate pro-
gram—it should be increased from four-and-a-half to five years.
This additional semester would serve a dual purpose; more
non-technical subjects could be taken to stimulate cultural
growth and more technical courses could be taken to stimulate
academic growth. The scrawny number of credits presently
allowed for non-technical electives can scarcely but wet an
interest in the humanities. 1 believe that the engineer should
have the opportunity to broaden himself in this respect, and
at this time, he is being cheated. Also the extra time could be
used to better train the undergraduate in the engineering
aspect of his education. He could take several additional
courses, perhaps in a more specialized area, to satisfy an inter-
est or a curiosity, or to develop an ability.
The third complaint that I have concerns the laboratories
and lab reports; this is not a general complaint and cannot

// has been said that man's technology
is far ahead of his physiological and psy-
chological development. This is especially
true in the field oj space research. Assum-
ing that man is necessary in a space veh-
icle, the primary concern in the space
program is finding ways to get the man
into space with the minimum of harm
and then keeping him alive.
From the viewpoint of the medical
specialist space begins at an altitude
of about three miles. It is at this
border that the unprotected space
traveler begins to suffer from an en-
vironment lacking in the many com-
plex physical requirements of life. His
body suffers from oxygen deficiency
and the atmospheric pressure drop
causes bubbles to form in the blood
stream and in the tissues of his body.
The harsh electro-magnetic radiation
and particulate matter of outer space,
normally filtered by our atmosphere,
would bombard the unprotected space
man incessantly.
It is therefore obvious that if man
is to explore space, elaborate protec-
tive measures must be taken. In view
of these circumstances, we may well
ask the question: is man necessary in
his spacecraft? Is it not possible to
carry out at least the initial explora-
tion of space with unmanned but well
instrumented vehicles? The authori-
ties assure us that man is an indis-
pensible part of space exploratory
missions. He is launched from earth
not merely as a biological test speci-
men, but with the duty of perform-
ing tasks vital to the mission. Man's
inductive reasoning ability and his
sensing elements make the prospect of
replacing him by a computer light
enough to be lifted into space highly
unlikely.
It is on this basis that we will as-
sume the necessity of man in his
spacecraft. We will now turn our
attention to the problem facing us:
how are we to provide for man in the
unfriendly environment of space? It
is the purpose of this paper to ex-
amine the various approaches being
made to the life-support problem.
Basically, these approaches fall into
one of two categories: the duplication
of the terrestrial environment in the
space cabin, or the "cyborg concept,"
a somewhat more radical but quite
interesting approach which proposes
the artificial adaptation of man to
the space environment. The question
dealt with in this paper is which of
these systems is the more promising.
Conclusions
There are two very obvious criteria
by which any life-support system may
be judged: dependability and mini-
mal weight. However, for our par-
ticular purposes, there is a third con-
sideration which becomes even more
important. What is needed is a system
which will be available within the
next two decades. It is within this
period that man will be making his
initial extended voyages into space
and the life-support systems presently
in use will not be adequate. It is be-
cause of this limitation that the first
of our two divisions of life-support
systems—duplicating an earth envir-
onment in the space cabin—seems to
be the most promising. Although the
cyborg concept is a very exciting pro-
posal, the technology is just not
available and it is highly unlikely
that it will become an operational
system within the next two decades.
Let us now examine each of these
systems so that we may see a little
more clearly what is involved.
The Cyborg Concept
The cyborg (CYBernetic ORGan-
ism) concept is the brain child of a
rather unique combination of a doc-
tor and an engineer: Dr. Nathan
Kline of New York's Rockland State
Hospital and engineer Manfred
Clynes who does computer studies on
body cybernetics at the same hospital.
The cyborg "deliberately incorporates
exogenous components extending the
self-regulatory control function of the
organism in order to adapt it to a
new environment."
This whole concept is made possi-
ble by a small osmotic pressure pump
called the Rose pump, named after its
inventor S. Rose of Australia. The
pump consists of a small tube about
two inches long which can be attached
to any organism, such as man, and
will deliver chemicals into its body
at minute, constant rates. Pumps are
available which can deliver 0.01
ml/day for 200 days. Within the tube
is a congo red solution separated
from a water compartment by a cello-
phane membrane. The water moves
by osmotic pressure into the congo
red compartment and expands it,
forcing a chemical out at a constant
rate.
They could have a variety of appli-
cations. This pump could control
blood pressure, pulse rate, body tem-
perature and blood sugar. It could
inject drugs which would regulate
energy or cause tranquility, increase
tolerance to radiation, and minimize
the psychological problems of space
flight by reducing the tension caused
by sensory deprivation or invariance.
But the use of the Rose pump is
only one of the possible uses of the
cyborg concept. For example, artifi-
cial senses could be provided which
would regulate artificial glands. The
heart would pump blood to a con-
verter which would remake oxygen
from the carbon dioxide. What better
way to solve the problem of providing
a cabin breathing environment than
to obviate the need for lungs alto-
gether! Man could adjust to the cold
vacuum of space by allowing his blood
to cool and prevent numbing by
warming only his brain. By deflating
his lungs there would be no need for
a completely pressurized cabin. His
food could be pumped directly into
his blood stream or his stomach.

altogether and wear only sealed skin-
tight suits. Their mouths would be
sealed and unused, communications
being accomplished with radio trans-
mitters connected to the vocal cords.
Although the possibilities of the
cyborg are tremendous it remains as
yet a bit of science fiction. Experi-
ments with rats have demonstrated
the capabilities of the Rose pump;
however, a vast amount of unvailable
technology is required before such a
system could become operational. A
more conventional life-support system
is required which will be available in
the near future.
Terrestrial Environment in the Space
Capsule
The possibility of providing a
warm, dry cabin in space has been
quite well established with the de-
velopment of the pressurized capsule.
Many radical approaches have been
proposed such as that of Dr. Bernard
Black who points out that animals
which are natural hibernators with-
stand acceleration better while asleep
and suggests that astronauts be im-
mersed in a fluid-filled bag and
cooled to suspended animation. How-
ever, the success of our Mercury Pro-
gram has demonstrated quite well
that man can provide a habitable
terrestrial environment in space. The
biggest difficulty is in creating a sys-
tem which will provide the required
oxygen, food, and disposal of waste
materials for a space voyage of ex-
tended duration and still be light in
weight so that it may be launched
from the earth's gravitational force.
I have classified the life-support
systems as those which propose the
adaptation of man to an alien en-
vironment and those which attempt
to duplicate a terrestrial environment
in the space capsule. VVithn the sec-
ond group a further division is possi-
ble. There is the open system which
rjirovides oxygen and food in storage
*and disposes of all gaseous waste prod-
ucts by venting overboard and by
storing the solid wastes. The semi-
closed system reuses the bad air, re-
moving the gaseous wastes. The closed
systerh operates on a complete ecol-
ogical cycle similar to that on earth.
Only for very short operations, from
one to eight hours, does the open
system seem to be the most practical.
It has been used up until now pri-
marily for short Mights of experi-
mental test animals such as monkeys
and dogs. For flights of longer dura-
tion this system becomes highly im-
practical because of the weight of the
large supplies of oxygen and food
necessary.
The semiclosed system is quite well
exemplified by that which is used in
the Mercury Program and in the So-
viet capsule Vostok I in which Maj.
Yuri Gagarin orbited. The Mercury
capsule employs a closely controlled,
all-oxygen environment under tem-
peratures ranging between —2()°F
and 200°F. With the initial flights a
four-pound supply of oxygen was pro-
vided which was good for twenty-
eight hours.
This type of oxygen supply was the
most undesirable feature of the Mer-
cury capsule. It presented a fire haz-
ard for which a special fire extinguish-
ing system had to be provided. Also,
oxygen has been demonstrated to
have toxic effects on the body when
present in such a high partial press-
ure. It also is capable of dehydrating
the linings of the mouth and throat.
The use of various gases as diluents
has been proposed and experiments
with such gases as nitrogen and the
inert gases have been made. The im-
practicality of this semi-closed system
becomes apparent on (lights of long
duration for which vast stores of oxy-
gen and food would be necessary and
because large amounts of metabolic
wastes would accumulate.
It is this weight factor which makes
the idea of the closed system of life
support so practical. Large stores of
supplies would not be necessary be-
cause of the recycling process em-
ployed. The breathing gas would be
constantly reconditioned and reused
and wastes would be reduced and con-
verted to usable materials. This sys-
tem is suggested to us by the natural
life cycle here on earth. Essentually,
man on this earth is part of a cycle
in which he receives oxygen from the
plants which in turn utilize his car-
bon dioxide wastes. His food comes
either directly or indirectly from the
plants which in turn receive nutrients
from animal wastes. A synthetic nutri-
tional cycle designed after this system
is the answer to our problem.
A great deal of literature has been
published, models made and research
done on this concept. Most of these
systems propose the use of some form
of green plant such as algae or lichen.
Dr. Jack Myers, at the University of
Texas has found that five pounds,
fresh weight, of the common algae
Chloella pyrcnoidosa under optimal
conditions, is sufficient to supply one
man with oxygen and absorb the car-
bon dioxide that he produces over a

single-celled, small, round bodies
about the size of a red blood cell.
Their average composition is 50%
protein, 15% carbohydrate, 25% lip-
ids, and about 10% ash. Since they
are highly digestible, these plants
would seem to provide an ideal food
source aboard a satellite or space ship,
for flights on the order of weeks or
nnonths. The nutritional requirements
of the algae include nitrogen, carbon,
phosphorus, potassium, calcium, iron,
magnesium, sulfur, and the micro-
nutrients manganese, cobalt, copper,
and zinc. Present data indicates that
all, or nearly all, of these elements
essential to the algae for growth, res-
piration, and photosynthesis are pres-
ent in adequate amounts in the three
forms of human wastes: the urine, the
organic waste of the gastrointestinal
tract, and the carbon dioxide in the
exhaled air.
The illustration on this page
is a simplified diagram of a closed
environmental cycle. The possibility
of using the algae as food for
the astronauts directly is under some
doubt. Some researchers feel that such
plants might be made more accepta-
ble, both in taste and nutrition, if
they are first fed to a lower animal
such as a goat, a daphina, a slug, a
snail or some other animal which is
likely to eat the algae directly. The
crew might then live off this animal.
However, there is little reason why
algae, through proper preparation
for the table, can not be a perfectly
acceptable food. In fact, not too long
ago, algal research scientists prepared
and ate a banquet in which all the
courses of the meal were composed
partially of algae. The event was a
notable success.
As yet no one has produced a work-
able photosynthetic macrocycle which
would be operable as the sole life-
support system of a space cabin. Prob-
lems which researchers are encounter-
ing now are: insuring that space radi-
ation will not cause mutations in the
algae culture, bacterial infection of
colony, unknown effects of weightless-
ness and reduced pressure. However,
indications are that this closed en-
vironmental system is entirely feasi-
ble and it seems to be the most prom-
ising of the life-support systems. Its
primary advantage is its self-sustaining
capability. No large amounts of sup-
plies are necessary for even long
space voyages and the entire system
could be made quite light weight.

A simple Algal Macrocycle.
Conclusion
The purpose of this paper has been
to survey the various systems of life-
support which have been suggested
for manned space vehicles. 1 have
made this analysis somewhat compar-
ative in that I have attempted to
point out the advantages that certain
systems have over others and to de-
cide which system appears to be the
most promising. I should point out,
however, that vigorous research is
necessary in each area of life-support
systems. For instance, although the
cyborg concept seems a most distant
possibility, we must not neglect the
demands of future space exploration
and possible colonization. Basic re-
search in this concept is necessary to-
day so that we may have the means to
meet tomorrow's problems.
The present state of research is ex-
pressed by Hubertus Strughold, Pro-
fessor of Space Medicine and Advisor
for Research at the Brooks Air Force
Base School of Aviation Medicine:
Laboratory studies concerning the
climatization of the space cabin and
nutritional problems have pro-
gressed to the point that the dura-
tion of keeping man alert and
healthy can be expressed rather in
the order of weeks than of days. A
flight to the moon, therefore—as
far as the duration is concerned-
poses no foreseeable difficulties
with regard to logistics involved in
the climatic and nutritional re-
quirements.

Probably no single issue in the world
today affects our lives more than the
spare race and all the economic and
political factors that revolve around it.
One could easily doubt the value of such
a program extended over a long period
of time, but, assuming that our space pro-
gram is as critical as its advocates say it
is, it is even more perplexing that our na-
tion is not leading in this race to space.
One would think that after so many bil-
lions of dollars and years of research that
the United States would hold an advan-
tage. However, there are many good and
very much overlooked reasons xvhy we do
not.
Every American can remember,
October 4, 1957, the day that news-
casters and newspapers announced
the shocking statement, "Russia sends
Sputnik to orbit the world." He also
remembers the amazement of his
friends and neighbors when they real-
ized that Russia had beaten us to
space and the angry editorials and
stories about the laxness of American
technology which followed. And on
the other hand he can remember peo-
ple saying, even after the Russians
had launched their second satellite a
full two months before we launched
our first, that this didn't really mean
anything, and that we were still far
ahead of the Russians in the race for
space.
Were we still ahead? We were not,
as the followiing reports show. Rich-
ard Witkin, editor of the New York
Times, in his book, The Challenge of
the Sputniks, states that after the
launching of Sputnik I, "Russia had
beaten the United States into space.
It was only a short jump in logic to
realize that Russia had run up a
threatening lead in weaponry." Fur-
ther, Mr. Wilkin states, "The nation
began to conclude [after the launch-
ing of Sputnik II] that Russia was
not simply a month or six months,
but probably a year or several years
ahead in the space contest." Ritchie
Colder, a leading British science writ-
er, stated in The Statesman and Na-
tion, "This [Sputnik I] is a technolog-
ical achievement which must shatter
forever any illusions about western
engineering superiority." Dr. Edward
Teller, creator of the hydogen bomb,
stated that , "It may take us ten years
to catch up to the Russians." John
Gunther in his book, Inside Russia
Today, states that, "The United
States can no longer claim with rea-
son to be the world's first scientific
power in an era when science, as well
as prestige, counts so much. One can-
not help but wonder what was the
background that caused Russia to
lead the United States in the space
race after the launching of Sputniks
I and II. That is, who or what was to
blame?
Conclusions
The reasons why Russia was the
first in space are numerous. The most
important ones are listed below. First
of all, the Russians had a historical
advantage. Secondly, their govern-
ment showed more interest sooner
than the American givernment. The
Russians also gained a great deal from
surrendered German rocket equip-
ment and personnel after World War
II. The American space program was
held back much by politics. And
perhaps the most important reason is
that the west has always believed that
Russian technology could never com-
pare with western technology in spite
of great Russian advances in atomic
energy and jet propulsion and in spite
of the fact that Russia has greater
natural potential than the United
States.
Who is to blame? The blame can't
really be placed on anyone's should-
ers. If someone must be found, how-
ever, perhaps the American people
are the most to blame.
Russia's Historical Advantage
Russia has enjoyed a certain his-
torical advantage in space technology
over the United States. What is meant
by this is that the history of Russian
astronautics is longer and fuller than
the history of American astronautics.
This has given Russia a head start on
the United States in this field.
Russian astronautical history ex-
tends back to 1898 when Konstantin
Ziolkowski wrote a volume titled
Dynamic Bodies of Variable Mass. It
was the first logically sound scientific
work exploring the possibilities of
rocket flight. Ziolkowski's work and
studies were subsidized by the Russian
government. In 1911, K. E. Tsiolkovs-
kiv (who is now generally known as
the father of astronautics) published
The Principles of Space Flight. In
1932, after four years of work, N. A.
Rynin published a nine volume trea-
tise on astronautics. In 1929, "Gird"
(Group Studying Reactive Motion)
was formed to study, with a high de-
gree of technical sophistocation, astro-
nautics. From 1929-1932, V. P. Glush-
ko designed and tested liquid fuel
rockets. This feat was noteworthy be-
cause of the two types of rocket en-
gines (solid and liquid) liquid fuel
engines are by far the most compli-
cated. In 1932, F. A. Tsander built
and tested a liquid fuel engine. And
the list goes on and on. Russian
rocket research before World War II
was advancing at a very rapid rate.
Similar advancement in the United
States was quite slow. Perhaps the
only person in early American astro-
nautical history of importance was
Robert H. Goddard, professor at
Clark University in Massachusetts. In
1919 Goddard made a study titled "A
Method of Reaching Extreme Alti-

tudes." He experimented through the
1920's with liquid propellant rockets
and was given a small grant in the
1930's by the government to carry on
his work. Before World War II,
American rocket research was barely
advancing at all.
Government Interest
The Russian government has been
supporting Russian rocket research
since the government sponsored a
rocket research program in 1934. Be-
cause the Russian government is a
dictatorship, Russian technical and
scientific skills were given a central-
ized control and a unified goal. Dur-
ing the early 1940s the Russians were
able to build several powerful rockets
and use some of them in World War
II as anti-tank and anti-aircraft
rockets. In 1949 government-inspired
research produced a rocket that boost-
ed payloads of 264 to 286 pounds to
an altitude of 68 miles. This was an
amazing achievement fourteen years
ago. In 1954 the U.S.S.R. Academy of
Sciences established the K. E. Tsiol-
kovskiv Gold Medal for outstanding
work in astronautics to be awarded
every three years. In 1954 the Acad-
emy also established a permanent in-
terdepartmental commission on astro-
nautics. In 1956 the academy applied
for membership in the International
Astronautical Federation and was ac-
cepted. The U.S.S.R.'s only repre-
sentative to the federation was elected
vice president.
The American government's first
sponsored rocket research program
didn't come until 1942, eight years
after Russia's similar program. In
1947 the government-sponsored Bell
XI rocket plane was tested and was
followed by a series of experimental
rocket planes and high altitude re-
search rockets. In December of 1948
a United States satellite program was
announced by Secretary of Defense
Forrestal, but was later scrapped.
Finally, in 1955 President Eisenhower
announced that the United States
would launch an earth satellite dur-
ing the International Geophysical
Year. This announcement was quickly
followed by a similar one from the
Soviet Union.
Thus it can be seen that the Soviet
government with its greater power to
organize showed an earlier and a
stronger interest in astronautics than
the United States government.
German War Losses
Russia gained a great deal from
surrendered German rocket equip-
ment and personnel after World War
II. As the allied forces drove into
Germany, Nazi V-2 rocket launching,
testing, and producing sites were
captured. The Russians, arriving from
the east, were able to capture the test-
ing and producing sites and most of
the German rocket scientists, while
the English, French, and Americans,
arriving from the west, were only able
to capture the field launching sites.
As a result, most of the German scien-
tists were taken to the Soviet Union
(to be repatriated in 1952) while only
a few came to the United States. The
Russians, it can be seen, had much
more of the advanced German tech-
nology to use and draw from than the
United States.
Western Egoism
One of the most important reasons
why Russia is ahead in the space race
is because the western world couldn't
bring itself to believe that Russia
could ever be as advanced scientific-
ally as the United States. People
thought, "Russians couldn't drive
a tractor, let alone build a missile."
As John Gunther states in his book,
"Sputniks were a defeat in the field
that Americans thought their own-
application of science to technology.
American officials failed to appreciate
the significance of Sputnik and had
a stubborn unwillingness to concede
the realities of Soviet scientific ad-
vance, devotion to research, and con-
centration of resaurces to a single pur-
pose." Carobie C. Adams admits in
his book, Space Flight, that, "There
should have been no surprise at the
timing and magnitude of the Soviet
achievements." The following state-
ment was made by Marguerete Hig-
gins, foreign correspondent of the
New York Herald Tribune, "It [the
shocked reaction of the west towards
Sputnik] involves nothing less than
this country's capacity to cope with
and, above all, understand workings
of the Communist totalitarian dic-
tatorship, for it has been the incapac-
ity to judge the self-proclaimed enemy
that has been primarily responsible
for bringing us to the present time of
troubles. The United States was over-
ly secure in its position as the most
technologically advanced nation on
earth. It was so secure that it saw no
need to push rocket research.
American Politics
Confused American politics is the
last major reason. On December 29,
1948, as was previously mentioned,
the Secretary of Defense, James V.
Forrestal, stated that a study for con-
struction of an artificial space satel-
lite was proceeding, but the so-called
Forrestal Project died in Congress. On
June 25, 1954 a talk between Dr.
Wernher von Braum, other scientists,
and Alexander Satin, head of the
Office of Naval Research, initiated
another space satellite program. On
January 20, 1955, the proposed pro-
gram was submitted to Assistant Sec-

Each member of each pledge class of
Tau Beta Pi, the national honor society
for engineering men, is required to write
an essay as one of his projects. This essay
was judged the best one submitted by this
fall's pledge class.
The laboratory course has been a
target of much criticism from the
engineering student. In light of this,
I would like to examine what makes
the lab such an integral part of an
engineering education, what pur-
poses it is supposed to serve, and
whether or not it serves them. Of ne-
cessity I can only draw from my ex-
perience here at the University of
Michigan, but I suspect the conditions
here prevail elsewhere also.
The purposes of the lab are three-
fold. One of the original purposes was
to acquaint the student with the ma-
chinery that was related to the ma-
terial that was presented in lecture.
This is necessary since it is difficult
to grasp the actual construction of a
machine without actually seeing and
using it. A second purpose is to allow
the student to perform calculations
that are not directly connected with
the concepts presented in lecture, but
that arise in practical applications of
these concepts. Calculations such as
machine efficiencies, structural
strengths, etc., could not be handled
in lectures without digressions that
would interrupt the normal flow of
teaching. The third purpose is that
of organizing the information and
presenting it in an effective way. This
is accomplished by means of a report
in which the student compiles and
reduces the data and presents his re-
sults with suitable remarks on the out-
come of the experiment.
The laboratory attempts to accomp-
lish these aims in approximately one
hour of a three or four hour course
and is organized as follows. The stu-
dents are given a write-up of an ex-
periment in which the procedure of
the experiment and the method of
data reduction is outlined. The stu-
dents, or in some cases the instructor,
perform the experiment and record
the data. The students then reduce
the data and present it in a report.
I contend that under the present
organization the least important of
these purposes are overemphasized
and the most important is pushed in-
to obscurity. The present-day empha-
sis in engineering education is on
developing tools of analysis to solve
problems that have or will have prac-
tical applications. 1 do not mean to
imply that the performing of calcula-
tions has no place in present-day
engineering, but rather that they
have become subordinate to analysis
of problems. This is especially true
since the advent of computors.
The performing of calculations is
something that teaches very little
after the method of solving has been
established. On the other hand, eval-
uating the data and writing a clear
concise report develops the analytical
powers of the student. Unfortunately,
both the calculations and the report
require a large amount of time that
is completely out of proportion to the
scholastic credit received from the lab.
This imbalance leads to the predict-
able result that once the results have
been obtained, little time is spent on
the report. The report many times
may consist of no more than a few
obvious comments about the results
and a half-hearted attempt at error
analysis.
The answer to this misplaced em-
phasis is quite obvious and indeed
some schools (MIT for example) and
at least one department in our own
university (Engineering Mechanics)
have taken steps in this direction. In
the freshman and sophomore years
there should be two or three labs,
including those offered in physics,
which emphasize individual use of
equipment and the orderly reducing
of data. In the junior and senior
years, the labs should not be attached
to the lecture courses as is presently
done. Each department should de-
velop a two to three hour lab course
to correspond to each important
phase of instruction (e.g., aerodynam-
ics, propulsion, and structures in
aero), at least one and possibly all of
which would be required for gradua-
tion. These courses should be com-
posed of about three experiments
and the students should be given a
choice of several problems to be
solved for their three experiments. An
indication of the possible methods of
attack should be mentioned and some
time should be devoted to the design
of experiments. Also, some time
should be spent discussing the writing
of reports and the presentation of
data.
If this plan were followed, organ-
izing and performing calculations
would be important, but would not
become overbearing. Also, an even
better familiarization with the equip-
ment would take place since it would
be necessary to determine the proper
equipment to carry out the experi-
ment. Most important, the emphasis
would be placed on the resourceful-
ness of the student and his ability to
present his results.

John LaCost wanted a part in scientific progress

He has it at Western Electric
John LaCost received his B.S.E.E. from the University
of Illinois in 1962. One of the factors which influenced
him to join Western Electric was the quick manner in
which new engineers become operational.
During the short time John has been with us, he
has worked in several areas which are vital to the
nation's communications complex. And with his future
development in mind, John attended one of our Grad-
uate Engineer Training Centers where he studied the
front-line Electronic Switching System. He is current-
ly working as a systems equipment engineer on such
projects as crossbar switching and line link pulsing.
John's future at Western Electric looks promising
indeed. He knows he will be working with revolutionary
and advanced engineering concepts like electronic
switching, thin film circuitry, computer-controlled
production lines and microwave systems. He is also
aware of the continued opportunity for advanced study
through the company-paid Tuition Refund Plan, as
well as through company training centers.
How do you see your future? If you have high per-

Our world-recognized trademark—"the P&amp;WA eagle"—has been
identified with progress in flight propulsion for almost four decades,
spanning the evolution of power from yesterday's reciprocating
engines to today's rockets. Tomorrow will find that same Pratt &amp;
Whitney Aircraft eagle carrying men and equipment to the moon and
to even more distant reaches of outer space.
Engineering achievement of this magnitude is directly traceable to
our conviction that basic and applied research is essential to healthy
progress. Today's engineers at Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft accept no
limiting criteria. They are moving ahead in many directions to advance
our programs in energy conversion for every environment
Our progress on current programs is exciting, for it anticipates the
challenges of tomorrow. We are working, for example, in such areas
as advanced gas turbines ... rocket engines ... fuel cells ... nuclear
power—all opening up new avenues of exploration in every field of
aerospace, marine and industrial power application.
The breadth of Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft programs requires virtually every tech-
nical talent... requires ambitious young engineers and scientists who can con-
tribute to our advances of the state of the art. Your degree? It can be a B.S., M.S.

EDUCATION
AND

by Paul Niffenegger
1-
Bio-Engineering
As it goes into its second year of
operation, there are now 11 graduate
students in The University of Michi-
gan program in bio-engineering. In-
terest is wide and increasing in the
new program. Presently, ten under-
graduate students enrolled in the de-
partments of chemical, mechanical,
industrial and science engineering are
known to be preparing for admission
to the program.
Associate Dean Glenn V. Edmon-
son of the College of Engineering,
outlined three reasons that such
courses as Michigan's have been set
up, and why there is this interest in
them. First the engineer has evolved
in his competence to understanding
"complex, non-linear systems that are
always in a state of transient behav-
ior"—such as living systems. Also,
rapid advances have occurred in elec-
tronic instrumentation which has en-
couraged the biologist to accelerate
his research. For the design of such
instruments, engineers who under-
stand the biologist's approach are
required. Finally, the "immediate
pressures of our man-in-space projects
have stimulated a very close collabor-
ation between the engineer, the med-
ical doctor, the physiologist and the
psychologist that few other projects
in the past have fostered."
To support such an educational
program complementary research is
required. These projects indicate the
range of such research and interests
in bioengineering activities: (1) A
U-M civil engineer whose specialty is
hydraulics is doing research on the
cardiovascular system with a physi-
ologist and a surgeon. Their topic is
pulsed How and pressure through dis-
tensible tubes. (2) Some mechanical
engineers at the U-M have been doing
research in orthetics anil prosthetics
for a number of years. (3) Chemical
engineers have been engaged in re-
search on the chemical processes of
the physiological system, and on bac-
teriological problems of food process-
ing and drug manufacturing. (4) In-
dustrial engineers have studied hos-
pital management problems, and a
noted group in the U-M School of
Dentistry has done basic research on
materials—an engineering type of
activity.
Such research has received emphasis
because these are the types of activity
that would be first to develop in pro-
fessional pursuits. Among other such
opportunities on the horizon, Edmun-
son saw "problems associated with in-
creasingly acute environmental condi-
tions caused by air and water pollut-
ants." These will be solved, he said,
"when the bioengineer, the atmos-
pheric scientist, and biologist pool
their talents." As a result of the new
interest and efforts, proposals for new
research can be expected to be "pro-
vocative—even shocking."
Phase-Shiff Amplifier
A new type of radio amplifier for
use in the higher frequencies—such
as UHF—has been devised by a Uni-
versity of Michigan electrical engi-
neer, David K. Adams of the U-M
Cooley Electronics Laboratory. His
wide-band phase-shift amplifier differs
from others of its type in that it is
more stable and tends to stay accur-
ately tuned—and in that it is useful
over much more of the radio spec-
trum than conventional amplifiers
(from which it gets its "wide-band"
designation). Advantage of this ampli-
fier over others is that it can be used
to get nearly noise-free (static-free)
amplification over such an extremely

used through TV bands up to micro-
wave communications frequencies.
Adams developed the amplifier fol-
lowing the successful introduction of
a component called a "varactor" in
UHF amplifiers over the past five
years. A varactor is a solid-state diode,
—described as "half a transistor"—
which has a relatively noise-free re-
gion of operation. Development of
the varactor has permitted much bet-
ter radar performance since it over-
comes the noise problem to a large
extetu—the noise in this case being
comparable to "snow" on TV screen.
Other amplifiers have been devel-
oped based on the varactor, but these
—called "parametric amplifiers"—do
not have the wide-band or stability
advantage of the "phase shift" ampli-
fier. The basic difference between the
two is the circuitry which employs the
varactor. The principle of the phase-
shift amplifier is very basic and had
been outlined by a man named Alex-
anderson in 1916, but his application
did not deal with amplification. The
theory's use for this purpose occurred
only with the development of the
varactor.
Germs in the "Spotlight"

faint pin-pricks of light in the blue-
green field of a $3,000 microscope. In
this setting University of Michigan
researchers are seeking new ways to
speed the identification of diseases,
particularly those where prompt rec-
ognition is crucial to successful treat-
ment. The key element in their stud-
ies are those pin-pricks of light: they
are "fluorescent antibodies" wrapping
their telltale glittering overcoat
around disease-causing viruses, para-
sites and fungi.
An organism called "E. coli" shines
like stars on a winter night. It causes
deadly infantile diarrhea. Until re-
cently, it took scientists nearly three
weeks to make a positive identifica-
tion of rabies. Under the mercury arc,
it can be spotted in 30 minutes.

worm-like chain. When it appears,
doctors can immediately start treat-

techniques.
professor of epidemiology at the U-M
School of Public Health. The tech-
nique is one of the newest scientific
methods for probing man's illnesses.
According to Eveland, about 800 pro-
fessional papers describe all that is
known about the use of fluorescent
antibodies, and virtually all of these
have been written since 1957. "The
technique," he says, "has opened an
exploding field of clinical and re-
search applications, and its limits are
not yet in sight."
The University of Michigan work
has largely centered on applications
for whooping cough and meningitis.
Recognition of these ills took four to
five days under previous methods. Dr.
Eveland and his associates reduced
that to 30 minutes.
In preparing to run tests for a par-
ticular disease, the researchers prepare
an animal "anti-serum" for that spe-
cific disease. This anti-serum, given
the chance, will now glue itself to the
organism which causes that disease,
and to nothing else. Next, the re-
searchers take a fluorescent dye (fluor-
scein isothiocyante) and chemically
hook it onto the anti-serum. If the
disease is meningitis, for example, a
drop of the patient's spinal fluid is
placed on a glass slide and mixed
with the anti-serum and its hitch-
hiking fire-fly.
Some 20 minutes later, the excess
serum is washed ofT, the slide placed
in the microscope and the mercury
arc turned on. A telltale glow shows
the anti-serum has glued itself to its
specific target. The patient has men-
ingitis.
The U-M researchers are currently
developing tests for listeriosis and
toxacara canis, two diseases which
affect both humans and dogs. The test
for listeriosis has already proved its
value to a patient recently admitted
to University Hospital. Doctors had
made a preliminary diagnosis of can-

ce|ls, and a sample of the tissue went
to the School of Public Health for
fluorescent antibody tests. When they
tried the anti-serum of listeriosis,
glittering specks appeared under the
microscope. Doctors immediately star-
ted treatment for this new disease,
and the patient recovered. Further in-
vestigation showed he had contacted
the disease from his dog.
One reason listeriosis is of growing
concern at the U-M: national figures
have shown that 10 per cent of all
cases in humans occur in the stale of
Michigan. Hopefully, this unwanted
distinction will be soon eliminated
by the fluorescent detective work go-
ing on in the light of the mercury
lamp.
Glass Studies
Man has used glass from prehistoric
times, but until recently his uses re-
mained relatively unchanged, and his
means of making it basically the same
as a hundred years ago. Only recently
has research on glass been undertaken
to increase understanding of its basic
properties. And from this understand-
ing have come a number of new uses
for this ancient material. These in-
clude a radiation-resistant glass used
for windows in nuclear energy experi-
ment cells, a photosensitive glass for
making photographs, and a current-
carrying glass useful for making heat-
ing utensils without wire elements.
The latest use for glass, called im-
possible three years ago, is as a ma-
terial for lasers—the device which can
amplify and regulate light wraves.
To further the new understanding
of glass and its properties, The Uni-
versity of Michigan is entering a co-
operative research program with the
Owens-Illinois Glass Company. Under
this program which is directed by
Prof. Chihiro Kikuchi of nuclear ma-
terials research, a Ph.D. candidate in
the U-M nuclear engineering depart-
ment, Sophocles Karavelas, of Greece,
will carry out the investigation with a
fellowship provided by the company
for the purpose. Not only will the
U-M program be directed at finding
new properties of glass, it also will try
to provide experimental evidence for
a basic tenet of magnetism theory
called the "one electron problem."
Glass normally is made of silicates,
like sand, and a few other minerals.
The newer glasses have tapped for the

With this device, University of Michigan nuclear engineers are studying the basic
properties of new types of glass. A sample of the glass is placed between the
poles of a large magnet, and sends out an electromagnet signal that, when de-
fected and measured by this instrument, reveals the properties of the structure.
Prof. Chihiro Kikuchi (seated) asks doctoral student Sophocles Karavelas about
progress of the research.
basic material a number of elements!
similar to silicon. These include tin,
germanium, and titanium. Like sili-
con, these are combined with oxygen
to make up the basic glass structure.
Prof. Kikuchi and Mr. Karavelas
want to find just how each of these
elements fit together with and in re-
lation to oxygen in the crystal struc-
ture of the glass. To do this, they will
use a similar element, vanadium, as
a "probe" by substituting it in the
crystal structure for some of the tin,
titanium or germanium atoms. "Van-
adium serves well as a 'probe'," Prof.
Kikuchi says, "because it is sensitive
to the arrangement of atoms about
it." Sometimes it is surrounded by six
oxygen atoms; in other states, only
four. Prof. Kikuchi and Karavelas will
begin by seeking information about
the change from the six-oxygen to the
four-oxygen stage.
The property of vanadium which
yields the message about these slates
is called electron spin resonance. Elec-
trons spin as they orbit in different
shell groups around each nucleus of
the vanadium atom (and all other
atoms), and in doing so give off elec-
tromagnetic energy, a form of radio
signal. In the different states, the
quantity of energy they yield is differ-
ent, so that measuring the energy and
its changes will give the investigators
the information they need.
Here is where the theory of mag-
netism will receive a basic test. Re-
lated to electrons in magnetic sub-
stances, the theory has been proved
experimentally for the cases of two
or more electrons in a given orbit or
shell around the nucleus of an atom.
But it has never been tested for its
most fundamental case, that of one
electron in a shell (called in this case
the three-d-one configuration—which
means one electron in the shell named
3-d). This is the "one election prob-
lem of magnetism."

Superconductive Computer Memory
Pictured above is a radically new type of
thin film superconductive array capable of
storing 16,384 bits of data in an area smaller
than a playing card. This array is a step toward
a high-speed all electronic memoryof hundreds
of millions or billions of bits, which is a
storage capacity now attainable only in slow
electromechanical devices.
The structure becomes superconducting with
its immersion in liquid helium; two pulses of
positive or negative electric current are sent
through the selection trees to a selected inter-
section. Their combined effect at the chosen in-
tersection produces a "normal" or non-super-
conducting area in the tin layer directly beneath.
When this occurs, a microscopic ring of
electric current is induced and instantly trapped
in the tin at this point. As the pulses cease,
the area again becomes superconductive, and
the stored current remains, moving in its micro-
scopic circle in either a clockwise or counter-
clockwise direction according to the positive
or negative character of the pulses that induced
it. In computer language, this stored current
represents one bit of information—a "zero"
or a "one," depending upon its direction.
When the information is to be recalled by
the computer, two pulses are again sent to
the same intersection. If their polarity (positive
or negative) is the same as that of the stored
current, nothing happens. If it is opposite, the
direction of the stored current will be reversed
and a read out voltage will be induced in a
simple box-like structure extending under the
whole memory plane. The presence or absence
of this signal is part of a code which is deci-
phered electronically to obtain the desired
information.

Sun-Pumped Continuous Laser

Laser (optical-maser) action has been
achieved in CaF»:Dy'+ at liquid neon tem-
perature (27° K) using the sun as the pumping
source. The minimum power required to obtain
laser oscillations could be supplied with a
10-inch-diametcr condensing mirror. Laser
action at liquid-nitrogen temperature is antici-
pated using a 20-inch-diametcr condensing
mirror.
Laser action in the CaFi:Dy,+ system was
reported at 2.36 microns. The laser oscillation
takes place in the sharp SL —&gt;- Ha 4f-4f
transitions, and it is pumped in broad 4f - Sd
absorption bands starting at 10,000 cm-1 and
extending throughout the visible region of the
spectrum. The low pulsed laser threshold, the
long lifetime (10 msec for a 0.05 molar %
Dy!+ in CaFi) and the convenient location of
the broad pumping bands of this system make
it especially suitable forsun-pumped operation.
The photograph shows the experimental
arrangement. A 1-inch long, '/S-mch-by-'/s-inch
cross-section CaFi: 0.05 M % Dy&gt;+ laser
crystal is placed in a dewar filled with liquid
neon just outside the focal point of a 14-inch
spherical mirror. The dewar was wrapped with
aluminum foil except for the area of illumi-
nation to insure better optical coupling.
From the known values of the pulsed laser
threshold at 27° K and at 78° K, we estimate
that a 20-inch-diameter condensing mirror will
be sufficient to operate the laser at liquid
nitrogen temperature. Experiments using much
larger mirrors are in progress to evaluate the
high power output capabilities of the sun-
pumped laser.

Beam Plasma
An experimental RCA tube which may open
new communication and radar channels near
the frequencies of infrared light is shown being
prepared for test at RCA Laboratories. The
device uses the interaction of an electron beam
with a cesium plasma to amplify 23 Gc micro-
wave power.
The device consists, basically, of an electron
gun, input and output helixes and a cesium
plasma. The gun sends an electron beam
through the input helix where the input signal
impresses a space-charge wave on the beam.
The beam then traverses a three centimeter
length of plasma. The plasma is generated by
a cesium Pcnning-type arc. The resonant fre-
quency of the plasma electrons, which is pro-
portional to the square root of the plasma
density, is set equal to the signal frequency.
Interaction occurs between the space-charge
wave and the plasma oscillations which results
in an amplification of the space-charge wave.
In the above tube, power in the space-charge
wave is amplified ten thousand times. The

amplified signal is delivered to the load by the
output helix as the beam passes through the
helix.

Are you interested in a career in management?
The key words are "career" and "management."
The Bethlehem Loop Course is designed not to place a
man in a job, but to start a man on a career. Although we
have a specific initial job assignment in mind for every
man we recruit for the Loop Course, that assignment is
just the first step toward increasing levels of responsibility.
The Bethlehem Loop Course is designed to train men for
management. We select men whom we feel have the po-
tential; we start them out with an intensive five weeks'
course that gives them a comprehensive knowledge of the
Company's operations; we follow this up with a training
program at the facility or within the department to which
he is first assigned. A steel plant man, for instance, will
be given general plant training for a number of weeks; a
sales looper trains for a full year before he starts actual
selling.
Think it over. It should be abundantly clear that we
have a big stake in our loopers. We do everything in our
power to assure that you make good progress—the rest
is up to you.
If you are interested in a career in management with
one of the nation's largest and most dynamic industrial

The Technic Spotlights:

mechanical engineering
1958
In order to increase student awareness of the opportunities
available for engineers in industry, the Technic has initialed
this feature on University of Michigan engineering graduates.
This month we spotlight Seal Ji. Robbins, an employee of
Burroughs Corporation.

Neal R. Robbins is one "M" engineering graduate
who is 'going far' professionally yet lives and works
within 20 miles of our beloved campus, which over the
years has prepared countless other engineers of solid
achievement. Neal, who graduated from the University
of Michigan College of Engineering in February 1958
with a BSME, is a project engineer with Burroughs
Corporation's Plymouth Manufacturing and Engineering
Division at Plymouth, Michigan.
During his last two years on campus Robbins worked
as a student assistant in Engineering Materials serving
as engineering assistant at the University's Engineering
Research Institute. This latter function provided valu-
able experience in investigative processes, centering for
Neal on a study of electrostatic sprays.
In April 1958, Neal joined Burroughs as an engineer-
ing assistant. Working with experienced engineers and
designers he learned company standards and design prac-
tices and applied these, along with his college training,
to the analysis and design of the intricate mechanisms
used in high speed business machines.
Neal was promoted to design engineer and assigned
to an engineering development department in 1959. In
this assignment his area of responsibility was broadened
to include a complete machine rather than individual
mechanisms.
One of his contributions during this period was the
development of an improved document feeder for a
magnetically encoded document processing system. The
system requires mechanically feeding a ledger with bal-
ance information recorded on magnetic stripes over a
magnetic head so that information can be accumulated.
Furthermore, accuracy is of prime importance; this is a
banking application. Careful analysis of the problem
and a genuinely creative approach to the solution re-
sulted in a significant improvement in the product which
is now in daily use all over the world.
Neal's professional growth has led to more responsi-
bility. In his present assignment as project engineer he
is called upon to supervise a new product design from
inception through the prototype model phase to release
for manufacture. Success in the rapidly changing business
machine industry depends on having the right product
at the right time at the right price, and the project
engineer plays a vital role in this success. Design must be
reliable and manufacturing cost targets must be met;
maintaining schedule is vital. To achieve all this requires
many decisions and adjustments.
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


As a project engineer Neal communicates with pro-
duct planning, manufacturing engineering, and the other
activities concerned with a new product. In addition,
he is often called upon to make presentations of his de-
signs to top corporate management personnel. Combin-
ing a variety ol skills, he is able to sense as well as select
those details which cause engineering problems. He also
uses a creative mind, and displays an enthusiasm which
suggests strong self-motivation.
Mr. Robbins has several patent actions in process on
various devices related to paper handling mechanisms.
Realizing how rapidly the business machine field is now
moving, Neal periodically refreshes himself in engineer-
ing basics through professional engineering refresher
courses. He is presently pursuing a math scries in prepa-
ration for resuming study for his M.S. degree. Neal has
completed two of the three requirements for registration
by the State of Michigan as a Professional Engineer.
Neal and Janet Robbins were married in the Summer
of 1956; are now the parents of three children. The
family's home is in nearby Ypsilanti where Neal serves
as Secretary to the Vestry of St. Mark's Lutheran Church.
He is also Chairman of the Republican Committee of
Ypsilanti Township. Robbins is a member of the De-
troit Section, American Society of Mechanical Engi-
neers.

High-speed photography often assists in the analysis of business machine engineering problems encountered by Robbins
and his associates at Burroughs.

tomer a number of application programs tailored especially for banks, savings and loan institutions, retail establishments,
insurance companies, hospitals, transportation firms and educational institutions.

retary of Defense in Charge of Re-
search and Development and was sent
on to the President of the United
States. But, just as the plans for
this project were underway, it was
scrapped in favor of the Vanguard
Project and everything had to be re-
organized. Then, after Vanguard
failed on the launching pad, the pro-
gram was given back to Dr. von
Braun, and the Explorer satellite was
launched. As John Gunther states it,
"failure in the United States was
caused by indifference to research,
rivalries between the services, faulty
leadership, lack of engineering per-
sonnel, stereotyped ideas about old
fashioned air power, and fear of
spending money."
Conclusion
Who is to blame? There probably
is no real answer. The American pub-
lic failed to realize Russia's potential.
Perhaps they are the most to blame,
but the reasons were many. Are we
still behind in the space race? One
doesn't like to think that we are, but
then some of us never thought that
we were in the first place. In any cir-
cumstance, the American people are
no longer so ready to say that they
are on top. And, our space research is
moving ahead at a rate which is vastly
greater than it has ever been moving
before.

be applied to all labs, but certainly it is applicable to some.
I feel that the student does not benefit from laboratory work
as much as he might. My suggestion would be to give students
more responsibility in the design and setting up of experi-
ments, and less work in menial data-taking and time-consum-
ing computation. To design an experiment to investigate some
phenomena is analogous to the industry situations where the
engineer is asked to investigate a process by testing. There-
fore, the design of lab experiment would serve as a useful in-
troduction to this practical problem.
In attempting to evaluate the strengths, 1 have asked my-
self, "Why is the engineering education which I have received
at Michigan better than one which I could have received else-
where? What is there about Michigan that has helped me to
receive an added measure in my education?" I have arrived
at two answers; Michigan has excellent facilities and excellent
teaching talent.
The facilities at this university are probably unique in
their scope and quality. The laboratories and the equipment,
the computers, and the libraries are but a few facilities which
immediately come to mind. The availability of these facilities
enhances the undergraduate education making it one of the
best offered in this country.
The instructors and the professors who teach here at Mich-
igan are truly high caliber individuals. Not only are these men
competent in their fields of specialization and able to convey
their vast knowledge to their students, but equally important,
they are devoted teachers—men willing to go out of their way
to help students to learn engineering.
In conclusion, I have tried to present what I consider an
evaluation of Michigan's system of engineering education. I
am aware that my own experiences have flavored this evalua-
tion to a large extent, and it must therefore be read with this
fact in mind. At any rate, I have tried to be constructive in
my criticism and honest in my discussion of the strong points.
Truly Michigan has a fine engineering college, and I have
appreciated the opportunity to study here. My memories of
the university and of the College of Engineering are fond
ones, and I shall cherish them always. It is my hope that in
this editorial I have presented something of merit and value
to those who have given so much to me.

At this printing, the Teclinir is in a process of change—the
old editors are giving way to the new editors who are preparing
to assume their positions for the coming year. A smooth staff
switch-over can be a good shot in the arm to a student publi-
cation, and we are fortunate to have continuing many of our
senior editors who can guide the magazine through this diffi-
cult transition.
I would like to offer my personal congratulations to the
new staff and to the new junior and senior editors. I am
pleased to see such a fine energetic and enthusiastic group
taking over.
Finally, I would like to express my appreciation to all of

THE COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING

OCEANOGRAPHY
Oceanography is that branch of the geophysical sciences which deals with the water and its environment on
the planet Earth. The oceanographer is concerned with the description and explanation of natural phenomena
in all water bodies ranging from small streams and lakes to the largest ocean on the earth. He studies further
the interaction between the water and the solid earth below it and the atmosphere above it. The science of
oceanography is thus of considerable breadth. In addition to the physical, chemical and biological aspects of
water and its motion, it is a!so related to the geological aspects of the bottom sedimentation and the exchange
of heat, moisture, and momentum with the atmosphere.
The educational program in Oceanography at the University of Michigan involves, in addition to the
basic oceanographic studies, an integrated program of study in chemistry, physics and mathematics, fluid
dynamics and thermodynamics, meteorology and the humanities. The laboratory instruction is closely integrated
with the classroom. Many of the students have additional opportunities to enrich their education by partici-
pating in research work during their undergraduate and graduate studies in connection with the research pro-
grams conducted on the Great Lakes, and carried out from the four ships belonging to the Great Lakes Re-
search Division. These research ships are equipped with modern oceanographic and meteorological instrumen-
tation, and contain laboratories for chemical and biological analysis as well as electronics laboratories.
The objective of the educational program is to provide the environment which will enable students to solve
the important problems connected with water resources, and the greater dependence of humanity on processes
in the oceans.

TURN OUT THE LIGHTS AND PRESS THE BUTTON
No preconceptions, please. Too often they point you
away from the buried treasure. Because Kodak is
properly known as a grand place for chemical engineers
and chemists, fledgling electronic engineers may over-
look us. All the better for those who don't. Particularly
for those who would rather apply ideas than dream
them, unfashionable as candor compels us to sound.
It takes all kind of electronic engineers to make to-
day's world, but we think we clearly see the ones likely
to wind up nearer the helm here 25 years hence:
When his projects are evaluated, he'd rather be right
than ahead of his time.
He works few if any miracles with sealing wax, old
shoestring, and new developments in plasma harmonics,
but when they turn off the lights in the big darkroom,
his machine from the very first crack starts inspecting,
processing, or otherwise handling light-sensitive prod-
uct smoothly, bugless, and at the miraculous rates he
had promised in the preliminary design report. He ac-
complishes this by keeping abreast of the state of his
art instead of considering his diploma an exemption
from learning anything new.
He deals with people as smoothly as with things.
He would rather put his roots down in the community
where he lives than root himself in one narrow box of
engineering specialization. He welcomes changes of pace
more than of place.
He finds it cozy to know that if times change, our
diversification leaves dozens of directions to go without
fighting the cold world outside.
Care to talk to us? Above remarks apply to more than
just electronic engineers.

COULD YOU OUT-THINK A COMPETITOR?
Consider a Career
in Technical Marketing
Q. Mr. Smith, I know engineering plays a role in the design and manufacture
of General Electric products, but what place is there for an engineer in
marketing?
A. For certain exceptionally talented individuals, a career in technical market-
ing offers extraordinary opportunity. You learn fast what the real needs of
customers are, under actual industrial conditions. You are brought face-to-face
with the economic realities of business. You participate in some of the most
exciting strategic work in the world: planning how to out-engineer and out-sell
competitors for a major installation.
Q. Sounds exciting. But I've worked hard for my technical degree. I'm worried
that if I go into marketing, I won't use it.
A. Don't worry—you'll use all the engineering you've learned, and you'll go
on learning for the rest of your life. In fact, you'll have to. You see, the basic
purpose of business is to sense changing customer needs, and then marshal
resources to meet them profitably. That means that you must learn to know
each customer's operations and needs almost as well as he understands them
himself. And with competitors trying their best to outdo you, believe me—
every bit of knowledge and skill you've got will be called into play.
O. Is that why you said you wanted "exceptionally talented people"?
A. Technical marketing is not everybody's dish of tea. It takes great personal
drive and energy, and a talent for managing the work of others in concert with
your own. It takes flexibility . . . imagination . . . ingenuity . . . quick reflexes
. . . leadership qualities. If you're nervous with people or upset by quick-
changing situations, I don't think technical marketing's for you. But if you are
excited by competition, like to help others solve technical problems, and enjoy
seeing your technical work put to the test of real operation—then you may be
one of the ambitious men we're looking for.
Q. Now what, actually, does a man do in technical marketing?
A. Let me describe a typical situation in General Electric. A field sales
engineer is in regular contact with his customers. Let's say one of them makes
an inquiry, or the sales engineer senses that the time is right for a proposition.
With his field application engineer, he determines the basic equipment needed.
Then he contacts the marketing sales specialist in the G-E department that
manufactures that equipment. The sales specialist, working closely with his
department's product engineers, specifies an exact design—realistic in function
and cost. Then the sales engineer and his supporting team try to make the
sale, changing and improving the proposition as they get cues from the competi-
tive situation. If the sale is made—a very satisfying moment—then the installa-
tion and service engineers install the equipment and are responsible for its
operation and repair. With the exception of the product design engineers, all
these people are in technical marketing. Exciting work, all of it.
Q. In college we learn engineering theory. How do we get the sales and busi-
ness knowledge you mentioned?
A. At General Electric, a solid, well tested program of educational courses will
quickly advance both your engineering knowledge and your sales capacities.
But perhaps even more important, you'll be assigned to work with some of the
crack sales engineers and application and installation men in the world, and
that's no exaggeration. A man grows fast when he's on the sales firing line. As
a FORTUNE writer once put it, the industrial sales engineer needs "that prime
combination of technical savvy, tactical agility, and unruffled persuasiveness."

Even at 3 in the morning... commuter service every 2 minutes
Urban planners figure the only way to solve the big-cky traffic jams is to develop some
method of mass transit that will be so frequent, so fast, so convenient that people will turn to it
as their No. i choice, as they did years ago. The key to this kind of rider convenience is a
computer-controlled system.
Westinghouse has developed such a system. It is called the Transit Expressway. It looks so
promising the government has approved a demonstration project near Pittsburgh, through the Port
Authority of Allegheny County.
The system uses its own private roadway. Silent, rubber-tired, comfortable vehicles will
operate on the two-minute schedule, day and night. A computer will schedule as many as 12 of these
cars together into a train during peak periods. You can be sure... if it's Westinghouse.

What makes a Company "Modern":
p
Not size. Not capital resources. Certainly not
age. At Celanese, we believe it is the degree to
which a company is equipped to meet the present
and future needs of its customers.
Efficient plant. Contemporary product. Aggres-
sive management. Industrious work force. The
ability to think ahead of the situation and be ready
for the problem when it occurs.
Celanese happens to be a young company. Much
more important, it's a modern company.
Perhaps you're among the men who will help
keep us modern. If you are trained in chemical
engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical
engineering, chemistry, or physics, we hope you
will stop in to see our representative when he
visits your campus. Or write directly to us, briefly
outlining your background.

ANOTHER VOID IN TECHNICAL EDUCATION
Americans were awakened by Sputnik as they were by
Pearl Harbor. This time it was an inadequate space program
which they found. The realization that someone besides the
United States could develop the technology required to shoot
oversized arrows into the air was incomprehensible. Crash
programs were initiated to make up for the lost time.
The result was a demand for scientists and engineers
which had never been anticipated. We did not have the
supply to meet this demand nor did it appear that we would
have in the relatively near future. Result: Increased demand
for the available personnel and increased efforts to divert
youth toward space related fields.
The nation's colleges and universities reviewed their
technical curricula to determine how they might best fill
this manpower gap. A considerable "beefing-up" of these
programs was found to be necessary. More meat was added.
Requirements for admission were raised.
Once enrolled, the new student was not disappointed.
His preconceptions of hard work were well-founded. He found
that competition, based on a no-holds-barred fight for an
Almighty Grade Point, was all that he had expected, and
more. Result: We are turning out many educated amoebas.
The nation is told that the increased tensions and frus-
trations of youth have led to the degeneration of moral
standards. This may be one side effect of the curricula
changes, but the loss of constructive aggressiveness and inia-
tive is just as important. Many students, confronted with the
pressures of competition and difficult coursework, are content
to withdraw into little niches like moles to study constantly.
Rising to the occasion is fine, but this is a little extreme.
Others, attempting to project an image of diligent study, are
actually just marking time until they graduate with unim-
pressive records. Some students are either extremely motivated
to study or not motivated at all.
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


These students graduate without a complete education.
Why? Because they do not participate in extracurricular activi-
ties which offer training grounds for the development of many
talents useful in later careers. There is no substitute. The
lessons must be learned first hand—they can be found no-
where else in school.
The pat excuse for not participating is lack of time.
Although the burden of time is indeed great, it is doubtful
that it is a truly valid argument. Some students who lack
personal organization, efficiency, or discipline do not have
time but easily could have. Others do not have any initiative
or desire to do anything but develop large posteriors while
hiding behind their books. In either case the problem seems
to be a lack of aggressiveness to get out and do something
constructive which is not directly connected to academics.
Educators have recognized a lack of well-roundedness and
depth in today's technical education. They are attempting to
swing the pendulum back so that students of these programs
are acquainted with Keates as well as kinetics and are in-
spired by Ghandis as well as Einsteins. It should be swung
just a little further so that more students realize that the
knowledge available through non-academic activities will
assist them in developing tools which will prove most valuable
to them.

THE lOOOOO-MILE
ENGINEERING TEST
THAT SET OVER 100
NEW WORLD RECORDS
It began September 21 in Florida, when a team of four
1964 Comets, specially equipped and prepared for
high-speed driving, set out to do the equivalent of four
earth orbits at Daytona International Speedway—100,000
miles at speeds well over 100 miles an hour, round
the clock for 40 days, through weather fair and foul.
They did it, all four of them, and they made history!
They did it in the full glare of publicity. In semi-tropical
heat. In the teeth of torrential squalls that fringed two
hurricanes. Including time out for refueling and mainte-
nance, the lead car averaged over 108 miles an hour,
toppling over 100 national and world records!*
For all practical purposes this was an engineering trial
—the most grueling test of staying power and durability
ever demanded of a new car. Only near perfection
could stand the punishment dished out to parts and
components hour after hour, mile after mile. Brakes,
engines, transmissions, ignition systems—every single
part a pawn in a grim game of truth or consequence,
with total product quality the stake. And they all came
through hands down!
Now that it's over and in the record books, what does
it mean? New proof of Ford-built stamina and dura-
bility! New evidence that Ford-built means better built!
Yes—and more, it is a direct reflection of the confidence
and creative know-how, the spirit and spunk of Ford
Motor Company's engineering, styling and manufac-
turing team—men who find rewarding adventure in
technical breakthroughs.

an engineering material
by Prof. Stephen B. Preston
Wood has been used as a structural
material since the dawn of civilization.
Long before the discovery of even the
most elementary scientific principles
provided a basis for engineering, man
relied heavily on wood for his homes,
ships, vehicles, bridges and other
structures dependent for their utility
on the physical and mechanical be-
havior of the material from which
they were fabricated. Today, in an
era of scientific sophistication which
has led to a nearly infinite array of
materials with many spectacular pro-
perties, wood may escape the attention
of the modern engineer. It is of sig-
nificance to note, however, that we
are now using more wood than ever
before in history and economists pre-
dict that this use will increase in the
future. Of the ten billion cubic feet
produced annually in this country
alone, it is estimated that nearly
three-fourths is used where physical
and mechanical behavior is of pri-
mary importance, and a high percent-
age of this is in some form of engi-
neered structure. As the world's only
renewable material with structural
potential, wood may be expected to
have increased engineering import-
ance in the future.
Approximately half of the wood we
use yearly is converted first into 35
billion board feet of lumber from
which to build three-quarters of our
houses, fabricated laminated arches
with spans in excess of 300 feet, con-
struct miles of railroad and highway
bridges, make decking for railroad
cars and highway trailers, and pro-
duce most of our household furniture,
to list but a few examples of its appli-
cation. Some five percent is manu-
factured into over ten billion square
feet of plywood which provides the
stressed skins for panels used for floor
and roof systems, the gussets for lum-
ber trusses, and critical parts of nu-
merous other components. It is also
used widely for sheathing, sub-floor-
ing, sub-roofing, and both decorative
and structural interior panels in
building construction. Even paper,
which accounts for one-fourth of the
wood we consume, is being used in
the form of impregnated honeycomb
as a core material for light weight,
stressed-skin panels. Fiber- and par-
ticle-board products are ever increas-
ing in importance on the engineering
scene.
In solid and modified form, wood
provides the engineer with economy,
versatility of use, and ease of fabrica-
tion unknown to other materials.
Additionally, it combines favorable
physical and mechanical properties
that cannot be duplicated by man. Its
efficient utility, however, is dependent
upon a knowledge of its unique char-
acteristics controlled by nature which
enables one to take fullest advantage
of its favorable properties. Although
wood at first may appear to defy con-
trol and predictability, knowledge
now available makes it a manageable
material, and additional information
is continuously being developed. The
purpose of this paper is to summarize
certain unusual aspects of wood be-
havior which influence its utility as
an engineering material.
What Is Wood
Wood is a highly complex aggrega-
tion of hollow, tubular cells, consist-
ing largely of cellulose, which are
cemented together with ligin (Fig. 1).
Most of the cells are vertically elon-
gated and of highly variable diameter
and length. In the softwoods (needle-
leaf trees) these range in diameter
from 15 to 80 microns and in length
from I to 7 millimeters. In hardwoods
(broadleaf trees), the cells may be
much larger in diameter, in some
woods such as oak up to 300 microns.
They rarely exceed two millimeters in
length. All woods contain horizontal-
ly elongated cells in radially oriented
ribbons of tissue called rays. Ray vol-
ume may vary from 5 to 30 percent
of the total wood volume, dependent
upon the tree species. The thickness
of the walls of the cells, which dic-
tates the density of the wood, is also
highly variable. In the living tree, all
of the wood gives mechanical strength,
and the outermost, light colored
sheath, sapwood, additionally pro-
vides for conduction of water to the
leaves to enter into food synthesis and
for storage of surplus foods.
The size, arrangement, and wall
thickness of the cells and the mole-
cular orientation within the cell walls
govern the physical and mechanical
behavior of the wood. In the United
States alone, there are about ninety
different species or groups of species
of trees providing wood of commer-
cial utility. Each of these has its own
characteristic cellular structure. With-
in each, variations occur dependent
upon heredity, environment, compe-
tition with other growing plants, and
position within the tree.
It is not surprising that properties
of wood vary significantly between
different species of trees. For example,
there is a twelve-fold difference in the
average specific gravity of the world's
lightest commercial wood, balsa, and
the heaviest, lignum vitae. In the
JANUARY 1964
17


Courtesy Forest Products Laboratory
Figure I—A highly magnified block of oak wood illustrating the complex cellular
arrangement.
United States, there is a three-fold
difference in specific gravity of north-
ern white cedar and live oak. This re-
flects in differences of more than three
hundred percent in most mechanical
properties. Variations within a species
are much less striking, but neverthe-
less important. Clearly, to use wood
efficiently the patterns of natural vari-
ation must be understood and con-
trolled or accounted for. This is per-
haps the most significant difference
between wood, a product of nature,
and materials synthesized or refined
by man.
Desirable Properties of Wood
The long history of utility of wood
by man cannot be accounted for by
availability and economy of use alone.
Obviously, wood must combine many
favorable properties to stand the test
of time. Most of these are familiar to
all. A few, summarized below illus-
trate its value as an engineering ma-
terial.
Mechanical Strength:
The basic molecular component of
wood, cellulose, has extremely high
tensile strength. Its distribution into
hollow, tubular components leads to
exceptional mechanical strength on a
weight basis. Pound for pound, wood
is stronger and stiffer in flexure than
structural steel. As a fibrous material,
its endurance limit in fatigue is high-
er in proportion to its ultimate
strength than for many metals.
Thermal Insulation:
Because of its millions of small
dead-air spaces, wood is markedly
superior to other materials in resist-
ance to heat transfer. The thermal
conductivity of wood is 1/1700 that of
aluminum, 1/400 that of steel, and
1/16 that of concrete. Not only is it
an excellent insulating material but
also it is always warm to the touch.
Thermal Stability:
Along the grain, the coefficient of
thermal expansion of wood is but 1/7
that of aluminum and 1/3 that of
steel. Stresses resulting from thermal
expansion are rarely significent.
Retention of Strength in Fire:
Although it is a combustible ma-
terial, wood in large dimensions burns
very slowly and even in extremely hot
fires loses strength only in approxi-
mate proportion to its reduction in
cross sections. At temperatures of
1300 to I7()0°F wood chars from the
outside at the rate of only 1/30 to
1/50-inch per minute.
Ease of Working and Fastening:
Machinability with light hand and
power tools and simplicity of fasten-
ing mechanically with nails, screws,
and connectors and chemically with
modern adhesives place wood in a
unique category among structural ma-
terials.
Durability:
Dry wood does not decay, and is im-
mune to the attack of most insects.
Tests have shown clearly that wood
retains its original strength after hun-
dreds of years of service.
Electrical Resistance:
Dry wood compares favorably with
bakelite in this property.
Chemical Resistance:
Wood not only does not oxidize
but resists rapid deterioration when
in contact with acids and alkalies.
Chemical vapor action is usually
minor.
The combination of these proper-
ties, coupled with inherent attractive-
ness, is unique to wood.
Unusual Characteristics of Wood
The characteristics of wood sum-
arized above are unquestionably de-
sirable in a versatile engineering ma-
terial. To be harnessed, however, the
material must be sufficiently well un-
derstood to permit precise prediction
of its behavior under any conditions
of intended use. Wood scientists
throughout the world have been at-
tempting to marshal this knowledge
for the past half century and signifi-
cant advances have resulted. Although
much remains to be learned, research
has provided an understanding which
makes possible many types of engi-
neered wood structures. Refinement
of this knowledge and discovery of
new information is continuous in gov-
ernmental, university and industrial

available for technological use.
Space permits but a brief summary
of a few of the more salient features
of wood behavior which influence its
engineering application. Detailed in-
formation regarding these and others
is available in a wide variety of texts
and technical papers in the world
literature. It should be noted that
these characteristics apply basically to
solid wood. Many may be changed
significantly by chemical or mechan-
ical modification.
Inherent variability:
As indicated earlier, variation in
physical and mechanical behavior is
to be expected both between and with-
in species. That existing between
species can be controlled by proper
identification. Within species, how-
ever, the problem is somewhat more
complex. Although some measureable
factors correlate with this, as will be
brought out later, frequently it must
be accounted for rather than con-
trolled in design.
The U.S. Forest Products Labora-
tory, Madison, Wisconsin, has con-
ducted millions of tests of physical
and mechanical properties for all of
our domestic species. Some foreign
woods have been similarly tested both
here and abroad. In the testing pro-
gram, each species has been statistical-
ly sampled from within its geographic
range and standardized tests of me-
chanical strength and elasticity,
shrinkage, and density have been con-
ducted from material from various
parts of the tree. The results have led
to average values for each property
measured for each species and have
provided data from which an estimate
of inherent variation and its correla-
tion with density can be made.
Values for each property were
found to be distributed normally,
and as might be expected, all proper-
ties did not vary similarly. Coefficients
of variation, which express the stan-
dard deviation as a percentage of the
mean, for a few of the properties fol-
low for illustration.
It must be kept in mind that this
variation is for defect-free wood un-
der constant exposure conditions and
at constant moisture content. It,
therefore is not subject to direct con-
trol.
Inherent variation may be con-

sional change, and other aspects of

tive testing of wood is currently being
studied widely by wood scientists and
technologists and workable principles
are evolving for future application.
Anisotropy:
Most commonly used engineering
materials are essentially isotropic.
Wood, however, represents an ex-
35
treme in anisotropy. As was indicated
earlier, it is composed largely of ver-
tically elongated tubular cells, the
walls of which are cellulosic. The
cellulose chains are aligned principal-
ly in the direction of the long axis of
the cell. It is therefore not surprising
that properties along the grain differ
significantly from those transverse to
the grain. Additionally, because of the
difference in density of the wood that
is formed in the initial part of the
growing season (earlywood) and that
formed late in the season (latewood),
the orientation of the rays, and sub-
microscopic structure of the cell wall,
wood behaves differently in the tan-
gential and radial directions with re-
spect to the bole of the tree. The
magnitude of anisotropy is great and
therefore many properties must be
measured in three directions—longi-
tudinal, radial, and tangential.
To illustrate the anisotropy in-
volved, consider the elastic constants.
Young's modulus longitudinally may
vary from 1,200,000 psi to 2,000,000
psi depending on the species. The
average ratios of radial and tangential
Young's moduli to the longitudinal
modulus are 0.085 and 0.045 respec-
tively. The three mutually perpen-
dicular directions of differing proper-
ties lead to the moduli of rigidity
values and six Poisson's ratios for a
given piece of wood. Strength proper-
ties similarly differ. For example, ten-

sile strength paralled to the grain
may be as much as forty times greater
than that perpendicular to the grain.
Shear perpendicular to the grain vir-
tually never occurs in service because
opposing force couples cause the ma-
terial to fail in the much weaker di-
rection parallel to the grain. Shearing
strength in the direction causing the
fibers to roll past each other may be
only half of that in the direction
causing fibers to slide longitudinally
past each other.
Physical properties also are influ-
enced by anisotropy. Shrinkage and
swelling accompanying moisture con-
tent change is approximately twice as
great in the tangential direction as in
the radial direction. Longitudinal
shrinkage may be but 1/20 the tan-
gential shrinkage. Thermal expansion
transversely is approximately ten
times that longitudinally, and thermal
conductivity longitudinally is over
twice that transversely.
Complexities resulting from aniso-
tropy are multiplied in modified pro-
ducts such as plywood in which adja-
cent layers of wood are bonded with
perpendicular grain direction. Even
in fiber products such as paper or
hardboard, directional properties are
the rule. Clearly, the nature of anis-
trophy must be understood if wood is
to be used as an engineering material.
Moisture Influences:
In the living tree, wood is continu-
ally bathed in the water it conducts
from the roots to the leaves. When a
board is cut from a log, the cavities
of the cells frequently contain appre-
ciable quantities of water. Additional-
ly, submicroscopic voids in the walls
of the cells contain water which is
attracted very strongly to the cellulose
molecules. Approximately 30 percent
moisture content, based on the oven-
dry weight of the wood, is in the cell
walls. As much as 200 percent more
may be contained in the cell cavities,
depending on the species, density, and
whether the wood is heart wood or
sapwood.
When wood is exposed to an at-
mosphere below 100 percent relative
humidity, all of the water will even-
tually evaporate from the cell cavities,
but unless the relative humidity is
zero percent and heat is supplied,
some will remain in the cell walls.
Further, if the cell walls have been
dried and are later exposed to an at-
mosphere of high relative humidity,
they will adsorb atmospheric moisture.
A fixed relationship exists between
the vapor pressure of the atmosphere
of exposure and the eventual moisture
content of the cell walls. This is
known as the equilibrium moisture
content (Fig. 2).
The moisture content at which the
cell walls are completely saturated
and no water is contained in the cell
cavities is known as the fiber satura-
tion point. This is between 24 and 30
percent for most species. Only wood
which is in continuous contact with
water in liquid form or is exposed
continuously to 100 percent relative
humidity can remain at or above
fiber saturation point. Obviously,
most wood in use is below the fiber
saturation point and varies in mois-
ture content depending upon the
average relative humidity to which it
is exposed. For example, flooring in
a university building varies between
approximately 6 percent moisture
content in the winter and 12 percent
in the summer. The flooring in a 12'
x 12' room will lose about three gal-
lons of water in the winter and regain
the same amount next summer. Noth-
ing—not even the best finish coat-
can pervent this except chemically
changing the wood to reduce its affin-
ity for water.
Moisture content changes above the
fiber saturation point have no signifi-
cant influence on any wood properties
except the weight. However, when
the moisture content below the fiber
saturation point is varied, essentially
all physical and mechanical proper-
ties are strikingly changed. Strengdi
and elasticity increase markedly as
20
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


For example, changing the moisture
content of coast type Douglas fir from
the fiber saturation point to 12 per-
cent increases the modulus of rupture
in bending from 7,600 to 12,200 psi,
the Young's modulus in bending from
1,570,000 to 1,950,000 psi and the
maximum crushing strength in com-
pression parallel to the grain from
3,860 to 7,430 psi. Below the fiber
saturation point, a linear relation
exists between the logarithm of
strength and the moisture content. It
is therefore possible to adjust aver-
age strength values for a given species
to the anticipated value at the mois-
ture content it will attain in service.
Moisture content variations below
the fiber saturation point are also ac-
companied by changes in dimension.
In decreasing native woods from the
fiber saturation point to zero percent
moisture content tangential shrinkage
may be from 4 to 12 percent of the
green dimension and radial shrinkage
from 2 to 7 percent of the green di-
mension, depending on the species.
Longitudinal changes accompanying
the same change in moisture content
rarely exceed one-half of one percent.
An essentially linear relation exists
between dimension and moisture con-
tent. If the percentage shrinkage from
the fiber saturation point to the oven-
dry condition is known, the change in
dimension accompanying a given
change in moisture content can be
predicted. For example, one can pre-
dict the increase in width of a floor-
ing strip from winter to summer.
Wood can now be dimensionally
stabilized with chemical treatment,
but as yet, it is uneconomical to do
so except for specialized products.
The substantial research effort di-
rected toward this problem will un-
questionably solve it at some future
time.
Other changes in wood properties
are similarly striking. The electrical
resistivity, for example, increases from
10" to 10'8 ohm-centimeters when
wood is dried from the fiber satura-
tion point to the oven-dry conditions.
The fact that, in this range, a linear
relationship exists between the loga-
rithm of electrical conductivity and
moisture content makes possible pre-
cise moisture meters based on electri-
cal resistance. The dielectric constant
for wood increases rapidly as water is
absorbed both below and above the
fiber saturation point. Certain ther-
mal and acoustical properties change.

Specific gravity

The relationship between wood strength in binding and specific gravity.
In fact, essentially every property of
importance in wood is sensitive to
changes in moisture content.
Specific Gravity:
Many important properties of
wood correlate closely with specific
gravity. This is not surprising since
specific gravity reflects the amount of
cell-wall substance per unit volume
on which most properties depend.
To be meaningful, specific gravity
must measure the amount of cell-wall
material per unit volume at a speci-
fied moisture content. It is deter-
mined by the relationship:
oven-dry weight of
wood
Specific gravity = weight of a vol-
ume of water
equal to that of
the wood at a spe-
c i f i e d moisture
content
Inasmuch as the volume changes ac-
companying variations in moisture
content below the fiber saturation
point, an infinite number of specific
gravity values could be determined
for any piece of wood depending on
its moisture content. Conventionally,
three values are determined for each
species. These are based on oven-dry
weight and (1) volume oven dry, (2)
at 12 percent moisture content, and
(3) above the fiber saturation point.
When the percentage volumetric
shrinkage is known, specific gravity
based on volume at one moisture con-
tent can be readily converted to that
based on volume at another.
Within a species, specific gravity
and strength are exponentially re-
lated (Fig. 4), the exponent differing
for different strength properties. The
exponent approaches one for parallel-
to-the- grain properties which are de-
pendent principally upon the amount

of resisting material. Transverse-to-
the grain properties which depend
upon deformation of the cross sec-
tions of the cells are related with
higher exponents. For example, the
equation
holds where s
is a strength property at specific
gravity G1. The exponent, n, is 1.50
for modulus of rupture in bending,
1.25 for Young's modulus parallel to
140
the grain and maximum crushing
strength in compression parallel to
the grain, and 2.50 for compression
perpendicular to the grain.
Specific gravity is the best available
index of mechanical strength. Al-
though it is often difficult to estimate
accurately, it provides some basis for
controlling inherent variability and
is used in structural lumber grading.

age is linearly related to specific grav-

ity. This can frequently be used to
improve the accuracy of prediction of
dimension change accompanying
changes in moisture content. The
volume of hygroscopic water con-
tained in wood in equilibrium in a
given atmosphere is obviously de-
pendent on specific gravity. Strength-
related properties such as ease of
machining and nailing and holding
power of fastenings are also influ-
enced by specific gravity. This prop-
erty provides a most valuable index of
most aspects of wood performance.
Time Dependency:
Many of the time-dependent prop-
erties of wood are not, as yet, clearly
understood. Some useful relation-
ships, however, have been well estab-
lished. For example, the load-carrying
capacity in bending is known to de-
crease logarithimically with time such
that a beam can be expected to carry
for a year only approximately 70 per-
cent of the load it can support for 5
minutes (Fig. 5). Creep and relaxa-
tion, particularly as they interrelate
with moisture-content and tempera-
ture changes, are currently receiving
much research attention. Recent
studies indicate that creep can occur
in tension at stresses as low as 5 per-
cent of the ultimate. Increased tem-
perature and fluctuating moiture con-
tent influence significantly the
amount of creep. Hopefully, this im-
portant aspect of wood behavior will
be better understood in the future.
Temperature Dependency:
Most mechanical properties of
wood significantly decrease with in-
creasing temperature, but revert to
normal strength upon cooling provid-
ing temperature in excess of 160°F.
has not been maintained for a pro-
longed period of time (Fig. 6). This
influence is much stronger at high
moisture content percentages. For ex-
ample, wood at high moisture content
doubles its bending strength when
cooling from 160 to 0°F. whereas in
the oven-dry condition the increase
for the same temperature change is
only about 20 percent.
As implied earlier, wood which is
high in both moisture content and
temperature may be permanently de-
formed. This is accomplished by
molding hot, wet wood which, while
under deformation, is cooled and
dried. Steam bending of boat ribs,
athletic equipment and other prod-
ucts is thus possible.

Numismatic evidence has been used
increasingly by modern historians study-
ing ancient and medieval history. But
they have relied almost entirely upon a
study of the surface of the coin, that is,
the name of the ruler, the name of the
mint, the date, etc. However, with a
knowledge of the metallic content of the
coin we could determine its value. Then
we could apply this data to our textual
information and have a more accurate
piture of the economic life of the period
under study.
In written historical sources for
the medieval and ancient world
there are isolated references to
prices and wages. For example,
we know that one measure of
wheat costs so many dirhams in
Bagdad in 800 A.D., while the same
measure cost a different number of
dirhams in Basra a few years later.
What the textual evidence does not
tell us is whether the differences are
due to a result of the debasement of
the coins or other economic factors.
Even when we combine all our text-
ual evidence there are many gaps in
our knowledge of prices for any one
area and almost no references to
comparative prices. It is impossible,
on the basis of this evidence alone, to
reconstruct exchange rates between
various regions or even price and
wage scales for one area. The knowl-
edge of the intrinsic value of the local
currencies over a period of time could
be the bridge permitting us to inter-
pret our textual data in a more mean-
ingful manner.
For this study a limited number of
Muslim dirhams from the Kelsey Mu-
seum, University of Michigan, have
been analyzed using an x-ray spectro-
graphic method. (A Muslin dirham
is a silver coin. The dirhams used in
these tests come from the early medi-
eval period, eighth to tenth centuries,
when the Muslims ruled from Spain
to India.) Some of the technical prob-
lems of coin analysis as well as the
uses of this scientific method for his-
torical research will be discussed.
The traditional method for finding
the intrinsic value of a coin is by
determining its specific gravity. The
method, credited to Archimedes, was
known in both the medieval West and
Muslim worlds. Once the value of the
specific gravity of a Muslim dirham
is determined, the approximate spe-
cific gravity of pure silver, 10.5, is
used for the purposes of comparison,
and the dirham is said to contain such
and such a percentage of silver. This
percentage is considered to be the
coin's intrinsic value. The percentage
of silver in the coins as determined
by their specific gravity in the accom-
panying table is based on the work of
Professor Earle Caley of Ohio State
University.
The Caley Conversion is based on
the assumption that the silver is
alloyed primarily with copper (s.g.
8.92). This should always give the
coin a specific gravity of less than
10.5. But as he points out, errors can
occur because, 1) we do not know the
mechanical and thermal history of
the coin, 2) there may be foreign in-
clusions in the metal, 3) there may
be hidden cavities in the coin (see
in the Table No. 8), 4) the coin may
be too small for accurate results (see
in the Table No. 15), and 5) we may
lack knowledge of the other metals
used as alloys.
Professor Ehrenkreutz of the Uni-
versity of Michigan, on the basis of
his extensive studies in Muslim
numismatics, has concluded that the
specific gravity method is only valid
for mass observations. Only then can
one reach general conclusions as the
relative value of money between dif-
ferent geographical regions or dynas-
ties.
It is possible for a historian to
acquire more specific data from
numismatic evidence? Modern science
has developed a number of methods
for determining the metallic content
of a coin. Possibly the most sophisti-
cated method is the use of a radium-
beryllium netron source to activate
the coin and then measure the result-
ing radiation to determine the various
elements present and their respective
percentages. The cost of testing and
of equipment, as well as the training
needed for research have severely
limited the practical application of
this method for the historian. An-
other method which is popular among
chemists, physicists, and metallurgists
for analyzing an unknown substance
is the spark test. While the results
from this method are very similar to
those of the x-ray spectrograph, the
historian must reject the spark test
as it destroys a part of an irreplace-
able historical object. The last meth-
od is x-ray spectrographic analysis
which does not harm the coin.
The first problem, whether one is
using the Archimedian method or
x-rays, is to clean the coin. The tra-
ditional techniques a historian uses
for cleaning coins, such as ammonia
24

and water, baking soda and alum-
inum foil, and lemon juice, sounds
like a do-it-yourself cookbook, but
they are all based on known chemical
phenomna. The American Numis-
matic Society is presently relying on a
faster process of electrolysis. But all of
these chemical methods tend to leave
areas of corrision between inscrip-
tions and on rough edges. A mechan-
ical method for removing isolated
corrosion spots was used which in-
corporated very fine Silicon Carbide
or Alumina abrasives applied with a
toothbrush. This mechanical method
does not significantly alter the coin.
The cleaned coin is then placed in
the x-ray spectrograph. Every element
when bombarded with x-rays will give
off certain characteristic waves which
can be detected by diffraction from
certain crystals. By altering variables
it is possible to look for one element
or scan for a general picture of the
various metals in the whole sample. It
is assumed that the elements are uni-
formly distributed throughout the
coin. The x-ray technique identifies
the elements of the surface layers.
The purpose of these tests, run under
the guidance of Dr. Paul Cloke of the
University of Michigan's Geology De-
partment, was to get an overall pic-
ture of the coin and possible deter-
mine the actual amount of the com-
ponent elements.
The tests were run with a Tungsten
tube and a LiF crystal with a dec tor
scanning at a speed of 2 degrees per
minute and with a chart speed of one-
half inch per minute. The coins were
analyzed over the angles 12° to 35°
and then 35° to 60° with a BaCl,
covering which was necessary to keep
the peak on the chart paper of the
recording instruments. By using
such a wide angular range it was pos-
sible to identify all the elements in
the coin. In a number of cases it was
necessary to check numerous known
positions on the graph before it could
be positively stated that certain ele-
ments were present. This was particu-
larly true for the appearance of bis-
muth in the Samanid coins.
As stated above, the x-ray method
not only enables us to label every ele-
ment in the coin, but also gives us
semi-quantitative results. The relative
height of the peak of the element to
its background can tell us if the ele-
ment is a major (M) factor in deter-
niing the specific gravity, a minor
(M) one which would effect the speci-
fic gravity, or ony a trace (t) ele-
ment. (See chart for results of these
tests).
Theoretically these relative heights
could be turned into actual percent-
ages of composition with a probable
error of 1 percent. The practical
method for finding such a solution is
difficult as there is no standard with
which to compare the coins. Because
the surface qualities of powder are
different from a coin, a powder mix-
ture composed of the known elements
in predetermined percentages can not
be used as a base. One possibility is
to take the purest coin and call it
100% and compare all the others with
it. This method fails when there are
many elements involved, as certain
phenomna, such as overlappng, tend
to give an element a greater peak-to-
background height then it warrants.
Another method would be to melt
down one of the Muslim coins and
analyze its component parts. Besides
the reluctance of a historian to des-
troy an irreplaceable object, these re-
sults would have the same drawback
as using the "purest" coin as a base;
it would only give the heights of
those elements involved in one par-
ticular coin. Another possible solu-
tion for determining actual percent-
ages would be to produce coins which
would be examples of the various
combinations of elements and test
them.
But even a knowledge of the rela-
tive quantities can clarify some of the
results of die specific gravity method.
One of the Baghdad coins (No. 3)
shows a percentage of silver greater
than 100%. The conclusions from the
x-ray mediod show the existence of a
large quantity of lead, thus giving
a greater specific gravity than the
percentage of actual silver would
warrant. Another example is one of
the Kufan coins (No. 6) whose spe-
cific gravity gives a reasonable result
— 100%. But the actual silver in the
coin must be less than 100% as the
coin includes a relatively large
amount of copper and mercury. In
this way each coin should be studied
to compare its specific gravity with
the relative amounts of die elements
found in it, until we can reach a more
definite statement as to the value of
specific gravity observations.
It is assumed that once we had the
actual value of the coinage at differ-
ent times and places, we could give a
more accurate picture of the medieval
economic activity. Of more immediate
concern to the historian is the ques-
tion of whether he is learning too
much. While it is well known that the

Muslims knew the Archimedean meth-
od for finding the specific gravity,
did they really know how much silver
was in a silver coin? Is the modern
historian, using x-ray analysis or any
other method gaining information
which those who used the coinage
didn't have, that is, its intrinsic value?
It is possible that the modern histor-
ian could erroneously reconstruct eco-
nomic relations which were in fact
determined by the contemporaries
wha had no such exact knowledge of
the coins.
There is no definitive answer to the
above question. A partial answer can
be found by examing contemporary
sources for complaints about debase-
ment and by determining the con-
temporary technological level of mint-
ing and assaying. There are numerous
complaints by Muslin chroniclers to
the debasement of coinage by various
rulers. What has not been determined
is if the chroniclers complain every
time there is a debasement or how
great of a debasement must occur for
a chronicler to be aware of it. The
contemporary scientific knowledge of
metallurgy can only be established
by going from the known to the un-
known. Again a lack of sources pre-
vents the historian from reaching a
final conclusion. Many of the first
printed books on metallurgy from the
early sixteenth century include chap-
ters on assaying and minting. A recent
exhibition by the American Society
of Metals on metallurgical literature
before the era of printing demon-
strated that there was a high knowl-
edge of problems directly or indirect-
ly involved in minting. While an ad-
ministrative treatise on the English
Exchequer from the reign of Henry
II (1154-1189) is unfortunately very
vague on the details of assaying coin-
age, the author states that assaying
was occasionally necessary. He states
it was necessary because although
some silver coins might weigh the
same as pure silver, after assaying they
were found to be deficient and the
sheriff had to make up the difference.
There is also an Islamic treatise
on minting from an earlier period
but because of definitional and
syntactical problems in Arabic, the
exact level of technological develop-
ment can not be determined. But
even with these limitations it can be
postulated that the Muslims knew
how to manufacture good coinage as
well as debase it.
The x-ray spectrographic method
can also supplement our knowledge
of the minting of these coins. For ex-
ample, the existence of mercury in
the Ja/ira dirham (No. 14) and one
of the Kufan coins (No. 6), proves
that these two coins, at least, were
poorly minted because mercury is
normally removed in the minting
process.
There is another potential piece of
information this method may give us.
If the coins from one geographical
area include an element that was not
found in any other area, we could
possibly prove the circulation of cer-
tain coins among various mints. To
be specific, only the Samanid coins
(No. 11 and No. 12), include bis-
muth. If large scale studies prove that
only Samanic coins and others from
different geographical regions dated
during and after the Samanid dynasty
include bismuth we could establish
the pattern of monetary exchange for
the Samanid coins.
The historian is approaching the
limit of new data he can obtain
from the existing sources as long as
he uses traditional methods. Science
is offering new methods for analyzing
our historical evidence. An example
of the type of contribution science
can make is demonstrated by the use
of x-ray spectrographic analysis. Even
in this limited study of a few Muslim
dirhams the results demonstrate the
necessity of re-evaluating the specific
gravity method for establishing intrin-
sic value as well as opening up other
areas of study, i.e., interregional rela-
tions proved by identification of local
elements. But this study must be con-
sidered preliminary to work with a
larger sample which will contribute to
our knowledge of comparative eco-
nomics.

The Pitot-Slatic Probe is a rocket-borne
research instrument using three radio-
active ionization gauges to measure aero-
dynamic pressures at three locations on
a moving rocket nose cone. These press-
ures are interpreted in terms of ambient
atmospheric pressure, temperature, and
density. The probe is planned for use in
a large scale, global, synoptic program of
measurement of the upper atmosphere
(18-75 miles). Real time data are impor-
tant for an understanding of meteorolog-
ical phenomena. The research effort is a
program of NASA's Goddard Space Flight
Center in cooperation with the Univer-
sity of Michigan.
The University of Michigan Space
Physics Research Laboratory has been
actively pursuing knowledge of the
upper atmosphere since early 1946. In
conjunction with NASA and the
United States Air Force, the Space
Physics Lab has been sending rocket
probes into the upper atmosphere in
an intensified program to find out
how the pressure, the temperature,
and the density of the atmosphere
vary with altitude. However, along
with this, it is also desired to know
how these three parameters vary with
the earth's latitude. For this reason
the Space Physics Lab will launch the
probes from such places as Fort
Churchill, Manitoba (59°N Lat);
Wallops Island, Va. (38°N Lat);
Cape Kennedy, Fla. (28°N Lat); and
Assension Island (7°S Lat). Not only
is the Space Physics Lab interested in
the variation of the parameters with
altitude, but also with respect to the
season of the year. Due to earlier data
that has already been processed, the
pattern of the variations show that
the three parameters not only vary
with the latitude and the season, but
with the time of day that the probe
is launched.
The program in which the Space
Physics Lab is participating has used
four different types of probes of
which the pi tot-static probe is the
latest development. The other types
of probes that have been used are: the

grenade probe, the sodium-vapor
probe, and the falling sphere probe.
Each of these three types of probes
have various factors that makes the
choice of a "best" probe a question-
able proposition.
The grenade probe is launched on
a high impulse rocket that in the past
has been a Nike-Cajun booster assem-
bly. As the probe approaches the peak
of its trajectory (starting at 40 km.
until the peak at 90 km), several
grenades (12) are exploded. The
sounds from the explosions are picked
up by a microphone array near the
launching site. Since the speed of
sound in a perfect gas is a function of
the temperature alone, the average
temperature of the atmosphere can be
calculated. Also, through considera-
tion of the angle of arrival of the
shock waves, the wind's velocity can
be calculated.
The sodium-vapor probe is
launched on a Nike-Apache booster
assembly and like the grenade probe
releases its payload as it approaches
the peak of its trajectory (80 through
220 km). On the ground, near the
launch site are camera stations. The
camera stations take pictures of the
sodium-vapor as it is ejected from
the probe. From the photos taken, the
diffusion rate of the vapor trail can
be determined and from this data the
velocity of the wind can be calcu-
lated.
The falling sphere probe differs
from the grenade and the sodium-
vapor probes in that the sphere is
released from the probe at the peak
of the rocket's trajectory and allowed
to fall freely back to the earth. The
sphere can contain various instrumen-
tation such as accelerometers to mea-
sure the changes in the acceleration
due to the drag of the atmosphere on
the sphere from which the density of
the atmosphere can be determined.
The pitot-static probe is named
after the primary measurements that
the probe takes. The pitot or ram
pressure is the pressure caused by the
probe's motion through the atmos-
phere and is taken from the nose of
the probe with the use of the basic
measuring instrument on the probe,
the densatron. The ambient or actual
pressure is also measured by a dens-
atron on the side of the probe. The
third and final measurement, the
wind velocity, is also taken by a
densatron which is housed just below
the orifices for the ambient pressure.
(See drawing for actual locations.)
The densatron, the basic measur-
ing instrument on the pitot-static
probes, is, in principle, a very simple
instrument. It is designed to operate
above thirty kilometers and measures
pressures from 10 mm. to 1 x 10"4
mm. of mercury. The rarified atmos-
phere enters the densatron chamber
through an orifice in the front. The
gases of the atmosphere are then
ionized by a radioactive material,
tritium (H3). The chamber's walls
are positively charged with respect to
the probe which is charged below
ground (see diagram). The ionized
gases are attracted to the probe due
to electric charges causing a current
to flow in the probe. The currents
caused by the ionized gases are from
1 x 10 8 to 1 x 1012 amps. The current
flows through a resistor, thus causing
a voltage drop across the resistor. This
voltage is measured, amplified, and
sent to the telemetry instruments.
From the telemetry instruments it is
transmitted to the ground support
units. The temperature of the inner
walls of the densatron chamber are
measured and assumed to be the tem-
perature of the gases in the chamber.
However, this is not the ambient
temperature of the atmosphere. With
this data the ambient pressure or the
ram pressure can be read from graphs
of pressure versus voltage that were
prepared using vacuum chambers on
the ground.
The three densatrons are placed
in the probe which contains the
necessary equipment to support
the rocket in flight. This equipment
includes an FM-FM telemetry system
to transmit the data to the ground;
an optical aspect system which re-
cords the angle of entry of the probe
into the atmosphere and a DOVAP
transponder for trajectory calcula-
tions. All these instruments are
placed in the shell of the probe.
According to Mr. Jack Horvath of
the Space Physics Lab, the probe's
shell was especially designed so that
the densatron could measure the am-
bient pressure directly. From the wind
tunnel tests it was found that the pres-
sure of the atmosphere just before the
probe widens is within plus or minus
ten per cent of the ambient pressure.
The probe is placed on a Nike-
Apache rocket which is a higher im-
pulse rocket than the older Nike
Cajun rocket used in the past. The
use of the Nike-Apache Rocket is due
to the fact that the pitot-static probe
can be used at higher altitudes.
"The aerodynamic theory of the ex-
periment is considered in three flow
regions which will be encountered by
the probe in a high altitude flight.
These are the continuous-flow region
(below approximately 85 km.) The
transition region (between 85 and 90
km), and the free-molecular-flow re-
gion (above 90 km).
The interpretation of the pitot or
ram pressure, in terms of ambient
density follows from the theory in a
straight-forward manner. In the con-
tinuous region, the ambient density
is obtained from the measured press-
ure through the use of the Rayleigh
equation1 and the equation of state.
In the transition region, the present
theory is not adequate to interpret
properly the measured ram pressure
in terms of the ambient density. The
loss of interpretable ram pressure in-
formation occurs over a very small
altitude range (between 85 and 90
km) and is not detrimental to the
measurement above and below this
region. In the free-molecular-flow re-
gion, the continuum theory does not
hold, and the density must be de-

duced from the molecular point of
view by means of a modified thermal
transpiration equation.2
The static or ambient pressure is
given directly by the manifold gage
in the continuous-How region. In the
free-molecular-region, the measured
pressure is corrected for the thermal
transpiration effect to obtain the am-
bient pressure.
Having obtained the ambient press-
ure and density from two indepen-
dent measurements, the ambient tem-
perature is computed using the equa-
tions of state.
The atmospheric wind measure-
ment in all three flow regions is based
on the roll modulated ambient press-
ure in the wind chamber." 3
The pi tot-static probe is used rather
than the three other probes for vari-
ous reasons. In the area of ground
support, the grenade and sodium-
vapor probes need surveyed launch
sites and therefore can only be used
in the vicinities of already established
launch sites. On the other hand, the
falling sphere and pitot-static probes
need only tracking, telemetry, and
data recording instruments which can
be easily transported to almost any-
where on the earth. The pitot-static
probe measures directly three para-
meters from which the pressure, the
temperature, the density, and wind's
velocity can be calculated measures
one parameter from which the density
can be calculated. The sodium-vapor
probe experiment measures only one
parameter from which the wind's
velocity can be calculated. The gren-
ade probe experiment also measures
only one parameter from which the
temperature and the wind's velocity
can be calculated. Also in favor of
the pitot-static probe experiment is
the fact that the data is redundant.
This means that the data collected
allows the Space Physics Lab to de-
termine the desired information by
two independent methods. The pitot-

static probe uses as its basic instru-
ment a densatron which is essentially
a simple instrument, but it can send
back a continuous reading of the de-
sired parameter.
In the final analysis, the actual
worth of the pitot-static probe has yet
to be proved. The three other probes
are older and have already gathered
much data, while the pitot-static is
new. Only further experimentation
will tell if the pitot-static probe is all
the Space Physics Lab hopes it to be.

Astronomers
With a 1,050 mile high rocket-
borne experiment last September,
University of Michigan radio astro-
nomers greatly extended the range
of radio frequency-intensity measure-
ments of our galaxy, the Milky Way.
One result of this will be that the
accuracy of scientific deductions from
physical data on the Milky Way's
radio emissions will be greatly in-
creased. For example, they deter-
mined that in the local spiral arm of
the Milky Way, there are no more
than an average of 15 electrons in
every 100 cubic centimeters of space
—a statistic that had not been fixed
before.
The 145-pound instrument package
fired from Wallops Island, Virginia
on September 22 measured at alti-
tudes up to 1,050 miles natural galac-
tic radiation on three frequencies—
750, 1,200, and 2,000 kilocycles, the
lowest frequencies yet reported from
the galaxy from space vehicles. The
U of M experiment was unique also
in that to ensure accuracy it periodi-
cally monitored the performance of
the equipment in flight—the radio-
frequency capacitance of the antenna
and the gain stability of the receivers.
As a result, the highly accurate meas-
urements of radio intensity in our
galaxy were obtained.
On a logarithmic plot of intensity
versus frequency (from the natural
radio emission of the Milky Way)
their measurements fall on an exten-
sion of a straight line as previously
determined by the latest high-fre-
quency measurements from the
ground. Such accuracy can not be
obtained at low-frequencies from
ground measurements because the sig-
nals are complicated by the earth's
atmosphere as they pass through it.
The U of M experiment eliminated
uncertainty inherent in the ground
data by observing above the ionos-
phere.
One of the things radio astronom-
ers are looking for in such experi-
ments is the point where radio wave
intensity drops off from the straight
line with decreasing frequency or as
the length of the radio wave in-
creases. Since the U of M experiment
did not detect this drop-off, measure-
ments lower in frequency (below one
magacycle) will be needed to find it.
The drop-off is expected because sev-
eral phenomena are known to exist
which could cause it.
The rocket results will help U of
M radio astronomers to plan another
experiment coming up—detailed low-
frequency measurements of Milky
Way radio intensity aboard the
POGO satellite by giving them the
precise intensity of these waves.
Atomic "Speedometer"
Nuclear radiation can be used to
time extremely fast and hidden
events, such as a bullet zipping down
a rifle barrel or the velocity of a tur-
bine blade in a running engine. The
technique could be used to measure
minute variations in speed of the
rifle bullet as it travels along the
barrel, or of piston travel in an en-
gine—which would tend to cut effi-
ciency and set up unwanted vibra-
tions. The method provides a relative-
ly inexpensive and non-destructive
means for testing rifle barrels and
ammution, according to Michigan en-
gineers Michael W. York, now at
General Dynamics Astronautics in
San Diego; Prof. Geza L. Gyorey and
John M. Lovallo, graduate student in
nuclear engineering.
Using gamma-radiation from a
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


detection technique, as proposed for
such measurements, would be quicker
and cost about one-fifth or less than
using high-speed X-ray techniques for
the same purpose. Briefly, they pro-
pose using several sources of gamma-
radiation placed along the rifle bar-
rel, with detectors on the opposite
side to receive the gamma rays that
go through the barrel. As the bullet
speeds down the barrel, it weakens
each beam in succession. The inter-
ruptions in each beam are detected at
the precise instant they occur, to
within several millionths of a second.
Thus, the instant the bullet passes
each measuring point in the barrel
is precisely known. From this, the
bullet's velocity—and changes in it
from point to point in the barrel-
can be determined. They note that
an inch-long bullet traveling at 3,000
feet per second, a fairly typical "muz-
zle velocity," takes 28 millionths of
a second to pass through one beam.
The signals of each beam interrup-
tion are all recorded at once on an
oscilloscope, and from this on photo-
graphic film. Thus, using Polaroid
film, results of each test are available
half a minute after it is made.
Usually, riHe barrels are tested by
suspending in the barrel fine wires
through which an electrical current
is sent. As the rifle is fired and the
bullet travels clown the barrel, it cuts
the wires and interrupts the current.
As the current fails at each point, the
precise time of failure is noted. But
this technique ruins the rifle barrel—
and interferes with the bullet. And
the barrel can't be sold afterwards.
The gamma radiation technique, by
contrast, could be used on every bar-
rel before it is sold. In addition,
minor variations make each barrel
different. Minor variations appear
also with test cartridges used to find
barrel velocity, no matter how care-
fully the cartridges are prepared by
present techniques.
For use in larger gun barrels, such
as artillery or naval weapons, or in
piston or turbine engines, the only
modification the technique needs is
a stronger source of radiation and
appropriate shielding, the U-M en-
gineers said.
They are a bit perplexed by one
remaining question: the upper limits
of velocity their techniques can be
used for isn't known. Theoretically,
it could be used on objects traveling
up to 30,000 feet per second. But the
only mechanical objects which travel
this fast that they know of are space
vehicles when escaping the earth's
gravitation pull. They are still hoping
to find some earth-bound mechanical
objects with parts that move this fast
so they can test the upper limits of
their development.
Fusion
A University of Michigan nuclear
engineer has eliminated a class of
problems that arose in efforts to ob-
tain power from controlled thermo-
nuclear fusion—the attempt to make
the hydrogen bomb type of reaction
a practical source of power. Prof.
Terry Kammash reported to the plas-
ma physics division of the American
Physical Society that his research
showed that, contrary to previous be-
lief, certain instabilities would not
exist. Significance of the finding is
illustrated by the fact that instabil-
ity of the fusion substance is probably
the key problem in the effort.
The particular instability with
which he dealt while on 15-month
leave from the U-M to do theoretical
research at the University of Califor-
nia Livermore Radiation Laboratory
concerns the way particles behave in
the fusion substance. Called a "plas-
ma," this substance is a gaseous state
of matter consisting of the electrically-
charged particles, electrons and ions.
(The most suitable ions for fusion
are the cores of heavy hydrogen
atoms—hence the name, "hydrogen
bomb.") If the plasma can be heated
to about 200 million degrees (Fahr-
enheit), a certain proportion of the
particles would fuse— pairs of cores
joining together—releasing great
amounts of nuclear energy problems
arise when attempts are made to con-
tain the plasma while heating it to
fusion temperatures. Because the plas-
ma has electromagnetic properties,
a magnetic field is used in attempts to
contain and heat it by, in effect,
squeezing it. But presently, before
fusion temperatures have been
reached, instabilities have broken out.
The attempts are rougly comparable
to trying to compress a balloon in
your hands (which would also heat it
by compressing the energy of the air
particles inside). As you squeeze, a
"bubble"—representing an instability
—tends to pop out between your fin-
gers.
The particles in the plasma, being
electrically charged, are coupled to
one another by the forces of their
self-generated electromagnetic fields,
and tend to move in unison. But some
of these "cooperative modes of mo-
tion" are unstable and tend to grow
from any slight, randomly occurring
displacement of a group of electrons
or ions in the plasma into an energy-
draining instability by causing the
particles to escape the desired con-
finement.
Physicists know this as a "dynamic
instability," in which forces tend to
drive a slight displacement to its
maximum, ft is like a pencil, balanced
on its point, being nudged from this
delicately stable condition by some
force, such as a breeze. After it is
thus displaced from its stable bal-
ance, other forces, gravity in the case
of the pencil, will tend to drive it to
its maximum displacement; it will
fall as far as it can.
Most plasmas have anisotropy—or
a difference between particle temper-
atures (or velocities) parallel to the
confining magnetic field and those at
right angles to it. Kammash wanted
to find out if this anisotropy—this
difference in temperatures — could
drive plasma instabilities" (known in
this case as microinstabilities). In
other words, could these temperature
differences act on the plasma like grav-
ity on the tipping pencil? He found
out that they did not.
His calculations demonstrated that
particles with these motions (or tem-
peratures) give rise to electric oscilla-
tions which do not grow, and hence
don't lead to instabilities in the
plasma.
There is, however, one exception.
This occurs when these oscillations
travel at a certain angle with respect
to the confining magnetic field. Ap-
parently, at this angle there seems to
be a strong coupling between the par-
ticle and the oscillation, which may
cause it to grow.
Research on all aspects of con-
trolled fusion grew considerably over
the past decade under the United
States' Project Sherwood, and the
problems along with it. But progress
is being made, mainly through great
increases in knowledge about the
mysteries of plasmas gained through
research such as this.

Your first job...will it be all you hope for?
MINE WAS, and it has never ceased to be. I joined
United States Rubber as a chemical engineer right after
my graduation in 1952, and the years since have held a
series of stimulating challenges. Why U.S.? A lot of
things influenced my choice. I knew there'd be a variety
of projects there, the programs you'd find only in a large
company with great diversification. I'd heard that U.S.
encouraged individual responsibility in an atmosphere of
freedom. I knew of the Company's record for leadership
in technical advances. At U.S. Rubber I've learned that
the Company regards men of industry and imagination
as their most valuable asset.
HOW ABOUT YOURS? We hope that you, too, will
find the opportunity you're looking for at United States
Rubber. If so, you'll be part of a team that, in the last five
years, obtained over 500 patents—more than our two largest
competitors combined. You'll join a select group of 2,000 engi-
neers and research personnel, working for one of America's
largest industrial companies operating 74 plants at home and
abroad. You'll join a company that makes 33,000 products.
Less than half of our business is in tires, and U.S. is one of
the nation's largest producers of textiles and chemicals. You'll
join a Company that, more than 100 years ago, made the first
manufactured vulcanized rubber product and where, today,
we contribute our resources and skills to atomic research,
oceanography, the latest designs in space stations and
hundreds of other exciting projects.

How to tell a career from a job
A job is a job. A career is a place to grow. A career has a future.
A job lives from day to day. In a job you get what you can, do
what you must. In a career, rewards parallel your contributions.
We're a career company. More than a third of our 90,000
employees have been with us at least 15 years; 10,000 for more
than 25 years. There are reasons for this. To assure growth we
invest over $90 million a year in research. Fifty percent of last
year's sales ($2.4 billion) came from products unheard of just
28 years ago. Because customers Mke these products, we've
grown 750% since 1937.
Our career men share in this growth because we fill virtually
all responsible positions from within. Our young men work in
several areas to develop their capabilities. This way they can
change positions without leaving the company.
There are job men and career men. If you seek a career, we'd
like to tell you about an interesting and rewarding one at

■ Edward G. Whittaker, III received his BS
Degree in Engineering Physics from Colorado
University in January of 1963. Shortly there-
after he joined the Research and Advanced De-
velopment Group at Delco as a Physicist.
As Ed puts it, "Believe me, it's a real chal-
lenge for a guy fresh out of college to see an
idea through from the development stage to the
finished product. Here at Delco in my work on
materials for new semiconductor devices the
creative experiences are endless—and the at-
mosphere seems to encourage your best efforts."
As a college graduate, you too may find excit-
ing and challenging opportunities in such pro-
grams as the development of germanium and
silicon devices, ferrites, solid state diffusion,
creative packaging of semiconductor products,
development of laboratory equipment, relia-
bility techniques, and applications and manu-
facturing engineering.
If your interests and qualifications lie in any
of these areas, you're invited to write for our
brochure detailing the opportunities to share
in forging the future of electronics with this
outstanding Delco-GM team. Watch for Delco

Develop a new surgical tool
to freeze tissue...

That was the goal of Union Car-
bide's Linde Division.
The result: fully automatic cryo-
surgery equipment that is easy to
operate and maintains preselected
temperatures reliably. It's been used
in a number of hospitals, here and
abroad, for treating the symptoms of
Parkinsonism and other involuntary
movement disorders.
Back in 1961, a new cryosurgery
technique, developed at St. Barnabas
Hospital (N. Y.) under the direction of
Dr. I. S. Cooper, was announced to the
medical profession.
In brief, this surgical procedure in-
volves making a small burr hole in a
patient's skull; directing a probe into
the thalamic target; and using liquid
nitrogen to cool the probe which
freezes the appropriate tissue.
Because of its extensive experience
and capabilities in cryogenic systems,
Linde was called upon to develop and
produce the needed cryosurgical de-
vice—a precision surgical probe and a
complete system capable of furnishing
controlled cold to the probe.
Designated the CE-2 Cryosurgery
Equipment, and shown above, it per-
mits using the ultra-low temperature of
liquid nitrogen (— 320° F.) as a surgi-
cal tool in a practical operating range
of 98° to -240° F.
Work with Linde and you work with
heat, cold, pressure, vacuum. You have
a choice among programs in cryogen-
ics, plasmas, Flame-Plating, electron-
ics, biochemistry, crystallography. Be-
fore deciding on any job, get to know
all that's going on at Linde.

Company
after
graduation,
what
will they do
for me?
Every man with any job hunting experience knows not to ask that question.
And yet, we think it has some validity. After all, a man's growth can
depend as much on the company he works for as the company's growth
depends on the man (remember, there are no statues to committees).
So to invest in your growth, and ours, every young graduate engineer
who joins the Timken Company spends from one to four years in one of
22 individualized training programs.
Extensive training
Instruction takes place on the job and in training sessions. Later there are
executive development programs at leading universities.
But don't misunderstand us. The Timken Company is not a graduate
school. With us, you earn as you learn.
As one of our engineers, you'll learn much of what we know about tapered
roller bearings, or fine alloy steel, and their infinite applications. Hopefully,
you'll teach us something, too.
You can be an indoor-type working on straight application engineering,
research, testing and production. Or you can be an indoor-outdoor-type
and work in sales engineering. It doesn't matter—choice of asM/nment is
up to you.
Challenging assignments
If you choose the latter group, you'll work in automotive, industrial, and
railway bearing sales—or steel sales—helping customers solve their engineering
problems, which are also ours.
Some of our recent efforts: bearing engineering for a telephone cable-laying
ship now crossing the Pacific, the Alweg Monorail, the world's tallest crane
and biggest strip mining shovel, Craig Breedlove's Spirit of America, a
moveable grandstand for the new District of Columbia stadium. Steel prob-
lem solving for Atlas missile silos, Project Mohole, the latest Kaman Heli-
copters, a 400-foot crane boom and hundreds of automotive gear and die
applications.
We won't forget you
Advancement is not restricted to one department or division. A steel sales
engineer may be transferred to automotive sales and from there to Inter-
national. Whatever your job, we'll never forget where we've put you. This is
one of the advantages of working for a company that is the world's largest
producer of tapered roller bearings and a foremost producer of seamless
steel tubing, but is not the world's largest corporation. We employ about
20,000.
The Timken Company has three products: Bearings, Steel, Rock Bits.
Uses for these products number in the growing thousands. And there is
always something new stirring.
The dramatic switch of the nation's railroad freight cars to roller bearings,
a field we pioneered, is an example.
An international company
There are 31 Timken Company sales offices in the United States and Canada.
Practically every major city has one.
We serve markets in 119 countries from 14 manufacturing plants located
in Australia, Brazil, Canada, England, France, South Africa and the U.S.
And we're still growing strong.

which has developed new courses in such
fields as orbital mechanics, hypersonics, and
magnetohydrodynamics to meet the needs of
the aerospace industry. Since 1915 the cur-
riculum has broadened steadily to include
both undergraduate and graduate work in
aeronautics and astronautics. Propulsion, areo-
dynamics, structures and instrumentation are
emphasized.

Abnormalities Which Influence Wood
Behavior
Factors discussed in the previous
section apply to clear wood. Inasmuch
as wood is a biological material, how-
ever, growth characteristics do occur
and many of these alter the normal
properties. Naturally occurring char-
acteristics in the tree such as grain
deviation, knots, shake, and reaction
wood all influence the behavior of
wood which may contain them. Each
of these can be readily recognized
and their effect predicted.
Under some conditions, wood is
subject to attack by certain foreign
organisms. Fungi and a few insects
may feed on it and thereby deterior-
ate its properties. Fortunately dry
wood is immune to most organisms
and susceptible woods which must be
wet for prolonged periods in service
can be protected by chemical impreg-
nation.
An obvious means of minimizing
the influence of defects in wood is
to eliminate them or control their lo-
cation. Thanks to modern wood ad-
hesives which effect bonds stronger
than the wood itself under all expos-
ure conditions, this can be done.
Where exacting strength is required,
glued-wood products such as plywood,
laminates, and combinations of wood
in various forms or with other ma-
terials frequently satisfy the require-
ments.
Summary
Wood, our only renewable struc-
tural material, has proven engineering
applications and, because of a unique
combination of favorable character-
istics, it has the future potential of
serving many more. As a complex
product of nature, however, wood has
many unusual aspects of behavior
which must be understood if it is to
be used effectively. Wood scientists
and technologists have developed
much knowledge which makes wood
a predictable engineering material
and are continuously adding to this
knowledge through the world's re-
search laboratories. With this infor-
mation available, wood both in un-
modified form and modified to take
advantage of its assets and minimize
its deficiencies should be more useful
to the engineer in the future.

We are the chemical company that an electromechanical
designer might be operating some day
The chemistry of photography is far from being all of
chemistry that concerns us. Actually, it is rapidly going
into hiding inside such machines as these automatic x-ray
processors for hospitals, seen here under construction.
We need electromechanical engineers to design all
kinds of automatic photographic apparatus that we have
ideas for—big ones, little ones, simple ones, super-sophisti-
cated ones, inexpensive ones to sell by the millions, very
expensive ones for maybe internal use only.
We need process engineers, by which we mean those
who figure out the best way to make what the designers
have dreamed up.
We need industrial engineers, who work out the most
rational relationships between apparatus and people—the
people who work in the plants and even on occasion the
people who buy or use our products.
This is a great place for all categories of engineers. How-
ever, we think in categories largely for hiring purposes.
There is such a thing as mobility, and it doesn't have
to be geographical.
Incidentally, we still need chemical engineers. Maybe
you are one and maybe you join us and maybe you turn
out to be such a whiz at your profession that after a while
we ask you to operate an electromechanical plant for us.

GROWTH THROUGH TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE
The Role of
R&amp;D in Industry
Q- Dr. Haller, how does General Electric define that overworked term, Re-
search and Development?
A. At General Electric we consider "R&amp;D" to cover a whole spectrum of
activities, ranging from basic scientific investigation for its own sake to
the constant efforts of engineers in our manufacturing departments to
improve their products—even in small ways. Somewhere in the middle
of this range is an area we call simply "technology", the practical know-
how that couples scientific knowledge with the engineering of products
and services to meet customer needs.
Q. How is General Electric organized to do research and development?
A. Our Company has four broad product groups—Aerospace and Defense,
Consumer, Electric Utility, and Industrial. Each group is divided into
divisions, and each division into departments. The departments are like
separate businesses, responsible for engineering their products and serving
their markets. So one end of the R&amp;D spectrum is clearly a department
function—engineering and product design. At the other end is the Re-
search Laboratory which performs both basic and applied research for
the whole Company, and the Advanced Technology Laboratories which
also works for the whole Company in the vital linking function of putting
new knowledge to practical use.
Having centralized services of Research and Advanced Technology does
not mean that divisions or departments cannot set up their own R&amp;D
operations, more or less specialized to their technical or market interesls.
There are many such laboratories; e.g., in electronics, nuclear power, space
technology, polymer chemistry, jet engine technology, and so on.
Q. Doesn't such a variety of kinds of R&amp;D hamper the Company's potential
contribution? Don't you find yourselves stepping on each other's toes?
A. On the contrary! With a great many engineers and scientists working
intensively on the problems they understand better than anyone else, we
go ahead simultaneously on many fronts. Our total effort is broadened.
Our central, Company-wide services in Research and Advanced Tech-
nology are enhanced by this variety of effort by individual departments.
O. How is Advanced Technology Services organized?
A. There are three Advanced Technology Laboratories: Chemical and
Materials Engineering, Electrical and Information Engineering, and Me-
chanical Engineering; and the Nuclear Materials and Propulsion Opera-
tion. The Laboratories do advanced technology work on their own, with
Company funds, and on contract to product departments or outside customers
and government agencies. NMPO works for the AEC and the military to
develop materials and systems for high-temperature, high-power, low-
weight nuclear reactors. ATS is the Company's communication and in-
formation center for disseminating new technologies. It also plans and
develops potential new business areas for General Electric.
Q. So R&amp;D at General Electric is the work of a great many men in a great
many areas?
A. Of course. The world is going through a vast technological revolution—
in the ways men can handle energy, materials, and information. Our
knowledge is increasing exponentially. In the last five years we have
spent more than half the money ever spent for research and development.
To keep competitive, and to grow, industry must master that mountain of
new knowledge and find ways to put it to practical use for mankind. Only
by knowing his field well and keeping up with the rush of new develop-
ments, can the young engineer contribute to the growth of his industry—
and society as a whole.

This tiny device is an ultra-reliable Westinghouse TV amplifier

It can replace all these wires and electronic parts

For information on a career at Westinghouse, an equal opportunity employer,
"With fewer parts and connections," sule. Actually, the electronics are on a bit that's half an inch square and an inch long.
Westinghouse scientists decided, "we'd
have a much more reliable amplifier."
So they developed a new kind, using
techniques called "molecular electronics."
The device is a functional electronic block,
one quarter-inch square. (That's the cap-
of specially-treated silicon the size of a
chip diamond.)
Other Westinghouse functional elec-
tronic blocks are just as small. They're
used in experimental products like a
pocket-size TV camera and a radio receiver
Today, Westinghouse makes these ultra-
reliable little devices mostly for military
applications.
One day, you'll find them in electronic
products everywhere.
You can be sure ... if it's Westinghouse.

Freedom &amp; Discipline
Modern physics has identified 34 elementary
particles of matter—each with its twin anti-parti-
cle. The inevitable two opposing forces that keep
the universe in balance.
We think at the heart of most well-run modern
companies there are also two opposing and equally
important forces—freedom and discipline.
Freedom to innovate, to change, develop and
invent. Plus the discipline to stick to the facts, to
stick to the problem, to stay within the budget.
At Celanese we try to combine freedom and dis-
cipline to better serve our customers, our share-
holders, and our employees.
Perhaps we are the company at which you can
best pursue your career. If you are trained in

MANAGERS ALL
Today's engineering student is an interesting specimen.
The primary source motivating him through his four to five
years of study is his conception of his position in industry
after graduation. He is able to endure long hours in labora-
tories and the mountain of associated seemingly menial tasks
in the belief that he will somehow be above this when he is
finally hired. He pictures himself as a member of "manage-
ment" after a few short years.
Perhaps this state of mind is a consequence of the intensive
recruitment campaign. Students are enticed into engineering
careers by the prospect of high starting salaries. They are told
of former students who have "made good" and now command
large salaries in positions of great responsibility. Unfortunately
many of these students are in for a big surprise!
The pyramid of personnel still exists. "Too many chiefs
without enough Indians," is still valid if somewhat trite.
Everyone is not going to be a company director, vice-president
or manager. Even the supervision of a staff of fifty men, some-
what small by modern proportions, is open to a comparatively
few people. Those fifty other men could very well be engineers
too. All of them are not fresh out of college; quite to the
contrary, they most probably have been in the company for
many years.
What seems to be the prospects for the young engineers?
If his principal goal remains that of attaining position in a
corporation, the student should consider a few facts of life.
The first has been mentioned—not everyone will make it.
Second, a good deal of back slapping goes on in industry. The
man with the best set of dentures may get the promotion. To
avoid this course of action, detested by many, the young en-
gineer must be so good as to stand out among his competitors.
10
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


must put out extra effort. This combination will make it hard
for anyone to overlook him. Third, if he believes he possesses
this combination which continually is not rewarded, the en-
gineer should consider relocation. Many times students report,
after summer employment, that persons of questionable abil-
ity were advanced over others who seemed to qualify. Perhaps
the employee was labelled a failure or unfit for responsibility
early in his career so that his later accomplishments were not
considered. In these instances a change of scenery with new
people making evaluations is probably the key to greater
success. One might better move than stagnate.
This is perhaps a bit bleak and harsh. Advancing beyond
some fellow workers will not be hard. Many do not place their
work at the pinnacle of their endeavors. So long as they have
a comfortable income, they would rather be active in lodges
or civic organizations and avoid the responsibilities of the
managing positions and its associated heart attacks and ulcers.
Also, satisfaction with a well-done project may be more reward-
ing than a few extra dollars could ever hope to be. In the end
a string of successful accomplishments may lead to that promo-
tion which had always before slipped out of reach.
What then is the outlook? Attainment of a responsible cor-
porate position is a fine goal. But achievement of it will require
maximum output all of the time, maximum interest in the
company as a whole as well as a particular project and a mini-
mum amount of frustration when another person gets the
gravy—for the moment. If these are kept in mind, today's
young engineer may in fact find himself being given the reins
of management which he seeks.

What
opportunities
are open at
s:
The range of work done at
IBM requires many different
academic disciplines. Your
education may well have
prepared you for entering
a broad field of opportunity:
• science and engineering
• computer programming
Each of these fields is
especially diverse because
IBM designs, makes, and
sells hundreds of different
products, supplies, and
services —in fact, complete
systems—for expediting the
handling of information.
If you have a creative
imagination, IBM can prov.ide
a practical foundation for
exploring such areas as
research, development,
manufacturing, and marketing,
among others. A logical
approach to problems in
scientific investigation is
necessary, and is usually
based on a solid background
in physical science or
engineering.
But these are by no means
rigid limitations. For, as you
would expect of a vigorous
and youthful company, recent
arrivals at IBM represent a
tremendous variety of
interest, experience, and
What
career can
you launch at
Science and Engineering.
A kaleidoscopic variety of
scientific and engineering
work goes into the research,
development, and manufac-
ture of IBM products.
A group may work on creating
new solid state devices-
designing new machine
organizations—or developing
new manufacturing processes.
Other teams may work out
further applications of IBM
systems—for instance, for the
control of manufacturing
operations.
Programming. A computer
processes information exactly
according to step-by-step
directions. These programs
must be ordered in the most
efficient and logical pattern.
You may program an IBM
system to solve procedural
business problems in
finance or complex scientific
problems involving millions
of calculations. You may be
a member of a team
programming the nearly
superhuman computations
required for a space probe.
Which majors
and minors
are useful at
Judge for yourself from
this partial listing. In the
past, graduates with
degrees in the following
fields have joined IBM:
chemistry
electrical engineering
electronics
industrial engineering
machine and structural design
mathematics
mechanical engineering
metallurgy
physics....
What
degrees will

We have people with us
who hold practically every
sort of baccalaureate.
However, our main interest
is centered in the physical
sciences, mathematics,
electronics, and engineering.
Many new employees at IBM
also have advanced degrees.
They are masters and doctors
representing many different
fields of knowledge.
This breadth of academic
background, as well as the
emphasis on problem-solving
at IBM, helps account for
the climate of intellectual
vitality. Whatever their main
interests, our people seem
to enjoy tackling problems
that require an imaginative
approach.

Result: More rust-resistant steel than
ever before on 1964 Ford-built bodies!
Ford Motor Company, pioneer in the use of galvanized
(zinc-clad) steel, long noted for its ability to fight off
rust, is using increased amounts of this superior
material in 1964 car models. This marks further
progress in our continuing efforts to solve the prob-
lems of metal corrosion in car bodies.
Other Ford-developed rust fighters include special
zinc-rich primers . . . aluminum and stainless steels
in mufflers, moldings and body fasteners . . . quality
baked-enamel finishes—all powerful barriers against
rust in Ford-built cars and trucks.
A new process, now in limited test production, is the
electrocoating of entire car bodies. This involves
electrical attraction between positively charged metal
surfaces and negatively charged paint particles. When
the body is dipped in an aqueous solution containing
the paint particles, a form of "electroplating" occurs,
the paint seeking those areas with the least coverage,
until a complete and uniform coating is deposited.

University of Michigan
Scientific and technological advances in recent years have
created a demand for trained engineers that is growing faster
than the supply of young talent coming into the field. This
need for the engineer is obvious, for on every hand his skill
and handiwork make their imprint on the observer's eyes,
ears, and movements. Each year new words spring into use be-
cause his ingenuity has added values to human kind.
Some of these values make it easier to talk or visit with
one's neighbors; some simply make living enjoyable and com-
fortable or more healthful; other values reduce the load on
man's muscles and release him from the slavery of spending
all his time to provide the necessities that merely sustain life—
they give him time for exploring the unknowns that envelope
his every glance and step.
Engineering enrollments reached a post-war peak in 1957.
During the next five years, when the total college enroll-
ments experienced a 35% increase; the engineering enroll-
ment fell off 6%. Recent reports indicate that a low point in
the enrollment nationally was reached in September 1963.
At The University of Michigan the number of freshmen enter-
ing from high school increased by 11% over those enrolled
in 1962.
Opportunities for employment continue to be attractive.
Engineering is a rewarding field, not only in terms of the
financial return but also in the many varieties of employ-
ment open to its members today. Today's graduates use their
engineering experience and background in a variety of fields
such as research and development, production, purchasing,
sales, merchandising and financial operations. Engineering
provides excellent training for anyone with administrative
ability. Many executives, particularly in technical industries,
started in engineering assignments.
In selecting the profession of engineering for a career, a
student accepts a very real responsibility for the well-being of
his fellow man. This is not an easy path to choose, but is one
filled with thrilling satisfactions. The horizons are unlimited

for the student who has the qualifications and the will to
succeed. The best criteria by which a student may judge for
himself while in high school are solid ability in mathematics,
science and English; a sense of curiosity, which makes him
want to know more about how something is put together;
and a creative urge to build a better product or find a better
method of doing a job.
Deciding on a life's work is a serious business. It should
be done with the best possible help and advice. The Admis-
ions Office of The University of Michigan and the officers and
advisers of the College of Engineering will gladly be of serv-
ice in assisting students with career planning.
Selecting a college is also an important decision. In speak-
ing for The University of Michigan, College of Engineering, I
am glad to call to your attention several unusual features:
1. Instruction is provided in a wide variety of programs
from the freshman year to completion of Ph.D., and a student
may transfer into the College at various stages of his profes-
sional development.
2. With a student body carefully selected from applicants
from many states and foreign countries, it is truly a high
quality cosmopolitan institution.
3. The excellent research facilities and resources of the
College provide the teachers of professional subjects with
valuable experiences in their fields of instruction and encour-
age a high level of professional competence. In addition, many
students will find opportunities among the many research
activities to do engineering work while learning, and to help
finance their education.
4. With a well selected student body, a research-minded
faculty, and excellent laboratory and library facilities, the
College provides the kind of learning environment that stimu-
lates its students to high levels of achievement.
Qualified high school seniors are invited to apply for ad-
mission to engineering at The University of Michigan.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


by Eric Austad
There is currently a general accep-
tance of the idea that all animal be-
havior, from the simplest to the most
complex, arises from the nervous sys-
tem.1 There is a question, however, of
how highly this system must be de-
veloped before directed, or "con-
scious," behavior may be exhibited.
The main structures of primate
brains are found in all other verte-
brate brains, and apparently have
been present for as long as 400 mil-
lion years.2 Perhaps these structures,
such as the cerebellum, the medulla
oblongata, and the cortex, are prere-
quisites to this higher behavior; but
there is also the possibility that cer-
tain psychological characteristics are
more ancient and widespread than
the physiological structures from
which they appear to have arisen.
Thus, it would be significant to note
the stage of development which is
necessary to permit formation and re-
tention of these patterns of behavior.
In this respect, attention was drawn
to the planarian worm as an excellent
subject for experimentation due to its
unique position on the phylogenetic
scale.3
Planarians are of the phylum Platy-
helmenthes, or flat worms, and as
such are the simplest organisms to dis-
play bilateral symmetry, a true
synaptic nervous system, and a distinct
head end. This "head" contains two
masses of neural tissue which may be
considered a primative brain; and two
longitudinal nerve cords pass poster-
iorly, serving to connect many trans-
verse nerve fibers.4 Thus, planaria do
not have the complex nervous struc-
tures which some theories hold to be
necessary for "conscious" behavior,
but they do possess a nervous system
which could prove sufficient if this be-
havior is based on neurons rather
than entire structures. Some of the
more recent experimentation with
planaria will be examined with the
objects of: (1) determining whether
or not planaria are able to display
directed behavior; (2) the degree of
complexity, if any, to which this be-
havior may be carried out; (3) pos-
sible explanations of the neural mech-
anisms involved; and (4) the implica-
tions of this experimentation.
Many early experimenters with
planarians tried various sorts of clas-
sical conditioning in an effort to es-
tablish the fact that conditioning
them was possible; but they were un-
aware of certain unlearned modifica-
tions in behavior called pseudo-con-
ditioning, which results from constant
exposure of an animal to non-specific
stimuli. The first classical condition-
ing experiments with planaria to be
generally accepted were carried out
by Thompson and McConnell at the
University of Texas in 1955. Their
purpose was "to determine the facility
with which planarians develop condi-
tioned responses under conditions of
massed training."5
The basic plan was to pair an un-
conditioned stimulus, in the form of
a weak electric shock, with a change
in illumination (the conditioned sti-
mulus). If repetition of this pairing
eventually lead to responses when the
conditioned stimulus was presented
alone, the animal was considered to
be conditioned. The actual apparatus
used consisted of a semi-circular plas-
tic trough filled with pond water to a
depth of 1.2 cm., a low-current source
of D.C. electricity with electrodes at
each end of the trough, and 2 100-w.
lights centered above the trough to
serve as the conditioned stimulus
(CS). Overhead lighting was kept to a
minimum (40 w. at a height of 12
feet), and the entire apparatus was
positioned so no shadows fell on the
water; thus, undesired stimuli were
kept to a minimum.6 Preliminary ex-
perimentation showed that planarians
reacted in two distinct ways to the US
(shock): there was a sharp turning of
the head region to one side or the
other, and a longitudinal contraction
of the entire body. In this experiment
and those to follow, either action was
considered a positive response. Since
the basic procedures used in this ex-
periment have become quite wide-
spread for use in other experiments,
it is desirable to study diem in some
detail.
The subjects were divided into four
groups of ten each; each group hav-
ing an equal median length. The ex-
perimental group (E) received both
light and shock, the shock-control
group (SC) received shock alone to
determine whether or not this shock
sensitized the worms to light, the
light-control group (LC) controlled
for responses due to light alone, and a
response-control group (RC) was used
to determine how often the animals
might appear to respond even though
no stimulus was applied. Group E
was given a total of 150 trials, each
trial consisting of light-shock pairing
where the duration of the light was
three seconds and the shock was ap-
plied during the last second. Group
LC received 150 trials also, but with-
out the shock; thus, any response
would be due to light alone. SC re-
ceived 150 shocks in series of fives, af-
ter which light was presented alone to
measure shock sensitization; reacting
to light alone would indicate that this
sensitization had taken place. Finally,
the RC group was observed with no
stimuli present to determine how of-
ten false reactions took place in the

specified time. The SC group was
found to have an insignificant change
in its level of response, thus eliminat-
ing the possibility of shock sensitiza-
tion. The results of the other groups
tested are shown in Figure I.7
The fact that the increase in re-
sponses of E was not due to light
alone is borne out by the performance
of the light-control group which re-
ceived no shock; in fact, the responses
of LC decreased as the experiment
progressed. In like manner, the de-
crease in reaction of RC with the pas-
sage of time would indicate that there
is no tendency for the activity level
to rise independently of the stimuli
applied. It would seem, then, that a
conditioned response can definitely
be established in planaria through the
use of shock and light. The experi-
ment has been criticized on the basis
of both the number of subjects used
and the use of light as a CS (light
elicits a variety of responses in the
naive planarian)9, but the basic find-
ings of the experiment have been
replicated with enough regularity to
cause general acceptance of the re-
sults.10-11-12
The previously described experi-
ment and its verifications have estab-
lished the fact that a vertebrate-type
of brain structure is not necessary in
order for an organisms to acquire sim-
ple conditioned behavior. The next
logical step was to determine the
length of time that this primitive ner-
vous system is capable of retaining its
"learned" behavior. Planaria prove
especially interesting in studies of re-
tention, for when they are cut into
sections, each is able to regenerate a
complete organism. Thus, two ques-
tions present themselves: how long
can a conditioned planarian "remem-
ber" the conditioning; and to what
extent, if any, will the regenerated
sections of a conditioned subject re-
tain this "learning"?
In an attempt to answer these ques-
tions, McConnell, Allan, Jacobson, and
D. F. Kimble devised an experiment
based on conditioning subjects to a
certain criterion of responses (23 re-
sponses out of 25 consecutive trials)
and latter measuring the number of
trials necessary to regain this criterion.
The apparatus used was similar to that
described in the original experiments
involving conditioning; but in this
case, three groups of five subjects each
were used. The experimental group
(E) was conditioned to a criterion
and then cut into two pieces trans-
versely through the center; the re-
generation control group (RC) was
not conditioned before cutting to de-
termine if cutting and regeneration
might cause sensitization to the con-
ditioning which was to follow; and
the time control group (TC) was con-
ditioned but not cut to determine the
normal effect of time on planarian
memory.
The results (Fig. II) indicate: (1)
that planarians are able to somehow
store this conditioning in some type
of memory system, (2) that regener-
ated head and tail sections are equal
in their retention of the conditioning,
and (3) that the retention in cut sub-
jects is as complete as it is in their
uncut counterparts.13 The implica-
tion is, then, that planaria are not
only able to retain the conditioned
response; but also that whatever
mechanism permits this retention is
found in some form throughout the
animal, not just in the "brain." This
is necessarily true if the equality of
trials necessary to reattain the criter-
ion level is accepted for the heads and
tails. The experiment could be criti-
cized on the basis of the small number
of subjects used and the great range
of trial scores obtained, but here
again the basic conclusions reached
have been verified with enough regu-
larity by other experimenters to cause
general acceptance.141518
From these experimental results,
McConnell, now at Michigan, theor-
ized that the storage of this "mem-
ory," or conditioning, was imple-
mented through a chemical change in
the subject's body resulting from repe-
tition of the stimulus and its response.
To test this hypothesis, he, Reeva
Jacobson and D. M. Maynard took
naive planarians, cut off their tails
and conditioned the heads be-
fore any regeneration could take
place. The animals then grew new
tails, which were removed and al-
lowed to regenerate new heads; thus,
totally regenerated organisms were
formed. Upon testing for retention, or
"saving," the regenerated worms
showed a significant "memory" of
what the original head had learned.
The total regenerate did not show the
degree of retention that an uncut con-
ditioned control had shown, but there
did seem to be a substantial difference
between the original training and the
training after the total regeneration
(Fig. III).17 While this did not defin-
itely prove that this mechanism of re-
tention is chemical in nature, it does
add support to the theory.
While McConnel and others were
adding strength to this chemical
theory of "memory," Roy John and

William Corning, of the University of
Rochester, reasoned from experiments
involving radio isotope exchange data
on brain compounds that this mech-
anism must involve a substance "capa-
ble of maintaining a structural modi-
fication by imposing an experientially
specified configuration on molecules
being built in neural tissue. Imposi-
tion of the additional requirement
that this substance be cytoplasmic in
nature (living material within the cell
but exclusive of the nucleus) directs
attention to ribonucleic acid
(RNA)"18 This theory is strengthened
considerably by the work of Hyden,
who found changes in the RNA in
nerve cells as a result of experience;19
and by Morrell, who discovered an
increase in RNA concentration as a
result of prior excitation.20
In earlier work with Wenzel and
Tschirgi, John discovered that injec-
tions of ribonuclease, a substance
which breaks up RNA by hydrolyzing
it,21 interfered with pattern discrimi-
nation for food in cats, but not with
conditioned avoidance responses to
visual or auditory stimuli. The chemi-
cal and physiological interpretation
of these results proved so complex,
however, that no definite conclusions
could be drawn. Thus, John and
Coming's decision to use planaria as
a subject resulted mainly from the
desire to use a comparatively simple
organism which is capable of con-
ditioning.22
After confirming the McConnell,
Jacobson, and Kimble findings that
both heads and tails of regenerated
conditioned planaria retain equal ef-
fects of learning experience, John and
Corning theorized that, if RNA is in-
volved, regenerating the cut segments
in ribonuclease might result in obli-
terating or altering the coded "mem-
ory."
The actual experiment was similar
in many ways to the previously de-
scribed work done on planarian re-
generation: subjects were trained to a
level of criterion (34 responses out of
40 trials), then cut, regenerated, and
brought back to the level of criterion
through retraining. The degree of re-
training necessary served as a measure
of retention. Ten groups of animals
were used, which were further broken
down into five pairs. Each pair re-
ceived equal treatment in all respects
but one: one member of the pair was
regenerated in pond water, while the
other was placed in ribonuclease for
regeneration. Groups I and II show
the effects of the ribonuclease on re-
generating heads and tails as com-
pared to those regenerated in pond
water; Groups III and IV controlled
possible sensitization due to transec-
tion and the possible effects of ribonu-
clease on structures necessary to ac-
quire the conditioned response;
Groups V and VI provided a control
on the time necessary to carry out the
experiment; VII and VIII controlled
the possibility that the reapppearance
of the conditioned response may be
simply a function of time rather than
retraining; and IX and X were used
to indicate whether or not ribonu-
clease acts only at a regenerating in-
terface.
From the results proving significant
(Fig. IV), it was concluded that: (1)
conditioned tails regenerated in ribo-
nuclease do not retain the condition-
ed response, (2) conditioned heads re-
generated in ribonuclease do not dif-
fer significantly from controls, (3)
ribonuclease does not effect intact tis-
sue, (4) regeneration in ribonuclease
does not interfere with acquisition of
new conditioning, and (5) effects of
transection and time are not factors.
Particularly curious among these re-
sults is the fact that tails regenerated
in ribonuclease are effected, while the
heads are not. This may be due to the
inability of the large ribonuclease
molecules to reach the front of the
head due to its size, but it has also
been theorized that two separate
"memory" systems are involved: the
chemical mechanism (RNA), which is
spread throughout the body, and a

tralized in the primative brain. Per-
haps this physical mechanism, if it
exists, is the base of a branch of evolu-
tion which leads to the vertebrate
brains; it seems plausable that, in de-
veloping from lower forms of life, the
vertebrates selected this mechanism
as most suited to their needs and em-
phasized it while permitting the
chemical mechanism to degenerate.
These implications, however, will be
given further consideration after all
of the experimental evidence has been
presented.
It should be noted at this point
that, while the results of this experi-
ment seem to support the RNA
theory very strongly, there are still
many factors which must be account-
ed for before any definite conclusions
can be reached. The RNA model does
provide a plausable explanation for
many of the observed phenomena, but
very little is known of its actual na-
ture. In addition, other models of
memory transfer in planaria involving
DNA, plastids, and various parts of
the nucleus seem to work equally
well. The experiment involving ribo-
nuclease is impressive, but actually be-
came so complex and time-consuming
that it has not, as yet been repeated
for verification. Furthermore, the na-
ture of ribonuclease itself is not well
understood; it is a very strong enzyme
which reacts so vigorously that it
could also affect other parts of the
cell. It is not specific enough to claim
that RNA alone is affected.23 It would
be very significant to inject pure RNA
from a conditioned subject into a
naive one, for an acquisition of condi-
tioning through this method would
definitely establish the fact that RNA
is involved. This has not, as yet been
accomplished, but work is progressing
in that direction.
While methods for the injection of
pure RNA and other possible "mem-
ory" chemicals are developing, how-
ever, McConnell and others at Michi-
gan have been carrying on further
experiments which seem to lend even
more support to the theory that this
"memory transfer" is at least partially
based on a chemical mechanism. They
reasoned that, if a chemical was re-
sponsible, transfer should be possible
if it could somehow be removed from
the trained worm and placed into a
naive subject. At first grafting and in-
jections were tried, but there was lit-
tle success due to the planarian's

small size. It was then noted that the
planarian digestive system is so primi-
tive that it uses no enzymes to break
down ingested molecules; instead, it
contains cells which engulf these
molecules in an amoeba-like fashion.
Thus, they are incorporated into the
system of the planarian with little or
no change in structure. Working on
the assumption that this would occur,
MConnell, Barbara Humphries, and
A. L. Jacobson chopped up criterion-
conditioned planarians and fed them
to naive "cannibal" subjects. A sec-
ond naive group was fed naive worms
to control for sensitization due to can-
nibalism alone. Upon retraining, the
cannibals fed on conditioned worms
showed a significantly higher degree
of retention (Fig. V).-4 Repetition of
the experiment has met with general
verification, although there seems to
be a great deal of variation in the
ability of individual worms to acquire
the conditioned response.25
This adds even more support to the
"chemical theory" of conditioning in
planaria, but should not be inter-
preted to imply that the chemical is
RNA; any of the other cell compon-
ents considered as possible carriers
would also have been transferred in
the process. Then too, it is possible

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


cut worms were incorporated into the
cannibal. In this case the transfer
would be at the organic rather than
molecular level, and the conditioned
behavior would be expected in the
formerly naive worm. The experi-
ment is significant; it implies that
"memory," at least in planaria, in-
voles some type of structure which
may be transmitted and has the po-
tential of being isolated.
A possible interpretation of this
experiment which should be avoided
involves questions such as, "Is Knowl-
edge Edible?",26 the title of a recent
article on planarian learning. It
should be remembered that the ability
of cannibal planaria to gain "knowl-
edge" from their victims was due pri-
marily to their rudimentary digestive
systems. There is no reason to believe
that higher animals with enzymatic
digestive systems would benefit in any
way whatsoever from the "knowl-
edge" of the organisms which they
may eat.
Perhaps it would be well to sum-
marize briefly the experimental data
presented to this point. It has been
quite well established that planaria
are capable of being conditioned to
a light-shock stimulus-response pat-
tern; and that this response is re-
tained to some degree even if the
planarian is cut and allowed to re-
generate, indicating a mechanism of
"memory" which is spread through-
out the animal. Further experimenta-
tion indicates that this mechanism
may be related to RNA, but no defin-
ite conclusions have been reached in
this respect. One of the objectives at
the outset of this paper was to con-
sider whether or not a simple organ-
ism such as the planarian is capable
of conscious, or directed, behavior.
We are now faced with a problem in
semantics: does a simple conditioned
response qualify as directed behavior?
Obviously, the worm is able to ex-
perience at least two types of stimu-
lation (shock and light), and his re-
sponse to the CS is due to some type
of association between the two. If
this ability to associate two stimuli is
accepted as a criterion for directed be-
havior, the animal may be considered
"conscious." The criterion, itself,
however, seems quite questionable;
perhaps the planarian is able to dis-
play robot-like behavior which util-
izes neural connections without any
need for conscious behavior. Further

T-maze for conditioning planaria. The planarian must keep trying until he picks
the right color, at which time he is rewarded with a rest. Notice Dr. McConnell's

cates, however, that this may not be
the case.
While working on planarian condi-
tioning, they found that shortly after
their subjects reached peak perform-
ance, they lapsed into a state of lethar-
gy very similar to boredom. This be-
havior seemed to parallel reactions of
higher experimental animals which
resulted from a kind of emotional re-
sponse to the entire test situation. By
adapting the maze in which the con-
ditioning was being carried on to give
the worms more movement freedom,
the cause of the "boredom" seemed to
be eliminated.27 In another experi-
ment, they noted what seemed to be
anxiety, or caution, in the planarian
subjects. Worms that had fasted for
various lengths of time were divided
into two groups, and one group was
given a familiarization period in a
small plastic recepticle. The recepti-
cle was then washed to remove any
"markers" which the subjects might
have left behind. Food was then
placed in the receptacle, and the fa-
miliarized animals were returned.
The length of time it took them to
begin eating was then measured.
Worms which had not been familiar-
ized with the receptacle were then sim-
iliarly tested, and it was found that
the familiarized worms ate consider-
able sooner in all cases. This delay in
feeding is normally interpreted in
higher animal experimentation to in-
dicate anxiety; moreover, it would im-
ply that the familiarized worms were
somehow able to "remember" the re-
ceptacle. Similar anxiety was indicated
in further experiments where plana-
rians were placed in a receptacle and
shocked. Upon later testing in the
same receptacle, they delayed feeding
much longer than those which had
not been shocked.'-'8 Thus, we have

Metallography is the study of the
physical and structural properties of
metals and alloys by the use of a
microscope. The photomicrograph, or
a photograph taken through a micro-
scope, is a vital part of metallography,
because it provides a permanent rec-
ord, and permits a more leisurely
study by an individual or group.
Thus, it becomes apparent, that
photomicrographs of metal specimens
can easily be used as valuable teach-
ing aids in metallurgy courses.
The Mechanical Engineering De-
partment of the University of Michi-
gan is in the process of preparing sev-
eral series of color photomicrographs
of metal specimens for class use. The
specimens used in the series were
both ferrous and non-ferrous, and
varied over a wide hardness range.
The pictures on these pages are from
this series, and the data in this arti-
cle pertain to the specific equipment
used.
Equipment
The photomicrographs were taken
with a Heiland (now Honeywell)
Pen tax adapted for use with a Bausch
and Lomb microscope. The adaptor
substitutes the eye-piece of the micro-
scope for the lens of the camera.
The opaqueness of the specimens
necessitates the use of an incident
rather than reflected light source. The
Bausch and Lomb microscope is
coupled with a vertical illuminator
which directs the light from a six volt
coil filament lamp through the objec-
tive to the specimen.
The light source is fitted with two
diaphragms, field and aperature. The
field diaphragm is used to minimize
internal glare, and provide proper
contrast, while ensuring that the field
of the microscope is filled. The aper-
ture diaphragm controls the depth of
field, and the amount of light reach-
ing the specimen, thus, also control-
ling the flare and contrast.

Although a coil filament is not as
bright as the carbon arc, common to
studies of this nature, it has the defin-
ite advantages of providing a more
constant light source and not requir-
ing frequent filament changes. How-
ever, the low color temperature of a
coil filament requires the use of com-
pensating filters (Kodak 82A and
82C) to match the light for which the
color film (Kodak Ektachrome F) was
balanced by the manufacturer.

posure can be a serious problem in

photomicrography. Several manufac-
turers produce photoelectric light-
meters that are sensitive enough to
measure the low illumination level
encountered in metallographic work.
These meters are especially useful if
color reversal film with little latitude
is being used. When a meter is not
available, exposure determination be-
comes a matter of judgment on the
part of the photographer. If a color
transparency film is being used it is
necessary to select an exposure time
that gives proper detail in the lightest
section of the specimen in order to
prevent a washed-out appearance due
to overexposure. Kodak calls this the
"Maximum Brightness Criteron." A
trial and error process in which the
exposure time is varied by one second
in each frame will provide a guide for
the proper exposure of a particular
material if a meter is unavailable.
After a few trials the photographer
should not have much difficulty in
determining the proper exposure for
a given specimen. It should be noted
that the exposure will vary relative to
the different objectives used. This is
due to a property of the objective
called the Numerical Aperture. The
light gathering power of an objective
increases roughly as the square of the
Numerical Aperture. For example,
photomicrographs at 400 X require
approximately double the exposure as
those taken at 80X. The N.A. of the
higher magnifying objective is larger
than that of the smaller one by a
factor of approximately the square-
root of two.

Specimen Preparation
Before any specimen may be photo-
graphed it must first be properly
polished and etched. This is a rather
lengthy and exacting process, but it is
simple to understand. After the de-
sired treatment such as annealing,
quenching, or rolling, a piece is cut
from the "parent" specimen (approxi-
mately 14 in. sq.) and mounted in
bakelite or a suitable plastic. The
specimen is then polished, first, on a
series of five emery papers, and then
on two Alumnia polishing wheels.
The first with a grit of 5 microns and
the second with a grit of 0.3 microns.
After polishing the specimen must
be etched. Polishing leaves a mirror-
like finish covered with a thin layer of
plastically deformed metal, which
must be removed to show the true
structure of the specimen. Extreme
care must be exercised during etching
for two main reasons. First, the depth
of etch must not be too great or the
depth of field of the microscope will
be exceeded. The depth of field is the
range between the points closest to
and farthest from the lens that are in
sharp focus. In microscopic work this
field is very small, usually in the
range of a few microns, and overetch-
ing will prevent a critically focused
photomicrograph. Second, the length
of exposure will vary with the depth
of etch. This is particularly true with
a carburized specimen where over-
etching leaves relatively large
amounts of carbon predominant in
the casing and presents a "false" pic-
ture.
Sometimes a student can grasp in-
stantaneously by looking at a picture
that which he may never understand
through explanation. Thus, visual
aids, such as these photomicrographs
of various metal specimens, can pro-
vide a great deal of help, both to the
instructor and student.

ON THE MOON...
Our world-recognized trademark—"the P&amp;WA eagle"—has been
identified with progress in flight propulsion for almost four decades,
spanning the evolution of power from yesterday's reciprocating
engines to today's rockets. Tomorrow will find that same Pratt &amp;
Whitney Aircraft eagle carrying men and equipment to the moon and
to even more distant reaches of outer space.
Engineering achievement of this magnitude is directly traceable to
our conviction that basic and applied research is essential to healthy
progress. Today's engineers at Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft accept no
limiting criteria. They are moving ahead in many directions to advance
our programs in energy conversion for every environment.
Our progress on current programs is exciting, for it anticipates the
challenges of tomorrow. We are working, for example, in such areas
as advanced gas turbines ... rocket engines ... fuel cells ... nuclear
power—all opening up new avenues of exploration in every field of
aerospace, marine and industrial power application.
The breadth of Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft programs requires virtually every tech-
nical talent... requires ambitious young engineers and scientists who can con-
tribute to our advances of the state of the art. Your degree? It can be a B.S., M.S.
or Ph.D. in: MECHANICAL • AERONAUTICAL • ELECTRICAL • CHEMICAL and
NUCLEAR ENGINEERING • PHYSICS • CHEMISTRY • METALLURGY • CE-
RAMICS • MATHEMATICS • ENGINEERINGSCIENCEor APPLIED MECHANICS.
Career boundaries with us can be further extended through a corpo-
ration-financed Graduate Education Program. For further information

IN
ENGINEERING
Edited by Allen Vartabedian
Since the end of World War II, the
engineering profession has made unpre-
cedented progress in establishing itself as
a valid and active force in participating
in the leadership and responsibility for
the nation's development. This is due, in
large part, to the changing needs of a
technologically oriented society. Addition-
ally, a change of attitude has occurred,
in that responsible citizens are coming to
realize that the further advancement of
society both spiritually and materially
will depend in large measure on the
thoughts and policies of those specialists
who grasp the meaning of physical, tech-
nological and psychological laws.
The engineering profession holds a
central position in the rapid advance of
society. Western thought contends that
cultural advance is to a large measure in-
fluenced by society's utilization of its
energy resources. This advance includes
not only widespread use of technology
but also the developing of behavior and
thought.
Unlike the medical and legal pro-
fessions which have had many cen-
turies to mature, engineering is a relative
newcomer—a child still experiencing
growing pains. One indication of these
pains is the fact that although the overall
median salary for engineers has increased
from $6J00 to $10,325 in the years 1953
to 1962, engineering enrollments have
been steadily declining since 1957.
One group responsible for guiding the
engineering profession to maturity is the
Engineers Joint Council. The Council
consists of eleven professional engineer-
ing societies as well as many other
affiliated groups. The council has con-
tributed considerably to the establishment
of the National Academy of Engineering
to be an equal partner ivith the National
Academy of Science. Additionally it has
sponsored many commissions and re-
search groups for the advancement of
"the art and science of engineering, for
the general welfare of mankind."
A recent effort of the council's Engi-
neering Research Committee is its study
on the Nation's Engineering Research
Needs 1965-1985. The report, which is
presented below in summary form, exam-
ines the responsibilities of the engineer-
ing profession and evaluates the scientific
and technological needs of our changing
society. It is the result of close to two
year's effort by the committee chaired by
Dr. J. H. Hollomon, Assistant Secretary
of Commerce for Science and Technology
and has been presented to various private
and government agencies concerned with
the problems delineated in the report.

AND DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES
Funds expended in the U. S. A. for
research and development have been
increasing at a rate of 15% per year,
or doubling every five years. Major
impetus to this increased support of
research and development has been
given by the rapid obsolescence of
weapons and military systems, as well
as by the revolutionary new concepts
arising from research and develop-
ment in other areas such as pharma-
ceuticals, synthetic materials and com-
puters. In the decentralized economy
of the United States, the allocation of
resources of trained men and money
to research and development repre-
sents a synthesis of decisions made by
thousands of individuals. Only now
is it becoming evident that the en-
vironment within which these in-
dividual decisions have been made
has caused an overwhelming concen-
tration of technical programs in the
defense, atomic, and space areas,
whether supported by public funds
or private industry.
The nation's 1960-61 expenditure
on research and development
amounted to 14 billion dollars, of
which 9 billion dollars was provided
by the Federal government. The sub-
committee report on this subject de-
scribes briefly the general structure of
the federal research and development
program. It throws some light on the
general nature of the unresolved
problems of our society that are not
receiving significant attention in na-
tional research and development pro-
grams. These general conclusions
were reached as a result of this anal-
ysis.
1. The present system for allocating
resources to U. S. research and de-
velopment programs is producing
an apparent imbalance in our tech-
nical effort, with emphasis on de-
fense-atomic-space activities and on
the rapid exploitation of new
scientific developments, with an
accompanying relatively complete
neglect of basic need-oriented en-
gineering programs.
2. The non-defense agencies of the
Federal government do not have
adequate research programs relat-
ing broadly to problems in the
public sector of the economy; ur-
ban transportation and the foreign
aid program may be cited as ex-
amples.
3. The research and development
funded by private industry is heav-
ily influenced by government allo-
cation of resources to research and
development. Industries which
have little contact with defense
programs tend to provide minimal
support for research and develop-
ment, suggesting that they are not
able to compete with Federal re-
search and development programs,
or that they are organized in such
a way that they cannot undertake
research and development as it is
performed today. This phenome-
non does not appear to have oc-
curred in Japan or the European
Common Market. This minimal
U. S. support may lead to a loss of
technological world leadership in
civilian markets.
4. Research and development efforts
applied to creating new materials
and new goods or products have
been very successful, but have not
been matched by equivalent success
in the development of the complex
systems within which these mate-
rials or products can be utilized
efficiently. An example is offered
by the relationship of the highly
developed automobile to chaotic
urban development.
ENERGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES
The United States is fortunately
well supplied with an abundance of
mineral resources to meet its require-
ments for the next 15 years, and is
not confronted with any serious prob-
lems of supply of basic minerals and
raw materials, assuming continued ac-
cess to foreign sources of supply. How-
ever, domestic supply conditions vary
widely from great abundance of some
resources to relative scarcity and high
dependence on foreign sources of sup-
ply in the case of others.
An expanding utilization of energy
will continue to characterize the de-
velopment of our society in the next
15 years. During this period the coun-
try can be expected to reach the up-
per limits of a sustainable level of do-
mestic production of both petroleum
and natural gas.
In the case of petroleum, annual
demand in the United States is ex-
pected to grow to something over five
billion barrels. While it now appears
there will be no serious difficulty in
meeting these demands, foreign sour-
ces are expected to become increasing-
ly important and there may be serious
limitations to further expansion of
the portion of total supply provided
by domestic sources. In the case of
natural gas, annual production can be
expected to increase to a maximum
sustainable level only about 25%
above the current level of about 13
trillion cubic feet, perhaps even less,
because of supply limitations.
Much of the world remains rela-
tively unexplored geologically, partic-
ularly large areas of Africa, Asia and
South America, but even in the
United States with its more advanced
industrial economy much more geo-
logical exploration remains to be
done. There is a long lead time be-
tween the discovery and exploitation
of mineral resources and it would be
highly desirable that a greater effort
be made in the geologic mapping of
the United States and that research
into new techniques for exploration,
extraction and conversion be pur-
sued.
URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL
PROBLEMS
Modern technology to a consider-
able extent has made possible the
growth of today's large cities, but the
increasing application of that tech-
nology to very much larger urban
concentrations than it was originally
designed to serve is creating major
environmental problems. To date the
engineer has done too little to ident-
FEBRUARY 1964
35


technical resources to bear on these
problems.
Factors of importance in the physi-
cal environment of our cities include
climate and weather, air, water, land,
natural vegetation and animal life,
heat, light, and noise. The engineer-
ing aspects of physical environment
control, like the economic aspects,
are closely associated with the utiliza-
tion and conservation of natural re-
sources in response to the social and
cultural needs of our increasingly
urban society.
For effective control, the physical
environment must be considered as a
whole. This includes not only the
effect of man upon his environment,
but the effect of that controlled en-
vironment upon man. This involves
a combination of social science and
engineering to overcome social, eco-
nomic, and political obstacles. A re-
view of this general area leads to the
conclusion that the most urgent
problems of physical environment
control today are air and water pollu-
tion, radiological health, noise and
land use. Each presents a problem of
national importance involving the
comfort, social status and future econ-
omy of the individual, the nation as
a whole. Unfortunately current re-
search and development programs in
these fields are few, and there is an
urgent need for greater action by
government, by engineering societies,
by educational institutions, and by
the public itself.
NATIONAL AND METROPOLITAN
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS
The failure of our transportation
systems to keep vehicles and commu-
nications in pace with the U. S. pop-
ulation growth and urbanization—in
spite of many splendid technical de-
velopments—is painfully evident to
travelers, commuters, property own-
ers, stockholders, and taxpayers. But
diagnosis and cure of the underlying
causes require more than superficial
appraisal and sweeping pronounce-
ments.
Probably the most important single
characteristic of U. S. transportation
is the artificial division of what
should be an integrated or fully coor-
dinated system into a number of sep-
arate modes, each a separate industry
made up of many separate companies,
separately owned and managed, with
separate governmental agencies at
separate levels of government, by sep-
arate criteria under separate policies,
with separate discriminatory subsidy
programs, with separate governmental
agencies planning, designing, con-
struction or operating important sep-
arate companies of the fixed plant.
The existence of chronic overcapa-
city in all modes of transport is a sig-
nificant characteristic of intercity
transportation in advanced econo-
mies; it explains many of the actions
and attitudes of the managers of
transportation enterprises, including
their stress on capturing business
from other carriers, reduction of oper-
ating costs, and development of short
term competitive advantages rather
than on implementing long range
programs. It also lies at the root of
the inadequate load factors, conse-
quent higher rates and inadequate
profit margins and resulting deficien-
cies in funds for investment in long
range capital improvements.
Changing patterns of transporta-
tion use by the traveling and shipping
public are still another critical factor;
current growth of private carriage at
the expense of common carriage in
intercity transport and the almost ex-
clusive reliance on the private motor
vehicle rather than upon coordination
of the use of private automobiles and
mass transit in metropolitan areas are
two important examples.
The engineering profession should
develop closer interaction with the
political decision makers, and strive
to be of greater service to them. One
of the more significant contributions
that could be made would appear to
be the development of one or more
adequate independently-oriented pro-
fessional engineering groups function-
ing at local, state, and national levels,
at the service of the political process,
government, the industry and the
users, but beholden to none of them.
ENGINEERING AND HOSPITAL-
MEDICAL SERVICES
Two general areas of engineering
activity are of major concern in rela-
tion to future progress in medicine.
First there is the need for more effec-
tive interaction between inventive de-
sign engineers and the bio-medical
research scientists. We are in a period
of very rapid increase in bio-medical
research activity in which the need for
contributions from creative design en-
gineers is becoming increasingly ur-
gent. For example, progress in many
research programs is impeded because
there has not been enough develop-
ment of automated analytical instru-
mentation coupled to data processing
systems for rapid, inexpensive ac-
quisition of statistically significant
amounts of research information. Al-
though progress is being made toward
greater collaboration between the en-
gineering and medical professions in
bio-medical research, much more is
needed both in terms of quantity and
effectiveness.
Secondly, in the area of health serv-
ices, there is an opportunity for the
engineer to help master a cost prob-
lem which is rapidly becoming very
serious. During recent years our
health services have improved mark-
edly in quality, have become inten-
sively used, and have required increas-
ing amounts of hospital labor per pa-
tient day. The health service's portion
of the average family budget has risen
to 5.5% and is now increasing more
rapidly than any other item. Increas-
ing the productivity of hospital work-
ers appears to be the most desirable
approach to improving this situation.
There is a challenge here to engineers
skilled in operations research, facili-
ties, layout, organization, work simpli-
fication, and industrial engineering in
general.
EDUCATION AS AN APPLIED
SCIENCE
While technology can and will in
the future contribute much in the
way of educational aids, there is a
danger of over-emphasizing the poten-
tional of physical technology for im-
36
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


proving the educational process.
Furthermore, it seems likely that exis-
ting private enterprise can meet the
need for advanced educational de-
vices, provided this need is adequately
expressed as a result of research and
experimentation in our educational
institutions. The decentralized nature
of the educational system, however,
creates serious problems in the objec-
tive evaluation of the real educational
worth of teaching devices and aids.
This is an area in which the engineer-
ing profession can contribute, but
largely in a secondary role, by cooper-
ating with the educational profession
in providing standards.
In the last 15 years the behavioral
sciences have made great progress in
understanding the nature of the
learning process. The new knowledge
gained has only just begun to be ap-
plied to education itself. The com-
plexity and variety of human behav-
ior make the problem of applying
new scientific knowledge immensely
more difficult than the application of
science to physical technology, which
is traditionally the domain of the
engineer. Nevertheless, if he approa-
ches the problem with sufficient intel-
lectual humility, the engineer does
have something to contribute. The
actual application of behavioral sci-
ence to education will not take place
spontaneously, but will require major
effort and expenditures involving the
cooperation of many disciplines, es-
pecially interaction between the sci-
ence of learning and scholarly insight
into the substance of knowledge even
at the most elementary level. A par-
tial pattern has already been set in
physics, mathematics, and biology at
the secondary school level. The engi-
neer must learn to contribute by
working with behavioral scientists to
analyze and understand creative and
inventive activity, and eventually to
incorporate instruction in this area
into education at several different
levels.
It does not appear that engineers
can or should ever play the major
role, as professionals, in the develop-
ment of educational systems for gen-
eral education in the U.S.A. Neverthe-
less, the analogy between human
learning and the adaptive control sys-
tems developed by the engineer has
already proved to be a fruitful line of
investigation in psychology, and in a

similar fashion it seems likely that
the whole educational process can be
usefully viewed from the standpoint
of the analogy with complex process
control systems. Some of the princi-
ples learned from the abstract study
of such complex systems can undoubt-
edly be usefully applied to the organi-
zation of the educational process. For
this purpose, increased collaboration
between educational theorists and en-
gineers at the rather abstract and
theoretical level may prove highly
profitable.
TECHNOLOGICAL PROBLEMS OF
DEVELOPING NATIONS
In 1960 the United States spent
two billion dollars on economic and
technical assistance to the developing
nations, but supported little research
and development aimed at assessing
and increasing the effectiveness of
these substantial expenditures.
The engineering profession's vital
concern with this program derives
from the proposition that when tech-
nology is transferred from one culture
to another—especially from a Western,
highly industrialized country to a
non-Western less developed nation-
some measure of adaptive innovation
will normally be required. There is a
growing realization that traditional
modes of foreign aid and technical
assistance which have frequently at-
tempted to utilize alien technologies
from developed countries are not al-
ways appropriate to newly developing
countries, and that new approaches
which involve the development of
technologies especially designed and
adapted to the needs and environ-
ments of the less developed areas
would be more relevant. Recognizing
these factors, the new U.S. Agency
for International Development (AID)
program has established a Research
and Development Unit to undertake
programs on:
a. techniques for developing both the
human and natural resources of
the less developed countries;
b. the adaptation of available tech-
nology to conditions in those coun-
tries;

tween economic and social change.
The most important underlying
question of the development progress
is: How fast can the less developed
countries close the gap between their
living levels and those of the ad-
vanced countries? An annual per cap-
ita GNP growth of two percent might
appear satisfactory from the stand-
point of current growth, and might
also in some countries reflect the
maximum capacity to absorb capital,
but from the standpoint of "catching
up" a much faster rate than two per-
cent is needed. To accelerate this
progress, bold new action oriented
programs will be required involving
close teamwork between experts in
overseas environmental problems and
the nation's top practical engineering
talent.
An important change in the orien-
tation of the U.S. economic assistance
program in recent months has been
the recognition of the urgent need to
improve the status of the simple vil-
lager in education, housing, land re-
form, health, and sanitation. Coupled
with this recognition is an awareness
that past development programs have
perhaps placed too great an emphasis
on large hydroelectric dams, atomic
power facilities, steel mills, super
highways, and jet airports. As former

Stevenson have pointed out, much of
this investment, while producing im-
pressive physical results, has only in-
directly and after many years, bene-
fited the poorer classes.
INFORMATION HANDLING
SYSTEMS
The essence of the study is that
modern digital computers, supple-
mented appropriately by special pur-
pose machines, including analog de-
vices and analog-digital converters,
can be developed to handle the spe-
cialized information of society. This
includes particularly technical infor-
mation handling, in ways which will
progressively recast the traditional
role of the engineer and technologist,
as well as other specialists such as
physicians, journalists, lawyers, brok-
ers, and others in their services to so-
ciety. This recasting will primarily
take the form of vastly reducing the
routine actions of handling and ap-
plying information for design, main-
tenance, and operation (whether of
manufacturers, of vehicles, or of
people.) There is, accordingly, the
possibility of restoring large elements
of personal independence and ingenu-
ity into the specialized intellectual
manpower of the nation, a quality
which has been progressively reduced
in the first half of this century by the
necessary proliferation of rigid and
standard practices, which accompa-
nied the great growth of industrial
and public systems. (Whyte, "The Or-
ganization Man," and others).
While 33% of all engineers (205,500
out of 615,400 employed in industry)
are working in research and develop-
ment according to the National Sci-
ence Foundation Report NSF-60-62,
it cannot be said that all of that third
are doing non-routine, truly creative
work. For instance, huge numbers of
them in "the aircraft and parts" in-
dustry are performing routine equip-
ment engineering of the most tedious
formalism. Also, classed as outside re-
search and development are 42,000 or
45% of the chemists in industry, 2000
or about 15% of the physicists, 6200
or about 53% of the metallurgists,
14,000 or about 95% of the biologists,
38
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


6000 or about 85% of the medical spe-
cialists in industry, and at least 10,000
other specialists. The activities of
these people are known to involve
large volumes of repetitive informa-
tion processing. The point is that this
total number of trained specialists in-
cludes a very large part of the na-
tional inventory of the brain power
of the nation. If we add the approxi-
mate 130,000 scientists and engineers
working for the Federal government,
of whom about 60,000 are engineers
and 21,000 biological scientists, we
find again large fractions engaged in
information handling of a kind suita-
ble for progressive mechanization.
Thus, one indispensable response to
the reduction in engineering enroll-
ments and graduates at a time of un-
precedented national need is the
spirited stimulation of mechanized
information processing.
The manpower resources required
for the achievement of many impor-
tant improvements in information
handling many not be large in quan-
tity, although they will tax the limit
in quality. Thus, in the areas dis-
cussed before including equipment
engineering, specification, drawing
and design production and the more
developmental fields of simulation,
pattern recognition, information stor-
age and retrival, language translation,
etc., considerable numbers of medio-
cre engineers and technologists may
be eliminated. Indeed, these aspects
of the evolution of information han-
dling systems raise broad questions
about U.S. educational and vocational
training policies. The current esti-
mate of the National Science Foun-
dation is that the Soviets are gradu-
ating two or three times the annual
U.S. output of scientists and engi-
neers, and that 75% of their students
enrolled in the equivalent of our
Bachelors course are studying science
and technology, in contrast to 24%
of U.S. students. Perhaps we shall be
able to revise some of the longer term
extrapolations for the national need
for engineers, in favor of increased
quality. There are now about 300,000
engineering and science undergradu-
ates in the U.S., with about 50,000
graduating a year. The removal of
many routine operations from engi-
neering might appreciably change the
composition of even the present en-
gineering enrollments.
ENGINEERING EDUCATION
Problems in engineering education
are acute in the area of:
• The declining numbers of young
people interested in the engineer-
ing profession;
• The profession's poor public rela-
tions;
• Curriculum developments, particu-
larly with regard to training in the
arts of design and systems develop-
ment and in realization of the im-
pact of computer technology on en-
gineering operations;
• Education designed to produce lit-
eracy in both the social-economic-
political and in the scientific and
technical areas;
• Techniques of student selection.
The number of freshmen registered
in engineering curricula has decreased
from about 11% to about 7% of the
total freshmen population during the
last four years. The reasons for this
decline are uncertain, but are prob-
ably related to the great emphasis on
science during the same period. Such
a decline in interest is likely to have
a major impact on the available engi-
neering manpower during the coming
decade and on the available instruc-
tional manpower in the engineering
colleges of the country.
One obvious way to combat this
decline of interest is to improve the
engineering profession's public rela-
tions, which are now completely in-
adequate. A particular target of im-
proved communications should be
the high school student, his counsel-
ors, and his parents.
The engineering curriculum has
been the subject of extensive experi-
mentation but much more remains to
be done. Particularly vital is the ques-
tion of "design," the extent to which
it can be taught, and how it can be
taught in academic situations. Sys-
temization and generalization of the
art are needed. The impact of compu-
ter technology on the whole art of en-
gineering design and systems develop-
ment will be great; this has major
implications for engineering curric-
ula.
One of the major requirements is
for increased emphasis on education
to produce literacy in the social-eco-
nomic-political field as well as literacy
in scientific and technical fields. Engi-
neers traditionally have been too nar-
rowly specialized to meet the widen-
ing responsibilities relating to social
needs that they must increasingly as-
sume.
Finally, the techniques of student
selection are not adequately refined
to discern those intellectual and non-
intellectual qualities likely to be most
important in the development of top
flight engineers. Much more work is
required to define these qualities and
to learn how best to measure them.
ENGINEERING PROFESSION
As is clearly evident from the Engi-
neers Joint Council report, there are
areas of urgent need for technological
development which have been largely
ignored by the professional societies,
contributing to the current imbalance
in the nation's technical effort. It is
evident, for example, that the fields
of transportation, urban development,
environmental control, technical as-
sistance to foreign nations, etc., where
billions of dollars are being spent an-
nually, are receiving fragmented at-
tention by the engineering societies.
The professional engineering socie-
ties grew to maturity during a period
of national life in which universities
and industries dominated research
and development, and technological
advancement. During the past two
decades, however, the Federal govern-
ment has assumed leadership in re-
search and development. This situa-
tion appears likely to continue for
many years. It is timely and necessary
that the professional societies re-ex-
amine their roles in the light of this
new government predominance in re-
search and development in order to
determine whether changes in orga-
nization and operating research and
development be appropriate to in-
crease their effectiveness and influence
in these new circumstances.

(EDITOR'S NOTE: In order to increase student awareness
of the opportunities available for engineers in industry, the
"Technic" has initiated this feature on University of Michigan
engineering graduates. This month we spotlght Douglas G.
Snow, an employee of Vickers, Incorporated in Detroit.)
For me, as for many others, engineering has proved a
satisfying and challenging profession. And while I have
gradually moved away from my undergraduate speciali-
zation at U. of M., my experience exemplifies the value
of basic engineering training as a springboard to special-
ized technical areas of all sorts. It went like this:
After receiving a B.S. in Marine Engineering in 1950,
I joined the Detroit Edison Co. to work in the area of
my particular interests . . . steam turbines, engines and
power plants. The duties ranged from performance eval-
uation of turbines, boilers and pumps to establishing a
maintenance program for coal handling systems. It was
no "white Collar job," but one of interest and challenge
that presented a variety of engineering problems.
After a year with that company, I accepted an oppor-
tunity to enter the field of product design with the
Liquid Drive Corporation, a small fluid coupling manu-
facturer. This offered me a wider range of activities than
would be possible with a larger company. . . . from de-
sign and development to application engineering and
quality control.
At this point, I began to realize the importance of a
fundamental engineering background. So many prob-
lems could be reduced to a form that required use of
what I call "basic engineering"—statics, dynamics, ther-
modynamics, strength of materials, fluid dynamics and
so on. If these did not provide a solution, they at least
gave me an understanding of the problem. Also at this

50
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


point it became apparent that my interests lay in the
engineering mechanics field where such basic engineer-
ing is emphasized. Advanced training seemed the obvious
next step.
Since family obligations made it difficult to consider
returning to Ann Arbor I enrolled in 1955 in the Rack-
ham School of Graduate Studies (Michigan's University
Extension Service operation in Detroit), pursuing a mas-
ter's degree in Engineering Mechanics while continuing
my regular job. The degree was awarded in I960.
Shortly after commencing graduate work 1 joined
Vickers Incorporated, a division of Sperry Rand Corpo-
ration and the largest designer and builder of hydraulic
equipment in the world. This meant a step backwards
from the responsibility I had enjoyed with the smaller
company, but opportunities and challenges were far
greater.
From the start, my work at Vickers has been in aero-
space engineering. Originally I did design work on a
variety of hydraulic equipment—piston pumps, actuators,
valves, accumulators—from preparation of layouts to de-
tailing drawings. This last is a somewhat tedious task
for an engineer, but certainly one of importance from a
design and manufacturing standpoint. I do not mean to
imply that an engineer should be satisfied with a detail-
ing job; rather, he should accept it as an interim thing
with the intention of "wringing it" of every bit of experi-
ence he can. When he "graduates" to a more responsible
job this experience and know-how can be invaluable. He
also becomes better equipped to supervise this activity
later on.
So, after a period, I myself "graduated" to responsi-
bility for development of a miniaturized vane-type pump
for missile use. We wanted one that would deliver 0.025
cu. in. of fluid per revolution (cipr), or about 1/10 the
amount given by the smallest standard Vickers-built vane
pump. Later we went down to 0.01 cipr and raised the
speed capability to 40,000 rph as compared with the ap-
proximately 3000 rpm top for the standard pumps. Our
principal problems included, of course, tolerances . . .
you can miniaturize a part, or a dimension, but not a
tolerance . . . and such things as bearising and seals. We
eventually developed our own shaft seal for the 3/16 in.
shaft required.
The success of this program led to a company deci-
sion to build a line of vane type units for such applica-
tions as pitch control of individual propeller blades on
VTOL aircraft, servo power supply for satellite boosters
and torpedoes, and circulation of coolant through elec-
tronic systems on aircraft and missiles. I was assigned
additional personnel and made Aerospace Engineering
Section Leader in charge of vane pumps.
Perhaps our most noteworthy achievement (for this
is a team effort) has been development of a contaminant-
tolerant, high pressure fuel pump for jet engines. To
our knowledge, this is an Industry "First" a pump that
can "digest" without excessive performance degradation
fuel laden with an abnormally high dirt particle content,
as may occur under military conditions where proper
fuel cleaning procedures cannot be exercised.
Along with supervisory duties in connection with
the design and development aspects of the program, I
am now concerned with providing technical background
and support for the corresponding manufacturing and
marketing efforts. Travel to aircraft and engine build-
ers' plants and to Air Force installations is involved. I
am also concerned from time to time in presentations
before technical societies. This falls into the area of
communications skills (both written and spoken) that
should not be overlooked during the college years. Capa-
bility to express and successfully transmit knowledge and
information is as much a requisite for success in engineer-
ing as in other fields of business endeavor.
If I were asked to summarize my experience of the re-
lationship of educational background to the job, I would
emphasize analytical capability as applied to design/de-
velopment work. Thoroughgoing analysis (using the
basic engineering previously mentioned, plus mathema-
tics) is the best insurance I know to increase probability
of project success and to minimize project costs. It can
detect and eliminate design weakenesses in the initial
design phases rather than during testing, where costly
hardware modifications will be required.

I AM AN ENGINEER. In my profession I take pride, but without vain-
glory; to it I owe solemn obligations that I am eager to fulfill.
As an Engineer, I will participate in none but honest enterprise. To
him that has engaged my services, as employer or client, I will give the ut-
most of performance and fidelity.
When needed, my skill and knowledge shall be given without reser-
vation for the public good. From special capacity springs the obligation to
use it well in the service of humanity; and I accept the challenge that this
implies.
Jealous of the high repute of my calling, I will strive to protect the
interests and the good name of any engineer that I know to be deserving;
but I will not shrink, should duty dictate from disclosing the truth regard-
ing anyone that, by unscrupulous act, has shown himself worthy of the
profession.
Since the Age of Stone, human progress has been conditioned by the
genius of my profesional forbears. By them have been rendered usable to
mankind Nature's vast resources of material and energy. By them have
been visualized and turned to practical account the principles of science and
the revelations of technology. Except for this heritage of accumulated ex-
perience, my efforts would be feeble. I dedicate myself to the dissemina-
tion of engineering profession in all its arts and traditions.
To my fellows I pledge, in the same full measure I ask of them, in-
tegrity and fair dealing, tolerance, and respect, and devotion to the stan-
dards and the dignity of our profession; with the consciousness, always,
that our special expertness carries with it the obligation to serve humanity
with complete sincerity.

Pearlitic Malleable Castings
A little known but extremely valuable property of
pearlitic Malleable iron is its excellent wear resist-
ance. Pearlitic Malleable castings have good natural
wear resistance and can be selectively surface hard-
ened to 60 Rockwell C. Any of the common methods
of hardening may be used — induction, flame, salt
or lead bath, or heat-treating furnaces.

The current trend from steel to pearlitic Malleable
castings for automotive crankshafts and connecting
rods demonstrates the practicality of pearlitic Mal-
leable for high wear applications.

Here are typical comparisons of the wear resistance
of unhardened pearlitic Malleable crankshafts with
unhardened steel crankshafts. These figures are
based on 50,000 mile proving ground tests in 13
automobiles.

pearlitic Malleable are reduced distortion during
hardening, simpler method of hardening, lower
purchase cost and lower machining costs.
Excellent wear resistance, with or without hard-
ening, combined with economy, quality, strength
and machinability, place pearlitic Malleable cast-
ings at the top of the list of engineering materials
for vital parts. Get complete information on how

EDUCATION
AND
RESEARCH
by Karl Legatski
Development of sophisticated opti-
cal devices which not only "see" but
"read" may be speeded up due to an
advance in optical spatial filtering
technology reported by a research en-
gineer at The University of Michi-
gan's Institute of Science and Tech-
nology (1ST).
In a project jointly sponsored by
the Army Electronics Command and
the Air Force Avionics Laboratory,
engineers in the 1ST Radar Labora-
tory have built an experimental
model of one such device and demon-
strated its ability to detect and recog-
nize geometric shapes, including
alphabetic and numeric characters.
According to Research Associate
Bud A. Vander Lugt, the develop-
ment is related to a previously de-
veloped method which produces clear
photographic images without the use
of images, since both resulted from
the discovery that a laser beam could
be manipulated to permit the record-
ing of certain vital—and hitherto un-
recordable—light factors on ordinary
photographic film. He added, that
two entirely different types of optical
systems are involved, and that each
uses a different method in applying
the principle
Experts in the field of optics pre-
dicted almost a decade ago that the
theory of optical spatial filtering
would lead to the development of de-
vices with recognition capabilities.
Since then a number of remarkable
potential commercial, military, and
space applications have been de-
scribed.
One of the most sought-after appli-
cations has been the optical device
widi ability to recognize letters and
numbers, which could read desired

information on printed documents
directly into a computer system. Such
systems would be useful in businesses
where the manual handling of enor-
mous volumes of paper documents is
difficult and costly. Present computer
systems process information automati-
cally, but require initial manual
handling of the original source docu-
ments, and the manual creation of in-
termediate input documents (such as
punched cards) for each original doc-
ument.
Another valuable use would be in
data reduction procedures, such as in-
dexing and grouping documents in
libraries, and locating desired infor-
mation rapidly from a large total vol-
ume of documents stored at random.
Still another potential is for automa-
tic machine translation of documents
from one language into another.
Vander Lugt explained that the
predictions about the development of
such devices were based on the as-
sumption that construction of the
necessary "general complex spatial fil-
ters" would pose no practical problem
—but that in fact the construction of
such filters has until now been ex-
tremely difficult.
A complex filter is one that utilizes
both the phase and amplitude infor-
mation in a certain distribution of
light. To date it has been fairly sim-
ple to use the amplitude information,
but in order to use the phase informa-
tion researchers needed to construct
auxiliary phase plates. These phase
plates are difficult to construct even
for simple filters. For more general fil-
ters the problem is compounded by
the need to obtain phase information
that is not available without extensive
computation.
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


The 1ST engineers have developed
a technique which simultaneously
produces the required phase informa-
tion and records it on ordinary photo-
graphic film without the use of auxili-
ary phase filters. Thus it is fairly easy
to construct the required complex
spatial filter for an arbitrary two-
dimensional shape such as a letter or
number.
In fact, with a simple modification,
the processing system uses its own
components to construct the required
filter directly from the object to be
recognized. It does not require a high-
ly skilled operator.
Vander Lugt's paper gives examples
of the selection of certain geometric
shapes from a variety of available
geometric shapes. One of the exam-
ples illustrates how one letter of the
alphabet was selected from all other
letters. The author states that the
device has the potential of detecting
entire words or sentences from a
printed page which might be recorded
on microfilm. Thus, he notes, it may
be possible to use it as a reading ma-
chine, a translation machine, or for
data reduction.
A strong feature of the technique
employed in the experimental model
is that no scanning is necessary.
Therefore a word or object to be
identified can be detected independ-
ently of its position on the printed
page.
A final example shows that the de-
vice was also able to detect a shape
which was partially obscured by an
artifically generated background.
The experimental device described
by Vander Lugt consists of a conven-
tional coherent optical processing
system, plus a modified arrangement
of interferometers and a gas laser
light source.
INFRARED RESEARCH
William L. Wolfe, a member of
Michigan's Institute of Science and
Technology, detailed the operation
of several applicable infrared instru-
ments in an address before the New
York Academy of Science's Confer-
ence on Medical Thermography. He
also suggested techniques for obtain-
ing improved performance based on
analysis of infrared theory.
Infrared devices detect and measure
infrared radiation which is emitted
by everything on earth. The amount
of radiation is directly related to heat.
Because many disorders in the human
body cause a local increase in temper-
ature, medical researchers have found
that the infrared devices can often
detect such disorders when other
methods fail.
They have discovered, for example,
that malignant tumors are warmer
than benign tumors. Thus infrared
devices can detect some kinds of can-
cer, particularly breast cancer, which
ordinarily requires surgery for diag-
nosis.
Other potential uses include aiding
the diagnosis of localized infection,
phlebitis and other forms of inflam-
mation, hair-line fractures and dislo-
cations, brain tumors, and blood clots.
One instrument used in medical
thermography scans the infrared radi-
ation constantly being emitted by the
patient and focuses it by means of an
optical lens or mirror onto the in-
frared detector. The radiation is con-
verted by the detector into electrical
currents, which are then recorded.
The result of the process is a ther-
mograph, or thermal picture, of the
human body. It is predominantly gray
with the areas giving off more in-
frared radiation showing light or
white. These white spots indicate an
increased temperature, which in turn
indicates injury or infection.
While the Institute of Science and
Technology is not at present carry-
ing on work directly related to medi-
cal thermography, it is conducting a
large-scale effort in infrared science
and technology, and the University
has a long-standing reputation for
excellence in its contributions to the
field.
Wolfe's work has been primarily
concerned with optical devices which
focus infrared radiation. One that is
commonly used is a mirror flipped
back and forth or rotated to gather
the maximum amount of radiation at
maximum speed. His paper also de-
scribed the different results obtained
by replacing the mirror with other
optical devices such as reflecting
prisms, or perforated discs, thus
changing the speed and pattern of in-
frared collection and focusing.
While some dramatic successes have
already been achieved in medicine
with the thermographic technique, it
does have definite limitations, Wolfe
points out. Because the devices detect
and measure only surface radiation,
the injury must be located fairly close
to the skin for precise location and
detection. Infrared radiation from a
source deeply internal, or covered by
many layers of fat, would be too dif-
fused and dissipated before reaching
the surface of the skin to be diagnosed
by this means.
SOIL DYNAMICS
Soil dynamics is a relatively new
field in civil engineering, combining
the modern developments in soil
mechanics and studies of soil proper-
ties with the elements of classical dy-
namics and theories of elasticity and
plasticity. Research on the behavior
of soils under dynamic loads and the
applications of these results to the de-
sign of foundations of dynamically
loaded structures is one of the direct
contributions of civil engineers to the
missile age. To stimulate research in
soil dynamics, the College of Engi-
neering established a new Soil Dynam-
ics Laboratory in the fall of 1962,
with the fundamental instrumenta-
tion and precise laboratory equip-
ment, including Geonor triaxial appa-
ratus, required for these studies.
Before a missile leaves the earth it
is subjected to tests on a static test
stand, equipped and serviced from a
mobile service structure, and support-
ed during the initial firing on a spec-
ial foundation called the launching
pad. After the missile takes off, it is
tracked by radar and the information
is fed back to a blast-resistant control
blockhouse.
The problems involved in the de-
sign of these various foundations
range from permitting only a very
small amount of deformation to
allowing for motions of several inches
or even feet for installations close to
a blast-affected region. The principal
problems involved with the minute
deformations are related to the propa-
gation and distribution of "elastic"
waves throughout the different zones
of soil. Elastic wave propagation veloc-
ities in different materials are being
measured by the resonant column
method, in which a cylindrical col-
umn of prepared soil is set into
resonant vibration, either in torsional
oscillation to determine the shear-
wave velocity, or in longitudinal oscil-
ation to determine the velocity of the
longitudinal wave. The analytical
studies of wave propagation are direc-
ted toward the evaluation of the vi-
bration characteristics of footings
resting on an ideal elastic semi-infinite
body.

RESEARCH
(Continued from page 27)
even more reason to believe that these
lower animals are more than automa-
tons, even though they do not possess
the brain structures often associated
with directed behavior.
There seems to be a generalized
dichotomy in theories regarding the
relationship of the nervous structure
to the degree of complexity of be-
havior. One view, which is gradually
losing support, claims that a verte-
brate-type brain is necessary for true
directed and "conscious" behavior;
the other would like to claim that be-
havior of this type may develop inde-
pendently of these brain structures.
From the data presented, however, it
would seem possible to reconcile the
differences of the two through an ex-
planation based on evolution. We
have seen that an organism with a
"proto-vertebrate" nervous system dis-
plays what appears to be "proto-learn-
ing" (simple conditioning), "proto-
boredom," and "proto-anxiety." That
is, this proto-vertebrate is capable of
proto-vertebrate behavior. The degree
of behavioral complexity may be
somewhat surprising, but it is also
becoming more apparent that the
mechanisms involved are quite com-
plex. Perhaps, as was propcsed ear-
lier, the evolving vertebrate forms
favored a physical mechanism which
is based on the brain to develop high-
er forms of behavior, while a very
rudimentary combination of physical
and chemical mechanisms is employed
by these lower animals. If this evolu-
tionary theory is accepted, there is
also the possibility that these same
chemical mechanisms are well-devel-
oped in vertebrates; or that they are
latent and capable of being utilized.
This will only be determined, how-
ever, through much more experimen-
tation. Whatever the case, it is in-
teresting to consider the possibility
that all of man's knowledge, his
"memory," might be contained in a
molecule very similar or identical to
the molecule of DNA, which appar-
ently is responsible for the genetic
continuity of mankind.

While he was rolling her onto the

to look at it. Sure enugh, the next
morning a man in a pickup drove up
to his house and asked to see the
raspberry.
"Certainly," said the owner of the
berry, and showed his vistor to the
glass cage. But as soon as he had un-
locked the cage, the other man hit
him over the head and knocked him
to the floor. Then, grabbing the
berry, he carried it to his truck and
prepared to make his getaway. The
owner of the berry staggered to the

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC



Once upon a time there was a creature known to joke-
smiths as "the efficiency expert." "When he wasn't being
laughed at, he was being hated. Kodak felt sorry for the
poor guy and hoped that in time he could be developed into
an honored, weight-pulling professional. That was long ago.
We were then and are much more today a very highly
diversified manufacturer. We need mechanical, electrical,
chemical, electronic, optical, etc., etc. engineers to design
equipment and processes and products for our many
kinds of plants, and make it all work. But all the inanimate
objects they mastermind eventually have to link up with
people in some fashion or other—the people who work in
the plants, the people who manage the plants, and the
people who buy the products. That's why we need
"industrial engineers."
A Kodak industrial engineer learns mathematical model-
building and Monte Carlo computer techniques. He uses
the photographic techniques that we urge upon other manu-
facturing companies. He collaborates with medicos in physio-
logical measurements, with architects, with sales executives,
with manufacturing executives, with his boss (G. H. Gustat,
behind the desk above, one of the Fellows of the American
Institute of Industrial Engineers). He starts fast. Don
Wagner (M.S.I.E., Northwestern '61) had 4 dissimilar
projects going the day the above picture was sneaked. He
is not atypical. Want to be one?

GROWTH THROUGH TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE
The Role of
R&amp;D in Industry
Q. Dr. Haller, how does General Electric define that overworked term, Re-
search and Development?
A. At General Electric we consider "R&amp;D" to cover a whole spectrum of
activities, ranging from basic scientific investigation for its own sake to
the constant efforts of engineers in our manufacturing departments to
improve their products—even in small ways. Somewhere in the middle
of this range is an area we call simply "technology", the practical know-
how that couples scientific knowledge with the engineering of products
and services to meet customer needs.
Q. How is General Electric organized to do research and development?
A. Our Company has four broad product groups—Aerospace and Defense,
Consumer, Electric Utility, and Industrial. Each group is divided into
divisions, and each division into departments. The departments are like
separate businesses, responsible for engineering their products and serving
their markets. So one end of the R&amp;D spectrum is clearly a department
function—engineering and product design. At the other end is the Re-
search Laboratory which performs both basic and applied research for
the whole Company, and the Advanced Technology Laboratories which
also works for the whole Company in the vital linking function of putting
new knowledge to practical use.
Having centralized services of Research and Advanced Technology does
not mean that divisions or departments cannot set up their own R&amp;D
operations, more or less specialized to their technical or market interests.
There are many such laboratories; e.g., in electronics, nuclear power, space
technology, polymer chemistry, jet engine technology, and so on.
Q. Doesn't such a variety of kinds of R&amp;D hamper the Company's potential
contribution? Don't you find yourselves stepping on each other's toes?
A. On the contrary! With a great many engineers and scientists working
intensively on the problems they understand better than anyone else, we
go ahead simultaneously on many fronts. Our total effort is broadened.
Our central, Company-wide services in Research and Advanced Tech-
nology are enhanced by this variety of effort by individual departments.
O. How is Advanced Technology Services organized?
A. There are three Advanced Technology Laboratories: Chemical and
Materials Engineering, Electrical and Information Engineering, and Me-
chanical Engineering; and the Nuclear Materials and Propulsion Opera-
tion. The Laboratories do advanced technology work on their own, with
Company funds, and on contract to product departments or outside customers
and government agencies. NMPO works for the AEC and the military to
develop materials and systems for high-temperature, high-power, low-
weight nuclear reactors. ATS is the Company's communication and in-
formation center for disseminating new technologies. It also plans and
develops potential new business areas for General Electric.
O. So R&amp;D at General Electric is the work of a great many men in a great
many areas?
A. Of course. The world is going through a vast technological revolution—
in the ways men can handle energy, materials, and information. Our
knowledge is increasing exponentially. In the last five years we have
spent more than half the money ever spent for research and development.
To keep competitive, and to grow, industry must master that mountain of
new knowledge and find ways to put it to practical use for mankind. Only
by knowing his field well and keeping up with the rush of new develop-
ments, can the young engineer contribute to the growth of his industry—
and society as a whole.

The captain commands a Westinghouse computer

The computer commands the ship
And the owner saves at least $1,000,000.
Westinghouse has developed a computer-
controlled system for doing almost every-
thing on a cargo ship faster and better.
It can be made to load and unload cargo
faster. Control speed directly from the
bridge with no help from below. Keep the
ship on course. Steer clear of navigational
hazards. Navigate so accurately it saves
fuel. Keep an eye on all dials and gauges.
Control valves in the engine room. Keep
records of operations. Analyze emergency
situations and take corrective action. Even
check on how the cargo is doing.
In this day of low-priced competition
from ships under foreign flags, this de-
velopment can add new strength to our
Merchant Marine.
The Westinghouse computer-controlled
system significantly reduces the annual
cost of operating a ship.
You can be sure if it's Westinghouse

Allison—long-famous leader in the development and
production of aircraft engines—is pacing state of the
art advancement in the turboprop area.
A regenerative turboprop engine—embodying con-
cepts further advanced than in any known turboprop
in the world today—is being developed for the U. S.
Navy by Allison . . . The Energy Conversion Division
of General Motors.
Featuring a regenerative cycle which transfers heat
from exhaust gas to compressor discharge air, Allison's
T78 will extend long-range and on station capabilities
of anti-submarine warfare through greatly improved
fuel economy . . . thus projecting the usefulness of
turboprop engines well into the future.
Too, hollow, air-cooled turbine blades—under de-
velopment at Allison for the last 5 years—will permit
higher inlet temperatures for a major improvement in
engine performance. Greater reliability and simpler
maintenance will be achieved with a unique, unitized
propeller-reduction gear box.

ONLY FORD-BUILT CARS MEET THE CHALLENGE WITH
TOTAL PERFORMANCE!
Something wonderful's happened to Ford Motor
Company cars! Under the freshest styling seen in
years, there's a new kind of durability and vigor that
more than meets the demands of today's and tomor-
row's high-speed turnpike driving conditions.
What's the secret? Quality engineering for total per-
formance. Quality engineering so outstanding that
Ford Motor Company received the NASCAR Achieve-
ment Award for engineering excellence which "superbly
combines the prime essentials of great automobiles—
performance, reliability, durability, comfort and safety."
Total performance makes a world of difference. Bodies
and frames are solid and quiet even on the roughest
roads. The ride's so smooth, so even-keeled, it seems
to straighten the curves and shorten the miles. And
nothing matches the spirit, sparkle and stamina of
advanced Ford-built V-8's and thrifty Sixes. Total
performance is yours to enjoy in all our 1964 cars—from
the frisky Falcon to the matchless Lincoln Continental.

Is it true that the leading producer of oxygen
for steelmaking had a hand in preparing
Tricia McDonalds orange juice?
You'd expect that a company with 50 years' experience in ex-
tracting oxygen from the air would lead the field. You might
even assume —and you'd be right—that it knows a lot about
how oxygen can speed the making of steel. As a result, the
company sells oxygen by the ton to steelmakers to help them
produce foster and more efficiently.
You'd also expect that a leader in cryogenics, the science
of supercold, would develop an improved process for mak-
ing the frozen orange juice concentrate that starts Tricia
McDonald off to a bright, good morning.
But there might be some doubt that two such
activities as helping to speed steel production and
helping to improve frozen orange juice could come
from one company. Unless you knew Union Carbide.
UNION
CARBIDE
For Union Carbide is also one of the world's largest pro-
ducers of petrochemicals. As a leader in carbon products, it
is developing revolutionary graphite molds for the continu-
ous casting of steel. It is the largest producer of polyeth-
ylene, and makes plastics for packaging, housewares, and
floor coverings. Among its consumer products is "Prestone"
brand anti-freeze, world's largest selling brand. And it is
one of the world's most diversified private enterprises in the
field of atomic energy.
In fact, few other corporations are so deeply involved in so
many different skills and activities that will affect the
technical and production capabilities of our next
century.
We're growing as fast as Tricia McDonald.

QUESTION: THE FUTURE
The United States Government is one of the largest
underwriters, directly and indirectly, of modern industrial
production and research. Particularly in the aerospace field,
the government is spending fantastic sums of money to
develop and produce today's complex weapons systems.
With these expenditures, the government has indirectly
committed a large portion of our natural resources, both
human and material, to aerospace and related fields. In its
transactions with the industry, the U. S. has been unreliable.
Seemingly overnight, projects have been cancelled which
supported large design, development, and production staffs.
These cancellations have led to layoffs of both white and
blue collar workers. Hopefully the corporations have been
able to relocate the personnel in other activities, but one
often wonders to what extent this can be done when, for
instance, Skybolt is discontinued affecting 3,000 engineers.
The simple number to be relocated makes the job difficult
but when the training of the staff is considered, the task could
become almost impossible. An engineer who has worked
on similar projects for his entire career becomes accustomed
to the problems which are likely to arise and the solutions
to them. As his experience increases in this area, it becomes
increasingly difficult to place him in an activity with the
same responsibilities and concerns as he held previously.
Only when his specialty is basic to many fields will the en-
gineer find the transition from one activity to another
relatively easy—metallurgy is an example.
These considerations are important to today's student
engineers. In choosing career specialties, they are making
a lifetime commitment. Only if they rise to managerial po-
sitions with essentially administrative rather than engineering
responsibilities will their dependence on their engineering
experience be relatively little. The student engineers must
try to forsee the future demand for their skills. The only
information available to them, however, is the present situa-
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


fraction of the present engineering output. But what will
happen if present emphasis is shifted, particularly that which
is now placed on aerospace? What will happen if Uncle
Sam slows down the space race or completely cancels other
programs? Unfortunately no one can predict what the gov-
ernment is likely to do. Congress may completely reverse its
stand on an issue in a few short years, especially if it involves
a great deal of expense. Emphasis on various programs by
the Executive may be shifted from administration to admin-
istration.
Should some of the present programs be cancelled, the
aerospace industry is likely to find itself with not a shortage,
but a surplus, of engineers. Not only would the industry be
able to select recently graduated men, but they also would
have the personnel who formerly worked on the cancelled
projects from Which to choose. Obviously the corporations
will be more inclined to select the more experienced en-
gineers rather than the untrained graduate.
Today, the demand for all types of engineers remains
unsatisfied. Today, student engineers are choosing career
specialties to fill this demand. Will the demand be stable?
Is engineering as secure a profession as most students are
led to believe? Might not the engineer whose talents are no
longer needed find the degree which had been the key to
the door of opportunity becoming the lock to that same
door?

Earth carries you through space. She

of 1,000 miles per hour in the proc-

crossing and listens to the whistle of
an oncoming train. As the whistle
appoaches the pitch increases, and as
the train flashes by the whistle's pitch
lowers. The astronomers took this
earthly phenomenon, the Doppler
Effect, and applied it to galactic light.
Since a shift towards red on the
light spectrum corresponds to a shift
towards a lower pitch on the sound
frequency spectrum, they concluded
that, like a passing train whistle, gala-
xies were receding from our own gal-
axy.

THE EXF^NIDIlSra- UNIVERSE
by jim comber
But for the astronomers, whose tele-
scopes and electronic "ears" tune to
the outer reaches of space, there is an
intense compulsion to learn about
speeds so fantastic that the key to
understanding the evolution of the
universe is contained in their final
explanation.
Imagine, if you can, billions of our
suns clustered in a gigantic disc-
shaped "galaxy" rocketing through
the universe at thousands of miles per
second along with billions of other
galaxies. From our tiny vantage point
called Earth in the gigantic Milky
Way galaxy, astronomers have been
observing just such a spectacle, hop-
ing to find the explanation for what
they see.
It was an astronomer named Hub-
ble, who, back in 1929, upset the ac-
cepted applecart by discovering that
our Milky Way galaxy was not the
only galaxy as was previously be-
lieved. As pieces of knowledge were
put together it became evident that
the entie space of the universe, popu-
lated by billions of galaxies, is in a
state of rapid expansion, with all its
membes flying away from one another
at high speed.
The tool astronomers used to arrive
at their findings was the spectroscope,
an optical instrument used to analyze
light. By observing the arriving light
from distant galaxies, they noted that
the color of the light became redder
as the distance from the galaxies in-
creased. What to do with this fact?
The answer can be found by any-
one who posts himself at a railroad
universe is uniform in all directions,
an observer located on any galaxy will
see all the other galaxies receding
from him at velocities increasing with
their distance from him.
Watch Grandma put raisin bread
in the oven on baking day. As the
yeast makes the bread rise, the raisins
will recede from each other. Those
raisins in the outer parts of the loaf
will recede a greater distance at a
greater speed than those located near-
er the center of Grandma's tasty
bread. Another example is that of a
balloon with painted spots on its sur-
face. As the balloon is inflated, the
spots will be seen to recede from each
other.
Using the Doppler "red shift" ef-
fect, two American astronomers de-
cided to study the color distribution
in far-distant galaxies. The hypothesis
of an expanding universe was borne
out when studies of galaxies situated
6, 40, 140, and 240 million light-years
distant showed an increasing red shift
at each distance. Analogous to the
rising raisin bread, the farthest gal-
axies from the observer were receding
with greatest velocity.
In terms of actual measurement,
galaxies are found to be moving out-
ward at several million miles per
hour, whereas the most distant observ-
able ones run away at a fantastic
200,000,000 miles an hour! Beyond
that who knows what speeds are at-
tained?
The question of the day becomes
"What about old Dr. Einstein who
postulated that no material body

mers put their heads together over
this puzzler and the concensus was
that as a galaxy nears the speed of
light, 186,000 miles per second, its
light neither gains nor loses ground.
If Sandy Koufax fired a baseball
ninety miles an hour off the back of
a train traveling at the same velocity
in the opposite direction, his usually
potent fastball would cover no dis-
tance.
Similarly, the light from a receding
galaxy will not reach the observer if
the galaxy nears the speed of light,
and it becomes impossible to know
what is happening beyond a certain
be so dense that each cubic centime-
ter of space would contain one hun-
dred million tons of matter! In such
a highly compressed state, he contin-
ues, all of the matter which we can
see must have occupied a sphere only
thirty times as large as the sun. Like
the compact rubber packet containing
a rubber lifeboat, a string was pulled
and things all of a sudden weren't so
compact anymore.
The consequent expansion of the
"primeval atom" opened a Pandora's
Box of problems for the astronomer
and physicist to play with.
In the first place, the expansion
concept disagreed with Einstein's ori-
tioned by the fraternity of geologists.
Geologists, by measuring the
amount of radioactivity in a sub-
stance, are able to learn how far back
in time that substance was created.
Using a chunk of lead for their cal-
endar, the geologists found that it
had seen at least 3.4 billion birth-
days. If the universe was the original
birthplace for all matter, they knew
that it too had to be at least 3.4 bil-
lion years old.
But the best laid theories of mice
and astronomers often go astray and
computations showed that the uni-
verse had been expanding 1.7 billion
years, or only half the expected
point in the expanding universe.
Having established that we live in
a madcap universe where every gal-
axy is running away from its neigh-
bor, the scientist becomes directed to
the cause of this almost unbelievable
effect. He wants to find the beginning
—the events initiated billions of years
ago which sent galaxies on a ram-
page of such proportions that the ra-
dius of the universe is doubled every
1,300,000,000 years.
The astronomer looked at the ex-
panding universe, and remembering
when Grandma's raisin bread was
just a lump of dough, concluded that
the universe, too, was once in a state
of compression.
The matter scattered throughout
-the universe in the form of stars,
planets, gas and dust must have been
squeezed into a uniform mass of very
high density. Temperatures under
this great compression would have
been tremendous since all material
bodies are heated when compressed
and cooled when expanded.
It was a Belgian churchman named
Canon Georges Lemaitre who drop-
ped the traditional heavenly musings
•and went scientific. He postulated
that, in the beginning, all the present
material in the universe was compress-
ed into an extremely hot and dense
"primeval atom."
George Gamow, noted physics pro-
fessor, continues along this line by
picturing the early compressed state
of matter as a "fluid" made up of
atoms without their electrons.
•Sucba "fluid," he theorizes, would
ginal model of a stable, unchanging
universe. According to this brilliant
scientist, the universe stood still, nei-
ther expaning nor contracting. The
layman might ask: "But why doesn't
gravity pull the galaxies together?"
Sir Isaac Newton, an astronomer not
by choice, supposedly saw his own
"stars" when a falling apple taught
him about gravity. "So, Mr. Einstein,"
the layman asks, "what keeps the gal-
axies from falling into each other?"
Dr. Einstein, not wishing to be
stumped by an ignorant bystander,
came up with the idea of a "cosmo-
logical constant." This sounded im-
pressive enough, and asked what it
meant, Einstein said that the force of
gravity was balanced by a "universal
repulsion" between material bodies.
In other words, the force of attractive
gravity was exactly balanced by an
equal force pushing the galaxies
apart and, consequently, the universe
remained as stationary as a person try-
ing to lift himself off the ground.
Einstein might just as well have
spent his time trying this feat, for
ironically, the great mathematician's
equations supporting his theory were
proven wrong. A Russian named
Friedmann discovered an algebraic
mistake in Einstein's computations,
and as a result, his supposedly "sta-
tic" universe was found to be highly
unstable and apt to start contracting
or expanding at the smallest distur-
bance.
The astronomer's expansion con-
cept besides disagreeing with Ein-
stein's static concept, was also ques-
length of time. Much of the expan-
sion theory would have to be thrown
out unless the date of its beginning
were proven to be at least as old as
the lead.
A German astronomer by the name
of Behr came to the rescue. He said
that new evidence would cause criti-
cal revisions in the estimated age of
the universe. He doodled around on
his pad and finally announced that
previous calculations were only half
right. The new, revised age figured
out to be 3.4 billion years, by chance
the same estimate of the geologists.
Everything fell into place and again
all was well with the expansion
theory. (Recent calculations, however,
give die estimated age as 10-15 bil-
lion years.)
By a roundabout route we have ar-
rived at two important questions: why
was our universe in such a highly
compressed state and why did it start
expanding?
Some astronomers believe that the
"Big Squeeze" which took place some
10—15 billion years ago was the result
of a collapse of the universe which
took place at a still earlier era. The
present expansion, then, is the re-
sult of a release in tension which
started when a maximum of squeez-
ing was reached.
Take pieces of clay and spread
them on a table. The clay represents
the galaxies of the universe. Now
bring the clay "galaxies" slowly to-
gether into a ball, making the ball as
small as you can. The original bits of
clay lose their identity, and if the
12
THE MICHIGAN TECH NIC


firecracker, you would see totally
new clay "galaxies" expanding out-
wards in all directions.
The clay analogy illustrates well
the astronomers' theory of the col-
lapse, squeezing, and expansion of
the universe.
Like the clay ball, the masses of the
universe were squeezed together
hard enough to demolish any struc-
tures and features. Even the atoms
and their centers were broken up into
small particles.
Though nothing can be said about
the pre-squeeze era of the universe,
much can be said about the begin-
would slow its flight, halt it, and
bring the ball back to the paddle
again.
If the "Expansion-Contraction"
Theory described the actual universe,
our galaxy would be on its outward
journey. However, the evidence is
lacking and goes against the case for
the expansion-contraction cycle.
Where the galaxies should be slowing
down as they recede, in reality they
are speeding up. The cycle theory,
then, is only an attempt to explain
what went on before the universe was
created.
Or, perhaps an embarrassed scien-
tist-father thought it up when junior
galaxies could be formed from free
"background material" in space, it
would eventually run out, and some-
day in the distant future, our spark-
ling universe would be but lumps of
burned-out charcoal scattered over
lightless space.
Fred Hoyle, British astronomer and
part-time science fiction writer, felt
that Mother Milky Way and her bil-
lions of sister galaxies deserved a bet-
ter fate, so he came up with a more
humanitarian theory which became
known as the "Steady-State" or "Con-
tinuous-Creation" Theory.
Hoyle believes that the universe is
not expanding itself to death but that,
the EXF^isminsro- universe
ning of expansion and the resulting
universe of which we became an in-
significant part.
There are three theories today
which try to describe the expanding
universe: the "Expansion-Contrac-
tion" Theory, the "Big Bang" Theory
and the "Continuous-Creation"
Theory or "Steady-State" Theory.
The former two are nearly alike but
are totally opposite from the latter
one.
The "Expansion-Contraction" The-
ory is not widely accepted but has
been used in this series to describe
the process of compression and ex-
pansion in the early stages.
Basically, this theory holds that,
while you read this, either you and
our galaxy are flying outward from
an explosion of an earlier compressed
universe or are on the way back, with
billions of other galaxies, to a gigan-
tic roundup and a re-compression of
all the matter in the universe.
The universe is seen to expand and
contract in regular cycles. The com-
pressed universe "explodes," galaxies
form from the debris and fly outward.
At some point in time the gravity of
the universe halts the flight of the
galaxies and they are at once pulled
back to where their journeys began.
Several billion years after the original
explosion, the returning galaxies
come together again and lose their
identity in a new compression which
eventually explodes to start a new
cycle. Taken by itself, our Milky Way
galaxy would act like a rubber ball
hit by a paddle. The elastic string
asked what God was doing before He
made heaven and earth. God, of
course, has managed the expansion-
contraction cycle since time began.
If you take away the contraction
side of the last theory and sort of let
the expansion continue forever, you
have what astronomers call the "Big
Bang" Theory.
Without attempting to explain how
the universe originated in its com-
pressed state, this violent dieory holds
that the compressed sphere exploded
and that the galaxies will expand out-
ward forever. Unlike the "Expansion-
Contraction" Theory, there is no
gravity acting to pull the stampeding
galaxies back to where they started.
In order to explain the observation
that the galaxies increase in velocity
as they speed into space, astronomers
had to pull Einstein's "universal re-
pulsion" idea out of the scrap heap
and modify it. With a force capable
of repelling bodies—and gaining
strength with distance yet—they were
able to explain why galaxies increase
their velocity the farther out they
travel.
Once again the explanation leaves
gaping holes. What was before the
original explosion, and what basis is
there for assuming a force that repels?
No one can say.
The grim aspect of the "Big Bang"
Theory is that it leaves the universe
to fade away to nothing. With every
galaxy receding from its neighbor it
would take only 10 billion years for
the sky to empty of the 100,000,000
galaxies we can observe now. Though
as galaxies recede from the universe,
new matter is being formed to fill the
empty space. To the observer 10 bil-
lion years from now this neck of the
woods should look the same as it
does now. In contrast, the "Big Bang"
Theory leaves a desolate universe
totally unlike the present scheme.
By now the reader has become ac-
customed to hearing a theory and
expecting some gimmick to make it
go. True to form, Hoyle relies on a
fantastic (to physicists) gimmick to ex-
plain why the universe expands while
remaining the same in appearance all
along. Simply put, matter is created
out of nothing.
Hoyle's universe began with no ex-
plosion, but a giant cloud of gas. Out
of this gas, like beads of water on a
drinking glass, stars and galaxies
were formed, and continue to do so
today. The only way that a universe
could expand and not die of old age,
reasoned Hoyle, was if matter were
constantly created throughout the
universe. By his figures, the average
rate of creation of an atom from noth-
ing occurs at no more than one atom
per year in a volume equal to that of
a moderate-sized skyscraper.
Thus, the Hoyle universe expands
because of the pressure of new atoms
being formed, similar to the spread-
ing of a pancake when fresh batter is
poured in. It is true that the galaxies
we see now will recede out of sight
and that all galaxies eventually burn
out—but the universe will never die.

Infrared Spectroscopy
Recognizing the exact cause of cer-
tain bacterial diseases is sometimes a
problem, for diseases which produce
the same general symptoms can be
caused by more than one type of
bacteria. Quite often, too, a certain
strain is more virulent and dangerous
than others. Such a disease is tuber-
culosis, which has three common
forms; human, bovine (in cattle) and
avian (in birds). All of these, plus
several recently recognized but less
common types, are capable of produc-
ing tuberculosis in man.
Although an experienced bacteriol-
ogist can distinguish some types of
bacteria by looking at them through
a microscope, usually other types of
studies must be made. With the or-
ganisms causing tuberculosis-like di-
seases, this means time-consuming and
expensive studies in chickens, guinea
pigs and rabbits. Recently, however, a
more simple physical means of identi-
fication has been attracting attention.
Devised over the past 10 years by a
"retired" University of Michigan phy-
sicist, Prof. Harrison M. Randall, and
a University of Wisconsin bacteriolo-
gist Prof. Donald W. Smith, it uses for
means of identification the unique
way in which compounds in the bac-
teria absorb infrared radiation.
Known as "infrared spectroscopy,"
this method identifies the different
species of TB bacteria through cer-
tain of their organic chemical com-
pounds as certainly as fingerprints
identify individuals. When applica-
ble, this method is any amount quick-
er than the tedious and costly chemi-
cal methods for such identification.
Moreover, the method can be exten-
sively extended to compare almost
any group of related materials.
The procedure used by these two
researchers consisted of preparing ex-
tracts of lipids (specific fatty substan-
ces) from the bacterial strains, and
partially separating the compounds
therein by means of column chroma-
tography, obtaining from each col-
umn about 80 such samples. These
were subsequently dried, and infrared
spectra were made of each.
In this process, infrared radiation is
sent through the sample, which ab-
sorbs certain wave-lengths of the radi-
ation. What gets through is measured
and reveals the part (or wave-length)
of the radiation that has been re-
moved by the sample. This in turn
reveals what the substance is, because
each specific molecule has a character-
istic absorption spectrum or pattern-
its "fingerprint"—which always re-
mains the same.
With this method, Randall and
Smith were able to identify the spe-
cific lipids found in each strain of
bacteria. When they started, they
hoped to be able to distinguish be-
tween the different types of TB bac-
teria by the different amounts of each
of these lipids in each different strain.
They were rewarded, however, by
their discovery that each strain has at
least one specific lipid unique in that
strain. This serves to identify the
strain.
Reporting this discovery to Nature
(186,4728, 887-888), the British jour-
nal of science, Randall and Smith
named these distinguishing com-
pounds "mycosides." They had not
been previously reported; chemically,
they belong to a class of compounds
known as glycolipids.
At a recent international sympo-
sium on bacteriology in Germany,
Profs. Randall and Smith were al-
lowed 40 minutes for their paper.
To scientists, this is a measure of the
importance with which their work has
come to be regarded.

1940 and led it to its position of pre-
dominance in the field of molecular

bacteria identification work with

medical microbiology faculty at the
University of Wisconsin. They started
the work when Smith was studying
for his Ph.D. at Michigan.
Effects of Radiation
New research findings at The Uni-
versity of Michigan Medical Center
show that "remarkably low" levels of
radiation can disrupt the growing
brain. The evidence was collected
by Dr. Samuel P. Hicks (M.D.) and
Constance J. D'Amato of the pathol-
ogy department. They irradiated dif-
ferent litters of rats on the 16th, 18th
and 22nd days of the mother's preg-
nancy, and on the day after birth.
The researchers found that a single
dose of 10 to 40 rads has a consistent-
ly widespread effect on the develop-
ing rat brain. Thirty rads disturbed
the development of the cerebral cor-
tex when given on the 16th, 18th, or
22nd day of pregnancy, or on the day
after birth. "Widespread deviations"
were caused by giving the animals 30
to 40 rads on the day after birth. (A
"rad" is a basic unit for measuring
the amount of radiation actually ab-
sorbed by a body. Natural radiation
coming from the earth and cosmic
rays will give everyone about one rad
in ten years.)
The Michigan scientists irradiated
137 animals, and maintained 83 of
their litter-mates and cousins as "con-
trols." They checked the animals at
intervals ranging from 24 hours to
10 weeks. Dr. Hicks reported findings
indicated radiation of a much lower
intensity than expected can have a
marked effect on the developing
brain. The investigation thus rein-
forces the belief that the effects of
radiation vary at different times of
pregnancy. The U-M researchers
found that changes in the time and
amount of radiation could:
—Alter individual nerve cells into
abnormal shapes.
—Disrupt the orderly structure of
different layers of the brain.
—Produce a shortage of neurones
in the cortex.
The study was supported by grants
from the Atomic Energy Commis-
sion, the U.S. Public Health Service
and the United Cerebral Palsy Asso-
ciation. A detailed report on the work
has been prepared for the magazine,
Science.
Noise Generator
A remarkably simple device for test-
ing certain kinds of communications
equipment has been developed by a
University of Michigan electrical en-
gineer. Intended for laboratory use,
the device can be put together in less
than half an hour, using standard lab-
oratory equipment, according to
Charles C. Hoopes of the U-M Cooley
Electronic Laboratory.
Called a "tractable Bernoulli-se-
quence generator," the device is used
to introduce errors (noise or static)
into a message transmission in new
electronic equipment undergoing test-
ing, just as the static would be intro-
duced by the atmosphere or environ-
ment in which the equipment is to
operate. It is designed to be used with
radio equipment that sends informa-
tion in bits, or digital sequences,
rather than continuously like a voice
transmission. Such digital transmis-
sion techniques are used, for example,
to send scientific and engineering in-
formation from satellites, such as the
Mariner II did on the Venus mission.
Besides being stable and reliable,
the noise generator has one character-
istic that makes it extremely useful
for its purpose: it has good random-
ness properties—it introduces the
noise as nature would, with absolute-
ly no pattern. It is also reproducible
—able to generate a similar condition
after being dismantled and rebuilt—
a feature not available in some com-
mercial equipment.
The unit is built entirely of small
commercially-available, plug-in units
called digital odules which are mere-
ly interconnected in a prescribed way.
With the proper units and wiring,
any error rate (caused by noise) up to
10 per cent of the signal can be in-
troduced.
Solar X-Rays
The University's McMath-Hulbert
Observatory near Pontiac, Michigan,
has long been engaged in studying the
Sun's activities. The optical data ac-
quired over a period of years have
often been employed in conjunction
with data obtained at other observa-
tories around the world, including
data obtained with radio telescopes.
Now, with the advent of orbiting un-
manned observatories, a new dimen-
sion of the electromagnetic spectrum
can be added to solar astronomy, the
dimension of X-rays.
Aboard one of nasa's Orbiting Solar
Observatories (oso-c), expected to be
launched toward the end of this year,
will be an X-ray experiment planned
by Richard G. Teske, Assistant Profes-
sor of Astronomy, oso-c is planned to
go into a circular orbit 300 miles high
with an orbital period of ninety minu-
tes. Part of the satellite will be con-
tinuously pointed at the Sun, and
part is a wheel which rotates once
every two seconds and thus offers in-
termittent but frequent solar obser-
vation. Professor Teske's experiment,
which is to be located on the wheel
part of oso-c, is designed to measure
the intensity of solar X-rays in the
very short wavelengths of eight to
sixteen angstroms.
The instrument to be placed
aboard oso-c for this experiment is
based upon use of an ion chamber for
the sensing device. The greater part
was engineered by the University's
Space Physics Research Laboratory
and subcontracted to the Consoli-
dated Systems Corporation for devel-
opment and fabrication. X-ray pho-
tons from the Sun are admitted
through an aluminum foil window
which allows only those photons of
the desired wavelengths to pass into a
chamber filled with nitrogen. The
photons entering the chamber ionize
the gas. Collection of these ions by
application of a voltage across the
chamber constitutes an electric cur-
rent, from which the X-ray intensity
can be obtained by measuring the
current flowing in the chamber. The
X-ray data are to be used in correla-
tive studies with optical and radio
observations of the Sun. The relation-
ships so developed should shed furth-
er light upon the physical processes
taking place on the Sun during active
events, such as solar flares and bursts.
Leak Detection by Radioisotopes
Saturn, the giant rocket vehicle
that will propel the coming genera-
tion of space flights and experiments,

hydrogen, and kerosene. Its eight en-
gines require a most intricate plumb-
ing system, with so many connections
that leaks are bound to occur and
cause difficulties in launching. Lloyd

a lot more engineers should try. Tech-
nically-minded men have been over-
looking these one-celled microorgan-
isms as a means of solving technical
problems for too long.
What can microbes do besides give
us a cold and cover our food with
mold? The answer to this question is
being sought by a gradually increas-
ing number of men. Probing the mic-
robes has revealed that these little
creatures, so minute that 2,000,000,-
000 of them can congregate in a tea-
spoon, are a very promising and hard-
ly-tapped engineering resource.
The engineer has traditionally
dealt primarily with mechanical sys-
tems and has shown little interest in
biological systems. Perhaps work with
purely mechanical systems has re-
sulted in so many technical advances
that the engineer has felt no need or
desire to investigate the industrial ap-
plications of living systems. Now,
however, technical men are discover-
ing how to exploit for industry the
tiniest environs of our world—the
MICROBES.
Microbes have been functioning as
miniature chemical converters for a
long time. In the 2 billion years of
the Archezoic Period, microbes
gnawed at the earth's rocky crust to
produce soil, and they changed the
composition of the sea and air so
that higher forms of life could exist.
Today microbes can be used to
serve man in various ways. The fer-
mentation industry is probably the
oldest and largest microbe employer.
Here microbial synthesis yields an in-
creasing variety of products, ranging
from antibiotics and hormones to al-
cohols, acids, and polymers. But "mic-
robe engineers" have made some valu-
able applications of microbe systems
to problems other than industrial fer-
mentation.
Present and potential uses of mic-
robes range from mining ores and re-
fining petroleum to air depollution
and treatment of industrial wastes.
Microbes can even fractionate isotopes
and generate electric power. More-
over, these microscopic organisms
may be the basis of life support sys-
tems in space.
But how can microbes be so useful
in so many different areas? Simply,
there are a great variety of these little
organisms, they are extremely active,
and they are rapid chemical conver-
ters of a wide range of dietary inputs
to an even wider range of products.
The microbes presently of interest
for industrial processes are the algae
and fungi. (Because protozoa are too
large and difficult to culture and
viruses are too minute, they are not
included.) This group of little beasts
has a large membership since there
are thousands of species of both fungi
and algae and numerous strains of
each species. Generally, microbes are
one-celled microorganisms classified
as belonging to the plant kingdom.
However, some scientists place mic-
robes in a kingdom separate from
plants and animals and called protis-
tra from the Greek word, protistos,
meaning "first." The microbes of in-
terest, algae and fungi, differ from
each other mainly in that algae con-
tain chlorophyll, while fungi, which
include yeasts, bacteria, actinomycetes,
and molds, lack chlorophyll. Algae
photosynthesize their own food since
they have chlorophyll; fungi, how-
ever, are parasitic or saprophytic and
thus depend on a host for organic nu-
trients.
Under proper conditions of tem-
perature and pH, microbes are highly
active and rapidly metabolize nu-
trients to release waste products,
metabolites. Cell division or spore
formation also occurs at a high rate
under favorable conditions. One bac-
terium, for instance, can divide about
every 15 to 20 minutes. In I ml of
medium, one such microbe in one
day can become, by a chain reaction
of divisions, a colony of 200 billion
bacteria—100 times the population
(human) of the earth!
Proper conditions for microbe
and activity vary from one species to
another, but optimum conditions for
most microbes lie in the temperature
range of 25-40 C. and a pH of 6.0-9.0.
Deviations from "proper" conditions
reduce metabolic activity and, if large
enough, kill the little one-celled fac-
tories. Generally a temperature only
10 above the ideal temperature will
kill a microbe, and 10 below will cut
activity in half.
What They Can Do
The reason for the rapidity of mic-
robial metabolism is that being so
small, the average critter being only 1
micron (104 angstrom units) in diam-
eter, die microbe has a large surface
relative to its volume. Because of this
huge surface to volume ratio, mic-
robes can assimilate food and excrete
metabolites more quickly than can a
larger organism. Coupled with rapid
reproduction, this rapid metabolic
rate makes microbes practical chemi-
cal converters for many industrial ap-
plications.
The amazing characteristic of mic-
robes is their ability to subsist on a
wide variety of nutrients. The ordi-
nary microbe, the organotrophic mic-
robe, requires organic food. Pseudo-
monas, a common soil and water bac-
terium, can satisfy its appetite for car-
bon with any of over 100 organic
compounds.
Microbes' wide-band appetite is
evidenced by fungi clogging fuel lines
of jet planes and voraciously spread-
ing across pieces of plastic. Not even
stones are safe from the mighty mic-
robes. Some bacteria can live com-
pletely on inorganic matter and are
appropriately tagged lithotrophic, or
"stone-eating" microbes. These
"plants" derive needed carbon from
carbonate or bicarbonate radicals of
the rock and actually oxidize inor-
ganic materials such as sulfur, ferrous
iron, hydrogen, ammonia, and hydro-
gen sulfide.
In order to grow, all microbes re-
quire carbon (but they don't seem
particular on where they get it).
Nitrogen for protein manufacture is

ing requisites for cell life are (1) an
energy supply (2) an acceptor for
metabollically released electrons and
H atoms (3) minute quantities of
other elements for growth factors.

wide range of metabolic products that
microbes can supply. Nearly 1500
microbial metabolites have been iden-
tified and vary from simple com-
pounds such as PLC* and CO, to such
complex compounds as folic acid, a
B vitamin, and such complicated
molecules as proteins and polypep-
tides with molecular weights of over
7000.
Microbiologists know of almost
2000 different chemical reactions ef-
fcted by microbes. What causes these
reactions? Enzymes.
A microbe per se is not a chemical
catalyst. But a microbe is quite literal-
ly a "bag of enzymes," and these en-
zymes cause the chemical changes to
occur. These chemical reactions with-
in or near the surface of a microbe all
occur in a series of small intermedi-
ate steps—each step catalyzed by a
particular enzyme in the cell. Thus,
when the microbe oxidizes its nutri-
ents, energy is liberated in amounts
small enough to be tolerated by the
cell structure.
Since enzymes are highly specific in
what they will catalyze, many differ-
ent enzymes are found in a single
microbe. In fact, most microbes prob-
ably have over 1000 different enzymes;
100 enzymes is believed to be the min-
imum per microbe. The enzymes are
essentially proteins and are thousands
of times more effective than an equal
weight of ordinary catalyst such as
patinum or metal oxides, or silica gel.
In brief, thousands of different mic-
robes, each equipped with thousands
of enzymes can assimilate a large
variety of nutrients or substrates to
produce an even larger variety of
metabolites.
However, industrial applications of
microbes are not restricted to the for-
mation of chemical products. In some
cases the substrate or the reaction it-
self, rather than the product, may be
of interest. For instance, one may
want to use a microbe to change the
physical structure, concentration or
toxicity of a substance. In other cases,
a microbe can indicate the presence
of a particular substrate by reacting
with it to produce a certain telltale
product.
Microbes are specific in catalysis-
one species or even strain can act
only on certain substrates. But there
are a vast number of microbes, so the
problem reduces to finding or breed-
ing a microbe to fit the particular
application.
Applications
The fermentation industry has
been the pioneer of microbe applica-
tion. As early as 1857, Louis Pasteur
showed that alcoholic fermentation is
caused by yeast cells. Until WWI the
primary use of microbes was the prep-
aration of liquor and commercial
yeasts. But after WWI industrial sol-
vents were manufactured via mic-
robes, and since WWII the synthesis
of drugs, such as antibodies and hor-
mones, has been the major applica-
tion of microbial fermentation.
To make the desired chemical prod-
uct, a seed culture of the particular
microbe is "planted" in sterile med-
ium, the substrate, of a large produc-
tion fermentation tank. The pure
microbial cultures for these seed cul-
tures are obtained from natural fer-
mentation and preserved, usually by
rapid freezing, until needed. The de-
sired seed culture is then grown for a
while in a flask or small tank, and the
production fernenter is sterilized with
steam and filled with the sterile sub-
strate. Then the seed culture is
"planted" in the substrate where it
grows vigorously. An active seed cul-
ture can build a microbe concentra-
tion of 50,0000,000/ml or 5-10% of
the total volume which may be
10,000 gallons.
The metabolite created in the fer-
mentation process is usually dissolved
in the culture liquor. To separate this
wanted product, the microbe bodies
are filtered out. The concentration of
metabolite in the resulting filtrate is
usually very low.
Then the metabolite is isolated by
the usual chemical methods such as
crystallization, precipitation, filtra-
tion, etc.
Fermentation is a batch process be-
cause the risk of contamination is too
great in a continuous operation. The
time required per batch depend, of
course, on the particular reaction oc-
curring and one the batch size. Actual
fermentation times range from per-
haps six hours to a week. One should
remember that reaction rate is very
dependent on control conditions.
Today equipment and techniques
are such that fermentation conditions
can be quite accurately controlled.
Pure seed cultures, steam steriliza-
tion of fermentation equipment, and
sterilization of air used for aerobic fer-
mentation processes prevents batch
contamination. Strict temperature
control, with 1° C. throughout the en-
tire batch, is maintained. Techniques
for keeping the batch in the optimum
pH range are effective; automatic buf-
fering can hold the pH within one
pH unit of a desired value. Due to
this mastery of fermentation tech-
nique, delicate microbes can now be
used for product synthesis.
The number of microbes available
and constantly improving techniques
insure the increasing value of mic-
robial fermentation processes. Mic-
robes can not compete economically
with chemicals for many reactions,
but more substitution of microbes for
chemicals occurs each day. Especially
in the synthesis of complex drugs,
such as hormones, microbes reduce
the number of reaction steps required
and boost the output. For example,
the 37 step chemical synthesis for
cortisone can be reduced to 13 steps
bv using a microbe, according to the
Pfizer Company.
Although the fermentation indus-
try is the prime employer of microbes
now, microbes have invaded other
industries also.
A rather direct application of mic-
robes is the derivation of enzymes for
comercial use. For example, enzyme
preparations from microbes are being
used to treat leather, to desize textiles,
and to tenderize meat.
Lithotrophic or "stone eating"
microbes are useful in mining and
metallurgy. Leaching metals from low
grade ores by microbial metabolism is
22
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


feasible. Using microbes, E. C. Perkins
and F. Novelli of the Bureau of Mines
station in Bolder City, Nevada, were
able to leach manganese from low
grade oxide and carbonate ores of
manganese.
Another of the metallurgical uses
of microbes is the oxidizing of soluble
metallic sulfides to insoluble, and
therefore recoverable, metallic sul-
fates.
One microbe, Th. thioxidans, can
generate and live in sulfuric acid up
to 10% concentration and seems
promising for inexpensive sulfuric
acid product near mines requiring the
acid.
Microbes, more specifically algae,
can recover minerals from sea water.
Recovery of precious metals by this
method is feasible but not yet prac-
tical. Desalting water via microbes is
also a potential application now un-
economical.
Industrial interest may develop in
certain marine microbes which can
fractionate isotopes. The marine bac-
terium, Pseudomonas, is one such mic-
robe—it fractionates hydrogen iso-
topes as it produces H2 gas. Other
microbes can absorb and retain radio-
active isotopes.
Air is polluted with pungent sulfur
dioxide when coal is burned. In the
laboratory, the bacteria, Ferrobacillus
fenooxidans, can metabolize the sul-
fur in coal. Coal thus treated with
bacteria would not contaminate the
air with SO,.
Plant Tissue Wastes
Microbes, voracious eaters, may
help man to dispose of unwanted
plant tissue. About 500 billion tons of
new cellulose sprout up as plants
each year. Man can not digest cellu-
lose and neither can most other ani-
mals. Perhaps engineers will take a
hint from the ruminants and let mic-
robes decompose this tough polysac-
charide.
Microbes may also help rid man of
the tons of waste lignin, the sticky
substance which binds cellulose fibers
in wood. There is indication that cer-
tain microbes, especially actinomy-
cetes, could decompose coal into sim-
pler substances which then could be
used to create new and valuable prod-
ucts.
Petroleum
Although they don't know it, mic-
robes are helping to locate petroleum
and natural gas deposits. The pres-
ence of certain bacteria in the marshy
ooze along the Gulf Coast indicates
the presence of underground hydro-
carbon deposits because these particu-
lar microbes metabolize the minute
traces of hydrocarbon gases (ethane,
butane, methane, and propane) seep-
ing up from the hidden deposit.
Microbes also aid in extracting
petroleum from oil-bearing rock such
as limestone and dolomite. Metabolic
products of the bacterium, Desulfovi-
brio halohydrocarbonclasticus, help
remove oil from rock in the following
four ways: (1) acids produced dissolve
the sedimentary rock making the rock
porous (2) C02 released increases gas
pressure and thins the oil (3) deter-
gents formed decrease the oil viscosity
(4) the microves themselves crowd oil
off the rock's surfaces.
Another scheme to separate hydro-
carbon deposits from rock is to find
the right lithotrophic microbe to
"eat" the rock and free the oil.
Work done at the Socony-Mobile
Oil Co. indicates that the omnivorous
little microbes can oxidize many hy-
drocarbons and, therefore, may be val-
uable in decomposing petroleum.
Industrial Wastes
There has been much concern re-
cently about contamination of rivers
and lakes by industrial wastes, espe-
cially by detergents, which foam pro-
fusely and seemingly perpetually after
leaving the kitchen sink or factory.
Microbes can destroy this detergent
foam. At least one company, Conti-
nental Oil, has been developing
strains of bacteria to destroy deter-
gents by oxidizing the sulfates in
them.
Many troublesome industrial wastes
are such organic compounds as for-
maldehyde, phenol, carbohydrates,
and proteins. Some manufacturers
are now using bacteria to oxidize
these and countless other organic in-
dustrial wastes.
Sewage
A potential application of algae is
to retrieve, by assimilation, the valu-
able nitrogen salts otherwise lost in
sewage. Presently the chemical fer-
tilizer industry supplies in a year
about as much nitrogen as is lost
through sewage in a year.
In space travel, life support systems
must be able to remove human wastes
and provide food and oxygen. The
green algae, Chlorella, seem likely to
be used to metabolize the spaceman's
body wastes and carbon dioxide and
provide him with oxygen and sugar.
Another space-age application of
microbes is a life probe on other
planets. Finding the products of mic-
robial metabolism would evidence the
existence of microbes, living organ-
isms, on the planet.
The electrons transferred in micro-
bial metabolism recently have been
harnessed to produce electric power
in a biological fuel cell. Frederick D.
Sisler of General Scientific Corp. has
developed several of these microbe
bio fuel cells using anaerobic bacteria
which provide electrons by reduction
of sulfates to sulfides.
Conclusion
Microbial application to industrial
problems is still in the dormant stage
since relatively few engineers have
exploited the powers of the tiny mic-
robe. The thousands of species of mic-
robes, each equipped with hundreds
or thousands of different enzymes to
metabolize a large variety of both or*
ganic and inorganic nutrients to an
even larger variety of products, are an
amazing technical resource.
A Reminder
Fix your globes on the microbes!
The thinking microbiochemical (or
other) engineer can find a microbe to
do almost anything. Think small-
good things come in small packages.

Fitzgibbon
■ George Fitzgibbon is a Senior Experimental
Chemist at Delco Radio. He's pictured here examin-
ing silicon rectifier sub-assemblies for microscopic
solder voids during the development stage.
George received his BS in Chemistry from the
University of Illinois prior to joining Delco Radio.
As he puts it, "I found, at Delco, an opportunity to
take part in a rapidly expanding silicon device de-
velopment program. The work has proved to be
challenging, and the people and faculties seem to
stimulate your best efforts."
The young graduate engineer at Delco will also
find opportunity—and encouragement—to continue
work on additional college credits. Since our incep-
tion, we've always encouraged our engineers and
scientists "to continue to learn and grow." Our
Tuition Refund Program makes it possible for an
eligible employee to be reimbursed for tuition costs
of spare time courses studied at the university or

FROM ROOM

by Alden Johanson
Once again, through the generosity
of Professor John G. Young, director
of the Engineering Placement Service
(Room 128-H, West Engineering), the
Technic is privileged to publish the
following annual report on the job
placement of Michigan engineering
graduates. Much of this article is a
condensation of the Annual Report
of Engineering Placement, issued by
Professor Young.
Demand Increasing
Two "barometers" continue to
clearly indicate the growing demand
for engineers. These are 1) the in-
creasing number of companies sched-
uling interviews, and 2) the higher
starting salaries being offered.
We can account for this trend by
citing a somewhat alarming phenom-
enon of the last decade. Despite the
rapidly increasing number of engi-
neering positions available in govern-
ment and industry, the annual num-
ber of graduates from this and many
other engineering colleges has actual-
ly decreased recently. The law of sup-
ply and demand has, to a large ex-
tent, forced salaries and recruiting
efforts to an all-time high.
Interviews and Offers
The number of different employers
scheduling visits increased by 8.5%,
to a total of 483. There was a substan-
tial decline, however, in the number
of students interviewing for regular
employment. This decline of 14%
was offset by an increase of 44% in
the number interviewing for summer
jobs, and thus the total number of
students participating increased by
3.5%. 1375 students interviewed for
summer employment last year.
The average number of job offers
per student was approximately the
same this year as last, with a slight
decrease in offers to Ph.D's.
The number of plant visit invita-
tions per citizen accepting regular em-
ployment rose from 2.8 in 1961-62
to 4.9 in 1962-63.
A total of 445 non-engineers were
interviewed last year for regular em-
ployment. The number of alumni
utilizing the Placement service rose
from 147 to 159 over the last year for
an increase of 8%.
Salaries
According to all available informa-
tion, starting salaries increased over
the last year by 4.4% for the B.S.
level, and 8.3% for the Ph.D. level.
Starting salaries remained about the
same for the M.S. level. Unfortunate-
ly these statistics don't represent an
adequate sampling of all salaries ac-
cepted, especially by M.S. graduates,
who very likely received an increase
which didn't show up in the survey.
The salary rankings by programs
at the B.S. level remained substantial-
ly the same as last year, except that
Mechanicals moved closer to the top-
ranking group of Aeronauticals, Elec-
tricals, and Chemicals, while the In-
dustrials dropped closer to the lower-
ranking Civils.
The highest industrial starting
salaries, as reported by the College
Placement Council, were offered by
the aircraft companies, closely fol-
lowed by electronics, electrical ma-
chinery, chemicals and drugs. Next
came the automotive, mechanical
equipment, metals, and petroleum
industries. The most dramatic in-
crease was made by public utilities
which showed a hike of more than
7% over last year.
Types of Jobs
Little change was witnessed in the
types of work accepted, but Sales
showed a significant increase over last
year, at the expense of Operations
and Production. This continues last
year's trend even more strongly.
Size of Employer's Organization
Large corporations continued to
dominate the recruiting scene last
year, as companies of more than 5000
employees scheduled 486 visits. This
was 63% of the 772 visits. Medium-
sized companies (500-5000 employees)
scheduled 236 visits, and small com-
panies (less than 500 employees)
scheduled only 50, for 31% and
6% of the total, respectively.

The proportion of graduates start-
ing work in Michigan increased slight-
ly at the expenses of the other mid-
west states, but the proportion leav-
ing the Midwest remained almost the
same as last year. There was a signi-
ficant shift in favor of the East Coast
over the West Coast, however, with
the same number going to each, as
compared to about 40% more going
to the West Coast last year.
Employees Strive for Quality Selection
Despite the difficulty many employ-
ers encounter in recruiting engineers,
no apparent sacrifice is being made in
the search for "quality" graduates. An
increasing proportion of employers
availed themselves of the opportunity
to review student credentials in the
placement office, with the prospect of
contacting selected candidates prior
to their interview visit. Thus we can
see that, although the demand for en-
gineers has increased sharply, this by
no means insures a lazy student of a
high-paying job after graduation. A
healthy spirit of competition still pre-
vails.

yet cut cost 20%
Originally, this crosshead for a lift truck was
not a forging. Now it is forged in steel. Here's
why . . .
The lift truck builder wanted to increase the
safety factor to meet greater bending and shear
stresses. He also wanted to increase the fatigue
strength of the part. And all without any in-
crease in weight or cost. He also wanted to
reduce tool breakage caused by irregularities,
voids, and inclusions.
He changed over to FORGED crossheads.
Now the crosshead has the required strength
and stress-resistance, costs 20% less when
machined and ready to assemble, increases
production rates 14% by reducing tool break-
age and increasing machining speeds.
Forgings are better for these reasons; they:
1. Are solid, free from voids and inclusions
2. Have high fatigue resistance
3. Are strongest under impact and shock loads
4. Have a higher modulus of elasticity
5. Have a unique stress-oriented fiber
structure
6. Are low in mechanical hysteresis
Memo to future engineers:
"Make it lighter and make it stronger" is the
demand today. No other metalworking process
meets these two requirements so well as the forg-
ing process. Be sure you know all about forgings,
their design and production. Write for Case History
No. 105, with engineering data on the lift truck
crosshead forging shown above.

Arm yourself with facts about DuPont
These booklets helped persuade some 700 new B.S. graduates
to join us in 1963. It was mostly a matter of getting facts.
For example, if you want to start your career in a certain
section of the country, you'll find that Du Pont—with facilities
in 28 states-will try to accommodate you.
If you're interested in growth for what it can mean to you
personally, you'll be interested to know that our sales have
increased 750% since 1937. You've probably heard that R&amp;D
expenditures are a good indicator of a company's future success.
We spend $90 million a year on it, $60 million of which goes
straight into "pioneering research" — the discovery of new
scientific truths and new materials.
Our booklets will answer most of your preliminary questions.
Later—or even now if you wish—we can talk specifics by letter,
or face to face. Why not write us or send our coupon? We'd
like to know about you.

K. M. Nelson, Manager—
Industrial Control Sales, discusses the functioning of
Cutler-Hammer's automation teams, and how
creative graduates contribute to pioneering developments.
For over sixty years Cutler-
Hammer has been a key con-
tributor in planning automatic
systems—now called automation.
To meet the pressing challenge of
rapidly expanding industrial auto-
mation, we have formed a number of
automation project teams. These
teams combine the technical and
manufacturing talents of versatile,
seasoned specialists and young, crea-
tive-minded engineering and business
administration graduates.
Their primary job: to make sure that
a customer's automation investment
pays an adequate return.
How do they meet this challenge?
By working with customer engineers
and consultants to isolate cost prob-
lems in manufacturing and ware-
housing operations. Then, by apply-
ing their individual disciplines and
creative ingenuity to build common-

too, on a Cutler-Hammer automation team
sense automation proposals that can
be justified economically.
Automation teams work together in
a modern 500,000 square foot plant
specifically designed to house every
activity involved in the evolution of
a system ... in a creative climate
that is conducive to imaginative
planning and development.
This approach has paid off! Though
industry has barely scratched the sur-
face of the automation potential, our
credentials already are quite impres-
sive. Jobs such as the U.S. Post Office
mail handling systems in 14 major
cities; a pallet handling system for a
mail-order firm; data accumulation
systems for large steel producers; a
number of automobile body-line
systems; bundle-handling systems for
30 major newspaper mail rooms; and
a package-handling system for a
prominent publisher are just a few
examples of our automation planning
skill at work.
What are the advantages to the
young, creative-minded graduate?
Short range, it's an exceptional op-
portunity for the man who responds
to the challenge of finding new solu-
tions to tough manufacturing prob-
lems. Long range, being a key
member of a Cutler-Hammer auto-
mation team is an excellent way to
get the diversified experience so
essential to steady career develop-
ment and future advancement.

CIVIL ENGINEERING
It is appropriate that in Michigan with its approximately 3,000 miles of coastline the
University is able to provide an active program in Coastal Engineering. Coastal engineer-
ing deals with the design oi shore and off-shore structures, the planning and design of
harbors and inlets, and the control of shore erosion. It embraces three branches of Cicil
Engineering, hydraulics, soil mechanics and structures.
Since the establishment of the Lake Hydraulics Laboratory at Willow Run in 1948, many
harbors have been designed or improved by means of model studies. An aerial view of a
harbor entrance during a model test is shown in Fig. 1. Other studies have dealt with
forces on off-shore structures such as those used for oil drilling. An illustration of the results
of tests on a submerged barge-like structure are shown in Fig. 2. The plotted points show
measured forces for various depth below the water surface (z) and for three different wave
heights (H). The solid lines are computed forces for the three wave heights using the indi-
cated coefficients of virtual resistance (C,„). Tests such as these provide the basic data
needed to design off-shore structures. An extensive long range program on shore protec-
tion is also being carried out.

The galaxies we see 10 billion years

be the ones we see today, but the im-
portant thing to note is that there
will always be galaxies in our neigh-

can happily contemplate walking un-

years—at least until our time comes
to fade away.
The expanding universe must be
ranked as one of science's great puz-

had to make up new concepts to ex-

WE MAKE INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERS SWEAT
Might as well scare off the ones who wouldn't like it.
Some of the unscared will in a few years be referred to as
"they" when people say, "At Eastman Kodak, they can
afford to do it this way—"
The reason we can afford to do things the best way is
that we are successful. The success can be attributed in part
to a fear worth fearing: of failing to deliver the best possible
performance that the customer's hard-won dollar can buy.
Sheer devotion on the part of the work force, though
beautiful to see, will not of itself deliver the goods. Some-
body must first come up with a sensible answer to the
question, "Exactly what is it you want me to do, mister?"
Thus a young industrial engineer may find himself acting
as his own first subject in a study he has set up to find the
physical and psychological conditions that best favor alert-
ness against film emulsion defects. If he saw the need, sold his
boss on his approach, and has earned the approbation alike
of the pretty psychologist who will be running the experi-
ment, the industrial physicians (who study what is humanly
possible, feasible, and healthful muscularly and percep-
tually), the cold-eyed man from the comptroller's office, the
Testing Division chief (who has dedicated his division to
the descent of an asymptote), and the inspectors (who will
find a month after switching to the new method that at
home they are shouting at their kids less often)—then we
know ways to make him glad he chose to learn the profes-
sion of industrial engineering at the company which the
leaders of the profession often cite as its ideal home.
Naturally, industrial engineers aren't the only technical
people we seek. Not by a long shot.

Define Your Career Objectives!
An interview with W. Scott Hill, Manager—Engineering Recruiting, General Electric Co.

W. Scott Hill
Q. Mr. Hill, when is the best time to
begin making decisions on my career
objectives?
A. When you selected a technical
discipline, you made one of your
important career decisions. This de-
fined the general area in which you
will probably begin your professional
work, whether in a job or through
further study at the graduate level.
Q. Can you suggest some factors that
might influence my career choice?
A. By the time you have reached
your senior year in college, you know
certain things about yourself that
are going to be important. If you
have a strong technical orientation
and like problem solving, there are
many good engineering career
choices in all functions of industry:
design and development; manufac-
turing and technical marketing. If
you enjoy exploring theoretical con-
cepts, perhaps research—on one of
the many levels to be found in in-
dustry—is a career choice to con-
sider. And don't think any one area
offers a great deal more opportunity
for your talent than another. They all
need top creative engineering skill
and the ability to deal successfully
with people.
Q. After I've evaluated my own abil-
ities, how do I judge realistically
what I can do with them?
A. I'm sure you're already getting
all the information you can on ca-
reer fields related to your discipline.
Don't overlook your family, friends
and acquaintances, especially re-
cent graduates, as sources of informa-
tion. Have you made full use of your
faculty and placement office for
advice? Information is available in
the technical journals and society
publications. Read them to see what
firms are contributing to advance-
ment in your field, and how. Review
the files in your placement office
for company literature. This can tell
you a great deal about openings and
programs, career areas and company
organization.
Q. Can you suggest what criteria I
can apply in relating this information
to my own career prospects?
A. In appraising opportunities, apply
criteria important to you. Is location
important? What level of income
would you like to attain? What is the
scope of opportunity of the firm
you'll select? Should you trade off
starting salary against long-term
potential? These are things you must
decide for yourself.
Q. Can companies like General Elec-
tric assure me of a correct career
choice?
A. It costs industry a great deal of
money to hire a young engineer and
start him on a career path. So, very
selfishly, we'll be doing everything
possible to be sure at the beginning
that the choice is right for you. But
a bad mistake can cost you even
more in lost time and income. Gen-
eral Electric's concept of Person-
alized Career Planning is to recog-
nize that your decisions will be
largely determined by your individ-
ual abilities, inclinations, and am-
bitions. This Company's unusual di-
versity offers you great flexibility
in deciding where you want to start,
how you want to start and what you
want to accomplish. You will be en-
couraged to develop to the fullest
extent of your capability—to achieve
your career objectives, or revise
them as your abilities are more fully
revealed to you. Make sure you set
your goals realistically. But be sure
you don't set your sights too low.

material that will help you define your opportunity at General Electric, write Mr. Hill at

Polaris missiles are fired by Westinghouse launching systems

Polaris subs are powered by Westinghouse-designed atomic reactors
Twenty Polaris submarines have gone to
sea. Each carries 16 Polaris missiles. They
give the U.S. a deterrent force that no
enemy can hope to strike out of action.
These subs can travel to any ocean in the
world and stay hidden under water for
months, because they are nuclear powered.
Their atomic reactors were developed
and designed by Westinghouse, under the
direction of and in technical cooperation
with the Naval Reactors Branch of the
Atomic Energy Commission.
The subs can fire their Polaris missiles
from far below the surface. A remarkable
deep-water missile launching system, de-
veloped and built by Westinghouse, makes
this possible.

and cut cost 16%

Originally, this earthmover wheel hub was not a forging. Now it is
forged in steel. Here's why . . .
While reviewing costs of the original part, the earthmover manu-
facturer discovered that: (1) Cost of the hub was too high; (2)
rejection rates during machining were high because of voids and
inclusions; and (3) hidden flaws required costly salvage operation.
By converting to forged steel hubs, the manufacturer has saved
16%, has completely eliminated rejects and repairs of parts in
process, has achieved 100% reliability of the part.
Forgings have greater inherent reliability and strength because
they:
1. Are solid, void-free metal
2. Have higher resistance to fatigue
3. Are strongest in withstanding impact and sudden load
4. Have high modulus of elasticity
5. Have low mechanical hysteresis
6. Have unique stress-oriented fiber structure
Memo to future engineers:
"Make it lighter and make it stronger" is
the demand today. No other metalworking
process meets these two requirements so
well as the forging process. Be sure you
know all about forgings. their design and
production. Write for Case History No. 104,

FOOTNOTE
Last month the editorial suggested that the demand for
engineers may decline in the coming years. This prediction
was largely an unsupported conjecture, however. The follow-
ing information published in the Wall Street Journal on
February 20, 1964, should serve as a footnote:
Demand for engineers and other highly skilled
technicians stands only at 65 percent of the 1961
average
Engineering salaries also suggest a slackening
of demand. Since 1960, studies indicate, salaries for
beginning engineers have risen less than 4 percent
annually, on average, far below the average yearly
increase of about 8 percent in the mid-1950's.
The demand has lessened since today's juniors and seniors
enrolled in their respective colleges. The extent of any
further decrease as today's freshmen progress is impossible to
predict. A decrease seems certain however.
Further eye-opening case studies are given in the article,
"Uneasy Engineers" by Alfred L. Malabre, Jr., which should
prove interesting to all student engineers.

enough to give you a chance to work on such new
projects early in your career. Its management can
take a personal interest in your progress.
B&amp;W, with annual sales of more than $330 mil-
lion, offers the advantages of a large company: in-
doctrination training program, paid tuitions, wide
variety of job openings (18 plants in ten states),
security and other benefits.
Growth opportunities are enormous. Yet only
59 bachelor-level students will be hired in 1964.
B&amp;W has interesting positions for graduate and
undergraduate engineers and scientists, including

MANAGEMENT
IS OUR MOST
IMPORTANT
FUNCTION
At the 1963 stockholders' meeting, Arjay R. Miller, President of
Ford Motor Company, emphasized the Company's far-sighted recruit-
ment program and its accent on developing management talent:
Obviously, our long-run future will be determined by the develop-
ment of our management. Here, every one of us—at all levels of
supervision—recognizes this as his most important function. Since 1946,
the Company has recruited widely varied talent—talent that can be
blended to give us the required combination of tight administration and
creative scope.
"Under a carefully conceived management development program, we try to
recruit the best personnel available, both in training and experience. Once we
get them, we have a program for giving them varied opportunities and increasing
responsibility. This program is in force in all parts of the Company—in manufactur-
ing, finance, styling, engineering and marketing.
The program is paying off. We have developed a real depth of management talent
in the Company, and we are dedicated to seeing it continued and reinforced. Because
of this, I feel not only very fortunate in being associated with this management
group, but also very confident of its long-run success. We know our goals and how to
achieve them."

AT ALLISON
■ For L. D. Shorts, the move from the University of
Illinois was a natural. L. D. had learned of the work
Allison is doing in advanced turbine engine develop-
ment. Particularly, he was impressed with Allison's as-
signment to develop the T78 regenerative turboprop
engine.
The T78—selected by the Navy for anti-submarine
aircraft—utilizes turbine exhaust heat to raise the tem-
perature of compressor discharge air, resulting in in-
creased fuel economy for extended long-range and on
station aircraft capability.
Air-cooled turbine blades, another Allison achieve-
ment, mark a significant advance in turbine engine
state of the art. And, the workhorse of turboprops, the
Allison T56, continues to set new standards as our
engineers find additional means of improving perform-
ance and reliability.
In addition to leadership in the turboprop area,
Allison also is making great strides in the development
of nuclear energy conversion projects, including a com-
pact, mobile nuclear reactor and an energy depot con-
cept which will permit manufacturing of fuel "on the
spot" for military field units.
Well-qualified, young engineers will find unlimited
opportunities in the long-range, diversified energy con-
version programs at Allison. Talk to our representative
when he visits your campus. Let him tell you what it's
like in the creative environment at Allison where En-
ergy Conversion Is Our Business.

When science and discovery made
possible the progression from the can-
dle to the incadescent and fluorescent
light, no one anticipated the develop-
ment of a light source with no gas, no
bulbs, no glass, no tubes, or filaments
and cathodes. However, it has emerg-
ed as a practical reality within the
last decade: the "cold" electrolumines-
cent panel. Radically different from
other light sources, it is the only
area light source (i.e., light is emitted
from an entire surface and is not
generated by an incandescent point
or fluorescent line) and the only lamp
which converts electrical energy di-
rectly into light, and with a minimal
amount of energy. Although now a
low intensity device, its unique con-
struction and extremely long life lend
it to applications where conventional
lighting would be more costly and
less dependable, and even not appli-
cable.
The nineteen-letter monster "elec-
troluminescence" adequately describes
the phenomenon responsible, lumine-
scence (non-incadescent light emis-
sion) due to pulsating or static elec-
tric fields. Professor Georges Destriau
observed this phenomenon in Paris
■■ • _ _ as early as 1936; he noted that the
I "I "I T*^^^ T T^^ ^^^ CSS phosphor zinc sulphide activated with
■■■ V^fc Jb ■■§*■§ ■!■ ■!■■■■ Vb^ Km^ copper and other elements dispersed
in an insulating oil emitted light
when subjected to an intense alter-
nating electric field. The EL (electro-
luminescent) phosphor discovered by
him is the basis of all EL devices to-
day, which consist of phosphor pow-
ders embedded in an inorganic (cer-
O ■—-»^ amic) or organic (plastic) dielectric
fc"J [' ■ # • C^a placed between two electrodes, one
^^^^ of which is transparent.
The theory of electroluminescence
is complex, delving deeply into solid-
state physics, and is somewhat contro-
versial. Essentially, though, the lamp
is a luminous capacitor consisting of
two electrically conductive plates with
an EL phosphor "sandwiched" be-
tween them. The electroluminescent
mechanism seems to be confined to
by Paul Niffenegger small regions in the phosphor crystal
where incomplete bonding in con-
junction with the activator atoms
provide electrons in shallow traps.
These electrons help dislodge or lift
electrons from deep traps resulting in

mechanism is not a form of glow dis-
charge as measurements indicate the
luminosity to be out of phase with the
current.
Construction of EL Lamps
Commercially, there are two types
of EL lamps with the basic capacitor
construction, the "ceramic" and the
"organic." This designation merely
indicates whether the phosphor zinc
sulfide is embedded in an organic or
a ceramic-enamel layer. The differ-
ences in construction give the EL
lamps diversified characteristics and
add to their versatility. The lamps
can be constructed in the form
of needle pointers and rods, and flexi-
ble or rigid sheets with dimensions as
large as several feet in length and
width, in any reasonable shape. Total
thickness is negligible, typically 0.045
inches or less.
The glass-organic lamp was the first
EL device to be produced commercial-
ly, and was subsequently used in pas-
senger warning signs on Comet, Bri-
tannia, and Caravelle airliners. As
shown in Fig. 1(b), a protective glass
plate coated with the transparent con-
ductor tin oxide is layered with the
plastic or organic resin binder con-
taining the EL phosphor onto a re-
flector coating as barium titanate, a
reflector which also increases the over-
all dielectric constant permitting
higher power application to the lamp.
The transparent tin oxide is usually
sprayed on and has a light transmis-
sion factor of 80 per cent or better.
The reflector coating is followed with
the second conductor electrode (usual-
ly evaporated metal or conducting
paint) and protective backing. Minor
variations are frequently made: the
reflecting layer may be dispensed with
and the back electrode may be eva-
porated aluminum with inherent, ex-
cellent reflecting properties; or fol-
lowing the reflecting layer, a con-
ducting paint containing lead dioxide
may be easily applied in the form of
letters, etc. The aforementioned paint
has important "self-healing" proper-
ties if a local breakdown of the dielec-
tric occurs.
The organic lamp is very suscepti-
ble to dielectric breakdown due to
moisture penetration, and thus the
back is shielded against moisture en-
try with wax and sometimes alumi-
num foil layers. These lamps have a
higher light output than the ceramic
lamps but a shorter useful life. They
are used extensively over the ceramic
lamps in small and complicated areas
because of the greater ease of fabrica-
tion.
Ceramic EL Lamps
The inorganic or ceramic EL lamp
is very rugged, humidity resistant,
compact, and the most common of
the two types; in fact, millions of the
ceramic panels have been sold. Fig.
1(a) illustrates the simplicity of this
lamp. High quality enameling steel is
cleaned on the one face after which a
special white ceramic dielectric simi-
lar to white porcelain is fused on in
a thin and uniform layer. The plate
acts as a rigid and durable backing,
and one of the two electrodes. Next
the ceramic with the EL phosphor in
suspension is uniformly applied, fol-
lowed with the transparent tin oxide
electrode. Finally, a transparent, in-
sulating ceramic is fused on providing
a protective glaze. Typically, the lay-
ers applied to the plate total less than
1/50 of an inch. Connections to the
two electrodes and final finishing are
than performed.
An interesting variation of the cera-
mic lamp described above is the flexi-
ble EL lamp. It uses aluminum in-
stead of the steel base plate electrode
and a plastic coating instead of a
ceramic glaze. It is thinner, totaling
approximately 0.022 inches including
the aluminum electrode.
Operating Parameters and
Characteristics
The luminous output of an EL de-
vice increases with the applied elec-
tric field; that is, the brightness in-
creases with the applied voltage, the
maximum voltage being limited by
the breakdown of the dielectric. More
interesting is the effect of an increase
in the applied alternating current
(AC) frequency. When the frequency
increases, the brightness rapidly in-
creases, almost following a parabolic
law, and the color shifts upwards to-
wards shorter wavelengths, as green
shifts to the color blue. Different
phosphors are available to produce
green, yellow, blue, red, and any in-
termediate shade including white by
mixing the phosphors, with the green
being 20 per cent brighter for any
given excitation. (Color conversion
enables a deep pink or similar colors
to be produced.)
Phosphors and Operating Mechanisms
Presently, of the electroluminescent
substances gallium phosphide, boron
nitride, certain forms of silicon car-
bide, and zinc sulfide, only zinc sul-
fide is used. The zinc sulfide matrix
is combined with varying proportions
of copper and halide ions; larger pro-
portions of both tend to produce
phosphors which emit in the green in-
stead of the blue under the same
excitation. Yellow EL materials are
produced by additions of about one
per cent of suitable manganese com-
pounds.
The efficiency seems dependent on
two main factors other than phosphor
composition and preparation: phos-
phor particle size and dielectrics used
in manufacture. If the dielectric con-
stant of the embedding medium for
the phosphor is greater than 50, there
is no appreciable gain in output, but
experiments indicate that maximum
efficiency is obtained when the dielec-
tric constant of the phosphor and the
embedding medium are identical.
Higher efficiencies are also favored
if the phosphor particles are fine and
in thicker layers.
The phosphor actually responds
to the electric field strength and not
to the voltage alone. The peak effi-
ciency appears to be inversely propor-
tional to the square root of the par-
ticle diameter. However, maintenance
of output is better with larger par-
ticles; and so a compromise between
efficiency and maintenance of output
desired must be made. The experi-
mental findings for panels of constant
thickness may be summarized as fol-
lows: (1) If the voltage per particle
is constant, the electric field per par-
icle and the light output increase with
a decrease in particle size. (2) At a
given voltage, the voltage per particle
decreases as the particle diameter de-
creases, although the average electric
APRIL 1964

of each particle decreases as the volt-
age decreases per particle, not be-
cause the particles are smaller.
EL lamps never abruptly burn out
under normal operating conditions,
but the light output gradually deter-
iorates. Operation at high tempera-
tures or high frequencies hastens this
deterioration with a corresponding in-
crease in the impedance of the unit.
Because of the high field strengths
and long periods of time involved
during the life of he lamp, even low
ionic mobilities can have appreciable
effects, and it is believed that the de-
crease in output is the result of elec-
trolytic migration in the solid phos-
phor particles.
The phosphor crystals emit
"bursts" of light with each alteration
of the voltage, and the bursts are in
phase with the power absorbed by
the dielectric. The current leads the
voltage by typically 40 to 80 degrees.
Currents per square inch range be-
tween 0.1 and 0.5 milliamperes at 60
cycles, 120 to 600 volts AC, and as
high as 2.2 milliamperes per square
inch at 600 volts AC, 400 cycles, the
present recommended maximum.
Operation thus achieved makes the
panels cold to the touch.

low that of conventional lighting; and
therefore, most research on electro-
luminescence is concentrated on im-
proving die efficiency, which at pres-
ent reaches a maximum of 10 lumens
per watt, in comparison with the 20
lumens per watt of incandescent
lamps and the 70 lumens per watt of
fluorescent lamps. Incandescent light-
ing, however, is limited by a practical
maximum efficiency of 22 lumens per
watt and fluorescent lighting a maxi-
mum of 100 lumens per watt. In the
fluorescent tube ultraviolet light from
a mercury arc excites the phosphor
lining the inside of the lamp tube,
the efficiency of the discharge being
about 50 per cent and the conversion
of ultraviolet light into visible light
also about 50 per cent; in incandes-
cent lamps most of the electrical en-
erg)' is converted into heat. But EL
lamps convert electrical energy direct-
ly into light and are limited by a
maximum theoretical efficiency of
240 lumens per watt, about three and
a half times the efficiency of present
fluorescent lighting; in fact, labora-
tory EL panels have produced a sur-
face brightness in excess of that ob-
tainable from fluorescent light.
Moreover, EL lamps are practically
indestructible and consume a fraction
of the electrical power of convention-
al lighting, ranging from 0.02 to 1.3
watts per square inch between 120
and 600 volts AC from 60 to 400
cycles. When operated on the stand-

ard AC voltage they have a useful
life between 25,000 and 40,000 hours,
(that is, up to five years), while
the incandescent bulb usually has
a 1000 hour life and the fluores-
cent tube 5,000 hours. (It has been
found that the useful life is four times
greater if the EL lamp is operated at
constant brightness instead of con-
stant voltage as "fresh" regions of
the phosphor are utilized as the volt-
age is increased.) EL devices never
abruptly fail, either; the brightness
falls about 50 per cent at the end of
its useful life. They are quite immune
to the most probable cause of failure,
breakdown of the dielectric under ex-
cessive voltage, as the resulting "punc-
ture" is self-healing and leaves a small
black spot on the EL surface. With
respect to temperatures in the range
32°F to 175°F, lamp brightness varies
less than 10 per cent. Thus, in low
brightness, high reliability applica-
tions, EL lamps are unexcelled for
their electrical and mechanical rug-
gedness.
Electroluminescence Excited by
Direct Current
The ceramic EL lamp with a zinc
sulfide phosphor activated by copper
and manganese emits a green or blue
light when excited by AC and a yel-
low light if a potential of 100 volts
or more direct current (DC) is ap-
plied. Another phosphor which ex-
hibits DC electroluminescence is zinc
cadmium sulphide activated by cop-
per and manganese. It possesses the
peculiar property of luminescing on
DC only after being sensitized by elec-
tromagnetic radiation. Thorn Electri-
cal Industries, Ltd. of England have
used the latter phosphor to develop
a remarkable device with a host of
potential applications, the Image Re-
taining Panel (IRP).
The IRP panel is constructed like
the ceramic EL lamps discussed
earlier using this special phosphor
and omitting the ceramic overglaze
to avoid undue radiation absorption.
A DC potential of 60 to 120 volts is
applied to the panel while removed
from the source of radiation, and in
this state it emits no light. If incident
light or radiation is now made to cast
a shadow on the panel by placing an
12
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


opague object between the panel and
the radiation, a yellowish glow builds
up on the irradiated area in propor-
tion to the intensity and duration of
the triggering radiation, as the
photographs illustrate. The current
through the panel increases as por-
tions of it are acti%'ated. With the DC
potential left connected, the trigger-
ing radiation can be removed and
the emission of the panel falls quick-

A key was placed on the image re-
taining panel shown above and a light
was shone on it. Upon removal of the
key and the light source, a sharp image

minutes.
ly to about 75 to 80 per cent but re-
mains constant for a period of up to
20 or 30 minutes thereafter, retaining
the image. If the DC voltage is
switched off or the polarity reversed,
the image disappears and the "clean"
panel is ready for use again after a
few seconds.
The panel has a maximum bright-
ness of about one footlambert (the
average television screen is 20-40 foot-
lamberts) and a working life of up-
wards of 5,000 cycles of retention and
erasure. It has approximately the
same sensitivity as bromide paper
and resolves an image of 100 lines
per inch or a 0.0060 inch square, but
responds to X-rays, gamma radiation,
near infrared, ultraviolet, and visible
light (except a yellow light). The
glowing image does not self-excite the
remainder of the panel. Although
the sensitivity is rather low, the IRP
undoubtedly will be improved even
as the first EL panels were. The ap-
plications for this novel EL device
are, obviously, quite unlimited.
Applications of EL Lamps
Electroluminescent lamps have
found their way into countless appli-
cations where the advantages of elec-
troluminescence, compactness, rug-
gedness, long life and low power con-
sumption, far surpass those of con-
ventional lighting. Some more typical
examples follow: highway and ad-
vertising signs subject to heavy duty,
data display applications of alpha-
numeric characters, train and air-
plane indicators and car instrument
panels, decorative lighting in bars,
hotel lobbies, and the like, EXIT
signs, radio dials and clock faces, and
night lights, to mention only a few.
More sophisticated EL devices have
been developed, too, such as Syl-
vania's light sensitive switches with
photoconductive and EL materials
which are capable of complex logic
functions, and an EL photoconduc-
tive image intensifier responsive to
light, infrared and X-rays.
Of the potential applications of
electroluminescence, the most inter-
esting is a flat television screen with
high brilliance. In experimental
models, the electrodes consist of mutu-
ally perpendicular sets of parallel con-
ducting strips. When any pair is ex-
cited by a voltage, the area between
the intersection of the two electrodes
lights. Halftone images have been
produced at low light levels, and
with frequency changes in the applied
voltage, color variations can be pro-
duced. Electro-Optics Division of
Be\ok Instrument Corp. uses a novel
fabrication technique of closely
spaced, insulated wires formed into a
matrix in its high-resolution EL
panel. When the wires are sequenti-
ally activated, a bar scan is pro-
duced. However, problems such as
relatively poor resolution and re-
sponse time must be solved before a
feasible EL color-TV tube can be
realized.
Electroluminescence, like so many
other recent discoveries, is rapidly
being applied to an ever-widening
field of utilization. The limitation of
a low efficiency may well be eventual-
ly surmounted and then, among the
wonders of electroluminescence, walls
or entire ceilings of light will illum-
inate man's world; the future is
promising.

ity he has wanted to find a way of
generating it efficiently and in large
quantities. Many methods of increas-
ing the efficiency of present systems
have been suggested, but steam tur-
bine power generators have the in-
herent inefficiency of having moving
parts. Many scientists and engineers
are, therefore, looking toward systems
without moving parts. A Magnetohy-
drodynamic system is one of these no
moving parts systems under considera-
tion.
Magnetohydrodynamics (a b b r.
MHD) was born with Michael Fara-
day's dynamo. Technically, it is the
study of the phenomena created by
the interaction of ionized fluids with
crossed electric and magnetic fields.
The fluids under present considera-
tion range from liquid mercury to
gaseous cesium. Faraday, however,
didn't actually discover MHD. He dis-
covered the underlying principles of
all induction type generators. Fara-
day's work consisted of discovering
that a current was generated by run-
ning a wire through a changing mag-
netic field. Essentially, the same
thing is done in an MHD generator
except the conducting material is a
gas or liquid rather than a wire. The
electricity is not easily released as
in the wire generator, but the prin-
ciples are essentially the same.
moving ionized fluid takes the place
of the metal block and by virtue of
the fluids' velocity through the mag-
netic field, an electric current is gen-
erated along the ionized stream and
90° to the action of the magnetic
field. These crossed fields cause the
electrons and ions in the stream to
migrate to one of the two output elec-
trodes because of force F.
This system and its equation are
relatively simple. However, the actual
generation of power by this method
requires much more complex equa-
tions and includes many problems ex-
cluded by this simple model. The
ideal simple model is complicated by
the fact that the gas or liquid used in
such a system must conduct electric-
ity, so conductivity and methods of
achieving it are of prime importance.
There are essentially four ways of get-
ting a conducting fluid: dissolving
salt in water, heating a gas to high
temperature, throwing a spark
through a gas, or by using a liquid
metal. The solution of salt in water
is not very conductive even as a satu-
rated solution, so that rules out the
use of this method. Since one is try-
ing to convert heat to electricity and
not electricity to electricity, one can't
use the spark method. This leaves the
use of a hot gas or a liquid metal.
Now, to decide which to use, another
criterion enters the picture, that of
TstL

A simple direct current producing
MHD generator work due to
the Hall effect. The Hall effect
is used most often for finding
the magnetic flux density or magnetic
strength of a magnet. When a magne-
tic field is placed at 90° to an electric
field, a force is exerted at 90° to the
plane of both fields on all particles in
the magnetic field. This force results
in the movement of some of the elec-
trons at 90° to the plane of both
fields. This effect should be clarified
by Figure I. This Hall effect is de-
noted by the vector equation:
F=E*B
Exactly the same thing happens in a
direct current MHD generator. The
Faraday's Law of Induction. Since this
generator's output is given by this
equation, one must satisfy it the best
way he can. By certain assumptions,
Maxwell's equation can be simplified
from:
e-IBltt
where e is voltage output, B is mag-
netic field strength, 1 the distance be-
tween the electrodes, and u the velo-
city of the fluid. It can easily be seen
that the fluid capable of moving at
the highest velocity is the one that
should be used to produce the highest
voltage, and the fluid is the hot gas.

gain high conductivity for the fluid.
Since one has decided to use a therm-
ally ionized gas, the problem is com-
plicated further. Most of the com-
mon gases such as Air, CO2, or the
noble gases, have very high ionization
potentials, and hence, do not ionize
until very high temperatures are
reached. If the gas has a high ioniza-
tion potential and the heat applied is
insufficient to ionize the gas to a great
enough extent, the amperage capacity
is so low that no power may be drawn
from the system. Thus, any MHD
generator designed to produce elec-
tric power must acquire a 50% ioniza-
tion of its gas to be at all efficient.
Because the alkali metals have low
ionization potentials, one can add
some potassium or sodium to the gas
and thereby increase the conductivity
a great deal.
Now that all the previous prob-
lems have been solved, the prob-
lem of heating die gas arises. One can
heat it in several ways: by fission re-
actor, by fussion reactor, or by direct
chemical combustion. Tests have
been conducted for chemical combus-
tion heated gases such as hydrogen
and cesium. These two gases are
heated in two different ways and
each has its advantage. In the case of
hydrogen, it is heated by direct com-
bustion with oxygen. The two gases
burn causing the water formed to
split into ions or dissociate. Thus, the
conducting fluid is formed and is
driven to a high velocity by the pres-
sure of the burning gas. This type of
system is easy to install and maintain.
For a large power station, however,
this system uses a great deal of fuel
and becomes impractical. With
cesium the heating is done by indirect
means. The cesium gas is put in a
closed system and heated by a heat
exchanger system rather than by di-
rect combustion. This system has the
disadvantage that cesium is highly
corrosive and extremely toxic. If a
leak should develop in the system the
whole power plant could be covered
by deadly cesium metal. The cesium
system is of great advantage in that it
may be heated by either direct com-
bustion or by atomic reactor. It also
has the advantage that cesium is an
alkali metal and therefore, it has a
low ionization potential so the tem-
perature can be kept under the melt-
ing point of most modern metals so
the system can be constructed. No
limit of output power can be seen.
Small amounts of fuel are consumed
slowly by this system in comparison
to the hydrogen system. Either of
these two systems have definite possi-
bilities for future power generating
systems.
Because an MHD system has essen-
tially no moving parts other than the
working fluid itself, the theoretical
maximum efficiency is on the order of
80%-90%. The efficiency in a turbine
system today is only 30%-50% de-
pending upon the installation. The
largest losses in any moving parts
generator system are thermodynamic
ones. Direct loss of heat or friction
losses are insignificant composed to
the loss of energy in the steam tur-
bine. The MHD generator doesn't
have a steam turbine so the greatest
loss is eliminated. This leaves only
small losses such as heat loss through
the walls, electrical losses because of
electrode burn off, and joule losses in
maintaining the magnetic field. All
of these losses could be made insignifi-
cant by making the generator large in
power output.
There exists one basic problem
with any Direct Current MHD gen-
erator: how to transmit direct current
long distances. This transmission
problem has plagued mankind since
he started using electricity. No one
has solved the problem of how to
transmit D.C. long distances, but
Charles Steinmetz solved the trans-
mission problem by using Alternating
Current. This now develops into the
problem of how to convert D.C. into
A.C., or how to develop A.C. in an
MHD generator. At first glance the
answer to the second problem is sim-
ple. If you turn the magnetic field in
the D.C. generator on and off, you
should develop A.C. However, Plasma
Physics, or the study of highly ionized
gases, is not as co-operative as it might
be. If one turns the magnet on and
off, one develops instabilities, eddy
currents, and interferring electric
fields. This results in the generator
producing no power rather than A.C.
The answer then becomes; use the
conversion of D.C. to A.C. The only
problem with doing the conversion
is that the electrical efficiency of the
generation system falls off sharply.
Because of this fact, many corpora-
tions are studying the properties of
an Alternating Current MHD gener-
ator. Obviously, the A.C. generator
is much more complex that its pre-
dicessor the D.C. machine even though
it works on the same principles as
induction generators.
Because of the studies with time
varying magnetic fields, one knows
that a magnetically susceptible ma-
terial, such as iron, placed in a cham-
ber can be driven by a time varying
magnetic field placed around the con-
tainer. If a conducting fluid is placed
in the container with the iron held
stationary then what will happen? It
turns out that the fluid is pumped
past die center body and out of the
container. Because of these studies,
one can say that a conductor tends to
prevent movement of a magnetic
field and vice versa. Since work is
being done by the time varying field,
the efficiency should be as high as
possible, so one winds on different
coils around the tube. The basic
function for a cosine wave is Cos
(kx — w0t): where kx is the magni-
tude and oi0t is the frequency. Since
one has n coils and not an infinite
number of coils the Cos (kx —&lt;,,0t)
function can only be approximated
by setting it equal to:
where Cj is the current in the particu-
lar coil, 8j is the phase angle of the
current in the particular coil, and
/j (x) is the function defining the mag-
ntic field produced by each individual
coil. Now, if one runs a least squares
solution to the function:
one gets the best approximation to
the ideal function if one now pushes

the conducting fluid through a tube
around which are wound the n coils
and a high magnetic permeability ma-
terial is placed as a center body, elec-
tricity in A.C. form may be drawn
off. The diagram in Fig. II should
illustrate what is going on in the
A.C. generator. What is actually tak-
ing place is that the magnetic flux
produced by the preceding coil is

thereby, inducing a current in that
coil. Using this method one can draw
A.C. current off each of the coils.
Because of the nature of this gen-
erator, it is a self-exciting device. This
should be evident if one inspects the
graph of resistance versus the differ-
ence between the phase velocity of
the magnetic wave and the speed of
the fluid flow (Uph is phase velocity
and Vf is flow velocity). The graph
is shown in Figure III. The point of
self-excitation is the point at which
the generator no longer needs an out-
side power source to feed power to
the coils to produce the magnetic
field. At this point the generator will
produce the same amount of power
that it consumes. If the Vf—Vph is
increased even further, the generator
will produce more power than it con-
sumes and the difference may be
pulled off into an outside load. This
type of generator than allows A.C. to
be produced without moving parts
of any kind except the fluid itself.
The biggest problem with any type
of MHD generator is the problem of
heat. Any MHD generator is going to
have to operate at very high tempera-
ture so this requires that material
heat fatigue and melting point must
be considered in any application
where this means of power produc-
tion is employed. Some of the present
ideas for controlling the temperature
are: use low temperature ionization
potential materials such as cesium,
use seeded gases or gases with an al-
kali metal added, or insulate the
chamber walls with magnetic blan-
kets. The last of these methods is the
most interesting because it leads to the
use of magnetic fields to slow re-
entry vehicles.
It was found that plasmas tend to
be repelled by a magnetic field due to
the electrical and magnetic forces act-
ing on the particles in the plasma. If,
therefore, a magnetic field is put
around the large generator section, the
plasma will be forced away from the
walls and toward the center of the
generator. The same thing may be
done with a space re-entry vehicle.
The plasma is initially created by
the vehicle heating up the gas be-
cause of friction. The magnetic field
can then be energized and the vehicle

plus the blanket, the re-entry vehicle
will be larger, thereby, create more
drag friction and slow the vehicle
faster. The magnetic blanket will
also prevent burn off of the outside
metal of the re-entry vehicle.

limited in scope to power generation
and re-entry problems. MHD is one
of the most far reaching studies now
being conducted. Some of the other
aspects of interest are sunspot activity
and formation, aurora borealis forma-
tion, cosmic ray production, control
of thermonuclear reaction, electro-
magnetic wave propagation, nuclear
reaction phenomena, and origins of
the galactic systems. These are only a
few of the studies under MHD. Each
of these studies is of importance to
everyone in some way. MHD will
make space travel a reality. It will
help us to understand and control the
weather. It will allow us to predict
when radio communications will be
interrupted by sunspot activity. It
may allow us to use the hydrogen
fussion reactor as a source of electric
power. It may eliminate cosmic rays
from critical experiments. Some scien-
tists feel that the study of MHD phe-
nomena will lead to the unified field
theory that Einstein was on the verge
of formulating when he died in 1955.
With a unified field theory we will be
able to understand and possibly con-
trol the earth's gravitation. MHD is a
field that is wide open, and much
more work needs to be done. As yet
we have only scratched the surface.

Ohio University conferred a B.S.E.E. degree on C. T.
Huck in 1956. Tom knew of Western Electric's history
of manufacturing development. He realized, too, that
our personnel development program was expanding
to meet tomorrow's demands.
After graduation, Tom immediately began to work
on the development of electronic switching systems.
Then, in 1958, Tom went to the Bell Telephone Lab-
oratories on a temporary assignment to help in the
advancement of our national military capabilities. At
their Whippany, New Jersey, labs, Tom worked with
the Western Electric development team on computer
circuitry for the Nike Zeus guidance system. Tom then
moved on to a new assignment at WE's Columbus,
Ohio, Works. There, Tom is working on the develop-
ment of testing circuitry for the memory phase of elec-
tronic switching systems.
This constant challenge of the totally new, com-
bined with advanced training and education opportu-
nities, makes a Western Electric career enjoyable,
stimulating and fruitful. Thousands of young men
will realize this in the next few years. How about you?

Kenneth E. Coulter, director of re-
search and development for the Mid-
land Division of The Dow Chemical
Company, admits, that in geometry,
the shortest distance between two
points is a straight line. But Coulter
does not believe this theorem con-
tains a formula for business success.
Coulter would rather believe that
a not-so-straight line, passing through
some basic areas of experience and
offering exposure to many facets of
industrial life, offers a better path to
success.
This not-so-straight line is the type
Coulter has been able to follow since
he joined Dow shortly after he was
graduated from The University of
Michigan. When he received both his
bachelor's and master's degrees in
chemical engineering here in 1941,
Coulter set the mark from which his
career was to be drawn.
Coulter feels that the time he spent
here laid the foundation for his later
success. It was from this foundation
that he began to build. The building
process he has followed is certainly
not the geometry student's straight
line. He has moved through all phases
of the chemical industry, and in the
process, has acquired a vast store of
new and varied knowledge.
Throughout his career with Dow,
Coulter has exhibited a drive and en-
thusiasm that has made him an as-
set to the company. This enthusiasm
has been recognized by Dow, and
Coulter has had the opportunity to
work in the areas he felt would pre-
pare him for future advancement.
Dow offered him the chance to add
a great deal of detailed technical
knowledge about the chemical indus-
try to the foundation gained during
his college work.
Coulter spent time working in a
chemical engineering laboratory in
Midland and some time in an organic
research laboratory in the company's
Texas Division, then attended a
20

Kenneth E. Coulter, M.E. (Ch.E.), 1941
training program in the production
of styrene. Not only was he gaining
technical knowledge and applied
skills, he was enjoying the opportun-
ity to move from pure research into
applied research.
This technical knowledge, which
Coulter believes to be a very im-
portant part of the formula for suc-
cess, came in many ways. Some was
acquired from formal training pro-
grams, some of it from books, and a
lot of it from on-the-job study.
Coulter was able to do a lot of on-
the-job studying when he got the po-
sition of night forman in the Mid-
land Division's ethylene plant. Al-
though many people feel that a night
shift job is unattractive, Coulter
looked on it as a great chance to
learn. "During the night, there are
fewer people at work, and the chance
to explore the entire operation and to
see just what makes it work is better
than at any other time," says Coulter.
Again violating the straight line
philosophy of so many people, Coul-
ter moved to different phases of pro-
duction work, taking two consecutive
positions as assistant superintendent
of production plants. The first of
these involved transferring from Mid-
land back to the Texas Division, and
the second meant a return to Mid-
land.
Still a "veteran" of less than three
years with Dow, Coulter had man-
aged to work in organic research and
several phases of production. The
company then offered him the oppor-
tunity to see yet anodier phase, and
he took it. Ignoring the straight line
again, Coulter moved into a physical
research laboratory as a group leader.
He spent several years there, learn-
ing research procedures and applying
his knowledge of production.
Chemical production, of course, re-
quires chemical process plants. With
his broad knowledge of the needs of
production, and his research experi-
ence, Coulter was a natural choice as
process engineer to work with a con-
tractor to construct a new vinyl to-
luene plant.
Coulter worked on the design of
the plant, contributing ideas to make
it better and more efficient. Then, he
followed its construction, step by
step. When it was completed, he was
named superintendent of the opera-
tion. Again, Coulter was back in pro-
duction work.
After he had gotten the newly con-
structed vinyltoluene plant under-
way, Coulter was chosen to be a staff
assistant to the Midland Division gen-
eral manager.
This offered him the opportunity
to gain another of the experiences he
feels is essential to success. He was
now able to gain business knowledge
by viewing the over-all operation of
a division of a huge corporation, and
seeing what was needed to make it
economically successful.
About a year after he was named to
his staff position, Coulter again put a
sudden bend in his career line. He
became the assistant chief engineer
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


in charge of process engineering.
Here, he was able to design processes
which would adapt pilot plant pro-
duction to full-scale operations.
After three years of process engi-
neering, Coulter again moved, this
time into the field of engineering and
construction. He was assistant mana-
ger for a while, then took what is
probably his only straight line step-
he was promoted to manager of the
Engineering and Construction De-
partment, later expanded to include
maintenance operations. Coulter
spent about three years in this por-
tion of his Dow career.
By this time, Coulter had a broad
expanse of experience on which Dow
could call, and on which he could
reflect with a great deal of satisfac-
tion.
He could look back on experience
in research, production, business man-
agement, process engineering, and en-
gineering, construction and main-
tenance.
In June, 1963, Coulter was named
director of research and development
for the Midland Division. From his
starting point as a University of Mich-
igan chemical engineering graduate,
he had followed a route which had
taken him through nearly every
phase of the chemical industry.
He had worked in areas where
products are theories—he had worked
to develop theories into practicality-
he had worked to build facilities to
convert practical ideas to real prod-
ucts—he had worked in the area of
making real products profitable to
produce and sell.
By taking advantage of the many
opportunities offered him during his
career at Dow, Coulter built a broad
and solid background enabling him
to direct the research efforts of one of
Dow's major divisions.

Shown above is Dow Chemical Company's ethyl benzene plant in Midland, Michigan. Such a plant exemplifies the fruits of
Mr. Coulter's leadership in Dow's research and develompent program.

The groove on this Malleable iron cam for a packaging machine requires a
fine finish. A shell core used on the outside of the part produces such a smooth,
accurate surface that no machining is required.

Shell coring produces such exact detail that the acme thread on this Malleable
iron trench brace wing nut is used without any machining. Previously pro-
duced with a standard oil sand core, it required reaming and tapping.
Solve Design Problems, Reduce Machining
with Shell Cored Malleable Castings
Shell cores are most often used to create interior surfaces but, in
addition, they can be utilized at other locations in a green sand
casting to impart smoothness, provide closer tolerances, reduce
machining, and solve a variety of design problems.
Shell cores create surface finishes of 50 to 250 microinch rms.
Thus, excellent detail can be obtained in Malleable castings for gear
teeth, holes, dove-tails, mating surfaces and threads with this modern
casting technique.
The internal air passages and chambers in the pneumatic wrench
handle, shown at right, are excellent examples of the amazingly
complex details which can be created accurately and economically
in Malleable castings with shell coring. They are produced—complete-
ly finished except for tapping—in the basic casting.
The advantages obtainable from shell coring in
selected applications, combined with Malleable's
high strength, ductility, easy machinability and
reliable uniformity, make Malleable castings an
outstanding choice for high-quality, low-cost parts.
Send for your free copy of this 16-page "Malleable
Engineering Data File." You will find it is an excel-
lent reference piece.


The machining once required to produce this
lever bracket included broaching the square hole,
milling the slot, drilling and reaming the two large
bolt holes, and drilling the small hole. All machin-
ing has been eliminated through the use of a
single shell core.

Precise dove-tails, intricate air channels and other
interior details of this impact wrench handle are
produced in the Malleable casting by the three
shell cores shown. A variety of machining opera-
tions is eliminated by this relatively low-cost
technique.

Is it news that a leading maker of
spacecraft alloys had a hand in dolling
up Mildred Kinne's potting shed?
It isn't really surprising that a single U.S. corporation pro-
vided the metal for the outer skin of Mercury space capsules.
It's perfectly natural to be called in on that kind of a job when
you lead the nation in developing a line of alloys that resist
extreme heat, wear and corrosion.
You'd also expect that a leading producer of petrochemi-
cals could develop a new base for latex paint—called "Ucar"
latex—since paint makers are among its biggest customers.
Now Mildred Kinne can paint right over o chalky surface with-
out priming. It's dry in minutes. And her potting shed will look
like new for many New England summers and winters.
But it might indeed be surprising if both these skills
were possessed by the same company. Unless that
company were Union Carbide.

Union Carbide also leads in the production of polyethylene,
and makes plastics for packaging, housewares, and floor cov-

will power rockets to the moon. In carbon products, it has been
called on for the largest graphite shapes ever made. It is the
largest producer of dry-cell batteries, marketed to millions
under the trade mark "Eveready." And it is involved in more
atomic energy activities than any other private enterprise.
In fact, few other corporations are so deeply involved

A new method of foaming plastics
for use as wire insulation and other
applications has been discovered by
Dr. Ralph H. Hansen of Bell Telephone

based on what he calls the "hot spot"
theory; that is, the more hot spots in a
plastic, the more bubbles created, and
consequently, the better the insulating
properties of the plastic.

Laboratories pours plastic pellets into

THE COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING
The Electron Physics Laboratory Is one of
the laboratories of the Electrical Engineering
Department which offers the opportunity for
research "internship". Unique analog computer
facilities are a part of this laboratory.

ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
The contributions of Electrical Engineering are manifold in our rapidly advancing society. The electrical engineer
is keenly aware of the technological needs of our society and the scientific community. The electrical engineer is ex-
tending and deepening fundamental knowledge beyond the normal accomplishments of basic physics, chemistry, biology,
and mathematics. He aids considerably in supplying the everyday needs for the existence of our society. For example,
his efforts are felt in food growing, processing, and distribution through his work with machine control, data process-
ing, and communication. His accomplishments are apparent when one considers the abundance of electrically con-
trolled and powered devices in our homes, places of business, and recreational facilities. His more publicized
contributions come from his work in the scientific community. Some of his accomplishments in this area include: world-
wide radio and television communication; machine learning and application of information theory; employment of new
physical science tools such at coherent optics, lasers, electrically conducting plasmas and solid state devices.
The University of Michigan is fulfilling its obligation to our society by training both the undergraduate and grad-
uate student to be leaders in the rapidly expanding technological areas mentioned. This training takes the form of
formal classroom work and research "internship" for a large fraction of students desiring it. The student who has
participated in the complete training program is usually a more effective engineer, one who appreciates the tie-in
between theory and practice and is ready for the real world of professional responsibility.

After McNair designs it,
Kelly has to manufacture it
In the broad spectrum of engineers and scientists we con-
stantly seek, we can use more manufacturing engineers like
Edward Joseph Kelly (right, six years out of Tufts this
June). Mark well the distinction between Kelly's responsi-
bility and that of his opponent in the debate pictured. Out
of it upon completion of their differing assignments will
come a photographic information storage and retrieval
device that will bear our "Recordak" trademark, well known
in banking and other businesses.
Dave McNair has determined how the mechanical, optical,
and electrical components and subassemblies have to work
and fit together for the equipment to do its job. He has
come up with a working model. Management likes it.
Enter Kelly. His task: to tell us exactly down to the last
detail what we have to do to multiply McNair's working
model by x, a number chosen by the marketing people. To
make the production-run machines work not merely as well
as McNair's hand-built one, but better. To decide which
parts we should buy and which we should make. To specify
the tooling for the parts we make. To specify also the tools
for assembly and inspection. To design the fabrication proc-
esses. Better than just designing the processes, to see the
need for a process which no previous manufacturing engineer
had realized was needed and which happens to make the
product an irresistible bargain for the ultimate user and a
money-maker for us.
We need that kind of manufacturing engineer so that we
can teach him how to run a big business.

Define Your Career Objectives!
An interview with W. Scott Hill, Manager—Engineering Recruiting, General Electric Co.

W. Scott Hill
Q. Mr. Hill, when is the best time to
begin making decisions on my career
objectives?
A. When you selected a technical
discipline, you made one of your
important career decisions. This de-
fined the general area in which you
will probably begin your professional
work, whether in a job or through
further study at the graduate level.
Q. Can you suggest some factors that
might influence my career choice?
A. By the time you have reached
your senior year in college, you know
certain things about yourself that
are going to be important. If you
have a strong technical orientation
and like problem solving, there are
many good engineering career
choices in all functions of industry:
design and development; manufac-
turing and technical marketing. If
you enjoy exploring theoretical con-
cepts, perhaps research—on one of
the many levels to be found in in-
dustry—is a career choice to con-
sider. And don't think any one area
offers a great deal more opportunity
for your talent than another. They all
need top creative engineering skill
and the ability to deal successfully
with people.
Q. After I've evaluated my own abil-
ities, how do I judge realistically
what I can do with them?
A. I'm sure you're already getting
all the information you can on ca-
reer fields related to your discipline.
Don't overlook your family, friends
and acquaintances, especially re-
cent graduates, as sources of informa-
tion. Have you made full use of your
faculty and placement office for
advice? Information is available in
the technical journals and society
publications. Read them to see what
firms are contributing to advance-
ment in your field, and how. Review
the files in your placement office
for company literature. This can tell
you a great deal about openings and
programs, career areas and company
organization.
Q. Can you suggest what criteria I
can apply in relating this information
to my own career prospects?
A. In appraising opportunities, apply
criteria important to you. Is location
important? What level of income
would you like to attain? What is the
scope of opportunity of the firm
you'll select? Should you trade off
starting salary against long-term
potential? These are things you must
decide for yourself.
Q. Can companies like General Elec-
tric assure me of a correct career
choice?
A. It costs industry a great deal of
money to hire a young engineer and
start him on a career path. So, very
selfishly, we'll be doing everything
possible to be sure at the beginning
that the choice is right for you. But
a bad mistake can cost you even
more in lost time and income. Gen-
eral Electric's concept of Person-
alized Career Planning is to recog-
nize that your decisions will be
largely determined by your individ-
ual abilities, inclinations, and am-
bitions. This Company's unusual di-
versity offers you great flexibility
in deciding where you want to start,
how you want to start and what you
want to accomplish. You will be en-
couraged to develop to the fullest
extent of your capability—to achieve
your career objectives, or revise
them as your abilities are more fully
revealed to you. Make sure you set
your goals realistically. But be sure
you don't set your sights too low.
FOR MORE INFORMATION on G.E.'s concept of Personalized Career Planning, and for
material that will help you define your opportunity at General Electric, write Mr. Hill at
this address: General Electric Co., Section 699-10, Schenectady, N. Y. 12305.
