AFTER THE WAR
HERBERT H. DOW, GENERAL MANAGER DOW CHEMICAL CO.
T AM asked to predict what will hap-
■*. pen to American manufacturers
at the close of the war, and as this is
a very important subject to all manu-
facturers, and all of them have un-
doubtedly given it a good deal of
thought, it is with pleasure that I pre-
sent my views here.
The factors that will make it possi-
ble for Americans to compete with the
rest of the world, I think can be very
properly divided into three classes:
First, relative ability as measured
by the amount of brains we have as
compared with those of our competi-
tors.
Second, accumulated knowledge
that could be defined as a knowledge
of the ''tricks of the trade," and
Third, the Trust laws and the tariff
laws that will favor or hinder Ameri-
cans, and the corresponding laws or
bounties or their equivalent that might
affect the possible competitor.
So far as T know, there is no way
of measuring the relative brain pow-
ers of the American manufacturers
and their possible competitors. There
are a number of incidents that might
be cited to prove either side of our
case, but these would be something
like the observation of a famous doc-
tor in the Balkans—I don't remember
his name—who noted that the people
were unusually long-lived and that
they consumed considerable sour milk;
consequently, sour milk was produc-
tive of long life. Or, we might take
the argument that I once heard put
forward, that one could walk down
the street and pick out the strongest
and healthiest looking men, of whom
nine out of ten had never taken a
bath; consequently, if you want to be
strong and healthy, never take a bath.
This whole subject of relative mental
power is so complicated and proofs
are so difficult to obtain, that at least
for the sake of argument, we will as-
sume that the American manufacturer
and his employees are on a par with
the corresponding men in any compet-
ing country.
The next heading under which I
have divided the whole subject of abil-
ity to compete, is the relative knowl-
edge of the "tricks of the trade." On
this subject, unlike the preceding one,
we have some pretty positive proofs.
Why is it that Boston is the center of
the shoe and leather industry? Un-
doubtedly it is because people in the
vicinity of Boston know more about
the "tricks of the trade" incident to
manufacturing leather, and boots and
shoes, than is known by people in oth-
er localities. Similarly, Grand Rapids
got started as a furniture center. Peo-
ple talked furniture, worked with fur-
niture, saw new designs of furniture
wherever they went, and were in touch
with the latest methods for making
furniture, and consequently Grand
Rapids acquired more of the "tricks
of the trade" in furniture manufac-
turing than other localities. The same
argument applies to Detroit as an au-
tomobile center.
From all this I infer that Germany
knows vastly more about the manu-


facture of chemicals in which she has
excelled in the past than the Ameri-
can firms know. On the other hand,
America knows better than Europe
how to make chemicals on a big scale,
as evidenced by the fact that American
Bicarbonate of Soda has been sold in
Hamburg as German Pharmacopoeia
Bicarbonate of Soda. Caustic Soda
cannot be profitably made by electrol-
ysis in Germany. Sulphuric Acid nor-
mally sells for less in the United
States than it does abroad. An Amer-
ican factory for extracting sugar from
beets is decidedly more economical to
operate than a corresponding foreign
plant. When it comes to the broad
principles of manufacturing on a big
scale, such as is exemplified by the
Ford plant, by our sewing machine
plants, and our plants in which type-
writers and cash registers are made,
we have abundantly proven our abil-
ity to outstrip all foreign competition.
When it comes to metallurgical prob-
lems that are more or less chemical,
we are also able to at least hold our
own with foreign competition, as evi-
denced by the magnitude of the Gary
plant, and the fact that American min-
ing engineers are in demand in all
quarters of the world.
As long as chemical manufacture
consisted in making products in large
laboratory apparatus, the cheap Ger-
man labor and the cheap German
chemist can undoubtedly outstrip his
American competitor, but when we
pass by the laboratory way of hand-
ling material; when we pass by the big
evaporating dish instead of the small
one, or the enameled kettle instead of
the beaker, and get to the condition
where great tanks are used with me-
chanical agitation and all the steps are
handled mechanically; then the Amer-
ican manufacturer is working with
tools that he is more familiar with
than is his foreign competitor, and the
"tricks of the trade" are with us rath-
er than with our competitor.
Now let us consider the third phase
of our subject, namely, our ability to
compete as affected by American laws.
When I first started to manufacture
bromine, I had as a partner a man who
had spent most of his life as a sewing
machine manufacturer, and it may be
of interest to know that a manufactur-
er gets about $9.50 for a sewing ma-
chine. The reason why the consumer
has to pay so much more is because
of the very great expense of selling.
The selling is strictly competitive, and
it is the expense of the competition
that makes the ultimate price so high.
The same argument applies to pianos,
for which the manufacturer gets from
$80.00 to $100.00. You are probably
all familiar with some of the many
tricks that agents adopt in order to
sell these products, the resulting bad
accounts and the great amount of time
lost incident to the sales, and also
heavy items in connection with the
selling expense.
Probably the Standard Oil Com-
pany was the first concern in the Uni-
ted States to fully appreciate the enor-
mous expense of competition and de-
vise means of eliminating it. While I
am not for a minute advocating many
of the methods attributed to the
Standard Oil Company, yet I think it
would be safe to say that any method
the Standard Oil Company uses, when
viewed from the money making stand-
point alone, is correct; and all foreign
countries have recognized this fact to
such an extent that laws are framed,
not to stop competition but to favor
Trusts. For example, the North Ger-
man Lloyd and Hamburg-American
steamship lines a short time before the


war,' started a price-cutting competi-
tion with each other. The German
Government stepped in and prohibited
the price cutting. We have, ourselves,
had experience with foreigners that
abundantly demonstrated that "Live
and let live" is not an approved policy
among these foreign competitors.
Possibly a law that would prevent
any manufacturer from selling goods
below cost might go a long way to-
ward settling the entire Trust prob-
lem. This broad idea would need some
minor modifications incident to varia-
ble freight rates or other similar cause,
but no manufacturer will normally
sell goods below cost except for the
purpose of putting a competitor out
of business, and on the assumption
that he has more money and can stand
the loss longer than his competitor.
Now let us consider for a few mo-
ments the subject of tariff.
The tariff has been very exhaustive-
ly considered by politicians for many
years, but I do not remember that the
following phase of the subject has
been presented. The sale of every
chemical manufactured abroad in nor-
mal times is controlled and the price
in America is not fixed by competition
but is fixed by what the foreign Trust
estimates will be the maximum price
that will not start competition. They
well know that tariffs do not get put
on articles automotically. and when
they see that an article that has for-
merlv been on the free list is being
protected, they know that competition
is imminent, and consequently reduce
their price to nip the competition in
the bud. At least, there are many ex-
amples of this method of procedure.
One notable example is the case of
Bleaching Powder, that sold for 2^4c
.
per pound when it was on the free list.
As soon as it was given 2/10 of a cent
per pound protection, the foreigner
made a price of i}ic. per pound in the
United States and paid the import du-
ty. Then, when competition within
the United States became acute, the
price was reduced to i/4c. per pound,
and the foreigner still paid the im-
port duty. Had no tariff been put on
Pdeaching Powder in the first place,
American competition might not have
arisen and the price would undoubted-
ly have remained at 2}4c. per pound.
To summarize: Labor and brains
are too high-priced in America for us
to compete on equal terms in manufac-
turing any compound where the total
consumpion is $50.00 per day or less.
Where the total consumption is be-
tween $50.00 and $200.00 per day, we
may or may not be able to compete.
Where the total business that the
American manufacturer might secure
is in excess of $500.00 per day, our
experience in manufacturing things on
a big scale, our superior knowledge of
labor-saving machinery, should make
it possible for us to compete, providing
patents or tariff laws or Trust laws do
not handicap the American maker.

W. C. BABBITT, '19E
&lt;&lt;AT7AY hack in the days hcfore
* » railroads were even dreamed
of, there was constructed across the
State of New York, a canal, which
was at first sarcastically called "Clin-
ton's Big Ditch." after Governor Clin-
ton, its promoter. l&gt;ut the "Big Ditch"
was a success and within a few years
after its completion it was a scene of
bustling activity. Its course was gone
over and approved by President
Washington, before the actual work
was undertaken and the original "Erie
Canal," as it came to be known, was
finally completed in October, 1825.
Among the stories told of the old
Erie Canal, one of the most interest-
ing relates to the packet boats. These
boats were usually of a rather ornate
nature, and were designed for passen-
ger service. They were towed by teams
of horses or mules which went at a
gallop, and which were frequently
changed for fresh ones. The arrival
of one of these packets at a town was
quite an event, especially as they were
the only satisfactory means of travel
in those days when roads (if they
may be called such) were more or less
impassible for nine months of the
year.
When the packet was on its journey
it was preceded by a man on horse-
back who rode along the tow path
blowing a horn. The main idea of this
was to give the freight boats warning
so that they could drop their tow lines
to allow the packet to pass. If the
freighter was at all slow in casting its
line, the sharp-edged bows with which
packets were provided made short
work of the rope.
Xow all is changed. With the ad-
vent of the new Barge Canal, mules
will no longer be seen traveling the
tow path, and the only tow lines used
will be between barges and tugs. Also
the day of the passenger boat has
passed, though one does occasionally
see a pleasure craft of one kind of an-
other on the canal.
Probably many of us do not realize
that we have, right here in the north-
ern part of the United States, a canal
which in a great many ways rivals the
Panama. This canal, the New York
State Barge Canal, connects directly
the Great Lakes with the tidewater of
New York harbor. The entire sys-
tem is practically 40 times as long as
the Panama, and its highest point is
some 30 ft. higher with respect to its
lowest point than is true in the case
of the Panama Canal.
The Barge Canal cost almost
half as much as the Panama Canal,
but in making this comparison it must
be remembered that the New York
State Barge Canal was constructed in
a temperate zone and that the work
was not handicapped by tropical con-
ditions.
The total length of the canal is 407.3
miles. Scattered along this length
there are forty dams, fifty-seven locks,
fifty terminal harbors (under con-
struction), two immense reservoirs,
and more than four hundred miscel-
laneous structures such as bridges.
aqueducts and the like. Careful esti-


mates show that the water flows into
the canal at the rate of 1,200 cu. ft.
per sec., and that the canal will sup-
port twenty billion tons of traffic in a
season without overloading.
In addition to its magnitude the
Rarge Canal enjoys the distinction of
heing spanned by the widest bridge in
the world. On its course is located
the nrst ''hook-needle" movable dam
1st: The reconstructed Erie Canal,
which constitutes the main channel,
and is 339 miles long.
2nd: The Cayuga-Seneca branch
which runs from Montezuma on the
main line, in two forks, to Lakes Cay-
uga and Seneca respectively. The to-
tal length of this branch is 93.6 miles.

ning from Three Rivers on the main

Fig. i. Map of New York State Barge Canal
-erected in this country. It has the
greatest lift lock in the world. Then
too, it possesses the only siphon lock
in America, which is still more famous
since it is the largest siphon lock ever
built.
With these few facts in mind let us
examine more closely this $175,000,-
000 direct water route from the Great
Lakes to New 'York City.
The Canal, System
The Xew York State Barge Canal
System can be roughly divided into
four distinct parts. They are:
line, and through the city of Oswego
to Lake Ontario. This branch is
known as the Oswego Canal.
4th: The Lake Champlain branch,
which connects Lake Champlain with
the main canal at Albany. Its length
is 61 miles.
The problem of maintaining the
proper depth of water throughout the
entire length is quite a serious and
complicated one. In order to solve
this problem two summit levels have
been established. One of these is lo-
cated at the western terminus of the
canal and the other near Rome. The


reasons for locating the summit levels
at these places can readily be seen by
examining the profile of the canal as
shown in Fig. I, noting particularly
the position of Rome and its relation
to the rest of the canal.
Having established the summit lev-
els the next thing to be done was to
find an adequate water supply which
could be fed into the canal at these
points. In the case of the western end
this task was very simple, as it was
only necessary to tap the Niagara Riv-
er. Here an ample supply is assured
since the Niagara River is fed by all
the Great Lakes except Ontario.
The water supply system at Rome,
however, is of a much more difficult
and complicated nature, and it finally
necessitated Ihc construction of two
large reservoirs. One of these is lo-
cated over and around the spot where
the town of Delta once stood, and is
called, from this, the Delta Reservoir.
Its capacity is two and three-quarters
billion cu. ft., and its source of supply
is principally the .Mohawk River. It
has a main wall 1,100 ft. long with a
300 ft. spilhvay and a maximum
height of 100 ft. above the stream bed.
More than 270,000 cu. ft. of concrete
were used in the construction of this
wall alone.
The other reservoir is located at
Hinckley, damming West Canada
Creek. The concrete work on this
Hinckley Reservoir is not of nearly as
great a magnitude as that of the Delta
inasmuch as the dam is principally of
earth. Its capacity, however, is ap-
proximately seven hundred million cu.
ft. greater than that of the Delta. Both
reservoirs lie on the slopes of the Adi-
rondack Mountains to which they owe
their water supply.
Genrrai, Dimensions
The length of the New York State
P.arge Canal has already been stated
as 403.7 miles. Over this entire
stretch, construction work of a more
or less complex nature was necessary.
If, on the other hand, we consider the
entire canal system together with the
distance traversed through rivers and
Fig. 2. Gate Construction
lakes where no improvements were
necessary, then the total mileage in-
creases from 403.7 to slightly more
than 790.
The depth of the canal is not less
than twelve feet, and its minimum bot-
tom width is 75 ft. Of course the
width at the top depends entirely on
the nature of the ground at the par-
ticular location. If the canal is pass-
ing through solid rock (usually lime-
stoned as it does in several instances


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
for considerable distances, then the
side walls are usually perpendicular
and the surface width is the same as
the bottom, while in other cases the
sidewalls are generally slanted more
or less. At turns, harbors, approaches
to locks, and the like, the canal is gen-
erally much wider than at other places.
Locks
Because of the almost constantly
changing level of the canal, the locks
come prominently to our attention
since they are so vital. There are in
all 57 locks in the Barge Canal. As
a rule these locks are of a standard de-
sign so that a description of one, to-
gether with the pointing out of a few
differences, will amply suffice for all.
The locks at Lockport are a trifle
out of the ordinary in a way be-
cause, with the exception of the pair
at Seneca Falls, this was the only
place where the drop was so abrupt
and so severe that it was found neces-
sary to place two locks in succession.
In all other ways, however, they are
practically identical to the rest of the
locks, so that we will use these Lock-
port locks as our particular example.
All the locks on the canal system are
numbered. Of the two at Lockport
the lower one is numbered 34; the up-
per one, 35. For brevity these num-
bers will be used in referring to the
locks.
Before proceeding with this descrip-
tion let us first note that there is one
main dimension of lock that is, in most
cases, different for each particular ex-
ample chosen. That is the depth. The
depth is dependent on the amount of
lift necessary, which in turn is meas-
ured by the difference in water levels
above and below the lock. The
amounts of these lifts vary all the way
from 6 ft. to ^oV2 ft.
For example: The locks Nos. 34
and 35 each have a lift of 24^ ft.
Lock No. 17, located at Little Falls,
has a lift of 40,1/ ft. This is the great-
est lift of any lock on the canal, and,
indeed, is said to be the greatest lift
made by any lock of its kind in the
world.
But to return to the description of
Lock 35: It is 328 ft. long between
gates, and 45 ft. wide. 310 of its 328-
ft. length is available for boats. The
lock walls are constructed entirely of
concrete, as is likewise the bottom.
The manner of laying the bottom of
the lock chamber, also, varies consid-
erably according to the nature of the
ground at that particular point. In the
case of Locks 34 and 35, for example,
the bottom of these lock chambers had
to be blasted out of solid limestone, af-
ter first removing one set of the old
Frie Canal locks. When there is no
bed of solid rock it is necessary to
construct some artificial foundation
for the lock bottom. This was usually
done by simply driving a lot of piles.
Along the bottom and sides of Lock
35 there are series of openings. These
openings are square, though in some
locks thev are round, but round or
square they serve the same purpose
and have, as a rule, the same mouth
area, namely a little over 7 sq. ft. It
is through these openings that the
water flows when the lock is being
filled or emptied. The openings are
all connected by smaller transverse
culverts to one of the two main cul-
verts. These main culverts run through
the sidewalls of the lock and measure
7 ft. by 9 ft. This size main culvert
does not apply to locks with a smaller
lift than that of No. 35, but it does
include all lifts greater than 23 ft. If
the lock has a lift of less than 23 ft.
but greater than 12 ft. then the cul-


vert size is 6 ft. by 8 ft. For all lifts
of less than 12 ft. five-by-seven cul-
verts are used. The reason for this
is simply the fact that the greater the
lift the greater the volume of water
which has to be handled. In order to
do this in the least possible time not
only is the size of the culverts in-
creased, but also more culvert open-
ings are placed in the walls and floor
of the lock. By these means it is pos-
sible to fill or empty any of the locks
in about five minutes.
All the lock gates of the Barge Ca-
nal are built entirely of steel except
locks may be properly appreciated we
will now make a few comparisons. In
the first place, the locks are capable
of accommodating a 3,000 ton barge
300 ft. in length. Now, if we look at
Fig. 3 very closely we will notice a
man standing on top of the left gate
near the side wall. The locks at the
extreme left of the picture are one set
of the old Frie Canal locks. These
'little' locks are each 100 ft. long and
about as wide as an ordinary side
street. And then, those big lock gates
only weigh about fifty tons apiece.
Figs 5, 6, 7 and 8 are all views of
Fig. 3. Lower End
for a heavy post of white oak which
is fastened to the inner edge of each
gate. The gate swings on this post
which revolves on a cast steel pivot at
the lower end, and in an adjustable
bearing at the top. The gates are of
the miter-girder type; and their con-
struction, both partial and complete,
can be clearly seen by referring to
Figs. 2, 5 and 6 especially. On the up-
stream side, the gates are faced with
steel plates which were riveted in
place. This too can be readilv seen
in many of the illustrations. Fig. 3
shows the upstream side of the lower
gate of No. 34, while Fig. 4 shows the
downstream side of the same gate.
In order that the magnitude of these

tion work on the lock—looking west,

the same lock completed. Fig. 6 is the
same as Fig. 5 only it is looking in
the opposite direction, while Fig. 7
shows the same view of the lock in
its finished state.
There is one very interesting lock
in the Barge Canal System which de-
serves mention. This is the siphon
lock located on the Oswego branch. It
is, as we have already noted, the only
siphon lock in America, and further-
more, the largest in the world. The
lock is quite efficient as is shown by
the fact that it, too, can be emptied or
filled in about five minutes, though in


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
this case it takes a trifle longer to
empty than to fill.
Briefly, the operating of the lock is
somewhat as follows: The siphons
are large culverts arranged just like
any ordinary siphon. All air is ex-
cluded from these culverts except that
which enters through pipes guarded
ij ^.a
i /. m-i* • HI

Looking Upstrkam
by 4-in. air valves. The amount of air
thus turned into the siphons controls
the speed of the flow of the water.
The water is started flowing through
the siphons by 'priming' them, that is,
water is rushed through them from

While in the case of emergency the
locks could be operated and controlled
by hand, all the operations of locking
are regularly carried on entirely by
electrical machinery. The mammoth
gates, which vary in weight according
to size, weigh, on an average, 50 tons
apiece. Seven and one-half h.p., d.c.
motors furnish the power to mechan-
isms of the rack and pinion type which
move these gates. Strong steel arms
carrying the racks run from the lock
gates to the machinery. With these
arrangements it is possible to open or
close the gates in considerably less
than one minute.
The gates and lock valves are all
operated from controllers which are
located in duplicate on either side of
the lock, close to the gates which they
regulate. In this way it is possible to
operate all the machinery about the
luck from either side at will. The
need for this double control can be
seen at a glance if we consider, for an
instant, the position of a lock tender
who is on the opposite side of the lock
from the control, with the gates open.
Each controller is equipped with
switches so that each of the two gate
motors can be brought under separate
control, or both controlled simulta-
neously; or, so that single valves can
be opened, or all the valves at once.
Also, if the control happens to be at
the lower end of the lock where there
is a buffer beam, this beam can be
raised or lowered into position from
the controller. These buffer beams
are merely strong steel beams which
are let down into the path of the
barge in front of a lock gate. Thus,
if the barge becomes unmanageable,
it crashes into this beam instead of in-
to the lock gate itself. The beams are
usually fitted with a hand rail and can
be used as a footbridge across the lock
unless the lock happens to be full, in
which case the entire buffer beam, ex-
cept for the hand rail, is usually sub-


11
merged. A buffer beam can be seen
in the foreground of Fig. 5.
The arrangement of the various
parts of the lock mechanism mention-
ed just previously is shown in Fig. 9.
In this illustration all covers and doors
have been opened or removed in order
to show as much as possible. The man
seen in the picture is standing at the
controller. The steel rack arm which
transmits the power to the gate is
shown about half way between the top
and bottom of the picture to the ex-
treme right.
One of the electric capstans also ap-
pears in this photograph. The purpose
of these capstans is to move and to
control the movement of barges while
in the lock, especially if they have no
power of their own, as is generally the
case. The capstans are capable of
moving a boat with an 8,000 lb. resist-
ance at the rate of fio ft. per minute.
They are driven by 20 h.p., d.c. motors
controlled by foot switches placed
flush at the top of the lock wall. The
motors of the capstans and all other
motors connected with the lock are of
an especially rugged design and are,
of course, waterproof.
The lock valves, which weigh about
7V2 tons apiece, are also actuated by
electric motors, and, as we have stated,
are regulated from the same control
as the gates. These valves are merely
immense slides which can be passed
over the mouths of the culverts, and
which are hung on heavy chains fitted
with suitable counterweights.
The electric power necessary to op-
erate the locks is generated, for the
most part, by the waste water of the
canal. A power house is located at
each lock, except in a few cases where
locks are located nearby each other in
which event a single power house is
sufficient. The power stations are
heated and lighted by electricity, and
the locks are illuminated at night by
numerous arc lights. The current from
the power station is supplied to the
machinery at a pressure of 250 volts,
direct current. The power house for
Locks 34 and 35 is clearly shown in
Fig. 3. These power houses are con-

structed entirely of concrete and have
green tiled roofs. They present a
very pleasing appearance.
Movable Dams and Guard Gates
It is sometimes necessary to main-
tain minor water levels in the Barge
Canal System by means of dams. Es-
pecially when these dams are located
along the courses of natural streams
which form a part of the canal system,
they must be of such a nature that


THE MICHIGAN TECH NIC
they can be removed entirely from the
path of the stream during floods. In
order to accomplish this end, movable
dams have been constructed at such
points. These dams generally appear
exactly like an ordinary bridge in ev-
ery way except one. This exception is
that from the downstream side of the
bridge-like superstructure hang steel
frames in which there are two tiers of
gates. The gates can be set at any
desired height by means of an electric
winch which runs along the super-
structure above. At the bottom, the
steel frames are held in place by the
at flood position. The water is again
let back into the canal in the spring.
There is one movable dam in the
system that deserves a brief mention.
That is the Pioree type (hook-needle)
dam located at Herkimer on the Mo-
hawk River. This dam enjoys the dis-
tinction of being the first of its type
to be erected in America.
Guard gates, as they are called, are
of extreme importance in a canal like
the Barge Canal where the water lev-
el has so many great changes. These
guard gates are sometimes built like
lock gates, in which case they swing
Fig. 7. Downstream—Lock 35—Upstream. Fig. 8.
force of the water which pushes them
against shoes set in concrete. These
shoes run clear across the stream be-
tween the piers of the structure. At
the top, the frames are fastened to the
bridge structure so that an immense
hinge is formed. In case of a flood,
first, the gates are raised clear of the
stream, and then the entire frame-
work is swung up under the bridge.
This gives the stream an unobstrusted
path. The water is let out of the canai
when the season of navigation closes
late in November thus getting rid of
the nuisance of the breaking up of ice
in the spring, and when the water is
thus let out the dam gates are all set
aside to allow the boats to pass; and
they are sometimes simply massive
steel barriers which are suspended
from huge bridge-structures in such a
manner that they can be raised verti-
cally to allow boats to pass under
them. The first pair of gates shown
in Fig. 7 is an excellent example of the
lock-gate type of guard gate. Guard
gates are located strategically along
the canal at rather frequent intervals.
The idea of these guard gates is to
form protective barriers so that if
there is a break anywhere, only the
water which is above the level of the
break and within the limits of the two
guard gates between which the break


13
is located, will be capable, for exam-
ple, of flooding surrounding fields, or
of doing other damage.
Let us take another example with
Fig. 7 as the scene of action. Let us
suppose that a boat is coming up-
stream (toward the observer), having
been successfully locked through the
lower lock into the upper one. The
upper lock is now being filled with
water and the picture presented to us
there would be very little question but
that the entire system of gates would
be torn away by the rremendous flood
of water. But the destruction of these
lock gates would be but a mere trifle
compared with the damage the water
would do when it got down into the
lower levels. It is quite interesting to
imagine what would happen if this
flow went on, as it would if unhin-
dered by guard gates or hastily con-
Fic. 9. Mechanism of Lock

is exactly like the illustration except
that there is now a barge in the upper
lock, and the lock is only partly filled
with water. Now as the barge rises
on the incoming water the ropes at-
tached to her slacken. The boat be-
comes unmanageable and, before the
electric capstans can gain control, she
crashes into the upper lock gate jam-
ming it part way open. The water
from the upper level immediately
rushes through, but it is only that
small portion which lies between the
lock gate and the guard gate.
'If the guard gate had not been there,
structed obstructions, until Lake Erie
had adjusted a water level through the
canal system with Lake Ontario. Lake
Ontario is about 250 ft. lower than
Lake Erie, as is shown in the 'Profile
Map.' The necessity for guard gates
seems quite obvious.
Terminal Harbors
Provisions have been made for the
accommodation of fifty terminal har-
bors along the canal. These harbors
are located at important cities and
towns, and will be equipped with ma-
chinery for loading and unloading


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
barges, and also with suitable ware-
houses and docking facilities. Practi-
cally all the excavating has been done
and it merely remains to equip them.
Every terminal will be owned and op-
erated by the State and under no con-
sideration will a private company be
allowed to construct or maintain such
a harbor. At the present time a sys-
tem of rates is being worked out,
which will be in effect at these har-
bors. By this means it is intended to
give the small boat owner a more equal
footing with the large companies, if
possible.
Importance of the Canal
Perhaps no better idea of the part
which the Barge Canal is due to play,
economically, in the near future can
be gained, than is expressed in the fol-
lowing paragraph from the "Literary
Digest":
''Not only will our Northeastern
states be affected commercially by the
completion of New York's Barge Ca-
nal, but a large part of the West, far
West, and Northwest, since through
this waterway must come in the fu-
ture a considerable part of the freight
business now taken care of by the rail-
roads."
The importance of the new system
to boat operators is readily seen when
we consider that in one section of the
completed canal alone the time of pass-
age has been reduced from three days
to 30 hours, and that more freight is
being offered than can be handled with
the present number of boats. The
time of passage over the entire sys-
tem is authoritatively estimated at
four days, exactly one half the time
required in covering the same distance
on the old Erie system.
Major General Wootherspoon, who
has charge of the operation of the en-
tire canal system, states that the time
of passage between Buffalo and New
York "will compare favorably with or
even be less than the period required
for shipment by railroad freight."


DON A.SMITH, M7E
WE need an ''Efficiency Commit-
tee" in the Engineering College.
So-called "efficiency experts" are re-
cruited from the ranks of university
men and particularly from engineers.
The most valuable asset we are sup-
posed to acquire here at school is an
increase in our efficiency, yet as Fresh-
men we are impressed with the lack
of efficiency around us and this lack
becomes more evident as we progress.
Let me mention some things which an
"efficiency committee" could consider,
not endeavoring to give arguments for
or against changes but maintaining
that the need for scientific investiga-
tion exists.
Examinations come first in my list
of "horrible examples." We spend
one month out of each nine trying to
show the faculty that they have taught
us something in the other eight. They
ought to have a fair idea of that them-
selves. In those four weeks we do
nothing constructive or permanent.
Yet consider what exams cost us in
money alone. Board costs on the av-
erage, $4.50 a week and rooms $2.00.
Then because of the waste time—at
least one week end and often a whole
week—everybody spends more. Two
dollars seems a fair estimate and most
of us spend a lot more,—at the Hop,
in Detroit, playing pool, visiting, and
the like, just $8.50 a week for fifteen
hundred men and four weeks means
$51,000.00. One month at an average
of $50 per man is $75,000.00. I have-
n't the figures on the cost of running
the college per week or on faculty sal-
aries but it looks as if examinations in
the engineering college cost at least
$100,000.00 a year.
Is that expenditure justified? Are
exams, really necessary or are they a
habit? Certainly they can be abol-
ished in over half the prescribed
courses with no harmful effects. Lan-
guage exams. appear as absurdities to
most students. That is why an"hon-
or system" receives its hardest trial in
language exams. When an instructor
can say, "I know who is going to pass
this course and who isn't" before an
exam, isn't it absurd to hold one at all?
Yet habit rules. A lot better work
might be done during the course if
there were no exams to look forward
to,—with which to pull one's self
through.
Lecture courses, and only lecture
courses, require an examination—and
then in many cases, written quizzes
would be sufficient. At least a week
each semester might be saved and util-
ized for reviewing, for research, for
special lectures, for co-ordination, or
for other important work. Because it
isn't done now is no sign it can't be
done. Let Michigan lead the way.
Why not a committee to investigate
the possibilities.
Now another thing; different, but
all in the line of increased efficiency.
There is no apparent reason why all
notes and required work cannot be
written on 8*&lt; x 11" paper. It is not
even essential that written tests, "blue
books," be written in the familiar 6 x
9 pests. It occurs more strongly to
seniors now, when we are trying to
file the written evidence of our col-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
lege work so that it will be available
for reference later, that it is more or
less nonsense that we should have all
sorts and sizes of paper to put away.
It is understood that 8yi x 11 is the
standard size for paper in the engi-
neering college. Practically every man
in college carries an %]/z x n three-
ring note book. Freshmen should be
told when they first get here that it is
economy to invest in one immediately.
We stick to it religiously for three or
four years and most of our stuff files
beautifully in the familiar manila cov-
ers. So isn't it aggravating to have
an odd course here and there required
on some other size?
Is it necessary that English themes
be written on special "rhetoric" paper?
Sometimes a man may want to keep
one or two that he has written, either
for its subject matter or for correc-
tions appended. The size doesn't fit
in our standard note book or in our
files. All our math, profs, required
work handed in to be on odd sized
paper, one in blue-books, another in
hard covered note books, another in
soft covered note books. Hence we
wouldn't give two cents for our other-
wise first class set of math, notes.
Physics paper is unusual; an M.E. 3
instructor requires all problems in
bluebooks; the M.E. laboratory has a
notebook all its own; C.E. 10 data
sheets can apparently as well be 8lA x
11; our economic friends have a fav-
orite size. And so it goes. An odd
sized paper does not make a course
"distinctly individual." There is much
needed co-ordinating work for a sym-
pathetic central committee.
There are other matters worthy of
consideration. Students sometimes sit
for an hour in the ante-room of the
Assistant Dean's office, awaiting their
turn to be excused for maybe one ab-
sence. Some of our instructors report
every bolt and some never report any.
It wouldn't be an impossible task to
extend our honor system to bolts. A
bolt becomes necessary to everyone
once in a while and the average stu-
dent doesn't like being summoned to
explain.
The Law School system of auto-
matic reduction of credit and the Lit-
erary College system of allowing ten
bolts before summoning are not what
we want. Just as a suggestion, could-
n't all engineering students be on their
honor not to bolt unless necessary and
a check kept by having instructors re-
port continuous or excessive bolting?
Let students explain odd bolts to in-
structors themselves, if they want to
and let the primary basis of reports to
the Assistant Dean be poor work rath-
er than absences. An absence more or
less doesn't matter if a student is get-
ting the stuff. We would be saved lots
of trouble and the standard of schol-
arship might be raised.
Continuous efforts have been made
by the faculty to co-ordinate depart-
ments, to have the knowledge absorb-
ed and thinking habits encouraged in
one place fit in other parts of the cur-
riculum. Yet the math, and physics
and the mechanics and the so-called
practical divisions still seem too far
apart. Maybe the viewpoint of stu-
dents who had just run the gauntlet
of all of them would be worth some-
thing. The problem could be consid-
ered by an efficiency committee of fac-
ulty and students.
A minor task of such a committee
might be an attempt to standardize
marking systems. Is it good, bad, or
indifferent, that written work and blue
books come back to us marked on the
scale of 100, as is most usual and


17
seemingly most sensible, or on a scale
of ten, or on that "distinctively indi-
vidual" scale of the M.E. 3 instruc-
tors, or on a different scale each time
in the same class, or as A. B. C. D. E.
Maybe it is all right but it is worthy
of thought.
These suggestions can be greatly in-
creased and they are no more than
suggestions. What I want to point
out is that we students are being told
continuously by faculty, high and low,
that we must be efficient, that we must
plan and co-ordinate our work, and
so on, yet the Engineering College it-
self does not furnish any inspiration.
We have efficiency experts on the fac-
ulty and there are students who can
see evidence of misplaced money, time
and energy.
A committee, small, practical, effi-
cient, not pedagogic, appointed by
Dean Cooley, with power to hear com-
plaints, gather evidence, investigate
and recommend to both individual in-
structors and to the faculty, as a
whole would be sure to increase the
already high standing of the College.
BOOK REVIEWS
HELDT'S GASOLINE AUTOMOBILE
Always an excellent treatment of
its particular subject, the 1916 edition
of Heldt's Gasoline Automobile, Vol-
ume One, which is just off the press
and which has been much elaborated
over the three preceding editions, is
a welcomed addition to automobile
engineering literature.
Volume One, which is a develop-
ment of the basic principles of engine
design, is also a resume of the most
up-to-date practice in this field, and is
written in a most understandable way.
The book is being used exclusively in
the automobile design courses at the
University of Michigan. Development
of the basic principles proceeds in
each case from the fundamentals in
mechanics and thermodynamics, while
rules and constants of design are
given, which the author has estab-
lished after an extensive study of cur-
rent practice and the investigations of
various engineering bodies.
The various elements of the subject
are taken up in the following order:
the working media—gasoline and air;
the laws of gases—thermodynamics;
the Otto cycle; conversion of recipro-
cating into rotary motion; balancing
of engines; the cylinder; piston,
rings, pin; offset cylinders; the crank-
shaft ; connecting rod; valve and valve
gears; camshaft and accessory drives;
crank case and oiling system; starting
crank, manifolds and mufflers; fly-
wheel; governors; power output and
other characteristics; sleeve, piston
and rotary valve motors; two-stroke
cycle motor; water cooling; air cool-
ing; motor tests.
Those familiar with preceding edi-
tions will find a new chapter on water
cooling systems while chapters on en-
gine balancing and crankshaft design
have been entirely rewritten to accord
with current practice. Aluminum pis-
tons and forked and tubular connect-
ing rods receive consideration, while
most important new matter relating to
the design of cams will be found.
Owing to the addition of a new
chapter and the extension of other
chapters, the new edition is larger
than its predecessors.


THOMAS J. MACKAVANAGH, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR, ELECTRICAL
ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
'VTOT many months ago I stood in
.*.' the doorway of the 'smoker"
of a parlor car enjoying the "that re-
minds me's" of the drummers and
drum majors. I was all attention
when an old gentleman said that the
story just told—on the high cost of
living, by the way—reminded him of
his visit to a cableship.
He was interrupted frequently and
the questions asked him had a familiar
ring: "Does the cable lie on the bot-
tom of the Atlantic Ocean?"—"How
do they find the break in a cable? Pick
up the cable near shore and keep on
pulling it up until they find the break,
eh?" The last question nonplussed
our informant. However, he offered
a statement that he had been ushered
into a testing-room, where there was
quite an array of expensive instru-
ments and he was told that when a
small mirror in the galvanometer wog-
gled,—"galvanometer? Yes, that's the
word,"—the electrical engineer knew
right where the break was in the ca-
ble.
As I stood there listening I could
not help but wonder how many men
of the present day have any idea of the
immense outlay of money necessary
to finance and maintain a cable sys-
tem; and of the countless risks and
dangers that the men on board a ca-
ble repair ship have to endure and sur-
mount in repairing even a small break
in a cable which may be miles under
the water.
Tn the Seventies "the man in the
street" was better informed on cable
matters than he is today. The United
States naval frigate "'Niagara" was
fitted out to assist the British War-
ship "Agamemnon'' in the laying of
the first Atlantic cable; and the story
of heroic effort fired the imagination
then as now. Millions were invested
in the pioneer cable enterprises and
millions lost: but communication be-
tween the Old World and the New
was a necessity so great, and belief in
the integrity and ability of the engi-
neers so firm that fear of failure
tightened the lips somewhat, but did
not overwhelm the supporters.
It has been said that the electrical
engineer is a cross between the phys-
icist and the mechanical engineer and
that he has no small opinion of him-
self. Accept the statement as being
true, the cap surely fitted the early
cable engineers and they established
a record to be proud of.
The Institute of Electrical Engi-
neers began as the Society of Tele-
graph Engineers—founded in 1871,
and presided over by telegraph engi-
neers until 1897.
Today, 330,000 miles of submarine
cable are in operation and a fleet of
over fifty cableships is required to
maintain them. Of the early Atlantic
cables, that laid in '73 is the only one
being operated; the others having been
abandoned but not until practically ten
millions had been absorbed in repairs.
One of the most successful of the
modern cables, that laid in '94 between
Newfoundland and Ireland, cost about
two million dollars, and is 1,845 miles


19
long. The conductor of this cable con-
sists of a central copper wire 0.122
inch in diameter surrounded by twelve
copper wires, each 0.041 in. in diame-
ter, and the completed conductor
weighs 650 lbs. per nautical mile. The
resistance per nautical mile of the con-
ductor is 1.9 ohms at a temperature of
75°. With an impressed voltage of 40
at the Irish end of the '94 cable the
current at the Newfoundland end is
only 0.000140 ampere. The capaci-
tance of the cable is 0.420 microfarads
per nautical mile; and were the cable
without capacitance the current at the
receiving (Newfoundland) station
would have a value eighty times that
given above.
Immersion in the deep waters of
the Atlantic improves the conducting
and insulating qualities of the cable;
but this seems to be contrary to what
were the expectations of some people
in the early Sixties: for we read that
they were pleased upon finding that
"the current flowed without hindrance
even when the cable was laid in great
depths." In the North Atlantic the
temperature at the depth of 3,000
fathoms is 32° Fahr. and the pressure
three tons per square inch; and this
combination of low temperature and
high pressure is ideal from the view-
point of the cable engineer.
The original contract for the '94
cable called for 4 miles of type "A"
cable, 17 miles of type "E," 347 miles
of type "B," and 1,587 miles of type
""D." The total length required was
1,955 miles. Type "D" cable is laid
in depths of from 500 fathoms to
3,000 fathoms, and the foregoing fig-
ures show that about 75% of the At-
lantic cable is in deep water.
The type "D" or deep sea section of
the cable has an overall diameter of
0.9 inch, weighs 40.2 cwts. in air, 22.75
cwts. in water, and has a specific grav-
ity of 2.30. The breaking strain is
8.2 tons with an elongation of 4%.
The armor of the deep sea type con-
sists of t8 galvanized homogeneous
iron wires, each wire covered with a
preservative compound and taped.
The wires are of No. 14 B.W.G., and
are required to bear a breaking strain
of not less than 85 tons per square
inch with an elongation of not more
than 4%. Type "B," known technic-
ally as "intermediate,'' is laid in depths

of from 30 to 500 fathoms. Type "E"
is a light shore-end cable for depths
under 60 fathoms, and where owing
to bad bottom the service conditions
are too severe for the type "B" cable.
Type ''A" is shore-end cable weighing
from 12 to 30 tons per nautical mile,
and is laid only where the cable is
liable to be damaged by being dragged
by ships' anchors, or subject to much
wear by ice or tides.
The "core" of the cable is similar
in all types, the protecting armor of
steel or iron wires alone varying, be-
ing least on the deep sea section and
greatest on the shoal water section.
In the Sixties and in the Seventies
the demand was for a cable that could
be easily laid with the imperfect cable-
laying machinery of that time; but in
modern practice telegraph engineers
have insisted upon the necessity of a
type which, though less easy to lay, is
likely to possess greater durability and


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
be more easily raised for repairs after
many years submersion.
The condition on which the possi-
bility of the recovery of a cable from
great depths really depends, is the
margin of strength between the actual
breaking strain and the weight of the
suspended portion of the cable. The
dead weight itself is only one of the
factors of the picking-up strain; an-
other factor is the friction between
the cable and the water, which de-
pends on the rate of picking up, and
on the nature and area of the sus-
pended part, but is quite independent
of the specific gravity of the cable. In
some of the light cables laid before
'74 the strain due to friction was
greater than that due to the dead
weight of the cable.
The frictional resistance between
the water and the cable is turned to
good account during cable laying. The
cable paid out from a ship going at
uniform speed does not hang as a
catenary, but takes the form, as it
sinks, of a straight line stretching at
a uniform slope from the ship's wake
to the point far astern where it
touches bottom. This is because each
part of the cable in sinking through
the water attains almost immediately
a constant velocity of descent against
the resistance which the water op-
poses to its motion. The cable tends
not only to sink, but to glide along
along the direction of its own length,
just as a rope resting on an in-
clined plane tends to glide down
it. A certain amount of such gliding
is desirable for it secures the cable
being laid with a sufficient percentage
of slack to accommodate itself to any
inequalities on the bottom and to pro-
vide for the possibilities of its being
raised, should that be required. As
cables are actually laid, there may be
ten to twelve per cent of slack, and
this means a considerable velocity of
gliding motion. With a depth of 3,-
000 fathoms and the ship steaming at
eight knots, no less than 25 miles of
cable are in suspension. It is the
function of the brake on the paying-
out drum to apply just as much re-
tarding force as will allow the right
amount of gliding to take place. If
it were simply a question of holding
the cable from gliding down the slope,
the retarding force applied would be
equal to the weight, in water, of a
length of cable equal to the depth: but
as a matter of fact, it is about half
that, the other half being accounted
for by the frictional resistance the
cable experiences in gliding down the
slope.
The '94 cable was laid in three
weeks, while a deep-sea cable repair
may extend over three months, and
even then the cable replaced may not
exceed one hundred miles. The first
cable repairing ship on the North At-
lantic was the "Minia"; and early in
the '70's was conspicuous because of
the daring and resourcefulness of her
engineers. In the early days of the
cable industry the "Minia" anchored
in the "stream" in October, and did
not weigh anchor until April or May.
Then, a deep-sea repair was an affair
of the first magnitude, but now it is
almost a commonplace in cable cir-
cles. Repairs are made in every month
of the year and deep-sea repairs have
been undertaken and successfully
completed in December. Gales are
no less frequent, icebergs perhaps
more menacing and the risk of being
run down in a fog is increased many
times.
Quoting from a recent paper on
this, "The operation of repairing deep-
cables is no child's play. It is work


21
requiring sturdy, fearless manhood
and skillful seamanship. Most of the
breaks occur during the time of the
year when the weather conditions, at
sea, are most severe. It is not uncom-
mon for a cable ship to spend a month
at sea waiting for suitable weather
conditions to carry on operations; and
during severe weather, cable ships
have been blown hundreds of miles
away from their ground of opera-
tions."
The volume of business transmitted
over the ocean cables has increased
enormously in the last decade. Na-
turally, anything that decreases the
earning power of a cable is of great
importance, and faults in the insula-
tion of the cables which were toler-
ated a decade ago, must now be re-
moved without delay. What is true
of small faults must, of necessity, be
true of faults or breaks which inter-
rupt the traffic over the cables. How-
ever small and insignificant a fault is
when first detected, it will gradually
open out under the action of the sig-
nalling currents, even should the orig-
inal cause have ceased, and on this
account alone, it is a source of worry.
P'aults arising from carelessness or
accident during the manufacture of
the cable are of very rare occurrence:
the writer detected such a fault only
once in twelve years, and during which
period he tested several thousand
miles of new cable. In the shoal wa-
ters of the Atlantic, the teredo, an
aqueous worm, is, or rather was a
prolific source of faults, as it bores
holes in the gutta percha unless pre-
vented by the layer of brass tape
which covers the core of all modern
cables. The writer tested and later
inspected, after it had been picked up,
a ten-mile length of cable that had
been submerged for seven years in
the shoal water off the Nova Scotia
coast and there was scarcely one foot
of sound cable in the whole length.
The fisherman riding out a gale with
his anchor dragging over or hooked
on the cable on the fishing banks, is
a not infrequent cause of a fault or
break in the cable. Corrosion of the
armor wires, and chafing on rocks
are responsible for a large percentage
of the faults and breaks.

Faults may be detected by their in-
fluence on the transmission of signals
in the carrying out of the routine tests
made every Sunday at all important
cable stations. As soon as possible
after a break is detected, careful tests
are made to determine the position of
the fault in the cable. This is deter-
mined as closely as possible and the
ship, arriving at the estimated posi-
tion, cuts and raises the cable to the
surface. Tests are then made from
the ship to obtain better working re-
sults. It will be evident that these


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
tests are of great importance, as when
carried out skillfully, the repair is
executed with a minimum of delay and
with a minimum waste of cable.
In a submarine cable there are vari-
ous currents prevalent, arising from
different causes, which interfere gen-
erally with the testing. It is a first
essential to have the various currents
clearly defined in mind and have form-
ed a clear conception of each, although
they chiefly act together.
Earth currents arise chiefly from
climatic conditions and magnetic dis-
turbances. In two distant localities
the earth may be at different poten-
tials and then a current flows between
them. The direction of such currents
may follow or cross the line of cable,
but the direct flow of earth currents in
the cable is prevented, in so far as sig-
nalling is concerned, by condensers
placed between the instruments and
the line. In making the tests to de-
termine the resistance of the cable up
to and including the fault, or to de-
termine the resistance between the
ship and the shore, the cable is earthed
at both ends. It not infrequently hap-
pens that the so-called earth-currents
vary so in direction and intensity that
tests cannot be made. Should the cur-
rent be fairly steady in direction and
in intensity, its effect can be elimin-
ated by the method known technically
as balancing to false zero. "False
Zero" is the position of the mirror of
a galvanometer when the testing bat-
tery is disconnected from the testing
set. The deflection is due to any cur-
rent or combined currents that may be
passing through the cable. By bal-
ancing the Wheatstone bridge to this
deflection as zero during the test, the
effect of the currents is eliminated.
Where a fault exists there is gener-
ally a current in the cable due to the
difference of potential set up by the
exposed copper at the fault; forming,
with the iron sheath and sea water, a
voltaic cell or couple. This current is
called the natural current from the
fault and may be distinguished from
what is known as the current due to
polarization. Under the action of the
current from the testing battery, the
fault—or rather the elements of the
voltaic cell we have at the fault—be-
comes charged like a storage battery,
and an opposing e.m.f. is set up. This
is equivalent to a resistance added to
the fault or break.
The capacitance of submarine tele-
graph cables is about 0.4 microfarads
per nautical mile and when the testing
battery is applied to or disconnected
from a long cable, momentary and vio-
lent rushes of current take place.
Every change in the value of the cur-
rent during the testing is accompanied
by an exaggerated swinging of the
galvanometer mirror and this causes
delays that are vexatious when every
second counts.
When a cable is fractured there is
generally a large area of copper ex-
posed where the copper has parted,
and if this is clean and not buried in
the sand, the resistance of the "end"—
the exposed copper—will vary in ac-
cordance with laws established with-
in well defined limits of current.
Dr. A. E. Kennedy established a
law which bears his name, when, after
a long series of experiments with dif-
ferent values of current, and different
areas of exposed copper, he stated:
"The resistance of an exposed con-
ductor varies inversely as the square
root of the current sent through it."
The law is based on gas development
at the break and its rate of discharge
from a clean exposure. It does not
take into account the resistance effect


23
of the polarization potential. In 1897,
Mr. C. W. Schafer established the law
of variation in the total resistance of
the break, namely, the resistance of
the exposed conductor and the resist-
ance due to the testing current acting
against the polarization potential, con-
sidered together as one quantity, which
he found varied inversely as the 1.3th
root of the testing current for con-
stant areas of exposure.
Today there is no scarcity in laws
and test methods, but faults and
breaks will apparently contravene
the copper; are the earth currents
weak or strong, steady or varying?
These are some of the questions he
must answer in the preliminary test.
A generous exposure of copper will
admit of a heavy current being sent
through it so that the copper salts may
be removed electrolytically, and the
dirt pried off by the gas generated. A
small exposure must be nursed very
carefully indeed, and a false move in
the preliminary test may cause an an-
noying delay. The sending of current
in one direction through the fault may
Contour of Ockan Bottom
even- rule on occasions. This will be
understood when it is considered that
exposed ends may be partly or wholly
buried in mud, and occasionally
stretched or shifted under the influ-
ence of the bottom currents.
In certain seasons of the years one
storm follows the other so closely that
the cable ship commences grappling
for the cable while the storm is yet
raging and the sea still rough, in the
hope that the cable may be raised to
the surface during a lull. A delay of
an hour may then have serious conse-
quences; and very frequently the elec-
trical engineer has the use of the cable
for testing purposes for not more than
five minutes. Tn a case of this kind
a rough test, taking only the smallest
amount of time, is made as a "feeler".
Is the exposed area large or small; is
the end clean or dirty; heavily or
lightly coated with copper salts; is the
conductor touching the armor wires,
or are the wires some distance from
cause an excessive generation of gas,
and should this gas become occluded
the resistance of the fault becomes
very high. Occasionally the resistance
of the end is so high the cable is prac-
tically a condenser with a leak across
its terminals. After the preliminary
test the engineer applies the test meth-
od in which he has the most confidence
and when time permits he tries one
method after another. When the end
of the cable is recovered and he knows
the exact resistance of the good cable,
the engineer derives pleasure in com-
paring the results of the methods tried
and the true values he has later found.
The localization of the break or fault
is affected not so much by the results
of equations as by weighing the re-
sults of the tests, each one in the light
of the others. The personal equation
enters very considerably into the re-
liability of the results and an experi-
enced man knows intuitively what his
readings are worth.

THE nitrate of soda industry which
is one of the principal sources
of production of the nitrogenous sub-
stance commonly called "saltpeter", is
one of wide interest. At present it is
very important because one of the es-
sential elements of most of the pow-
der used in the European war is Ni-
trate of Soda, but the technical organ-
ization and the many important pro-
mittee appointed by the Chilean Gov-
ernment stated in the Chamber of
Deputies in Santiago the 5th of July,
1913, that there is 5,408,204,000 met-
rical quintals of 100 kilgs. of export-
able nitrate which will last for a period
of at least 150 years at the present rate
of production and after thorough in-
vestigations and explorations, it has
been mathematically computed that

ducts and uses make it important in
times of peace also.
The principal deposits of Salitre as
it is called in Chile, are found in the
Regions of Tarapaca, Tocopilla, and
Antofagasta which are located from
I9°3°" S.L. to 26 S.I/. forming a nar-
row strip of land running about 65
kilometers from the Pacific coast and
at an average altitude of 900 meters.
This is the zone called the "desert"
and very often "La Pampa" and as its
name suggests, no vegetation can be
found for miles and miles. These de-
posits are enormous and a special corn-
there is still an extention of nitrate to
be examined 34 times larger than that
already stated. Considering the very
primitive methods of extraction, the
future of this industry against its com-
petitors is very clear, great improve-
ments being capable of being made.
The following sketch shows in a com-
parative scale the consumption from
the year 1830 to 1914.
As the nitrate industry is situated
in this desert, it has been necessary to
bring from the southern part of the
country all the things necessary for
the life of the inhabitants of this re-


25
gion. Food and fuel are brought to
the different harbors created for that
purpose, from where they are carried
to the oficians by the railroads which

on their way back bring the refined
nitrate to be shipped to all parts of the
world. There is a population of about
came from the United States and 155,-
852 tons from Feru. During the same
year the U. S. imported about 535,700
tons of nitrate.
The nitrate of soda is found under
a crust of earth forming there saline
deposits in layers of varying thick-
ness; generally mixed with other salts
as nitro sulphites, chlorides, and some
calcium salts, as well as other insolu-
ble substances. The raw nitrate ore
is called "caliche" and its presence can
be detected by the burning of small
particles if approached to a match.

During the year of 1914, 42,979 la-
borers were employed by the 137
oficians which were at work out of
the 140 existing ones in the Pampas.
Of these 32,987 were Chilians; 4,984
Peruvians; 4,730 Bolivians and 1,291
from other different countries of the
world. The production for the year
was 2,483,356 metric tons and the
efficiency per laborer was 56.01% per
ton. 268,313 tons of coal and 388,802
tons of petroleum were used during
the year and of the latter 374,008 tons
The origin of this product has been
very much discussed but it is not the
aim of this article to advance any
theory. Its origin from sea weeds
was advanced by Drawin and on the
other side Williams, Sundt and Pissis
believed that it was of atmospheric
origin. The caliche is extracted by
means of explosives which break the
so-called earth crust after which the
caliche being selected from the broken
mass is placed in special cars, pulled
by a team of mules and carried to a
gradient where it is discharged in the
cars of a small railway which bring it


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
to the refining plant where it is thrown
into great crushers and reduced to
small pieces. From there, by means
of different kinds of elevators, it is
conveyed to from 16 to 24 large rec-
tangular tanks called in the language
of the Pampa, "Cachuchos", where
it is treated by boiling water which is
kept at a high temperature by means
of serpentines rilled with superheated
steam. The water is pumped consec-
utively from one tank to the other
until the liquid produced, generally of
a reddish clay color, is saturated with
dissolved nitrate which has been found
to be the only salt in the caliche which
will dissolve at a temperature 115 to
120 degrees C. The liquor is fre-
quently tested by means of densi-
meters and at the moment it has
the maximum amount of nitrate
dissolved, it is run off to large tanks,
where it is cooled by exposure to
the air; and as it is cooled large
white crystals of nitrate are deposited
in the tank. A part of the water which
will be left is run off and this is call-
ed "mother liquor", which will be used
again in the first tanks.
When this "mother liquor" is highly
concentrated, as it contains large quan-
tities of iodine, this is then separated
by a special process and placed in
small wooden caskets for exportation.
During the year 1914, 486,952 kgs. of
iodine were exported as well as 55,430
kgs. of perclorate.
The nitrate after a few days is
scraped from the tanks and placed in
large drying floors. From there it is
placed in sacks which contain a quintal
or 101.4 lbs. which are sent by train
to the ports.
Besides the refining plants the ofici-
nas contain almost all the activities of
a town; dwelling houses of employees
and laborers, stores, shops, hospitals,
police barracks and very often a mov-
ing picture theatre. Football fields
and tennis courts are provided for the
use of the employees which serve to
bring some change in the monotonous
life of the Pampa. Alcohol is under
control of the companies and seldom
are there any cases of drunkenness.
The population of an oficina is
very variable but in normal times is
about 700.
Life in the oficinas is very quiet and
healthful; the highest temperature is
9T°F. during summer, but the aver-
age is about 60. Rains are very scarce
and sometimes fifteen or more years
pass without a drop of rain. Salaries
are very good and in the oficina there
is no way to spend it. Besides the
railways the means of communication
are the horse and mule and every ofii-
cina has a number of these animals
for the purpose of the work and local
needs. Nine hundred horses and 13,-
507 mules are thus used.
The work is carried on day and
night and it is very picturesque to
see in the beautiful moonlight in the
desert, all the lights of the oficinas,
some of them 50 to 60 miles away.


THEODORE A. LEISEN, GENERAL SUPERINTENDENT, DETROIT
WATER-WORKS
'T'HE growth of any public utility
-*. usually parallels the history of
the municipality which it serves. In
conformity with this exomatic fact
the development of the Detroit Water
Supply System has kept steady pace
with the varying stages of the growth
of the city, until at the present time the
effort to maintain this pace is evolving
a tendency to break all records and,
figuratively, to exceed all normally es-
tablished speed laws.
Historical.
The water-works of Detroit is of
comparatively recent origin, its his-
tory dating back only to the year 1825,
when by virtue of a grant of the Com-
mon Council, certain citizens were ac-
corded the sole and exclusive right
to supply water to any or all of the
fifteen hundred inhabitants which then
constituted the population of Detroit.
Two small pumps were placed at the
foot of Randolph street, from which
place wooden pump-logs, four and
one-half inches internal diameter, were
extended to Randolph and Jefferson
Avenue, (the site of the present Wa-
ter Office), where a wooden tank with
the capacity of 9,600 gallons, was
erected to serve the purpose of a stor-
age reservoir. In this primitive ex-
ample of a privately owned public
utility, the present water-works had
its birth.
The development of this embryo
plant for several years was not re-
markably rapid, although some evi-
dence of growth and expansion was
manifest. In 1831 the concessionaires
to whom had been granted previously
the exclusive privilege of supplying
water, were incorporated under the
title of the Detroit Hydraulic Com-
pany. This organization imparted an
impetus to the extension of the plant
as indicated by the construction of a
reservoir having the capacity of 120,-
000 gallons; the erection of a new
pumping station and installation of a
twenty horsepower pumping engine,
and a gradual but limited extension of
tamarac water mains.
The control of the water-works re-
mained in the hands of this company
for a period of five years, and during
this time the venture proved to be a
financial burden instead of a source of
profit. The management also was
subjected to continual public criticism,
both on account of the quality of the
water and the inadequacy of the sup-
ply. The culmination of this criticism
was the appointment, by the Common
Council in 1836, of a special commit-
tee of investigation, whose report de-
clared that the company had forfeited
all of the rights and privileges granted
it under its charter, and recommended
the purchase of the water-works by
the City. The recommendation was
formally confirmed, and on June 4.
1836, the City acquired the plant for
$20,500.
The management of the newly ac-
quired water-works was vested in a
committee of the Common Council,
but municipal ownership did not elim-
inate the adverse criticism. Intermit-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
tent agitation on the part of the citi-
zens resulted in the appointment, in
1852, of a Board of Trustees, follow-
ed in 1853 by an act of the State Leg-
islature creating the Board of Water
Commissioners. Since that time the
management of the water-works has
been under its complete charge.
Passing over the various periods of
development and changes, and the
abandonment through obsolescence of
manv of the earlier portions of the
works, the actual incipience of the
present plant may be said to date from
1873-74. At this time the property
now known as Water-Works Park,
was purchased, and construction com-
menced on several of the features de-
signed to constitute the basis of the
existing works ; including the sedimen-
tation basin, the original pumping sta-
tion, the first twenty-four million gal-
lon compound beam engine, and the
first forty-two inch cast-iron main.
Rapid increase in the equipment of
engines and boilers, of intake pipes
and tunnel and of the extentions of
the main arteries to the distribution
system, came, with each succeeding
year. This was a natural sequence to
the steady growth of the City until
today there exists a plant, which if
only the legitimate use of water were
strictly observed, would suffice for
over a million inhabitants.
Statistical.
The water-works as completed to
date, is equipped in all its ramifications
to furnish an average daily supply of
over one hundred and sixty million
gallons, and a maximum of over two
hundred million gallons, and distribute
it to and beyond the extreme bound-
aries of the city as constituted a year
ago.
The pifmping equipment consists of
three compound beam engines, and
seven vertical triple expansion en-
gines, of capacities from twenty-four
to thirty million gallons each, and a
combined pumpage capacity of two
hundred and sixty million gallons
daily. The boiler plant for furnishing
steam to operate the pumping engines,
consists of fifteen units of from two
hundred and twenty-five to four hun-
dred horsepower each, or a total of
forty-four hundred boiler horsepower,
—a capacity ample for the simulta-
neous operation of all the pumping en-
gines, and a safe marginal reserve.
The distribution system comprises
1,040 miles of mains of varying sizes.
from four to forty-eight inches in
diameter, of which about 100 miles
are from twelve to thirty-six inches,
and fifty miles from forty two to
forty-eight inches in diameter. The
service connections which extend from
the mains to the consumer's premises,
number 140,000 and represent a total
length of approximately 800 miles,
making the combined length of pipage
from the pumps to the consumer 1,840
miles.
Embraced within the distribution
system, exclusive of service connec-
tions, are 12,000 gate-valves for shut-
ting off sections of the mains, and 850
blow-off valves for flushing or drain-
ing the mains, and as an aid to fight
fires, there are 7,064 fire hydrants and
517 fire cisterns.
Operation.
In order to furnish a reasonably
even pressure to all sections, the city
has been divided into low and high
pressure districts. All of the lower
portion lying south of Mack, Canfield
and Warren Avenues are supplied
from the lower service, and all terri-
tory north of these limits by the high
service. The low pressure district em-


2Cj
braces all territory below a contour
line approximately forty feet above
the level of the Detroit River, and the
high pressure district everything be-
tween the forty and sixty feet con-
tours. The pressures maintained at
the pumping station average forty-
seven pounds for the low service and
sixty-five for the high service, result-
ing in an average pressure of about
thirty pounds to the ultimate points of
distribution at normal stages.
The water supply is taken at the in-
take crib in the Detroit River near the
upper end of Belle Isle, 3,300 feet
south-eastwardly from Water-Works
Park. It flows thence through a ten
foot diameter brick tunnel to the shore
shaft, whence it is distributed either
into the settling basin, or through the
by-pass conduits into the various con-
duits leading to the water galleries of
the pumping stations.
At the shore shaft the water is
treated with chlorine gas as a disin-
fectant, in proportion of from one and
one-half to two and one-half pounds
of liquid chlorine to a million gallons
of water, or in the ratio of from two-
tenths to three-tenths of a part of
chlorine to a million parts of water.
The result of the disinfecting treat-
ment has been the reduction of bac-
teria from an average of 187 per cubic
centimeter in the river water to 14
in the treated effluent, and a reduction
of eighty-six per cent bacillus coli.
After the chlorine treatment, the
water flows normally through the set-
tling basin (so called) to the several
conduits, and through four screen
houses, where wire screens—of one-
half inch mesh—intercept any floating
ice or debris, or other coarse foreign
matter held in suspension, and thence
to the water galleries and suction pipes
of the pumps. From here the water
is forced by the pumps through four
48 inch and five 42 inch diameter
mains, into all of the branches of the
distribution system.
The total quantity of water pumped
during the past year as indicated by
the Venturi Meters On the force mains,
was 46,689,000,000 gallons, equivalent
to an average of 127,565,000 gallons
per diem, with hour rates of pumpage
varying from a minimum equivalent
of 72,000,000 to a maximum of over
200,000.000 gallons per diem. The per
capita consumption, based on a care-
fully estimated population of 781,133
for Detroit and the suburbs supplied.
was 163 gallons .—a quantity largely
in excess of what is adequate for all
legitimate purposes according to the
most reliable statistics. In an effort
to curtail unnecessary waste, all new
services are metered and old connec-
tions are being metered as rapidly as
possible. There are at present sixty
thousand metered services of forty-
three per cent of the total, and as this
percentage increases, the per capita
consumption should be proportionately
reduced, with a consequent saving
both in cost of operation and in ex-
pense for new equipment.
Recent and Future Improvements.
During the past two years the
energies of the water department have
been directed principally toward the
extention of the distribution system,
and special efforts made to extend the
large supply mains, with a view to af-
fording an increased volume of water
in sections of the City remote from
the pumping station, and in localities
where the consumption was greatest,
A'ith a resultant stabilization of the
(iressures. Since July, 1914, approxi-
mately 130 miles of water mains of all
sizes have been laid, including over 16
miles of mains 42 and 48 inches in
diameter. The plans for the current


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
year contemplate a further extension
of over thirteen miles of 42 to 48 inch
mains in addition to about eighty miles
of laterals six inches to twenty-four
inches in diameter.
The result of the addition of these
large arteries to the distribution sys-
tem has been a decrease in the velocity
through the pipes, with a correspond-
ing lessening of the tendency of break-
age in the large mains, which previous-
ly may have been caused by water
hammer, aggravated in its action by
the excessive momentum of abnor-
mally high velocities. The construc-
tion of the large lines in the form of
loops was, it is believed, a further
factor in the removal of the tendency
to sudden shock, by creating a more
evenly balanced condition of flow.
The principal single extension
planned for this year is a new dis-
tributing main forty-eight inches in
diameter and ten miles long, from the
pumping station to a point in the Six-
Mile Road, or Palmer Boulevard, west
of Woodward Avenue, where it will
connect with other large mains, and
extend thence westwardly in gradually
diminishing sizes. This will make a
total of ten force mains radiating
from the pumping station,—five 42
inches and five 48 inches in diameter,
whose combined capacity at safe nor-
mal velocities would be upwards of
300,000,000 gallons in twenty-four
hours.
The new pumping station, complet-
ed two years ago, was designed to
house six 30,000,000 gallon triple ex-
pansion pumping engines, and coinci-
dent with its construction, three 30,-
000,000 gallon pumps were installed.
The old station contains seven engines
having a combined capacity of 170,-
000,000 gallons, and the 90,000,000 of
the three new pumps brought the total
pumpage capacity to 260,000,000.
In January of this year a contract
was made for two new pumping en-
gines of the same general type of
those previously installed in the new
station, but designed to pump 37,000,-
000 gallons each at normal speed, and
40,000,000 gallons at twenty-two revo-
lutions per minute, under a guarantee
of 190,000,000 foot-pounds duty per
thousand pounds of steam. The first
pump is to be ready for service by
January, 1918, and the second by July,
1918. The completion of these two
engines will give an available pump-
age capacity of 334,000,000 gallons, or
with two units out of commission for
repairs or other causes, a dependable
capacity of 270,000,000 gallons daily.
Plans are now being prepared for a
new boiler house to be erected at the
rear of the New Station, which ulti-
mately will contain six 600 horsepow-
er boilers equipped with superheaters
and the best type of automatic stokers,
and all other modern appliances de-
signed to assist in scientific and eco-
nomical operation. The building will
be in architectural consonance with
the New Pumping Station, to which it
will be attached by a connecting wing
containing offices, shower-baths, toilets
and locker-rooms. Overhead coal
bunkers holding ten days' supply of
coal, will enable the stokers to be fed
with a minimum of manual labor, and
steam ash ejectors will remove the
ashes to a conveniently located bin,
from which they can be loaded direct-
ly into cars or wagons. A brick stack
twelve feet internal diameter and two
hundred fifty feet in height will pro-
vide ample draft for all the boilers
when operating at over rating.

Supply is remarkably good for a sur-
face supply obtained from a source

contiguous to a thickly inhabited sec-
tion, but it is not all that might be
desired from a standard of purity, and
in consequence the question of filtra-
tion is one which for some years has
agitated the minds of those who were
intelligently interested in devising
means to improve the quality of the
supply. The chlorination treatment,
while highly desirable in the absence
of a better method, should only be
considered in the nature of a tempo-
rary expedient, and performs no func-
tion in reducing turbidity or removal
of organic matter from the water.
The typhoid death-rate approximat-
ing twelve per hundred thousand pop-
ulation, as recorded for the past three
years, cannot consistently be offered
as the basis for a rabid or hysterical
arraignment of the character of the
drinking water; but the elimination or
reduction of typhoid fever is only one
of several reasons, sanitary and aes-
thetic, which can be advanced in favor
of filtration. The fact that the water
.supply, in its present condition is not
entirely satisfactory is subject to con-
stant criticism, and is open to the
possibility of occasional serious polu-
tion, imperatively demands that it be
improved; and as filtration is admit-
tedly recognized, by all who are con-
versant, as the most efficient method
of treating a public water supply—in
conjunction with partial or limited
sterilization can be relied upon to con-
vert the river water into a perfectly
clear, wholesome, pure article—every
dictate of reason seems to call for fil-
tration.
Carried to its ultimate analysis, the
problem resolves itself into these
questions: (1) are the citizens of De-
troit satisfied to accept an inferior
article in the water furnished them,
or will they demand the best that can
be procured; and, (2) will a cost of
less than one-half cent per thousand
gallons—the maximum cost of filtra-
tion, exclusive of interest and depre-
ciation—deter them from exacting
their demands?
Imbued with the conviction that the
water supply should be purified, the
construction of a small experimental
filter has been authorized and plans
have been prepared to show the pro-
posed lay-out of a complete plant. The
experimental filter, which is practi-
cally complete, consists of a coagulat-
ing basin with a capacity of 18,000
gallons, and two small filter beds, each
capable of filtering from 60,000 to 80,-
000 gallons per day. The principal
object of this model is to demonstrate
the maximum rate at which the water
of the Detroit River can be filtered,
the minimum quantity of coagulating
necessary, and the requisite period of
coagulation, to produce the desired re-
sults. These determinations will con-
trol or modify the capacity of the
coagulating basin, and the area of fil-
tering surface in the proposed plant
for treating the whole supply.
With fairly complete records of the
results attained with waters of high
turbidities and excessive bacterial con-
tent, it is reasonable to assume that
equally satisfactory results may be se-
cured with the comparatively clear and
pure water of the Detroit River, at a
much higher rate of filtration, which
will mean a considerable saving in the
area of the filters, with a proportion-
ate saving in cost of construction, and
the same principle may apply in the
use of coagulants, with like results in
operating costs. These assumptions,
it is hoped, will be verified by the ex-
perimental work.
The tentative plans for the filter
plant provide for a low-lift pumping
station; a coagulating basin with its
necessary .mixing chambers; a filter


THE MICHIGAN- TECHNIC
house having eighty filter-beds; a
chemical house for storing and mixing
the coagulant; and a filtered water
reservoir. The filtered water reser-
voir will occupy the space of the pres-
ent settling basin, but the remainder
of the plant will be located at the rear
of the New Pumping Station, and its
central axis will coincide with the
north and south axis of the pumping
station and the proposed boiler house.
With the exception of the filtered wa-
ter basin, all of the plant will be under
one roof, but of varying elevations to
conform to the requirements of the
different units.
The low-lift pumping station will be
equipped with steam turbine driven
centrifugal pumps capable of raising
400,000,000 gallons from the intake
level to the coagulating basin. Steam
for the turbines will be taken from the
boilers in the new boiler- house, and
the raw water supply will be received
through a twelve foot diameter con-
duit connected both to the ten foot
tunnel and the six foot conduit which
parrallel the easterly side of the set-
tling basin. A screen-house with mo-
tor operated revolving screens will in-
tercept floating ice and other coarse
material in the water, before it reaches
the suction well.
The coagulating basin in conjunc-
tion with the mixing chambers, will
occupy a space 400 feet wide, and 800
to 1,000 feet long, and have a capacity
of 40 to 50.000,000 gallons, providing
for a four-hour period of coagulation
for 300,000,000 gallons daily. The
basin will be of concrete and provided
with necessary baffles and division
walls for adjusting the period of coag-
ulation. The chemical house will be
placed between the coagulating basin
and the filters, rising to a higher ele-
vation for the storage and mixing
space, and will be surmounted central-
ly by the wash-water tower.
The filter proper will consist of
eighty beds of about 1,200 square feet
each, arranged in eight tiers of ten
beds with pipe galleries between tiers,
the whole covering a space 300 x 400
feet. The full equipment of filter-
beds will not be required at the start,
and probably twenty beds will be left
for future development as the increas-
ing consumption may demand.
The sub-structure of the whole
plant will be concrete, and the super-
structure of brick of ornamental de-
sign. The plant will be entirely cov-
ered.
The filtered water basin will be 350
feet wide, 800 feet long, and twenty
feet deep, giving a capacity of 40,000,-
000 gallons. It will be all concrete
construction, covered and parked over
the top and laid out in tennis courts
or ornamental shrubbery and lawn.
Conclusion.
The plans in all their features con-
template a daily capacity of over 300,-
000.000 gallons, with provision for
meeting peakloads of ten per cent
above the maximum normal condi-
tions. It is difficult to predict what
the future will require, but when the
average daily consumption approaches
300,000,000 gallons, a second station
located farther up the lake and equip-
ped with large centrifugal units will
probably be the solution.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
It will be noted upon perusal of the
proposed law as drafted by the Mich-
igan Society that one of the most se-
rious bones of contention found in
other statutes has been removed. Ref-
erence is made to the effect of the
measure upon men who are practicing
as engineers at the time of its passing
into effect. All men engaged in such
practice at that time will be granted
licenses upon presentation of creden-
tials or a creditable record. By this
means, no man will be prevented from
continuing his work through inability
pass a required examination. The
work of all licensed Engineers will be
under the surveillance of the Licensing
Board, provided for in the law in a
manner which will prevent the pos-
sible bad effects of political influence.
If this Board observes any cases of
incompetency it has the power to re-
voke the license of such practitioner.
In this way, no person will be disqual-
ified without having been given an
opportunity to show his worth.
Although there are still many op-
ponents to the plan of licensing, their
number is continually decreasing. The
work of the Michigan Engineering So-
ciety will have much to do with fur-
ther conversion of belief on this sub-
ject, and should the bill become law it
will probably become the basis for
similar legislation in other states.
IN LARGER QUARTERS
By the time that this number
reaches our readers, The Technic
will be in their new offices. For con-
siderable time the present quarters
have been greatly overcrowded; both
the Engineering Society and The
Technic feeling that they could oc-
cupv a larger space. And so we are
moving to rooms 269 and 271 of this
same building. This gives us two of-
fices to ourselves and leaves the Engi-
neering Society the sole occupants of
our present office. All the pamphlets,
bound notes and other publications on
sale by The Technic can be pro-
cured at the new offices any school
day between the hours of eight and
three.
FILING ENGINEERING DATA
The recent step of the Engineering
Society in undertaking through com-
mittees, the study of different prac-
ticable methods and classifications for
the filing of engineering data and lit-
erature merits comment for several
reasons. It is an indication of the
appreciation of the present need for
a logical order or classification for
technical subjects which is adaptable
for universal application. At the pres-
ent time there are a very few classifi-
cations. Foremost among these are
the Dewey Decimal system and the Li-
brary of Congress system. Develop-
ments of recent years have made a
further extension of these necessary
to their usefulness. The first problem
before the committee is the selection
of the basic system after which the
work will consist in completing a thor-
ough classification of all subjects in
use today.
To the student in college, particu-
larly the upper classman, such a com-
pleted index would be of immense
value. Engineering science is based
on the proper and logical classification
of the facts of other branches. That
the engineer know all of these facts
is not presumed for an instant, but it
is essential that he know where to find
them. At no time is the engineer in
a better position to make use of a
classification than while in college. His
business in college is the collection of
information which he expects to use
in practice later, and which to be of
use must be preserved. A logical in-

A BILL FOR
AX ACT providing for the regulation of the practice of civil engineering
and for the organization of a Board of Examining Engineers.
Section i. All persons proposing to practice civil engineering (in-
cluding surveying, structural work, foundations, buildings, bridges, etc.,
hydraulic engineering, municipal and sanitary engineering, highway engi-
neering and all other branches of engineering which pertain to the civil
engineer), within the State of Michigan, and who are engaged in such prac-
tice on the 31st day of August, A. D. 1917, shall file with the State Board
of Examining Engineers, to be hereinafter provided for, not later than
September 15th, A. D. 1917, a sworn certificate setting forth in full their
training and experience. The Secretary of the Board of Examining Engi-
neers shall file all such certificates and shall furnish copies thereof upon re-
quest, charging the legal fee for transcripts of records. The Board of Ex-
amining Engineers shall issue licenses to all civil engineers who thus qualify
for practice under the provisions of this section and the licenses shall refer
by number to the certificates filed by such engineers in the office of the Sec-
retary of the Board.
Sec. 2. All persons proposing to practice civil engineering on and
after the first day of September, A. D. 1917, shall, before performing any
professional work within the borders of the State of Michigan, satisfy the
Board of Examining Engineers, either by the presentation of diplomas from
reputable schools of civil engineering and a statement of practical experience,
or by examination, as the Board may direct, that they are qualified members
of the profession. The Secretary of the Board shall keep a record of all
business transacted by the Board and a license shall be issued to all appli-


cants who qualify under the provisions of this section. An applicant failing
to qualify under the provisions of this section may again apply to the Board
of Examining Engineers after the expiration of one year.
Sec. 3. The State Board of Examining Engineers shall consist of three
representative civil engineers, who shall have been, at the time of their
appointment, engaged in the practice of civil engineering within the State
of Michigan, for a period of at least five years. The members of the Board
shall be nominated by a committee composed of the Dean of the College of
Engineering, University of Michigan, the Dean of the Department of Engi-
neering, Michigan College of Agriculture, and the President of the Michigan
State School of Mines, and appointed by the Governor. The term of office
of the members of the Board shall be six years, excepting that when nom-
inations are first made, the nominating committee shall designate one can-
didate for a term of six years, one for a term of four years and one for a
term of two years. The State Board of Examining Engineers shall organize
within itself, electing a President and a Secretary-Treasurer. In order that
the Board may carry into effect the provisions of this Act, it shall have au-
thority to make rules and regulations, not in conflict with the laws of the
State. The Board shall collect the following fees: (A) For the examina-
tion of credentials and issuing of licenses under the provisions of Section 1
of this Act, ten ($10) dollars; (B) for examining credentials or conducting
examinations under the provisions of Section 2 of this Act, ten ($10) dol-
lars; (C) for issuing licenses under the provisions of Section 2 of this Act,
ten ($10) dollars.
The license issued shall be of such form as the Board may adopt. It
shall bear the seal of the Board and the signatures of the President and the
Secretary-Treasurer. All moneys collected under the provisions of this
Act shall be deposited in the State Treasury and credited to the fund of the
State Board of Examining Engineers. Such funds shall be available for
paying the expenses of the Board, including the hire of clerical assistance.
The members of the' Board shall serve without compensation. Their actual
and necessary traveling expenses shall be defrayed. The President of the
Board shall make a biennial report to the Governor, to be filed on or before
the first day of December preceding regular sessions of the State Legisla-
ture, which shall contain a complete account of all business transacted by
the Board, together with a detailed statement of all receipts and disburse-
ments.
Sec. 4. Any and all persons professing to be civil engineers, or who
perform work in the field of the civil engineer, who fail to avail themselves
of the benefits of this Act, shall be ineligible to appointment or election to
any State, County, Township, City or Village office of trust or honor within
the State of Michigan, where the duties of such office involve service of the
kind rendered and performed by the civil engineer. No such person shall
be accepted as a competent witness in testimony involving matters pertain-
ing to the work of the civil engineer, in any court within the State of Mich-
igan. No public officer within the State of Michigan shall accept any work
which concerns the profession of civil engineering from any person who


fails to avail himself of the benefits of this Act. The Board of Examining
Engineers may, at any time, revoke the license of any civil engineer when,
in the judgment of the Board, such engineer is incompetent, dishonest, or
whose practice is clearly prejudicial to public safety or welfare.
Sec. 5. No public works, usually demanding the service of the civil
engineer, shall be undertaken by the State of Michigan, or by any County,
Township, City or Village, within its borders, without first having plans,
arid specifications prepared therefor by some licensed civil engineer.
Sec. 6. It shall not be necessary for any licensed civil engineer to
qualify under the laws of the State of Michigan relating to the registration
of Architects, in order that he may design and superintend the construction
of foundations and buildings, when such foundations and buildings are in-
cidental or subordinate to engineering design, or where utility, special engi-
neering features, strength and durability outweigh any architectural or
esthetic considerations.
Sec. 7. There shall be assigned to the State Board of Examining Engi-
neers, by the Board of State Auditors, suitable rooms at Lansing, together
with office furniture and equipment, for the use of said Board.
Sec. 8. All Acts and parts of Acts conflicting with the provisions
hereof are hereby repealed in so far as they are inconsistent with any of the
provisions of this Act.


44TTTR have met the enemy and they
W are ours," is the historical re-
port of Commander Perry, of
Lake Erie fame, after one of his successful
naval engagements. With apologies to the
commander the "studes" at Michigan have
all repeated, "We have met the enemy and
they are ours."
After a period of weeks when the first
part of that old axiom, "Early to bed and
early to rise," was warped all out of shape;
when old familiar gathering places were
deserted; when there was much burning
of midnight oil, and worries were many and
pleasures few; when the big indoor sport
was a close application to musty text-books;
midyear examinations became but shadows
of the past, and once again the Engineering
Society rooms were the rendezvous of the
engineer. Pipes were lit, post-mortems on
the examinations were held, the war was
discussed and life in the University again
settled into its normal course.
The annual Junior Hop, the stellar social
e.vent of the college year, took place. It
brought to Ann Arbor 500 Helens, and
Marys, and Janes from every corner of
the country to startle this staid old college
town by the originality and brilliance of
their decorative schemes, which would have
brought delight to the heart of the most
ardent cubist or futurist. Waldo McKec,
'18E, was general chairman of this year's
Hop.
Preparations are now under way for the
new Michigan Union Opera, "The Fool's
Paradise." Rehearsals are held several
times each week, and the enthusiasm of the
men in the cast points to a big success.
Arthur Schupp, '17E, is general chairman
of the opera.
Work is progressing rapidly on the new
Union Building and on the Library. Con-
crete is being poured for the Union when
the weather conditions permit. Work on
the superstructure should be well under way
by April 1st. If the weather is at all fa-
vorable, the two new wings of the Library
will be ready for occupation early in April.
The reading rooms and reference books
will be transferred from the present reading
rooms to these wings, and the work of
tearing down the old main structure imme-
diately begun. In the plans for the new-
library no provision has been made for the
old Cambridge Chimes in the present build-
ing, which have sounded the opening and
close of each day for so many years.
In preparation for the extension of the
central heating system to take care of the
new Union Building and the larger li-
brary, the building and grounds depart-
ment of the University have had Prof.
Emswiler, of the Mechanical Engineering
College, carry on a series of tests to deter-
mine the pressure load on the heating
mains. Under Research will be found a
complete description of these tests.

Dean M. E. Cooley was one of the in-
vited guests at a reception given to mem-
bers of the Immigration Committee of the
Chamber of Commerce of the U. S. by Mr.
and Mrs. Astor, of New York City. A
number of prominent engineers attended
the reception.
Robert Rutledge, Chief Engineer of the
Santa Fe Railroad, addressed the All-Engi-
neers Smoker, recently held at the Mich-
igan Union. President Hutchins and Prof.
Riggs also addressed the men, and empha-
sized the importance of such gatherings in
promoting a greater social bond among the
students. About five hundred engineers
were present.
ADDRESS BY PROF. W. T. FISH-
LEIGH TO S. A. E.
At the last regular annual session of the
Society of Automobile Engineers, held in
New York City, a very interesting paper
was read by Prof. W. T. Fishleigh, of the
Automobile Department. The paper em-
phasized the great waste of fuel in the
automobile engine. Ninety per cent of the
gasoline used in the modern gas engine
goes to waste. Out of every dollar's worth
of gasoline, a mere 10 cents worth of
power is developed at the flywheel and de-
livered through the transmission to the rear
axle. The balance is dissipated in the form
of heat losses to the exhaust, cooling the
water, cooling the air, and friction. Radical
changes must be made in the present de-
sign, or it must be discontinued, eventually,
in favor of a more efficient form of internal
combustion engine.
SHORT COURSES IN HIGHWAY
ENGINEERING
The third annual short course in High-
way Engineering was given during the
week commencing Monday, February 19.
The purpose of this course is to aid in sup-
plying that information to highway com-
missioners relating to the construction and
maintenance of country roads, that is so
much in demand and which is so
difficult to get. The subjects given are so
condensed and organized that a digest of
the best practice can be presented. The
topics selected for lectures, papers and
demonstrations, are those relating directly
to Michigan conditions, and in which com-
missioners and engineers are definitely in-
terested. Those in attendance are encour-
aged to ask questions, and promote dis-
cussion, for the exchange of ideas is mu-
tually beneficial. Lectures are given daily,
in the morning, afternoon and evening, by
various well known engineers. This short
course in Highway Engineering has worked
out very successfully, and has proved it-
self a popular institution.
PROF. PAWLOWSKI READS PAPER
On the evening of February 9, at the
annual session of the Society of Automo-
bile Engineers, a paper was presented by
Professor F. W. Pawlowski, of the Aero-
nautics Department. The paper dealt with
the evolution of wing truss design, and
was very highly received.

Manufacturers' Fellowship.
The Technical Association of the Pulp
and Paper Industry was organized largely
through the efforts of Henry E. Fletcher
who has just completed his second year
as president of this young but thriving
association. The membership of this or-
ganization now numbers over 250 and in-
cludes most of the men who are respon-
sible for the vigorous and progressive
technical development which the pulp and
paper industry is experiencing. The As-
sociation is attempting to standardize the
processes of pulp and paper manufacture
and to develop standard methods of testing
raw materials and finished products.
A paper was presented before the Tech-
nical Association by Profs. White and Rue
on "The Recovery of Methyl Alcohol and
Acetone from the Black Liquor in the Soda
Process." It was shown that these valu-
able chemicals can be obtained by a modi-
fication of the present process of recover-
ing the soda. The cost of the modified
recovery process promises to be no more
than for the older method so that the alco-
hol and acetone appear as practically a
net gain.
Mr. Zimmerman and Mr. Yetter, who
were doing graduate work and held assisl-
antsbips in the department, resigned at the
end of the first semester. Mr. Zimmerman
is now with the Goodyear Rubber Co.,
at Akron, O.
Mr. A. W. Bretsch and Mr. S. T. Leo
received their degrees, and have left the
University. Mr. Bretsch is with the Hud-
son Motor Co.
Mr. E. R. Young, holder of the Detroit
Steel Castings Co.'s fellowship, has fin-
ished the work for his degree of M.S. and
has taken a position with the above com-
pany. The fellowship probably will not be
reassigned this year, but it is expected it
will be available next year.
Mr. Samuel Cohen and Mr. L. E. Peter
son have been appointed assistants for the
remainder of the year.
MECHANICAL ENGINEERING DEPT.
Measurement of Low Pressure Steam
Used for Heating the Buildings on the
Campus
BY J. E. EMSWILER
At the request of the Buildings and
Grounds Department of the University,
some experiments were undertaken to de-
termine the velocity and quantity of steam
that is being carried through the low pres-
sure heating mains fed from the Washing-
ton Street plant. The Buildings and
Grounds Department is confronted with
the problem of extending soon the central
heating system to serve the new Michigan
Union Building, as well as that of pro-
viding heat for the new and larger Library.
Some information as to the present. load
on the heating mains was therefore neces-
sary, and it was in this connection that the
experiments described in this paper were
made.
The low pressure steam furnished for
heating is made up in part of the exhaust
from the joo k. w. main generating unit of
the plant, and its auxiliaries. But the
amount of exhaust steam is by far too
small in colder weather, and the greater
part is delivered directly into the low pres-
sure main through a reducing pressure
valve from the high pressure steam header
in the plant. The proportion of exhaust
steam and throttled steam of course varies
throughout the day with the variation in
load on the engine unit, but the average
for the winter time is about 24% exhaust,
and 76% throttled steam.
The entire amount of heating steam is
conveyed from the plant through a 20 inch
main at pressure varying from 4 to 9 lbs.


4i
above atmospheric pressure. At the "sub-
station," just north of the Medical Build-
ing, the 20 inch main divides into four 12
inch pipe branches, of which one serves
the gymnasiums; one goes to the west,
serving the Chemistry Building, Natural
Science Building, Hill Auditorium, etc.;
the other two go to the south, serving the
buildings on the eastern side of the Camp-
us, and after being tied together in the
old power house, one line passes to the
fig. I
riroT XUB£ •ini&gt;
west, serving the buildings in that direc-
tion, and finally tying in with the other
western branch under University Hall and
so completing the Campus loop.
The instruments of measurement em-
ployed were the Pitot tube and special
manometer. The Pitot tube used is of the
form shown in Fig. 1. The static and total
elements are separate, S representing the
static, and T the total. The tip of the
static element, presented to the current, is
plugged, and the end nicely rounded. There
are three 1/16 inch holes on each side of
the tip for the communication of static
pressure. In addition, there is a row of
three holes in the bottom of the tip, to
permit any condensation which may have
formed in the tube, to drain out without
obstructing the other openings. The total
tube is of course open at the end of the
tip. Both tubes are made of J4 inch pipe,
nickel plated. The large size was selected
in order to obviate any possibility of a
drop of water filling the cross-section and
interfering with the communication of the
true pressure.
The tubes enter the steam pipe through
the stuffing boxes B. The total tube is of
sufficient length to permit of a traverse of
the pipe. G is a guide extending from the
tube in the same direction as the tip, and
serves to align the tip with the pipe. V
is a valve for shutting off the steam from
the connections, when necessary. C is the
connection to the manometer. A pressure
connection for a gage or mercury mano-
meter can be made to the static tube be-
yond the valve R.
The form of manometer finally devised
to register the differential pressure between
total and static pressures, that is the ve-
locity pressure, is also illustrated in Fig. I.
The static connection is made at A, the
pressure being communicated to the H"
gage glass L. The total pressure connec-
tion is made at K. The pressure is exerted
upon the water in the 1 inch pipe chamber
E. The part D is not a pipe, but merely a
solid connector. The water in E stands
at the level of the overflow of pipe F, so
that the height of water in the glass above
a zero reading on the scale corresponding
to the top of the overflow pipe in E rep-
resents the velocity pressure of the steam
in inches of water. Condensation in either
E or L can not accumulate and alter the
level in E. so long as the overflow cham-
ber H is not full.
It will be noted that the entire apparatus
is constructed with the idea in mind of
taking care of condensation as it is formed,
and obviating any errors that might result
from its presence. With the same thing in
mind, the connecting pipes between the
Pitot tube and manometer were relatively
large in size, and the greatest care was


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
exercised to see that there were no pock-
ets for the accumulation of condensation.
It was at first thought that rubber tubing
could be used, but after some preliminary
trials, it became apparent that the heat and
pressure of the steam was beyond the limits
of the rubber. Owing to the necessity of
keeping the connecting tubes free of water
at all times, the hot steam itself came in
contact with the rubber causing it to rot
and ultimately rupture. Flexible metallic
gas tubing was then tried but was soon
found to develop small leaks. Finally, af-
ter the proper position of the total tube
in the pipe had been determined by travers-
ing, the connections between tubes and
manometer were made of solid H" iron
pipe, and after that no trouble was ex-
perienced.
Pitot tubes were installed in the 20 inch
line, near the sub-station. This location
was known as station B. Similarly, tubes
were installed in the several branches to
the gymnasiums, to the west, and the two
to the south, and the stations were desig-
nated respectively C, D, E, and F. The
combined flow measured at C, D, E and F,
should total up to the amount measured at
B, and offers a check on the accuracy of
measurement.
- It was obviously out of the question to
traverse the pipes at the frequent inter-
vals of reading. The pipes were therefore
traversed beforehand and a certain posi-
tion for the total tube ascertained, at which
point the same velocity pressures were in-
dicated as resulted from the average of 10
points on the diameter of traverse. This
matter of ascertaining an average position
offered much more difficulty than might be
expected. The rate of steam flow was
subject to frequent and considerable varia-
tion, so that in traversing one could not be
sure that a difference between readings at
different points was due to difference of
position of the total tube in the pipe. A
plan was finally suggested which made a
fairly satisfactory solution possible. The
tube was set on a certain point of the tra-
verse, say 1. A reading was taken on the
manometer, and instantly the tube was
slipped to position 2, and a reading on the
manometer taken. Then, after a few mo-
ments, a reading on position two was
taken, and the tube immediately slipped to
position 1, and a reading taken there. This
was repeated many times, the averages fin-
ally furnishing a pretty accurate relation
between the velocity pressures at these two
points. Then a comparison was made be-
tween positions 2 and 3, and so on across
the pipe. The position of average reading
having been established, the tube was set
there, and but a single indication was then
necessary.
The pressure of the steam was indicated
at stations B and D by mercury U-tubes.
The temperature of the steam at B was
registered by a thermometer in a well in
the pipe. It is interesting to note that the
steam was superheated at that point, usually
10 the extent of 40 or 50 degrees.
Observations were begun at 3 P. M. on
Thursday, February 1. and were continued
for a week, ending Thursday, February 8.
Readings at all stations were taken every
fifteen minutes. The work was done by
students of the Engineering College for
the Buildings and Grounds Department.
The men worked in 8-hour shifts of two
men each.
The velocity of the steam is calculated
by the equation V* = 2 g h. where h refers
to the velocity head measured in feet of the
substance flowing. The working form of
the equation reduces to
V = 1096 V'p Vs
where V ~ velocity in ft. per min.
p — velocity pr. in inches of water,
and s — specific volume.
The curves show the velocities of the
steam in the several pipes, as well as the
amount flowing, for a part of Tuesday,
February 6.
The velocity curves show that pipe D is
much more heavily loaded than any of the
others. The maximum velocity indicated is
nearly 12,000 ft. per minute. Pipe B is
next, with a maximum velocity indicated,
of something over q.ooo ft. per minute.
Comparing the curves which show the
flow through B fthe 20-inch pipe) and the


43
tYeia. Fen, 7,1111
Velocity Curves for Part of Day
sum of the flows in the 4 branches, it is
apparent that, while there is not perfect
agreement, by any means, the check is suf-
ficiently satisfactory considering the diffi-
culties.
The demand for steam is much greater
during those hours of the day when the
ventilating fans are on, that is from 7 to 8
in the morning until about 4 in the after-
noon. These hours are included on the
curve.
At night, the valves to all the 13 branches
except D are shut off between the hours 10
or 11 P. M., to about 4 A. M., and the
amount of steam falls to about 8,000 pounds
per hour.
For several hours during the clay, a flow
of approximately 50,000 pounds, or 25 tons


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
of steam per hour, was indicated. This
amount of steam for heating is probably
far beyond the expectations of anyone who
has not had the figures presented to him.
Moreover, the above value does not repre-
sent the amount of steam used by all the
buildings of the University. The steam for
the Martha Cook Building is furnished
from a high pressure line; four buildings
received steam from the 20 inch main be-
tween the power plant and sub-station and
so was not measured; and the General Hos-
pital is heated by its own plant.
With the method of measurement em-
ployed, some difficulties were encountered
which it may be well to point out here.
Not only were there frequent variations
in the flow, but there were rhythmic pulsa-
tions, due to the discharge of the low pres-
sure cylinder of the engine into the main.
It seems incredible that the engine's dis-
charge could be noticeable in a receiver 20
inches in diameter, and nearly a third of a
mile long, and yet every stroke of the en-
gine is distinctly visible in its effect on the
water level in the manometer, not only at
Station B in the 20 inch pipe, but in the
stations in the branches, though to a lesser
extent. These pulsations necessitated the
partial closure of the valve M (Fig. 1),
in order to dampen the fluctuations of the
water in the glass and make observation
possible. Pulsating flow introduces some
error in itself and in this case probably
causes another error by allowing some of
the water in E CFig. 1) to splash out
through the overflow pipe, and thus change
the zero.
Any leakage in the apparatus or connect-
ing tubes is fatal to accurate readings.
A difference in rate of condensation in
the connecting tubes may introduce an ap-
preciable error. This was guarded against
as far as possible in the installation of the
apparatus, and was further remedied by
covering, or partially covering, some of the
pipes so as to leave the same length ex-
posed.
More nearly accurate results were un-
doubtedly obtained at the higher velocities,
where the velocity pressure was large. It
rcmiires a velocity nearly 5,000 ft. per min-
ute to cause a velocity pressure of I inch
of water; whereas a velocity of 10,000 ft.
per minute will give a reading of 4 inches.
The maximum velocity observed, about
12,000 ft. per minute, caused a deflection of
approximately 6 inches in the water level
of the manometer.
COMPARISON OF PIPE COIL AND
CAST IRON SECTIONS FOR
WARMING AIR.
The designing engineer, in laying out a
ventilating system, must decide whether to
use coils or cast iron sections.
Tests were recently conducted by Prof.
John R. Allen, of the Mechanical Engi-
neering College, in the research laboratory
of the American Radiator Company, to
form a basis in the comparison of pipe
coil and cast iron sections for warming
air. The tests were conducted to show the
comparative effects of these two types of
radiation. The conclusions reached were,
first, that the condensation in pounds per
square foot per hour for both pipe coils
and cast iron surfaces depends, in properly
designed surfaces, upon the friction of the
coil; second, that the friction of pipe coils
varies as the velocity to the 1.9 power,
and in cast iron sections, as the square.
In order to obtain the results for pipe
coils, a set of experiments were made on
an A B C No. 25A pipe coil, with 1" pipes
spaced 2^4" on centers with pipes 5' and
5-3" in height. Each section contained 4
staggered rows of pipe, making 192.55
square feet per section with a free air
area as measured between the first row of
pipes of 1.71 square feet.
The coils were placed in a testing cham-
ber and the thermometers were protected
from radiant heat by the use of a cover-
ing. Piping was used to obtain the static
pressure on the inlet side of the coil. An
inclined platform, 4' long was placed in
front of the coils and a similar one after
the coils, to prevent the air currents, ordi-
narily produced by the base of the coil.
A manometer was used for measuring
the resistance of the coil, and a steam-
jacketed tank for collecting condensation.


45
The water level was maintained constant
in this tank during the tests as nearly as
possible. Other apparatus comprised a
steam separator fan, steam gauge, slant
gauges and Pitot tubes. Forty readings
of the manometer were taken for each test
and averaged. Condensation from the coils
was weighed in weighing barrels.
Before tests were started, coils were put
under steam pressure and carefully ex-
amined to see that they were hot all over,
and not air bound at any point. The ve-
locity of the air through the coils was
adjusted by means of the speed of the fan
and the adjustment of the dampers. The
air velocities were measured by means of
Pitot tubes, and manometer, and checked
with the velocity determined from the con-
densation of steam in coils. Logarithmic
charts of the results of the tests were made
for both pipe coils and Vento surfaces.
Similar resistances were found to give
almost the same condensation.
The Engineering Society and the Society
Publication, The Technic, have so far
outgrown their quarters at 212-214 Engi-
neering Building, that The Technic has
taken new quarters at 269-271 Engineering
Building. This will better enable them to
care for the large volume of business they
are now doing in the sale of pamphlets
for the engineering mechanics courses,
Carnegie Handbooks, blueprints, and so
forth.
This has remedied to some extent the
overcrowding in the society rooms. The
membership of the society is 625. Although
the present quarters are still entirely in-
adequate, there still seems to be no imme-
diate relief.
Lounging in the rooms between classes
has given the engineers an excellent chance
to know each other better. In promoting
this closer social union among the men,
the society can be a real factor in the de-
velopment of engineers. With larger
quarters, the work which is possible in this
direction could be extended. Checkers,
chess, and cards have been placed in the
rooms, so that men who care to come there
evenings can occupy their time.
A George Washington party was given
ac the Union on Friday night, February
23rd. This was the second membership
party, for both of which the capacity of the
Union floor was sold. A big smoker is
planned for the near future. N. H. Isben,
'18E, is acting as chairman and promises
some real features in the way of entertain-
ment. A nominal fee only will be charged
to enable the committee to estimate the
crowd.
Mr. Menefee and Mr. Streiff, engineers
with the Fargo Engineering Company of
Jackson, Michigan, lectured to members in
the Science Building auditorium recently.
Mr. Menefee spoke on the "Construction
of the Wissota Dam at Chippewa Falls,
Wisconsin." Mr. Streiff spoke on "Spill-
ways in General." Both lectures were il-
lustrated by motion pictures and lantern
slides.
A committee of members, under the
chairmanship of R. L. McNamee, '17E, is
working on the Dewey Decimal Classifica-
tion System, in an effort to make it better
apply to the indexning of engineering litera-
ture. Meetings are held every two weeks.
F. M. Sabin, '18E, is acting as secretary of
the committee.
On January loth, the Chemical Branch
of the Engineering Society held another of
their successful meetings. The committee
in charge tried to make the affair as in-
formal as possible and succeeded beyond
all expectations. Several good papers and
talks were given, followed by a general
social time.
"Hal" Smith, '16, who has been working
on the various properties of brass, was the
first on the program and gave the society


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
an interesting discussion of the cause and
remedy of blow holes in brass ingots. W.
Lee Watson, '17, next gave an illustrated
paper on paper and its physical structure.
He showed many microscopic slides of dif-
ferent kinds of papers, explaining the
various textures and telling the advantages
and various uses of the different grades of
paper on the market.
Following Watson's talk a few minutes
recess was called and large dishes of pop-
corn were distributed to the members, fol-
lowed by smokes. Professor Badger was
then called upon and responded with a
short talk on the manufacture and possi-
bilities of metallic calcium; pointing out
that when a method of commercially mak-
ing this metal has been worked out, no one
can predict to what extent its uses may
extend.
Chairman Breitung next introduced Mr.
R. A. Johnson, chief chemist of the Good-
year Rubber Company, who explained the
chemical control of 'his company's plants
and outlined the possibilities of college
graduates in taking up rubber work.
And then came one of the best social
get-togethers any branch of the Engineer-
ing Society has ever staged. Coffee and
sandwiches were served and an impromptu
quartet rendered several Michigan songs.
The chairman then asked each member of
the faculty in turn to give something in
the line of an anecdote, song or conun-
drum. Each responded and the rest of the
society were given a treat that apparently
has never been surpassed.
Taken it all around, our youngest branch
has started a program of meetings that is
certain to be successful and well attended.
During the winter the Student Branch
of the A. I. E. E. has enjoyed many in-
teresting and important lectures covering
various fields of electrical work.
On the evening of December 10, Prof.
Sadler spoke before the combined meeting
of the Detroit-Ann Arbor Section and the
Student Branch, his subject being, "Sub-
marines and their Electrical Equipment."
Prof. Sadler prefaced his talk by a dem-
onstration of the manufacture of subma-
rine models and some of the devices used
in testing them in the naval tank.
January 11, 1917, Mr. G. E. Lewis, Su-
perintendent Hydraulic Plants of the De-
troit Edison Co.. read a very interesting
paper before the electrical and civil
branches on "The Development and Oper-
ations of the Water Power Plants on the
Huron River." In his theme Mr. Lewis ex-
plained some problems arising in the oper-
ation of hydraulic power plants and the
transmission of electric power. He also
touched upon some of the future possibili-
ties of further utilizing the power on the
river.
Thursday evening, January 25, Mr. C. R.
Underhill, Chief Engineer for the Acme
Wire Co., gave a very interesting talk on
"Electro-Magnets." Mr. Underhill dwelt
for some time on ingenious devices and
application of electro-magnets. The talk
was followed by a discussion in which both
members of the faculty and the students
took part. Mr. Underhill left a case of
apparatus with the department to be used
in research work.
On January 19, Mr. L. W. Bronson, '17E,
read a very interesting lecture on
"Synchronous Motors and A. C. genera-
tors." This lecture was illustrated and is
one of the many furnished by the G. E.
and Westinghouse Companies, giving de-
tails of design, construction, and tests car-
ried out on various forms of electrical ma-
chinery. This was the first lecture of this
nature attempted, but judging from the
able way in which it was handled and the
interest manifest by those present, it may
be considered only a stepping stone to
many others of a similar nature to follow.
GRAPHICAL METHODS FOR HAN-
DLING ENGINEERING DATA
An important event of Friday evening
February 16, was Prof. Running's lecture
before the Detroit and Ann Arbor sections
of the A. I. E. E. The subject of the talk
was, "Graphical Methods for Handling
Engineering Data." The two problems dis-
cussed in the talk were: First, determin-
ing the fall of the equation which repre-


47
scnts the relation between the variables
entering into a set of data; second, the
determination of the best values of the
constants entering into such equations.
The first problem was solved by a con-
sideration of a series of differences of the
dependent variable. In any set of data,
the values of the independent variable are
either given in an arithmetic series or in
a geometric series. They may also be
read from the curve in either one of these
two series. The series of differences of
the dependent variable may be used to
determine the form of equation which will
best represent the data.
The second problem, that of determining
the best values of the constants in the
equations used, was reduced in each case
to the problem of computing the slope of
a line and its intercept. As the eye can
judge points lying on a straight line quite
closely, a good approximation of the best
constants can readily be made.
Prof. Running's lecture was enthusiasti-
cally received by a very large audience.
He is the author of a manuscript on em-
pirical formulae. The work is practically
complete, and will shortly be published.

R. H. Erley, Reporter.
The 1917 "J" Hop has passed into his-
tory, and it will be remembered as the
most brilliant and successful Hop ever
given. It was our good fortune to be in
turn for the general chairmanship and the
class has every reason to be proud of the
choice they made. Waldo McKee conduct-
ed the entire affair with true engineering
thoroughness. There wasn't a hitch any-
where. D. J. Hibbard and E. G. Dudley
proved able assistants.
Then there was our own little "hop," the
"Wheel and Axle Ball," which was held on
February 21, at Barbour Gymnasium. The
music was good, there were lots of favors
and it was well attended. Everyone pres-
ent had a fine time. Prof. F. H. Stevens
and Mrs. Stevens, and Prof. John E. Ems-
wiler and Mrs. Emswiler acted as chap-
erons and the class wishes to thank them
for the interest they took in the affair.
This is the second successful dance that
we have had this season. The first one
was held at the Packard Academy on De-
cember 8.
We are making good progress in ath-
letics, too. Our hockey team had a clean
slate and with only one more game to play
at the time this went to press it was prac-
tically certain that we would be Hockey
Champions. The defeat of the fresh yearl-
ings 6 to o on Washington's Birthday gave
us a head start on our only dangerous
competitor.
At the January class meeting the class
elected E. C. Schacht as its Student Coun-
cil representative. B. E. Breckenridge,
chairman of the directory committee, had
the class directory ready for us at this
time, and we were glad to receive them.
H. A. Knowlson reported that the class
was somewhat in debt and that there were
still many class dues outstanding. Since
that meeting a statement was mailed to
each member stating the amount that each
respective member owed. This proved
quite successful for it brought some re-
sponse. Prof. Trueblood, of the Oratory
Department was the speaker at this
meeting.
Our next social event will probably be
in the form of a dinner. Waldo McKee,
chairman of the social committee, is wait
ing until the next class meeting before
completing arrangements.
Two hundred and three pairs strong,
our new corduroy trousers arrived on the
first of the year. They have certainly
turned out a tremendous success, and even
the girls on the Campus speak to us once
in a while now as they get accustomed to
them.

Michigancnsian
This year's senior class will dedicate
their section of the Michiganensian to
Professor J. J. Albert Rousseau. Profes-
sor Rousseau has given much inspiration
due to his past experience and work in
L'Ecole de Beaux Arts, and it is hoped
that he will remain here after the war
closes.
Bob Frantz is this year back at his old
job as art editor on the Michiganensian.
Bob is showing a lot of punch and it
would be safe to say that the 'Ensian this
year will probably be one of the best ever
as far as the art work is concerned.
Those Senior Canes
The seniors, in trying to do something
original, struck upon the idea of carving
their names on each other's class cane.
The twenty members of the class plan to
have their canes well decorated with
"trade-marks."
during the February examinations, but did
not prove a success; as a result, it will be
discontinued for the present, at least.
The Honor System
Recently there was a great deal of agi-
tation on the campus to establish the honor
system in all the separate schools and col-
leges similar to that in force in the College
of Engineering. A vote was taken in the
College of Architecture and it was de-
cided to try out the system. It was used
Opera Poster Contest
The architects at least got a look-in on
the Michigan Union Opera Poster Con-
test, due to the fact that Samuel Wiener
came under the wire for third place. Per-
haps next year, with a little more enthusi-
asm, we may be able to do better. How-
ever, even third place in infinitely better
than nothing at all; not so?
The 1916 Medal
F. L. Brinkman was the winner of the
1916 medal awarded in the College of Ar-
chitecture. Some of his work was exhib-
ited at the recent architectural exhibition
at Minnesota.
The Minnesota Exhibition
At the recent architectural exhibition
held at Minnesota, it is pleasing to note
that the College of Architecture of the
University of Michigan was so ably rep-
resented. The cathedral problem by Ar-
nold Berg was among the best pieces of
work sent from here. F. L. Brinkman,
Warren L. Rindge, Gilbert S. Underwood,
and John H. Pielemeier were included with
those whose work was given a place in the
exhibition.

Basket Ball
There is "in embryo" a basket ball team
in the College of Architecture, but its
growth promises to be rapid and sure.
Hammond, Hewlett, Cartwright, and Hull
look very promising as material. Get
braced.
The Soph Dance
In the front ranks of the year's social
events was the dance given by the Sopho-
more architects at the Michigan Union on
January 12. The music was rendered by
Fisher's orchestra, and all of the numbers
were well received by those present. The
specialty of the evening was the ukelele
and hula sketch by Cohen and Adams.
Professors Boynton and McConkey were
the chaperons. Dancing continued from
9:00 till 1:00 o'clock. Charles Norton,
Harold Kiefer, and Adolph Martz com-
prised the committee.
Art Exhibit
Paintings by faculty of the Architectural
College occupied the most prominent places
in the Ann Arbor Art Association exhibit
held in Alumni Memorial hall during the
week of March 19th.
The "Huron River" and "Memories of
Night." by Mr. E. H. Barnes show the
artists' skill in the use of light and shade.
"Winter Afternoon" also by Mr. Barnes
has won prizes throughout the country.
A series of paintings was contributed by
Mr. Makielski representing Notre Dame
at different times of day and season. The
new idea in art was represented by his
"October." Mr. Barnes and Mr. Makiel-
ski are both skilled in depicting Nature
and outdoors.
A large collection of etchings was ex-
hibited, including the artists Zom, Rem-
biant and Haden.
Other paintings of especial not were the
portrait of himself by Seymour Haden,
Worrited by Richeton and the water color
collection by Miss Alice L. Hunt of the
Literary College.
State Board Exams
The State Board for the Legislation of
Architects will hold their Spring examina-
tions on the nth, 12th and 13th of April.
A bill is before the Legislature for
$250,000 for an addition to the Engineer-
ing building to take care of the College of
Architecture, the Surveying school and
possibly the department of Automobile
Engineering. It is undecided as yet how
the appropriation will be expended if ob-
tained.
Notes
Fred Strauss has accepted a position
with L. J. Heenen, an architect of Pon-
tiac, Michigan.
We are glad to note that Bob Miller is
back with us this semester.
P. O. Davis acted on the J-Hop Com-
mittee for the junior architects.
Warren L. Rindge is at present with an
architectural firm of Lansing, Michigan.

PROFESSOR J. B. DAVIS.
/ Will.
"I am always gratified to find myself
wrong, because I would like to be right,
or to be set right."
To most of the Alumni it is unnecessary
to reveal the author of the above and many
other similar bits of homely philosophy.
Prof. J. B. Davis, '68, is one of Michigan's
"Grand Old Men," who was eulogized
February 4, 1917, at the annual meeting of
the Chicago Engineers' Club, composed of
Ann Arbor graduates. Because of the fact
that Prof. Davis and Mrs. Davis are
spending the winter in Braidentown,
Florida, he was unable to accept the in-
vitation to the banquet. It was followed
by speeches from President Bibbins, '99,
and Prof. Johnston, '95, after which "Poet"
Hatch delivered an unusually appropriate
composition in meter. They are printed
herewith.
Mr. Clarence T. Johnston,
Ann Arbor. Mich.
Dear Mr. Johnston:
After having fun with Chairman Bib-
bins for confusing Prof. Davis and St.
Paul (the apostle not the city), I let my
imagination travel with Hatch, the poet,
to the drawing room in which he sat with
J. B. and listened to him talk about things
contemporary including the gowns of the
girls; and then I described that drawing
room, which was at the same time study
and bedroom and dining room and kitchen,
built in the corner of a snake rail fence
and occupied by the revered professor dur-
ing the early years of his college life. I
told it as though I were a contemporary
(which the report of the Chicago Engi-
neers makes me out to be!), of his ar-
rival in Ann Arbor; the building of the
shack in the fence corner, through the
kindness of Mr. Baldwin, on the outskirts
of the orchard which bordered on the old
fair ground, and where the new tenant
v\as probably permitted to draw freely on
the supply of fruit which was gathered by
others without permission; that the daugh-
ter of the house evinced a certain sympa-
thetic interest in the young student,
brought him baked apples for his break-
fast on occasion and finally married him
cr he married her and then he was on
Easy Street, where he has resided more or
less ever since.
I referred to Prof. Johnston's statement
that the "old professor" was always ex-
tremely modest and preferred to travel on
his merits rather than on his position. I
illustrated this with an incident in con-
nection with the '79 engineers' camp at
Unadilla. The professor had preceded the


5i
boys to make arrangements for the camp
location and cooking and was known to
the neighbors throughout the season only
as "the old man who was sent out to put
up the tents." He never had told them
that he was the professor in charge and
many of them do not know it to this day,
except that he was invited with the boys
when the festivities were given in their
honor by the natives.
As bearing on his companionability and
wholesome nature, the following is inter-
esting: During the progress of the camp
work the professor spent his odd mom-
presence of the professor with "his wife
and little son," then an infant in arms. But
the good old professor said gruffly and
with a prefatory grunt, "Do not spoil a
good joke for relation's sake," and the
song was sung to the plaudits of the com-
munity and the "old man" himself.
This, I think, covers the gist of my re-
marks concerning the professor. Many
of his wise saws and his kindnesses to me
and to others of the boys remain in my
memory as warm and glowing spots.
Yours very truly,

later was used in the neighboring lakes to
help the surveying; and then was used as
a means of transportation for the profes-
sor and his family and his goods through
the lakes down the Huron to Ann Arbor.
Just about this time "The Old Ark" with
the refrain of "Dc Ole Ark's A-moverin',
A-moverin' Along," was very popular with
the students. I paraphrased the words of
this song so as to put "Massa Davis" in
place of "Massa Noah" and had Massa
Davis and his son go to work upon the
timber while "the boys began to laugh and
Unadilla point the finger." On the occa-
sion of the reception to the boys by the
villagers I was asked to sing this song
but appeared a bit diffident because of the
FOUND: A MAN
Guests and Fellow Graduates:
This hour, I think more than any other,
in our pleasant if only occasional asso-
ciation brings back memories of those
other days of work and hope and play now
gently fading into indistinctness, but los-
ing nothing of their beauty or strength or
inspiration. And the presence of these
familiar faces tonight as those of honored
guests, rather than as the heartless task-
masters of the other days, to me seems
only to heighten the coloring of the
thought-picture that recreates the shaded
groves and hallowed spots of old Ann Ar-
bor town.
I have often mused over the thought


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
that this subtle bond of understanding be-
tween those who go out from the halls of
learning is a fact and not a fancy. Many
of us are strangers to each other and yet
we come in increasing numbers or height-
ened enthusiasm to these college gather-
ings. What is the reason? I found that
reason last June in journeying back again
to the well remembered scenes of the days
when a youth finds himself; when you and
I found out the kind of stuff that other
men are made of. Or to say it in more
elegant terms—when we found that there
is an inward ethical principle behind the
outward life of every man, however rough
—a desire for knowledge, for higher things,
aspiration, ideality.
No doubt these sentiments have been ex-
pressed numberless times before by num-
berless speakers and in more romantic
phrases, but I venture them again—because
they are the truth.
There is a pleasant vista at the south-
east corner of the old campus, through the
pleasantly shaded archway of a building
known to all of us as the birthplace of our
major selves. I invite you to go with me
to that spot and let your vision recreate
the scene on a certain day in June. There
stands a group clustered within and about
the archway with earnest faces and bared
heads. In the center stands an old man
speaking in the slow and measured phrases
of experience and emotion—speaking in ap-
preciation of another, whose familiar pres-
ence is now no more except as enshrined
in the chaste bronze tablet that adorns
the wall of the archway.
These two men always seemed to me as
far apart in personal characteristics as the
antipodes. One—strong and rugged as the
sturdy oak; the other—gentle and soft-
spoken as a young girl. Could these men
have anything in common I used to hear
them talking about each other, good-na-
turedly, of course. Yet here on this lovely
June morning stood the one speaking about
the other, but now only of words of af-
fection. Bareheaded, heavy-eyed, some-
what stooped, the corners of his mouth
drooping, his big heavy voice shaking from
excess emotion, he spoke words that had
always seemed to me foreign to his lips.
But they were not. And I fancied I saw
a furtive tear trickling down the wrinkled
and gnarled cheek as the sober words came
like tidal waves from the great heart of
the boundless deep—slowly, solemnly, but
full of the strength and conviction, born of
years of association with men, young and
old, good, bad, and indifferent, during
which the man had formulated his life-
philosophy.
Listen to them:
"'Whatsoever things are true; whatso-
ever things are honest; whatsoever things
are pure; whatsoever things are lovely;
whatsoever things are of good report,' we
are here this day to honor by the testi-
mony of our presence."
Why need I say more of this man, who
could say these things of other men? Now,
we know him. We have looked into his
heart and found—a true man. Unknow-
ingly he has held up the mirror to the
other, only to find therein—his own face,
and as he stands there on the Great
Threshold and speaks his simple words of
hope and life and aspiration. Instantly
there comes to my mind, the composite
portrait of some venerable and well loved
poet, like Joaquin Miller or Whitman.
These words typify the man's utter sim-
plicity, dogged determination, uncompro-
mising integrity, abounding faith in him-
self, in his profession and in the love of
humanity and his God. To younger men
he is a myth—almost—simply an educator
who has served his time and gone his way.
But is that all? What does it mean to be
an educator? Here are his own views
(speaking of the other man):
"He was a teacher, a worthy member
of that great company which is charged
with the preservation and peace of man-
kind. A college should make men and
women out of boys and girls and good
citizens of both. The responsibilities of
teachers are so great there may be grave
doubts if any of them would have been
willing to assume the burden in the be-
ginning, could they have understood what
they were entering upon. So are the great
labors of our lives shielded from our fears


53
by our lack of experience. In our igno-
rance we enter boldly, and in the buffeting
of experience find strength to master our
fears. Having borne such responsibilities,
the worthy teacher may rightfully be hon-
ored.
If the teacher is really worthy he will
be honored in the memories of his stu-
dents. He will be honored by the influ-
ence of his life which these students will
pass on to the succeeding generation. He
will be honored by the regard and esteem
of his colleagues. He will be honored by
his college and especially by his own life,
by his work and his sense of duty well
done. No one can measure his work, his
worth, his influence or his life. And when
the soothing touch of the gentle angel
comes—we can follow him no farther—
not yet; but we need not forget."
These words are not my words, they are
his. I simply turn the mirror around
again, that he may find portrayed in
equally tender remembrance—himself. To
you I can only echo the words—
"We need not forget."
Some time ago I happily stumbled across
an unpublished fragment of Walt Whit-
man's "Passage to India," that famous
epic poem, idealizing the work of the en-
gineer, the architect and the naviagtor as
represented in the completion of the Suez
Canal and the Union Pacific R. R. This
consummation of the dream of the ages—
Passage to India—the poet likened to the
ultimate fulfilment of man's highest devel-
opment and aspirations. The words re-
flect so clearly the spirit of the present
occasion that I am going to propose them
in a toast to our absent guest, who is ever
honored and ever welcome—Professor
Emeritus Joseph Baker Davis.
Joy! shipmate! joy!
For now the long, long anchorage we
leave.
Our ship is clear at last—she leaps
She swiftly courses from the shore—
Joy! shipmate! joy.
Soon, soon we breathe the breezes—
Soon, soon we sail the sea,
The sea of Freedom, Time and Space—
The all expanding sea.

Clarence T. Johnston
The Technic of 1891 contains an ex-
cellent article by the late Professor Mark
W. Harrington, on the early life of Pro-
fessor J. B. Davis. Professor Davis had
been teaching for a period of nineteen
years when this brief biography was pre-
pared. He continued his university activi-
ties until 1910. During the last five or six
years of his work in the College of Engi-
neering he was Associate Dean.
While teaching he was always engaged
in practice. He was city engineer of Ann
Arbor for many years; he installed water
works for a number of towns; he was
consulting engineer for railroads and he
has always been the leading authority of
the country on land surveys. He has never
solicited work and never requested special
recognition. He has written but little for
publication, because he has been engaged
in work that he has considered of greater
importance and also because he always un-
derestimated his ability as an author. He
remained as a junior of the American So-
ciety of Civil Engineers from 1874 to
1898,—the time record, undoubtedly. He
showed the same characteristics in dealing
with university authorities. He always
made his wants known. His addresses were
in plain terms. If his requests were not
granted, he accepted the situation and con-
tinued his work as usual. He gave much
in the way of time and money to carry on
work that was not fully supported by the
university. He never complained and he
has said so little that we have but scant
evidence of his personal sacrifice in this
direction.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
He always felt keenly his personal re-
sponsibility to students. The estimate of
others regarding him or his work never
seemed to interest him. He had enough to
do when he had cared for the students who
came to him. There was never a time, day
or night, when he could not be consulted.
Students who were so fortunate as to
have troubles, always found in Professor
Davis a sincere friend, an able councellor
and a fatherly adviser. Such students dis-
covered that engineering is something
more than an applied science.
While Professor Davis startled the
freshman by his plain talk and deep voice,
he had the confidence of the sophomore
and the love of the senior. Some years
after graduation we begin to have a better
idea as to relative values and we then turn
back to the grand old man who, in college
days, asked us if we wore rubbers; who
told us, when we accidentally broke win-
dows, that the janitors were employed for
the main purpose of replacing them; who
always insisted that theory be sacrificed to
horse sense; who quoted from Josh Bill-
ings, saying, "It is better not to know so
many things than it is to know so many
things that are not so. You can find eight-
een men who can tell you how to do a
thing where you can fir.d one who can do
it;'' who said, "You may not understand
what I tell you now. but some day when
you are plodding along with your transit
on your back it will become plain in an in-
stant;" and who, in reviewing a new text
on surveying, and explaining its short-
comings to the class, said frequently.
"Write on the margin, 'not plain to J.
B. D.'"
He has quit active work. He is happy
and well. He spends much time in writing
autograph letters to his former students.
He owns a little paradise on the shore of
Portage Lake, eighteen miles northwest of
Ann Arbor, where he works and plays.
Last fall some visitors at his cottage no-
ticed a number of juvenile books on a
table. When asked if he had become in-
terested in this kind of literature, he re-
plied, "No, those are for some boys who
come to play with me at times." His
great days are those that record the visit
of some former student. His hearty wel-
come, his enthusiastic and sincere personal
interest and his homely philosophy recall
memories of those days when he would
ignore, for a time, the theory of surveying
or descriptive geometry to make a prac-
tical illustration, or those evenings at camp
when we gathered in front of his tent to
hear him talk of his days in the woods,
on the plains or at sea.
His conversation and his letters would
be recognized anywhere by his former stu-
dents. Here are a few "crotchets," as he
styles them:
"A college is to make men out of boys
and good citizens out of those men."
"The old Kentucky dictum for raising
boys is, 'learn to ride and shoot and speak
the truth.'"
After helping some sailors launch a boat
on the Gulf coast a few years since, he
wrote Dean Cooley, "By this little observa-
tion, I discovered three things,—a tackle
may be back rove, a rope has two ends
and I am a wooden-headed old galoot."
A postscript at the end of a long letter:
'This is to certify that I, J. B. Davis, in
my own proper person, myself, have read
through the whole of the above writing
and that any other person who may do the
same has my earnest sympathy and heart-
felt commisseration."
MICHIGAN ENGINEERING SOCIETY
WOULD LICENSE CIVIL
ENGINEERS
Alumni of the Engineering College took
an active part in the program of the thirty-
eighth annual meeting of the Michigan En-
gineering Society at Saginaw, January 16-
18, 1917.
A bill providing for the licensing of per-
sons practicing civil and other branches of
engineering pertaining to civil engineering
in the State of Michigan was discussed and
unanimously approved.
The bill is comparatively brief. but com-
plete in its scope, and according to the
success of similar bills in other States, par-
ticularly Wyoming, it will cause a marked


55
improvement in engineering work if adopt-
ed. The bill in detail appears elsewhere in
this issue. Prof. C. T. Johnston, '95, is
largely responsible for the measure, being
chairman of the Committee on Legislation
for the Society. Mr. R. D. Goodrich, '03,
is also on that committee.
Manley Osgood, '11, City Engineer of
Ann Arbor, presented a paper on the "Sys-
tem in the City Engineer's Office." An-
drew Lenderink, '08, City Engineer of
Kalamazoo, read a paper on "The Method
of Making Assessments for Paving. Sew-
ers, Sidewalks and Other Improvements."
Prof. Wniiam C- Hoad, of the Civil En-
gineering Department, W. F. Walker, '14,
Sanitary Engineer, Detroit, and D. W.
Bingham, '13, Assistant Sanitary Engineer.
Lansing, took part in a discussion on "The
Water Supply Problem."
Prof. H. H. Atwell, '03, of the Surveying
Department, read a paper on "Town, City
and Village Plats."
Mr. R. D. Goodrich, Manager of Public
Utilities, Ypsilanti, took the topic, "Li-
censing of Engineers," for his paper, and
spoke in favor of the bill.
Prof. Johnston, Head of the Surveying
Department, also presented a paper en-
titled, "Drainage, A State Business," in
which he dealt with the present defects in
our drainage system and their remedy. We
hope to publish this paper in the near
future.
George H. Knutson, '08, Engineer, Jack-
son, Michigan, read a paper on the "Sixty-
Foot Hydro-Electric Development on the
Chippewa River, Wisconsin, Now under
Construction." He concludes the list of
Michigan graduates who took part in the
program.
The next annual meeting will be held in
Grand Rapids and there is a possibility that
the one after that will be held in Ann
Arbor.
HUBBELL PLANS BIG PROJECT
A sixteen million dollar sewer system,
which will eventually take care of a popu-
lation of two million six hundred thousand
people, has just been planned for Detroit,
Michigan, by Clarence "vV. Hubbell, '93Er
now City Engineer for Detroit. Mr. Hub-
bell recently had charge of the investiga-
tion of the pollution of Detroit River
water and recommends as a part of the
new sewer system, three purification plants.
It is thought that inadequate sewerage fa-
cilities has been one of the retarding
factors in home building and that the
housing congestion will be relieved as soon
as the new sewer can be pushed into the
newly annexed territory adjacent to De-
troit.
The system itself will consist of three
main "interceptors" which will traverse the
city diagonally, to the natural slope, and
all the trunk line sewers surrounding will
empty into these. There will be a total of
five hundred miles of sewer when entirely
completed, forty-four miles of which are
to be installed in the coming season. It
will take five years to build the whole sys-
tem. The sewage will be treated by reduc-
tion. Six millions of the entire expendi-
ture is charged to the three reduction
plants.

J. H. Walker, engineer in the Distribu-

Company, Detroit, presented a paper be-
fore the American Society of Heating and
Ventilating Engineers at their recent an-
nual. meeting in New York. The subject
was, "The Transmission of Steam in a
Central Heating Plant."
Due to the rapid development of the
down-town district, the connection of many-
new buildings and the extension over a
wide area of the heating service, the old
steam pipe system became entirely inade-
quate. The paper deals with the manner
in which this problem was overcome.
Twelve inch feeder pipes were installed
which transmitted steam under high pres-
sure to the center of load. This is
analogous to the method used in electrical
distribution.
In connection with this work Mr. Walker
mentions some tests that were made by
the Central Heating Company with a view
to checking the actual capacity of a pipe
against the figures computed from the
formula of Unwin. It was found that the
computed quantities were much less than
the actual observed quantities. These tests
were not of sufficient scope to warrant a
revision of the formula, but plainly showed
the necessity for further research.

following notes, especially the letter from
F. W. Zinn.
We hear that Thomas D. Hays, Detroit
Engineer for E. F. Houghton Co., Phila-
delphia, "is not yet married, but is favored
with glimpses of that blissful state by being
invited out to Max Wises once in -a while.
Maxwell Wise, '14, has long been a suc-
cessful husband and in addition is forging
to the front in the Studebaker Co."
Walter A. Erley is now associated with
Walter B. McLaughlin, member of the De-
troit Stock Exchange. He is specializing
in public utility bonds, and is manager of
the Partial Payment department. "Walt"
reports that if his income continues to in-
crease at the present rate, he may soon get
himself five gallons of gasoline and a Ford.
Edward S. Marks, Jr., Instructor in Penn
State College, deserted the ranks of the
"free and easy" on December 26, 1916,
when he was married to Miss Flora E.
Bartlett.
Arthur L. Sloman is now acting city
manager of Albion, Mich.
Stewart L. Ferguson is in charge of the
property accounts relating to steam plant
equipment of the Detroit Edison Co. Mr.
Ferguson's work is part of a new system
adopted recently by the Edison Co., where-
by a continuous inventory of their entire
property is kept at all times.
Victor DesRoches has left the Wells
Manufacturing Company of Fon-du-Lac,
Wisconsin, to become consulting engineer
for the D. M. Ferry Co., Detroit. He has
designed an automatic seed package filling
machine which acts with almost human in-
telligence. The job would have driven
anyone but Vic to a padded cell.
Mr. DesRoches also secured patents on
a rectifying commutator, designed to rec-
tify the current on a Ford magneto so that
the current may be used in connection with
a storage battery for lighting and starting
purposes.
Frederick W. Zinn has been with the
French Army since graduation, and after
recovering from injuries received on the
battle front at Verdun, was placed in the
aviation corps. He writes, "My entree is
below. This address is supposed to be
permanent, but I have a feeling that it is
going to change shortly to one that won't
be reachable by any post. If the weather
clears tomorrow expect to make some
sorties on a new machine, a little surprise
for William II, which hasn't as yet made
its debut on the front. It is equipped with
one of your rotten American motors and
I think that we are going to be in for
some exciting times." The address given
is Aviator-Observator, Groupe des Esca-
drilles, S. P. 92A, par B. C. M., Paris,
France.
1915
George F. Prussing, Room 1122, 112 IV.
Adams St., Chicago, III., Secretary.
Leonard B. Orloff, President and Gen-
eral Manager of the Leonard B. Orloff Co.,
Inc., distributors for the Mitchell car in

David Stott, the miller. Their honeymoon
was spent in a trip through the Eastern
States. Send congratulations to 421 Vir-
ginia Park, Detroit.
Edward J. Smith, formerly superintend-
ent for the Marshall Furnace Co., Mar-
shall, Mich., has left that company to enter

Lewis C. Wilcoxen writes us that he is
new assistant engineer on a large sugar
plantation at La Romana, Dominican Re-
public.
Warren B. James has recently left the
Ste. Marie Falls Canal to become bridge
inspector for the Michigan Central R. R.
His address is 763 Cass Ave., Detroit.
L. F. Merritt, who was production man-
ager for the Detroit City Gas Co., has
joined the engineering staff of the Stand-
ard Fuel Appliance Company, 1267-1269
Beaufait Ave., Detroit. The company spe-
cializes in heat treating furnaces and his
past experiences with the Ford Motor Co.,
the Steere Engineering Co., and the Gas
Co., will aid him considerably in the new
position.
Jay H. Schmidt, formerly Transitory
Slants Editor for The Technic, writes:
"I am now a full fledged editor—of the
enclosed merrie sheet which is distributed
(gratis) to all employees of the National
Carbon Co., who can read English." The
'merrie' sheet is "The Carbon News," pub-
lished at Cleveland, Ohio. It is an excel-
lent little paper, and contains the same snap
and clean-cut humor that characterized
Jay's Technic contributions. The follow-
ing is another quotation from his letter:
"Mr. Uhl M. Smith, now with the Ban-
ner Works of the National Lamp Co., at
Youngstown, Ohio, was in town over
Christmas, visiting friends. We histed a
few for old time's sake. U. M. has a swell
job, is a foreman, and has charge of eight-
een more or less ravishing beauties. He
says that Bert Standerline, '15E, Harry
Hooper, '15E, and Torchy Watson, '16E,
are also in Youngstown and they reunion-
ize with extreme oftness." U. M. Smith,
it will be remembered, was our circulation
manager during his senior year.
Sidney Steen has entered the employ of
D. L. Seymour &amp; Co., stock and bond
brokers, with offices at 50 Penobscot Bldg.,
Detroit, Mich.
Howard H. Phillips and Arthur Burrell
have both resigned their positions with the
City Engineer of Ann Arbor to start work
with the Ingersoll Rand Co., of Painted
Post, N. Y.
George Guy and David Ruxton have also
connected themselves with the above com-
pany.
William Weltner, civil engineer, writes
that he has just completed a survey of the
farm and grounds of the State Hospital at
Traverse City and made a map of the
whole thing, about 880 acres. He is now
engaged in surveying the underground wa-
ter, sewer and gas pipes to complete the
map. Address, 819 Randolph St., Traverse
City, Mich.
Arthur G. Plankel is now a barber and
at the same time in the real estate business
at 2090 Woodword Ave., Highland Park,
Mich. This is another proof of the broad-
ness of the training given by the Engineer-
ing College.
THE BYGONE DAYS
A Picture of the Boyhood Days of Prof. J. B. Davis
JAMES N. HATCH, '92
Come let us gather 'round the hearth and talk about old times,
That fill the vistas of the past with memory pantomimes,
And let's forget that times have changed and spend an hour or so
With recollection's clock turned back as far as it will go;
Then we will see the old log house among the sheltering trees,
And hear the tinkling cow-bells, and feel the gentle breeze,
And with our hearts once more attuned to those old days of yore,
We'll catch the pleasant melodies which memory holds in store.


And we will live again that life of three-score years ago,
Among the shaker bonnets and the printed calico,
Where the morning-glories smiled afresh to greet each waking day,
And neighbor bowed to neighbor in the old familiar way;
And strife was not a watchword, for each one by his toil
Brought forth an honest living from the product of the soil,
And rivalry was then employed to enlighten and amuse
With singing schools and husking bees and wedding barbecues.
And in our mental visit we'll pass the old stone mill
That stood beside the covered bridge, and no doubt stands there still.
Where the grape-vine trails along the fence and drapes the dying tree,
And the Katydids are practicing their wondrous symphony;
And at the toll-gate just beyond which no one dared to spurn,
We'll give the silver sesame that made the hinges turn,
And pause beside the tavern to see the stage-coach load,
And hear the driver's wondrous tales he's gathered on the road.
And in the evening as of old beside the candle light,
We'll read aloud the paper that came each Thursday night,
And learn that the Atlantic had won immortal praise
By making her last trip across in just eleven days;
And read about the wonders that Barnum had to show,
With Jenny Lind and Thomas Thumb and the man from Borneo;
And marvel at the various things the paper advertises,
From baking tins and wayside inns to lists of lottery prizes.
O those are pleasant memories that come across the years,
Where time has smoothed the rough spots out and wiped away the tears,
Where Summer days are balmy and Winter days are bright,
And the terrors all forgotten that worried us at night;
For troubles that looked mountain high now look so very small,
And most of those which looked the worst did not exist at all,
For when we ciphered all our sums and each day did our best,
We found the double-rule-of-three no harder than the rest.
We'll thus recall the pictures of that good old long-ago,
When the shadows all are softened by a mellow after-glow,
And the friends who come to meet us smile a kind familiar smile,
With their hands outstretched to greet us in the good old-fashioned style,
And midst all the old surroundings and kind memory for our guide
With the clouds of half-a-century gently wafted to one side,
We will don again youth's vesture and live awhile today
In those early recollections that will never fade away.


ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
By Mle. Mameyelle de Tausi
Dear Ed.: For three weeks Eve received
no check from my father. He calls him-
self a kind pater. Pray, what sort of kind-
ness do you call this?—Stude.
Answer: Unremitting kindness.
Dear Ed.: How can the principle that
two bodies cannot occupy the same place
at the same time be illustrated?—Algy, '20.
Answer: Easy,—open a window and
when the wind blows in the lights go out.
Dear Ed.: When rain falls,
does it arise again?—L. T. G.,
Answer: In dew time.
how soon
'18E.
Lady—Did that last nickel I gave you go
for beer?
Weary Walter—Not alone, mum, I went
for beer and took it along.
A senior engineer leads a strenuous life,
even his corduroys.
TOO MUCH FOR ANY GIRL
Jay—What's the matter, old pal? You
look sick.
Hopper—I am sick. Just gone through
a blamed serious operation. Had my allow-
ance cut.
"May I see father's record "asked a
new student. "He was of the class of '76."
"Certainly, my boy, what for?"
"He told me when I left him not to dis-
grace him, sir, and I wish to see how far
I can go."
BUT SOMETHING ELSE MIGHT
HAVE
Captain to retreating private—Coward,
will you run? Remember, your country is
watching you.
Private—Y-y-y-yes, but my country can't
see a h of a lot through this smoke.
Soph.—Do you realize what an import-
ant factor the wheelbarrow has been to
Irish education?
Fresh—No.
Soph.—Why, fool, it taught Irishmen to
walk on their hind legs.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
QUITE RIGHT
Co-Ed.—That's quite a scar you have,
Will.
Student—Oh, no, it's next to nothing.
Joe—Why is he so criminally inclined?
Jim—He was born on a rainy day and
everything he touches is mist.
ARE THEY NOT ALWAYS RIGHT?
She—John, is it proper to say this 'ere,
that 'are?
He—Why no, of course not.
She—Well, I don't know whether it is
proper or not, but I feel cold in this ear
from that air.
Prof.—You are getting awful stupid
these days when you can't multiply.
Aroused Student—I shouldn't be sur-
prised. They say that fools multiply very
rapidly these days.
OH! UNWISE FRESHMAN!
A freshman hesitates on the words, "con-
noisseur."
Prof.—What would you call a man that
pretends to know everything?
Fresh—A professor.—Ex.
YES; AND HERE'S ONE WORSE
THAN THAT!
Sweet Thing (at football game)—Oh,
those poor fellows—rolling on the ground.
How will they ever get clean?
'20 (very green)—Huh, what do you
think our scrub team is for, anyway?—
Polyana.
CLOSE TO THE WALL
"Ivy, why don't you cling to me?"
He cried in whispers thick;
"Oh, Archibald, I will," she said,
"I think that you're a brick."
—Widow.
AFTER THE J-HOP
Joe—Cheer up, old man. There's just as
good fish in the sea as was ever caught.
Jim—Perhaps there are; but what's a
fellow to do when he is out of bait?
She—Why do you paint the insides of
chicken coops?
He—To keep the hens from picking the
grain out of the wood."—Polyana.
Fresh—When
come a bird?
Senior—H'uh,
Fresh—When
Oo—00—h!
does a married man be-
when does he?
a married man comes
home at three in the morning, don't his
wife make him quail?—Life.
HONEST, DON'T READ THIS ONE
Heard in the Engineering Society Rooms
— (Mourners' Bench):
Nuts—Have you noticed how broken up
Blinks looks since the Hop?
Bolts—He has a good reason. He can't
stand capital punishment any better than
the rest of US.
Nuts—How did he come to get capital
punishment?
Bolts—Why, he took a Washington girl
to the Hop.
AND YET THEY CALL IT A JOKE
You have probably heard the story that
in a suburb of Chicago there is a moving
picture show which charges 5 cents or a
potato for admission, but up in Northern
Michigan they go 'em one better.
There is a saloon where you can get a
beer for a potato, and if it is an extra
large one you get three beans in change.
He—J'cver hear that joke about the
mistletoe?
She—Are you sure it's not over my head?

Tightwad: She must dislike flowers; be

CIVIL ENGINEERING
CLARENCE T. JOHNSTON
THE PRACTICE of civil engineer-
ing is under government regula-
tion in nearly every country but our
own. The American engineer who
goes to Canada or Mexico finds that
he must qualify before he can practice.
Practically all of the Latin-American
Republics and other foreign countries
permit the civil engineer to practice
only after he has proven his worth and
ability. As engineers we are imme-
diately interested in this apparently
novel attitude of government towards
a scientific profession. We cannot re-
main in Northern Italy, France or
Spain many weeks before we are con-
vinced that the civil engineer there
enjoys a real profession. He must
be educated and he must have experi-
ence before he is entrusted with the
most responsible duties. The burden
is thrown on him first. When he qual-
ifies, he receives protection that is un-
known in but few states of the United
States. Supervision of the practice of
civil engineering means public recogni-
tion of ability. Within a few years af-
ter a government becomes active in
this field the engineer obtains a place
in society and he becomes a factor in
government.
The United States stands alone
among the countries of the world in
one respect. It is governed by men
trained in law. This tendency has
gone so far that even our courts, which
were organized for a different pur-
pose, have entered the field of admin-
istration. It may be a limited admin-
istration and a necessary function in
the absence of a legally organized de-
partment under the executive branch
of government. The result of this ten-
dency is that branches of service,
which should be supported by an ad-
ministration based largely on science,
are impaired, in so far as efficiency is
concerned, by legal complications
which should not exist/
Where engineering is recognized by
the general government or by the
State, the administration of water re-
courses, including all the uses of wat-
er and the structures necessary to per-
fect such uses, are in the hands of en-
gineers. Drainage and irrigation works
are constructed and maintained by en-
gineers who have qualified for this
special field. The settlement of water
rights disputes goes to administrative
officers or boards rather than to the
courts. Highways, navigation canals,
state railways, telephone, telegraph
and other branches of transportation
and communication are under the con-
trol of administrative officers having
technical qualifications. Matters of
public health and public safety fall
into the same category.
The practicing engineer, under this
kind of government, is always able to
deal with public officers who can give
him information, who can furnish re-
liable advice regarding any feature of
the law that may relate to prospective
development and who can settle quick-
ly and justly any disputes that may
arise. Works of a public character
are carefully planned and executed.
The argument generally used to dis-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
courage law-makers when any reform
of this kind is suggested, is that the
state will be obliged to expend much
larger sums of money in support of
the necessary administration. The an-
swer to this is easily found. The tax-
payers foot the bills. Tax-payers are
concerned in matters of public im-
provement. Where engineering work
is done without engineering advice and
supervision, it is the tax-payer who
suffers. After a study of some six
years of the operation of the Michigan
drain law the writer can say that there
is enough loss of money each year in
litigation and other unnecessary ex-
pense to support a department of pub-
lic works for the state which could
have charge of nearly every technical
branch of public service in which all
of the people of Michigan are interest-
ed. Michigan has wasted much money
in highway construction. The State
Highway Department has saved
enough each year to support many
similar organizations and the results
accomplished in good roads and
bridges furnish us with abundant op-
portunity and cause for praising the
engineers in charge.
While we may have too many law-
yers in our legislative bodies, the en-
gineer of today is not likely to be a
successful candidate against any indi-
vidual who represents this class. We
frequently wonder why it is that the
engineer is forced to occupy a subor-
dinate position in many lines of work
where he should be a leader and in
which foreign engineers have an es-
tablished place. One prominent rea-
son for this unfortunate condition is
that the engineer has no standing un-
der the law. He is simply a hired
man. Even engineers raise the serious
question as to whether or not the en-
gineer has a profession.
Law-making bodies, as they are now
constituted, are not inclined to go out
of their way to recognize the engineer
until he manifests some concern in his
own welfare, and what is of more im-
portance, until he demands adequate
control and authority of the fields of
public service which his brethren of
foreign countries have administered
for many years. His interest in the
public welfare should be sufficient to
enlist his sympathy and support in any
move which has the latter object in
view. His pride of profession should
fully support his interest in any pro-
posed legislation which has for its ob-
ject the protection of the work of com-
petent engineers and legal recognition
of his field of activity.
The licensing of engineers is but a
step towards the proper and ultimate
recognition of capable engineering ser-
vice. The lawyer has enjoyed the pro-
tection of special enactments relating
to the practice of law for many years.
Whether or not selfish motives were
behind this legislation we need not dis-
cuss. The legislation in effect doubt-
less protects the public as fully as it
protects the practitioner. The physi-
cian obtained what recognition he has
received only after a struggle. Many
of the younger men of Michigan can
not remember the campaigns staged
by able physicians in efforts to protect
the public, and the able men of the pro-
fession also, from quacks and dishon-
est men. The dentist has followed the
experience of the physician. Only two
years ago the architects of the state
secured legislation which enables them
to lay a similar foundation. Other
classes, including barbers and under-
takers, have been able to obtain the
ear of law-makers for a sufficient peri-
od to demonstrate the wisdom of some


69
legislation which demands ability and
honesty in their particular line.
Today there is not a complete list
of the civil engineers of Michigan.
These men have never been brought
together by any common tie and they
have never had an opportunity to con-
sider, as a body, any of the important
policies which should vitally concern
them. The judgment of the engineer
stands alone among the various classes
which go to make up the citizenship
of the state. Engineers have minds
which analyze problems. They go to
any source for truth. They are not
bound by tradition or by precedent.
They discard the obsolete and accept
innovation only when worth is proven.
The influence of such men is sorely
needed in a state which is supported
by popular sentiment.
The Michigan Engineering Society,
which represents a part of the civil en-
gineering talent of the state, has be-
come interested in some of these prob-
lems which are not technical. The so-
ciety discusses matters of government.
It is concerned in the public welfare.
At the last meeting of the society,—
January of this year,—a brief meas-
ure was presented relating to the li-
censing of civil engineers. The provis-
ions of the measure were discussed
and when a motion was made accept-
ing the proposition in general and au-
thorizing the legislative committee to
request its consideration in the legis-
lature, there was no dissenting voice.
This beginning was so encouraging
that it seemed that rapid progress
might be made within the two or three
months that followed. When the pro-
posed legislation was considered at a
later date the question was immediate-
ly raised as to the attitude of the many
civil engineers who do not belong to
the Michigan Engineering Society and
the membership of that society not
present when the measure was dis-
cussed.
It seemed unwise to urge the intro-
duction of the measure until it could
be shown that it had the support of
practically every engineer in the state.
The Engineering Society is to print
many copies of the measure and to
furnish each member with several.
The members of the society are then
to be requested to confer with all civil
engineers of their own locality and to
have all submit suggestions and at the
same time to indicate their attitude as
to approval or disapproval of the gen-
eral scheme, leaving it to the commit-
tee to work out the best possible
measure when all suggesions are taken
into consideration.
But one state has had extended ex-
perience in this kind of legislation.
There, the engineer has a position that
is recognized. Each legislature con-
tains engineers among its members.
They are invaluable as law-makers.
The state maintains engineering de-
partments which have supervision of
all public works. These officers also
have something to do with the engi-
neer's license law. The law is uni-
formly supported. It has not injured
qualified men. Consulting engineers
from abroad have had no difficulty in
obtaining a right to practice. They are
inclined to support legislation which
is beneficial to the engineering profes-
sion.
The objects of a reasonable and just
license law are: (a) To lay a founda-
tion upon which a civil engineering
profession may rest; (b) To have a
public record of the training and ex-
perience .of each civil engineer who is
entitled to practice within the state;
(c) To protect every practitioner who


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
is of value to the community in which
he lives; (d) To provide a complete
list of the civil engineers engaged in
practice within the state; (e) To bring
all of these men together in one body
in so far as their support may be
needed on any question concerning
their profession or public business of
a civil engineering kind; (f) To
arouse their general interest in mat-
ters of government; (g) To enable
them to lend general support to the
engineering administration of the
state, and (h) To gradually obtain
control of all work in the field of the
civil engineer.
The object last stated may appear
of trivial importance or it may seem
to embrace something of selfishness.
This is not the case. No profession
can develop to the point where it en-
joys general respect until it is in posi-
tion to control the field it is presumed
to occupy. This respect can not be de-
veloped until the practice of civil engi-
neering is so regulated as to insure
the realization of the objects enumer-
ated above.

rnHE MANUFACTURE of the
*. enormous tonnage of shell steel
in the U. S. A. destined for Allied
Europe, has made necessary the main-
tenance of a small army of men to in-
sure the serviceability of the shell ma-
terial. The chemical and physical
properties, and the mechanical treat-
ment of the metal which guarantee this
serviceability must be carefully con-
trolled throughout the different pro-
cesses. The many problems arising
from the moment the ingot or casting
is poured and continuing through the
fracture, chemical, and physical ex-
amination, to the finished forging
ready for the machinist, furnish ma-
terial that is very interesting.
There are two forms in which the
steel is supplied to the users—the roll-
ed billet and the cast "slug." The lat-
ter is the one adopted by the foundries
which specialize in steel castings.
The slug has physical properties
which are, in general, peculiar to it as
compared with the steel billet on ac-
count of the lack of heat treatment
and mechanical working previous to
forging. These properties are high
tensile strength, low elongation and
failure due to segregate pockets. To
offset these peculiarities as much as
possible the chemical and mechanical
handling of the steel is important. It
is understood in the foundries that
best results are obtained by keeping
silicon relatively high, by using the in-
verted mold and a "hot top." The
mold is said to be inverted in contrast
to the usual method of casting large
ingots which when sufficiently cooled
have the iron mold stripped by pulling
it off from above. The "hot top" is
an extension on the top portion of the
mold. When the mold is poured full
this extension provides a reservoir of
liquid steel which supplies the lower
part of the casting as it gradually sol-
idifies and shrinks toward the outer
and more rapidly cooling walls. This
prevents a pipe from extending down
into the slug.
The steel billet rolled from the ingot
is the common method of supplying
steel for shells. It is rolled into a
gothic section and cut into multiple
shell lengths—usually three or four.
The furnaces used are of the open
hearth type, either acid or basic, from
which the ingot is poured. The mold
is provided with a hot top but is not
of the inverted type because the large
size of the ingot would require more
equipment and time in stripping it.
The advantage gained in the illimin-
ation of occasional voids in the cast-
ing is in this case not worth the cost
of extra machinery.
After the ingot has solidified suffi-
ciently to support itself it is placed in
a heating furnace called a "soaking
pit." This operation, lasting for the
proper length of time, makes certain
a uniform temperature through the
ingot before it is rolled. A want of
thoroughness in this soaking process
makes it impossible to work the steel
properly in the mill and defects pres-
ent to more or less extent in any cast-
ing cannot be suitably remedied in the
mechanical treatment.
Impurities and excess of the consti-


THE MICHIGAN TECHN1C
tuents which are alloyed and combined
with the steel, often segregate them-
selves partially from the iron or whol-
ly in pockets in the ingot. Scavengers
like aluminum and ferro carbon-titan-
ium have been used to drive out the
gaseous impurities, distribute locally
surplus elements in the steel, or bring
some of them to the top of the metal
On thk Loading Platform
in the ladle with the slag, but they can-
not be relied on entirely to right these
faults.
During the rolling process slag
pockets keep coming to the surface
and they are drawn out into a long
thin line. These cause cracks and laps
on the surface of the finished bloom
that must be chipped away with such
a radius to the chipping tool as to in-
sure no re-forming of the crack or lap
in the later forging. Rolling breaks
up large crystals in the steel, tends to
eliminate sponginess, and brings the
walls of voids together causing them
in most cases, unless coated with scale,
to weld. In general the rolling opera-
tion makes a more uniform quality of
material.
.After passing the blooming mill at
least 20% is discarded from the top
and 5% from the bottom or such an
amount above this that will make sure
the absence of piping in the steel.
The chemical analysis is usually
taken at the mill. The specifications
require it to be within the following
tolerances:
C Mn
40--S5 -5.S-1.oo
Si P s
.09 0.00-.035 0.00-.045
These limits in special cases may be
subject to change when the quality of
the material relative to its serviceabil-
ity can be proved satisfactorily by
physical tests.
The physical testing constitutes a
very good check on the quality of the
metal. It indicates whether the me-
chanical treatment and chemical com-
bination are producing the right re-
sults for the elastic limit and the ulti-
mate strength. The British inspection
department requires that the elastic
limit shall be above 19 T/sq. in. when
found by the drop-of-beam method, or
that at a load of 19 T/sq. in. a perma-
nent extension of not above 0.005 mcn
shall be allowed by the scribe-line
method or as measured by an extens-
ometer. The method used in check-
ing the yield point has not been stand-
ardized but varies in different locali-
ties.
The extension, if not too great, al-
though apparently permanent at the
moment the 19 T/sq. in. is released.

has been found in many cases where
the steel is sound, to be one that will
recover almost entirely in the course
of several hours. This phenomenon
indicates that the specimen may not
have reached the elastic limit although
an extension took place. This may be
two hours but with still no recovery.
The chemical analysis of these bars
showed percentage of Mn and Si
greater than those listed above. The
steel may have been burned in the
heating furnaces previous to forging

Specifications for the tensile strength
make the limits for the ultimate be-
tween 78,400 lbs./sq. in. and 109,760
lbs.. sq. in. The elongation after break-
ing is measured in a length of two
inches or such a piece as can be cut

ed round and for a length of two
inches have a diameter of 0.564 inches.
Best results are obtained for physi-
cal tests with carbon between .44 and
.49. everything else being equal. From
.40 to .44 results are liable to failure
in elastic limit and from .49 to .55 the
tests show failure frequently in a high
ultimate and low elongation. This in-
formation has been made use of by
the shell makers in their specifications
for steel in order to raise their produc-
tion to a maximum.
Until very recently three forging
plants in a Chicago district using hy-
draulic presses or steam hammers of
at least 700 tons capacity, produced
about 10,000 shells daily. These con-
sisted of both 8" and 9".2 shells
weighing 300 lbs. and 380 lbs. respec-
tively. These are shipped to Canada
and other points in the States for ma-
chining.

OF A LARGE AUTO CONCERN
FRITZ G. MARSTELLAR, '17E
IN OUR present age of commercial
competition, where the reputation
of a manufacturing concern is achiev-
ed and maintained by the superior
quality of its products perhaps more
than any other factor, it is of vital
importance to provide proper facili-
ties to ascertain with great accuracy
that the quality decided upon is con-
stantly coming up to standard require-
ments.
In the automobile industry for ex-
ample, to which the above statement
particularly applies, highest quality for
a reasonable price is invariably the
center of interest to most prospective
purchasers of motor cars. Since how-
ever, the reputation as to quality is de-
pendent upon satisfied customers,
which undoubtedly constitute the most
efficient and cheapest advertising de-
partment a company could have, it be-
comes evident that the maintenance of
that quality with only slight deviations
from a fixed price, represents the only
permanent basis of all financial suc-
cess. Obviously then, to combine both
a low price with high quality, necessi-
tates the adaption of the various intri-
cate processes to one standard pattern,
a plan which must be adhered to that
the cost may be reduced to a minimum.
And it is just exactly in this sense
that all of our large and successful au-
tomobile concerns, are so much like
one large, smooth-working automaton
which .turns out cars at a quantity,
quality and price, inconceivable only a
decade ago. During the rapid devel-
opment of the automobile industry, it
soon became apparent however, that
the uniformity of quality was of the
utmost importance. Consequently, the
maintaining and improving of that un-
iformity in production proved itself
to be a task of the two great sciences:
Physics and Chemistry. No longer
could the managing of such important
work be considered a side issue and
left to the care of untrained judgment.
The loss in hard dollars and cents,
arising directly but mostly indirectly
out of carelessness or happy guess-
work, proved to be too disastrous not
to justify more than fully the expense
of a trained corps of specialists con-
stantly in the employ of the company.
So it came to be that almost all mod-
ern motor-car concerns of any size
have today what is known as the Met-
allurgical Department. Where for a
small company it would represent an
expensive luxury, it is of great eco-
nomic benefit to the concern of large
magnitude, and clearly shows some of
the advantages it has in crushing its
small rival.
This general term "Metallurgical
Department" includes three distinctive
sub-divisions, namely, the Department
of Metallography, making its chief
occupation to study and control the
endless properties of metals by dictat-
ing the various methods of treatment.
There are then the Chemical and
Physical Laboratories, all of which
must cooperate effectively toward the
common end.
Resides these three distinct branch-
es, there are several small groups of


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
which for example that of pyrometry
and the measurement of high tempera-
tures deserve mention. Naturally, it
is its duty to investigate and supervise
as accurately as is possible with hu-
man limitations the electrical control
of the many heat treating furnaces
and to see that the all important con-
stancy and corrections of the different
temperatures required, is being main-
tained. Extremely delicate recording
that there is left no opportunity for
original work and research in the en-
deavor to both better and cheapen the
methods as well as the quality and
functions of the many details them-
selves out of which a car consists.
On the contrary, large sums of mon-
ey are generously spent not only to
keep abreast of the times but to be
ahead in the merciless game of indus-
trial rivalry.
Experimental Electrical Heat-treating Furnaces
instruments, located in the office of
the man in charge, which may be
blocks away from the furnaces and
enameling ovens, print automatically
during all times the slightest variation
in temperature. In this manner there
is a constant check upon the various
heats required.
Besides the many routine tests
which necessarily have to be carried
on in the Metallurgical Department, it
would be an erroneous idea to assume
Among the routine tests of the
Chemical Laboratory there may be
mentioned the analysis of all incoming
ore and pig iron for sulphur, phos-
phorus, manganese, carbon and sili-
con, with a view of producing as uni-
form a cast as possible. Even the
leather is being tested in small electric
ovens heated from ioo°F. to 200°F. at
which temperature the leather must
not blacken a white cloth when rubbed
over it.

All fabrics are subjected to the wat-
er and weather tests. The gasolines
are most carefully compared and all
the different kinds of oils are tested
for viscosity, specific gravity, flash,
heat test (must not carbonize below
about 400°F.) free acid and cold test.
A great amount of work is being done
in investigating different kinds of oils
and grease. Without it the wheels of
industry would stop. Although for the
average layman grease is grease and
oil is oil, it has been my privilege to
realize the great importance of deter-
mining the right kind of oil or grease
to be used for particular purposes and
it is rather surprising to see what a
very wide difference exists among
them in properties even if all of them
undergo identically the same condi-
tions of test. Much research work is
being done especially along the lines
of heat treating, and also in finding
a perfect enamel for the motor cars.
Evidently, in the case of enamel great
difficulties present themselves in dis-
covering one of lasting qualities which
must retain its lustre and last but not
least have a temperature coefficient
identical with that of the metal which
is to be coated, since any perceptible
difference between them would cause
immediate cracking of the enamel.
Having had the opportunity to be-
come somewhat more familiar with
the workings of the Physical Labora-
tory, it might prove of general interest
to get a glimpse of a few of the more
important tests and testing machines
employed there.
First of all it is essential that we
should appreciate the industrial im-
portance of the physical properties
which iron and steel must possess, in
order to render them most suitable
for the specific purposes for which
thev are to be used. Where in one
case greatest hardness or ductility is
desirable, in another greatest softness
may be indispensable and it is in the
power of the Metallurgist to control
and modify the many influences of the
additional elements which we know
steel to contain as well as the effect of
the temperatures employed in treat-
ing it.
Space would not allow us to enter
this large subject extensively and we
will therefore consider in the form of
a rough outline only those physical
properties which are generally speci-
fied; namely the hardness values and
tensile strength. It is perhaps well to
call attention .to the fact that no single
property in iron or steel is of more
consequence than the degree of hard-
ness required. Die punches and cut-
ting tools are almost worthless unless
they be able to retain a sharp edge
while on the other hand where the
material must undergo further ma-
chining or cutting, even a compara-
tively small increase in hardness is
often the cause of much trouble and
expense.
Under the definition of hardness,
we understand the tendency of the
material to resist penetration and
abrasion while in a more general sense
a hard body is one which under prop-
er conditions, will readily penetrate a
softer material. However, as is well
known, there are in metals various
kinds of manifestations of hardness
depending entirely upon the character
of the stress to which the metal is be-
ing subjected. For example, placing
a material under a static load, will
lead to entirely different results than
where the penetrating body is moving
with a certain amount of velocity, and
the conditions are profoundlv modi-
fied.
In a laboratory of the kind men-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
tioned above, two typical instruments
which aid in controlling the produc-
tion of enormous quantities of motor
car parts in so far as having uniform
physical properties, are known as the
scleroscope, invented by Shore; and
the Brinnell press.
The former instrument consists es-
sentially of a very small piston of
steel carrying a diamond point and nor
weighing much more than two grams
which is enclosed in a glass tube with
graduations of arbitrary units. By
Electrolytic Separators
means of an ingenious arrangement,
the top of this glass tube is connected
to a rubber tube with a bulb in such a
manner that upon pressing the bulb
once by hand, the air forced up, causes
the little piston to ascend rapidly to
the top of the glass tube where it is
automatically held in position. Upon
a second pressure of the rubber bulb
it is suddenly released and falls at
right angles upon a little smooth sur-
face of the material to be tested.
vSince the diamond is probably the
hardest known substance and there-
fore any material being tested for
hardness causes the piston to rebound,
the hardness number is entirely deter-
mined bv the amount of this rebound.
For example, the rebound of hardened
steel varies from 140 to 180 millime-
ters, while the total height of fall is
in the neighborhood of ten inches or
about 254 millimeters. This little in-
strument is unique in that it combines
both reliability with considerable rap-
idity and has a wide field of practical
application.
The other test mentioned above, was
invented by the Swedish engineer, J.
A. Brinell. The test is founded upon
the fact the identation made upon a
substance by means of a spherical ball
carrying a known load, will cause an
impression in area inversely propor-
tional to the hardness of the metal to
be tested. Tables of hardness num-
bers have been constructed and these
numbers are deduced from certain
factors and coefficients. They are
however not intended to represent ab-
solute values of hardness, but rather
arbitrary, convenient and comparable
units which indicate simply the vary-
ing physical character of the different
materials. They comply more with
the need of commercial practice than
theoretically correct investigations.
Knowing the diameter of the im-
pression (which is measured by means
of a microscope having a micrometer
scale graduated in tenths of a milli-
meter) and the load, the working ex-
pression below has been derived for
constructing the table of hardness
numbers mentioned above. The ex-
pression is:
L
H =
*D/2(D — V£&gt;! — d')
when H = hardness number,
L — load in kg. (usually 3.000 for
iron and steel),
D = diameter of steel ball (10 mil-
limeters),
el = diameter of impression.


79
This expression is not to be consid-
ered scientifically accurate, since it
fails to take into account the mass of
material displaced but merely the su-
perficial area of the impression. A
few values taken from one of the
hardness tables might assist in convey-
ing a better impression to what re-
sults some typical values lead:

An instrument of much interest is
the gear impact testing machine shown
in the illustration. It has been origin-
ated by the research engineers of
a prominent physical laboratory
with the consistent view in mind of
finding some effective method of test-
ing gear teeth. Machines of a similar
nature have been in existence. but none
were capable of measuring the forces
at work unless elaborated devises were
resorted to. In principle the machine
is simple enough. By means of the
sprocket wheel shown the heavy
weight may be easily lifted from its
lowest position to the one shown in
the upper right hand corner. A lock
will automatically keep the weight in
this position until released by hand.
The gear to be tested is securely
held in position and a lever arm is ar-
ranged in such a manner that while
one end in the form of a double knife-
blade, is resting upon the tooth to be
cut off, the other end is struck by the
full force of the impact due to the
dropping weight. A semi-circular
graduated brass scale has a pointer
which is moved by the weight after
the tooth is cut. Obviously, the
F
Brinell Hardness Tester
amount by which this pointer is moved
is an indication of that part of the to-
tal kinetic energy of the weight which
was not consumed in the cut itself.
Knowing the weight, its height of fair,
the position of the pointer and certain
other constants, mathematical expres-
sions deduced from well known laws
of mechanics will tell us with a reason-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
able degree of approximation the work
done in cutting the teeth. This, of
course, would become only necessary
if we should be interested in the abso-
lute values more than the relative. For
example, if two similar gears, of sup-
posedly similar characteristics, would
show any great difference in the posi-
tion of the pointer, further investiga-
tion would be warranted.
Another most important of the
many vital instruments of a similar
to the strict specifications insisted
upon, a very compact electrolytic ar-
rangement has been devised to fulfill
this purpose. To determine accurately
the amount of copper and lead in any-
non-ferrous alloys received at the
plant is important. On the other hand,
to ascertain the amount of impurities
they contain is perhaps still more im-
portant. By means of electrolytic sep-
aration and deposition this task is re-
duced to great exactness. The elec-
S ho wing Application of Scleroscopb
nature is a 200,000 pound automatic
and autographic testing machine of
the Tinius Olsen type and is used for
compression as well as tension tests.
An autographic record may be taken
of either a tensile, compression or
transverse test since the machine is
provided with the latest autographic
apparatus which automatically records
the characteristic of the test and pro-
duces the stress-strain diagram.
In order to check and control the
brass and copper production of
foundries so that these come up
trodes are of platinum due to the
chemical immunity towards most acids
and chemical changes.
As a mechanical wonder worthy of
mention among the modern accurate
appliances is an automatic, auto-
graphic torsion testing machine in the
Physical Laboratory.
A similar machine was exhibited at
the San Francisco World's Fair and
was later sold to the Japanese Gov-
ernment by the Tinius Olsen Testing
Machine Company. The machine con-
sists of two heads,—a driving head


81
and a movable weighing head which is
supplied with a magnetic control
mechanism, operating the clutch of a
small continuous running motor. A
head screw running along the scale
beam and moving the poise, is con-
nected to the above mentioned clutch.
The slightest variation in load oper-
ates the proper magnetic circuit,
throwing in the clutch, rotating there-
by the head screw which moves the
poise until a temporary condition of
equilibrium has been re-established.
The driving head receives the power
from a 6 H. P. variable speed motor
and the reduction and regulation of
speed is so wonderfully developed that
the driving head can make 1/48,200
revolution for every revolution of the
motor when at its lowest setting.
A faint idea of the gigantic forces
which this machine is capable of de-
veloping may be gotten from the fact
that the maximum capacity of the
machine is 232,000 inch pounds which
is roughly equivalent to a load of
nearly 10 tons on a one foot lever
arm. To absorb this enormous turn-
ing moment a heavy concrete founda-
tion is the prerequisite where accurate
testing is expected.
Many other machines are present
for testing the various kinds of
springs, to carry on grease and oil
tests, to test self-starters, cast iron,
etc.
Space would prohibit the descrip-
tion even in a superficial manner, of
all the machines and tests, but it is
to be understood that the physical la-
boratory is one of the best equipped.
In the constant endeavor to determine
the causes of troubles and prevention
of their re-occurrence as well as im-
provement of many details, money is
no object.
SUBMARINES HAVE THEIR MOVEMENTS
OF WEAKNESS
A submarine always reveals her
presence to the seeing eye. If near
the surface, her periscope leaves the
betraying wake, and, even when she is
a hundred feet or more under water,
she always disturbs the surface in a
way that, to the experienced observer,
makes her presence known. The
watcher in an airplane quickly sees
such disturbances, even if the sub-
mersible is too far under the sea to be
seen itself.
But the important fact is that the
submarine spends most of her time on
the surface. The U-53's ability to sail
70 miles under water without rising is
regarded as a great achievement. Most
submarines, that is, cannot keep sub-
merged nearly so long. The reason is
that it has to come to the surface to
recharge its electric batteries. This
recharging is done by the oil engines,
which can work only on the surface,
because of the exhaust. In addition to
its other disadvantages, the recharging
process makes a noise that can be
heard five miles away. While under-
going this ordeal, the submarine is in
a helpless condition, and a well-aimed
shot, even from a small gun, such as
a motor boat can carry, can pierce its
thin steel plates and send it to the bot-
tom.— The World's Work.


R. H. ERLEY, 18E
IS THE engineer now going through
college getting the proper all-
around education that he needs?
Should there be more cultural sub-
jects? Here is what one senior says,
"The engineers turned out by this de-
partment are worse than ignorant and
narrow-minded. They know a little
about technical engineering but they
know absolutely nothing about apply-
ing that knowledge in the interest of
the community and the Nation. They
know nothing about government, of
people or of conditions in actual life.
They know nothing of what history
has taught the world. They don't know
how to think and they don't even
know that the big men arc big because
they are thinkers.
"I am spending my fourth year
studying engineering. If I can find a
way to do it, I am going to try and
come back next year and really learn
something."
Tbe occasion of the above opinion
was a blue book given unannounced
by Trof. John R. Allen to his class of
seniors in Heating and Ventilation, M.
E. 18. The class said that it was the
hardest exam, they had ever had.
Here are the questions.
1. (a) Name three prominent
German Authors.
(b) Name three prominent French
Authors.
(c) Name three prominent Eng-
lish Authors.
(d) Name three prominent Ameri-
can Authors.
2. Name the capital of each of the
following countries:—(a), Italy; (b),
Austria-Hungarv: (c), Roumania;
(d), Servia: '(e), Turkey; (f),
Greece; (g), Bulgaria; (h), Monte-
negro.
3. Name two generals of import-
ance in each of the following countries
now at war,—
England, France and Germany.
Name rulers of England, France,
Germany, Russia, Austria, Spain and
Italy.
4. (a) Name five prominent ar-
tists now dead.
(b) Name five prominent compos-
ers now dead.
(c) Name five prominent musi-
cians now living and give their in-
struments.
(d) Name your three favorite au-
thors.
5. If you had been allowed to sub-
stitute Philosophy, Sociology and His-
tory for Language, would you have
taken Language, and why?
Over eighty per cent of the class
"flunked."
On the first question there were
mentioned German authors such as
"Wm. Tell;" English authors such as
"Longfellow" and "Irving" and Amer-
ican authors from Longfellow to Jack
London. (Tom Lovell was also men-
tioned).
Out of the entire class of forty, only
six had the second question correct.
The Balkan States seemed to present
the greatest difficulty and were quite
mixed up. One paper gave Monte
Carlo as the capital of Montenegro.
Eight had both parts of the third
question correct and six were unable
to answer at all. One man still had
Edward the Third on the Throne of
England.
The fourth question was really en-


83
couraging. Ten had the first part
right, sixteen had the second part cor-
rect, while twenty-two received full
credit on the third. Two were unable
to name any prominent artists and
composers now dead. Most of the
prominent musicians now living took
part in the last two May Festivals
here. The vote on the favorite au-
thor stood.tie between Rudyard Kip-
ling and Jack London. Both received
eight votes. Charles Dickens and
Winston Churchill held second place
with five votes apiece, while Mark
Twain proved third choice. Ted Coy
and Bill Nye were also favorites, while
one man "liked Horatio Alger pretty
well." A couple of students said that
they had no favorite authors because
they had no time to read.
The last question brought the most
interesting results, the first paragraph
being one of its answers. Fifteen stu-
dents chose Language; seventeen,
Philosophy or History and one was in
favor of any Language but the Ger-
man. Here are a few "pros and cons"
on this subject: "I believe the lan-
guage courses are too uninteresting
and dry and as a result the average
student has trouble learning them."
"A man can read up on Philosophy,
etc., when he is out of school, but
class methods and every-day work are
necessary for learning a language."
This is a good one for our Language
department: "Men of national repu-
tation are teaching the above three
courses, (Philosophy, Sociology and
History), while the Language faculty
is of mediocre quality." On the same
paper stands, "I would take three sub-
jects mentioned, as they would be
more broadening than Language
would be. * * * Furthermore, the
language learned in school is not
enough to be of any use.'' Another
man answered, "LANGUAGE. It
puts bread into my stomach. Phil-
osophy, Sociology and History are
good to support college professors,
but, the WORLD must move." A
foreign student chose the cultural sub-
jects because they "enable us to dis-
criminate between the rational and ir-
rational ways of bettering ourselves
and society." "I might be able to use
my language some day, but I fail to
see where the other subjects would
have helped me to make a living,"
wrote another student. Still another
answer reads, "I would have taken
Language instead of Philosophy be-
cause some day I intend to apply for
a job and a good command of the
English Language would certainly be
of more value than wondering if my
foot was in my shoe even though I
couldn't see it."
The general idea in the answers to
the last question seemed to be that a
man comes to college to study so that
he may earn more money after he
graduates. The fact that one is bet-
ter able to serve his fellow man and
enjoy life to a greater extent himself
with a college education was mention-
ed only by a few.
This is the condition that prevails
throughout the Engineering College.
The same is true among engineers in
general, however, is the opinion of
Prof. Allen, who has given several
"examinations" to groups of engineers
at which he happened to be present,
along the same lines as the one above.
Prof. Allen will continue work of this
nature and would like to see the idea
spread to the other instructors.
Should there be more cultural sub-
jects required for us?
How many questions could YOU
have answered correctly out of the
above five'


THE LEAVEN OF LIGHT
OUT of the dust hath the hand of man
Formed and fashioned thee as thou art,
Placed together in well-wrought plan
Every feature and form and part,
Gathered of sand and pebble and clay.
Gathered of wood and water and stone,
Moulded and shaped in a devious way
Part by part as the whole has grown.
Staunch and strong were thy members made,
Product of furnace and quarry and mine-
Wide and deep thy foundations laid,
True every wall to plummet and line;
Yet cold and dumb as the lifeless clod.
Bleak as the rock on a barren plain.
Awaiting the touch of the quickening rod,
The pulse of life through the dormant vein.
Cold and dumb—till the breath of flame
Quickened to life thy every part,
Set a-quiver thy ponderous frame
Set a-throbbing thy wondrous heart,
Made thee a unit of vigor and might
Hissing and singing a busy lay.
Made of the clod as soulful sprite
Started a song from the lifeless clay.


Out of the mine where energy sleeps,
Out of the torrent all foaming and white,
Out of the lightning which flashes and leaps,
Cometh the source of thy marvelous might;
Dormant these forces or wasting their strength
Tearing the earth in their wild career,
Useless, till bridled and trammelled at length.
Guided and held in a useful sphere.
Fettered and turned from their useless course,
Curbed yet strengthened by being allied,
Fire and water combining their force
Join and their efforts are unified;
Under the glow of thy fervent heat,
Under the fetter of thought's command
The bond of their strength becomes complete. N
As they yield to the guidance of wisdom's hand.
Out of the furnace a new force springs,
Silent and subtle and unperceived,
Swifter than thought on its fleeting wings,
Stronger than imagery ever conceived;
Into the distance its tentacles reach
Over the water and over the land,
Throbbing with power is the pulse of each
A power in attune with the world's demand.
Changed is the world by this vital force.
One man's work is the work of ten,
A tiny thread from the potent source
And miles are measured by minutes then,
A tiny thread and a chain of stars
Ties the curtains of coming night,
And progress gleams through the midnight hours
When the world is transformed by the leaven of light.
Out of the dust these marvels were made,
Moulded and shaped by the hand of man,
Yet not a member was formed or laid
Till mind had conceived of the finished plan;
Skill and craft with infinite care
Wrought to the lines that mind has shown
Gauged and tested with plummet and square
But 'twas mind that gave life to the brick and stone.

WAY IMPROVEMENT
D. A. THOMAS, 16E
THE planning for and building of
the large mileage of improved
highways which, reports from all sec-
tions of the country indicate, will soon
take place, involve certain vital fea-
tures which must be given due con;
sideration if the roads of the future
are not only to render economic serv-
ice but are also to be worthy of being
ranked as engineering achievements.
Perhaps the first problem which pre-
sents itself and one which frequently
is not solved according to the best
principles is the selection of the type
of road surface. This subject will be
conisdered here with especial refer-
ence to Michigan conditions.
The problem of selection is in itself
relatively simple. It consists in build-
ing a type of road which will satis-
factorily carry the traffic imposed up-
on it for the least annual cost. Carry-
ing this analysis farther, an economic
road may be defined as one which will
move the traffic over it for the least
annual cost per vehicle mile, taking
into account interest on the first cost
of construction, the annual mainten-
ance, and a sinking fund which will
eventually renew the surface when the
old road wears out. In general then,
the intensity of the traffic will govern
the type selected, provided, of course,
that sufficient funds are available for
the construction.
Roughly, a solution may be arrived
at by balancing the high interest
charge and low maintenance cost on
the higher types of roads such as
bituminous-concrete, cement-concrete,
and brick against the low interest and
high maintenance costs on the lower
classes of roads such as gravel and
macadam. One of the New England
states has estimated that it could af-
ford to spend $900 a year in the main-
tenance of its gravel roads before it
could economically afford to build
roads of concrete or brick if for that
sum the roads could be kept in a satis-
factory condition. Since the amount
of maintenance required is, however,
dependent upon the traffic, the prob-
lem again reduces to a consideration
of the travel which is after all the only
logical basis upon which to select a
road surface. Where to draw the line
between heavy and light traffic is
where judgment frequently errs.
The taking of a traffic census cov-
ering the number and kind of vehicles
should be a preliminary step to the
fixing of the type of road. This is in
accordance with the dictates of the
best engineering practice and yet how
often it is neglected. In fact in per-
haps no other field of engineering is
there such a lack of the application of
scientific principles as in highway con-
struction. This may be due, however,
to the fact that at present a large pro-
portion of the actual construction
work is in charge of men who are not
technically trained.
If a system of sewers is to be built
in a city or town, the first requisite
is complete knowledge of the number
of inhabitants and the area and char-
acter of the land tributary to the pro-
posed sewers in order that an esti-


87
mate may be made of the probable
demand upon them. Then in the out-
skirts where there are but few houses
to serve small sewers would be laid,
say pipes of from six to eight inches
in diameter. As the more thickly
populated sections are reached the size
would increase until on the main sew-
ers leading to the outlet there might
be pipes three or four feet in diam-
eter.
Okcmos on the same road, a distance
of about three miles, the travel falls
down lo 400 vehicles per day, and at
a point just east of Okemos the travel
is only about 225 vehicles per day.
Bearing these facts in mind, after
making a careful study of the traffic,
with due allowance for future in-
crease, that type should be selected
which with proper maintenance v/ill

So it is with a system of highways.
Traffic upon a road varies with the
distance from the cities and towns.
From a careful study of traffic rec-
ords, it has been found that the local
traffic is on the average about 85 per
cent of the total while the touring traf-
fic amounts to about 15 per cent of the
total. To give a specific illustration:
On the route of the Wolverine. Paved-
way at a point half way between Lan-
sing and East Lansing the travel
amounts to over 1,000 vehicles per
day, while between East Lansing and
bear the traffic which comes to it dur-
ing the life of the metalled surface.
For a few miles out of each large
city where the number of vehicles per
day exceeds 400. it would undoubted-
ly be advisable to construct a 16-foot
cement-concrete or bituminous road
which would cost in the neighborhood
of $14,000 or $15,000 per mile with an
annual maintenance cost of from $50
to $100 per mile. If the traffic is not
in excess of 700 vehicles per day a
macadam road with a bituminous sur-
face treatment constructed at a cost


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
of about Sio.ooo per mile could be
recommended provided the necessary
equipment is provided for the continu-
ance of the treatment as a part of the
yearly maintenance which would cost
from $200 to $400 for a 16-foot road.
Beyond the four or five-mile limit
where the traffic reduces to from 150
to 400 vehicles per day, a 16-foot
gravel road costing from $5,000 to $6,-
000 per mile with an annual mainten-
ance charge of $100 to S200 per mile
should suffice during the lifetime of
one gravel surface. Farther from the
cities and towns where the traffic goes
both ways to market and reduces to
less than 150 vehicles per day, even a
less expensive road would be satisfac-
tory for many years—say a nine foot
gravel road costing from $2,000 to
83,000 per mile.
In this discussion no account has
been taken of the ability of the county,
township, or local unit to pay for the
roads. It should not be impossible,
however, to obtain the money to
build roads commensurate with the
traffic. The thickly populated sections
which require the best and most ex-
pensive roads have a relatively large
valuation to assess and the sparsely
settled regions where the traffic is
light can build the cheaper types of
roads at about the same rate of assess-
ment. When the people as a whole
realize the value of good roads the
money will be forthcoming.

WHEELS
THOMAS O. PERRY, ,69A-,72E
SO FAR as I know, the experiments
here described are new as well
as curious and have never before been
mentioned in any publication.
Fig. I is a photographic view of the
four windwheels with which these ex-
periments were made.
Fig. 2 is a photograph of the ap-
paratus specially constructed for mak-
ing the tests to be described. One of
the windwheels is shown mounted on
Without further description of the
testing apparatus it will be clear that
thrusts due to the wind can be weighed
whether the wheel is allowed to turn
on its axle or is held stationary, as
well as thrusts due to pressure of wind
against the solid disc.

two of the windwheels. The whole
apparatus was placed on an ordinary
table as the photos show.

the axle which is supported like a
swing just behind the wheel and at
the rear end is pivoted to the vertical
arm of an L shaped lever. The hori-
zontal arm of the lever carries a
weight pan to receive weights which
will measure the longitudinal thrust of
the axle. The wind was supplied by a
12" electric fan set in front of the
wheel.
Fig. 3 shows a solid disc of sheet
metal mounted on the axle in the same
position as that occupied by the wind-
wheels.
The weight shown in the pan is not
one of those which was used. Special
weights were used so that the amount
of thrust was directly determined to
within o.oi of a pound. Weights of
o.ooi lbs. were sometimes used but
will not be needed in this description.
The four windwheels were made
precisely alike in general dimensions
and all measured io-JA" from tip to
tip. The solid disc shown also was
10-3/2" in diameter. The wings were
T--K" wide and made of sheet brass
T/32" thick. The camber of the wings


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
was about 1/14 part of the length of
the chord and cross sections of the
wings conformed to circular arcs.
One windwheel differed from an-
other only in the angle of inclination
with the plane of its motion made by
the chord of the wing. Two of the
wheels had their wings set at an in-
clination of 8 degrees, but in opposite
directions. One had its wings set at
only 3 degrees of inclination and an-
other had no inclination of its wings
in either direction. This wheel might
be supposed to be as strictly neutral
as it could be made.
For the sake of brevity when re-
ferred to hereafter I will designate
the different wheels by characters
which will disclose their natural dis-
positions as follows:
R8° is the 8 degree wheel which is
disposed to turn right-handed or
clockwise. L8° is the 8 degree wheel
disposed to turn left handed. L30 is
the 3 degree wheel whose disposition
is to turn left-handed ordinarily. NO°
designates the wheel of no perceptible
inclination, as the wing chords face
the wind squarely, and naturally it
could not decide in advance on which
way to turn.
As the forms of these four wheels
may seem strange to most men who
have had much to do with windmills
I will explain that they were not orig-
inally intended to represent wind-
wheels at all but were designed to an-
swer certain questions arising from a
proposed use of aeronautical propel-
lers and these questions could appar-
ently be answered by submitting the
propellers to blasts of wind artificially
produced.
As a windmill man it always seemed
perfectly obvious to me that the wings
when subjected to wind pressure
would relieve themselves of pressure
in part if allowed to turn freely. That
is, in yielding to the pressure, without
resisting it, the pressure should be
greatly diminished. In all of my
windmill experiments it never occur-
red to me to question what seemed to
be so obvious a fact. But in studying
some aeronautical problems I was led
to question what I think any windmill
expert would regard as an unquestion-
able fact.
First experiment. I mounted my
windwheel R8° as shown in Fig. 2,
but by means of a collar pressed
against its hub prevented its turning
in the blast from the fan. The press-
ure was balanced by a little less than
0.05 lbs. placed on the pan.
After freeing the wheel so that no
resistance was offered to rotation, ex-
cept that of a very slight axle friction
and the air itself, the thrust increased
as the speed increased until it required
more than 0.16 lbs. in the pan to coun-
teract the pressure. So it appeared
that the wings were not relieved of
pressure by yielding but that the pres-
sure was increased more than three-
fold in their attempt to run away
from it.
Second experiment. The solid disc
of the same diameter as the wheel was
mounted on the axle in place of the
wheel, as shown in Fig. 3. The disc
was fastened securely so that it could
not move on the axle. It required 0.15
lbs. in the pan to balance the wind
pressure against the disc, a little less
than the revolving R8° received. This
was tried many times with the same
result. So it appeared that two nar-
row blades revolving without applied
resistance about an axis parallel to
the wind received more pressure than
a solid disc of the same diameter sim-
ilarly placed.
Third experiment. Two wheels,
R8° and L8°. were mounted on the
axle tandem fashion, as shown in Fig.


9i
4, and both allowed to turn freely
against independent thrust collars. The
wheels were driven in opposite direc-
tions as was to be expected, though the
rear wheel ran at less speed than the
one in front. By using a broader
thrust collar for the front wheel, the
two speeds were, in a measuree, equal-
ized. The thrust of the two wheels
while in full motion was balanced by
about 0.17 lbs., only a little more than
what was required to balance the pres-
sure against either one alone.
in the previous experiment with
tandem wheels. L3° ran and con-
tinued running rapidly behind R8°.
Fifth experiment. The wheel NO°,
supposed to be strictly neutral with
no inclination, was mounted alone on
the axle. As it refused to start of its
own accord, it was given a start with
the fingers. Instead of losing the mo-
tion given at the start, it immediately
gained speed and was soon going as
rapidly as any of the other wheels
and manifested a vigorous intention
Fig. 2
Fourth experiment. L3° was mount-
ed on the axle in front of R8°. That
is, the previous experiment was re-
peated with L,3C taking the place of
L8°. Both wheels started readily and
ran well for a time in opposite direc-
tions, as they were supposed to do,
but L3° gained motion and L8°
lost motion until the latter finally came
to a state of rest and refused to run
any longer, while L3° remained in
rapid motion. It was necessary to
slow down L3° considerably before
L8° could again be induced to make
a start. The thrust was the same as
of removing all doubts in regard to its
supposed neutrality. The application
of considerable friction failed to more
than slightly arrest its motion. A
very moderate start given to NO° in
a left-hand direction was sufficient to
initiate motion. For some reason not
easily explained it was not quite so
easy to give this wheel a right hand
start, though there was no difficultv
in giving it sufficient start in either
direction, but in whichever direction
it was started with the fingers it
promptly increased its speed and ap-
peared to be quite indifferent as to the


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
direction which it was prompted to
take, manifesting both ways an equal
amount of vigorous motion. The pres-
sure was balanced by about 0.17 lbs.
Sixth experiment. The wheel NO"
exhibited such a surplus of energy and
eagerness to go, after being mildly
urged to start, as to suggest that pos-
sibly L3° might be induced to whirl
contrary to its natural inclination. At
first I did not succeed in getting L30
sufficiently started with the fingers to
overcome its disinclination to go right-
Jv8° began to lose its motion and final-
ly came to a state of rest. L8° could
not be induced to go behind NO° af-
ter the latter attained rapid motion.
When R8° was tried in the same way
behind NO" it sometimes ceased mo-
tion entirely and at other times would
continue to barely keep in very slow
motion. When R8° was first allowed
to get full speed. NO° would occasion-
ally start in a left-hand direction of
its own accord, without assistance. but
never started when mounted alone,
^
Fig. 3
handed, but by winding a string once
or twice around the hub the start was
easily effected and then this left-hand
wheel seemed to travel nearly as rap-
idly, contrary to its original disposi-
tion, as when allowed to take its own
course. The wind pressure was about
0.16 lbs. whichever way this wheel re-
volved.
Seventh experiment. The wheel
L8° was mounted behind wheel NO°.
1.8° started and ran apparently as well
as ever, before NO° was made to
start, but after NO° was started in
either direction and attained full speed
nor would it ever start itself in a right-
handed way. I would attempt to ex-
plain this predilection of NO° to start
left-handed rather than right-handed
by a supposed rotation of the blast
from the fan if the. imagined twist of
the air were not contrary to the way
that NO° preferred to start. The no-
table feature of this experiment is
that NO3, when revolving at full
speed entirely, or almost completely,
shut off the wind from the wheel be-
hind it practically the same as would
a solid disc. As the axle was a smooth
drill rod less than V*j" in diameter


93
well lubricated, the resistance to start-
ing was too small to be appreciable.
Either R8° or L8° would have started
easily behind NO° or behind L3° if
these wheels had permitted even a
very light wind to reach the rear
wheels.
In all of the above mentioned ex-
periments the wheels whether mount-
ed singly or tandem received about the
same amount of pressure when run-
ning at full speed, by which I mean
their own naturally assumed gait un-
started vigorously it seemed almost
willing to continue its adverse motion.
When showing these experiments
to others I have been asked, "Of what
advantage is it to a windwheel that
it may be able to turn in either direc-
tion, if it develops less power than a
wheel adapted to revolve in only one
direction?"
As already intimated, these experi-
ments were not made with a view to
promote windmill industry. I am will-
ing to let windmill men find out for
Fig. 4
hindered by any applied load. NO°
received a slightly greater axial thrust
than the other wheels used singly and
about the same as the greatest thrust
sustained by tandem wheels. The
thrust against single wheels when
clamped against the axle was about
0.05 lbs. in all cases, and about 0.08
lbs. balanced the thrust when tandem
wheels were fixed at right angles to
each other.
An attempt to make an L4° wheel,
not shown, go contrary to its inclina-
tion was not successful, although when
themselves whether or not the phe-
nomena disclosed can ever be of any
use to them.
The knowledge of such paradoxical
disclosures should, in a general way,
be of value if for no other purpose
than to teach mankind that our boast-
ed powers of reason are of little use
to us unless subjected to constant
checks by means of experiment.
Especially is this the case when one
has to deal with problems involving
action and reaction between moving
surfaces and the wind.


DR. J. S. LAIRD
rpiIE SITUATION originated by
-*- the present European war has
resulted in many instances in a devel-
opment of the resources and industries
of this country to a degree that seemed
almost impossible in normal times. It
is axiomatic that in time of war, if
not in time of peace, a nation should
be as self-contained as possible, and
not be under the necessity of depend-
ing on outside sources for supplies
necessary for its industries, especially
those which are directly involved in
the production of munitions of war.
Development of our resources which
tend to make us independent of Eu-
ropean sources may thus be regarded
as a real measure of preparedness.
Much newspaper ink has been ex-
pended on the question of a shortage
of dyes, and the necessity of develop-
ment of an American dye industry.
Comparatively little has been written
about the shortage of more funda-
mental, if less decorative materials,
from whose normal source of supply
we have been almost as completely cut
off. Magnesite may be noted as a ma-
terial, for the supply of which we were
up to 1914 almost entirely dependent
upon European countries. The exten-
sive deposits of this material existing
in this country are now being utilized
to a degree that makes us practically
independent of foreign supplies.
The importance of magnesite lies in
the fact that it is almost a vital neces-
sity in our great steel industries.
American ores of sufficient purity so
that steel can be made from them in
the acid open hearth process using a
siliceous slag are becoming scarcer and
more expensive each year. The almost
inexhaustable iron ore deposits in the
Mesabi region contain considerable
quantities of phosphorous, which can
be eliminated only by the use of a
basic or lime slag. This necessitates
that the furnace used in the steel mak-
ing be lined with a neutral or basic
material which will not be attacked by
the slag. The only refractory material
which is sufficiently resistant chemi-
cally, capable of withstanding the in-
tense heat, and of moderate cost is
magnesite.
Magnesite, the carbonate of magne-
sium MgC03, occurs widely distrib-
uted in the earth's crust, but the de-
posits are rarely of sufficient size or
purity to be commercially valuable.
The most extensive deposits have been
found in Austria-Hungary, where the
magnesite occurs in a massive lime-
stone like formation, apparently of
sedimentary origin. These deposits
are not very pure, containing about
eight per cent of iron oxide Fe20,.
This impurity makes the magnesite
somewhat more fusible, so that it can
be sintered to a hard mass at i5oo°C-
i6oo°C, but still cannot be fused be-
low a much higher temperature. Mag-
nesite brick to be used in furnace lin-
ings can be made from it more eco-
nomically than from purer materials,
and the cost of mining these deposits
is lower than that of any other mag-
nesite deposits. Up to the outbreak of
the war practically all the magnesite
used in metallurgical operations in
America was imported from Austria-
Hungary, mostly in the dead burned
condition, that is after having been
heated to such a high temperature that
all the carbon dioxide has been driven


95
oft and the material has become chem-
ically inactive. In 1913 there were im-
ported 136.000 tons of this material
valued at about $1,630,000.00. None
has been imported since March, 1915.
At Euboea in Greece deposits of
much purer magnesite have been ex-
tensively exploited, but for other pur-
poses than the manufacture of refrac-
tories. This pure white material has
always commanded a higher price, and
has been used largely in the manufac-
ture of oxychloride cement and com-
position flooring. Oxychloride cement
is made from magnesite which has
been calcined at a comparativelv low
temperature so as to drive off most of
the carbon dioxide, but still leave the
magnesium oxide remaining chemical-
ly active or "caustic." This caustic
magnesite when mixed with a strong
solution of magnesium chloride sets to
a very hard mass of high strength and
bonding power. It is coming into fair-
ly extensive use for inside and outside
plastering in spite of its relatively high
cost, as it makes a plaster which is
much tougher and more elastic than
cement or gypsum plasters or stuccos.
Such plaster is not nearly as liable to
show cracks caused by the settling of
the walls as the common more brittle
plasters.
The American magnesite deposits
occur in California, and are as a rule
quite pure, resembling the Grecian de-
posits. Small mines have been worked
for a number of years to supply the
local demand for magnesite for paper
making and cement. Most of the
known deposits were rather small, and
until recently difficult of access. Aus-
trian magnesite of metallurgical grade
could be laid down in San Francisco
more cheaply than California!!, so
there was little incentive to develop-
ment. In 1914 only one mine made
an output of any moment, the total
production being 11,293 tons.
In 1915 with the almost complete
cutting off of importations from Aus-
tria and Greece and consequent rise
in prices, many properties began to be
developed, and active prospecting
brought many new deposits to light.
With crude magnesite selling for five
dollars a ton at the mine, it became an
ore worth looking for, and eastern
capital became interested in the prop-
osition. Railroads and wagon roads
were built, modern rotary kilns for
calcining the ore were installed, and
shipments through the Panama canal
became an established fact. The mo-
tor truck, too. must be credited with
its share in improving transportation
and making communication with the
more remote mines possible.
Since August, 1915, almost all the
magnesite reaching the New York
market has come from California, and
the metallurgical industries are entire-
ly dependent upon this source of sup-
ply. Some of the Californian material
is sufficiently impure to be used direct-
ly in making fire brick. The most of
it, however, has to be mixed with flux-
ing agents such as slag or iron ore. A
good many of these difficulties have
not yet been completely worked out,
but considerable progress has been
made. The development work which
has been done in California will make
the future production of magnesite in
that state cheaper than it has been in
the past. But it is doubtful if it can
ever be laid down as cheaply in the
New York market, in normal times,
as the Austrian product. Up to the
present, importation of magnesite into
this country has been duty free. As a
measure of preparedness it might be
well to encourage the continued de-
velopment of the Californian deposits
by a protective tariff on this verv im-
portant material.


LOUIS HOLMES BOYNTON
DURING the last few years there'
has been a movement, which is
gaining increasing momentum, for im-
proving the conditions of housing un-
der which we live. This movement at
first affected only the very poor, hut
was gradually extended to include the
prosperous artisan and the better paid
clerk, and is tending toward control of
all housing, including that of the well-
to-do. The chief means employed are,
first, an awakening of the public con-
science to the need of better condi-
tions, and then the enactment of such
laws as seem wise, or in default of
sufficient support, of the best laws that
can receive the support of the public.
There are, of course, many impor-
tant instances of housing reform in
Europe which might be sighted and
with which it is necessary for the stu-
dent of this subject to be familiar, as
the movement in this country is inti-
mately connected with the work done
abroad. European conditions, howev-
er, are rather beyond the scope of this
paper, so we must limit our attention
to conditions in this country.
A brief resume of the history of
housing reform in this country will
be necessary to an understanding of
some present tendencies.
One of the earliest efforts at such
regulation in the United States was
the attempt at tenement house reform
in New York City. The condition
there was, as is commonly the case,
due to shifting population. In New
York the unit of lot is 25 feet wide by
too feet deep. As the better class, or
at least better housed class, of people
moved, with the rapid change of fash-
ion, to locations that were considered
more desirable, the less favored class
occupied the houses. Houses which
had been built to accommodate a sin-
gle family, filling the width of the lot,
and frequently 50 or 60 feet in depth,
were converted into tenements.
The customary house containing, on
each floor above the first, two large
bed rooms and two small or "hall"
rooms, usually with an interior bath,
were ill adapted to conversion into
tenements. The practice of making
entirely dark interior rooms became
such a crying evil that at last a law
was passed, prohibiting such rooms.
This law, well intentioned as it un-
doubtedly was, was written for the
purpose of ameliorating existing con-
ditions, and of allowing the alteration
of the unsanitary dark tenement. Ob-
viously such an enactment was almost
sure to be inadequate, and when this
finally became apparent a new move-
ment was started to correct the evil.
This movement finally resulted in the
enactment of the present tenement
house law.
This law, while much more general
and on the whole satisfactory, was
frankly written with the small tene-
ments in mind and was clearly framed
to correct abuses and regulate condi-
tions in such houses. Then, apparent-
ly, the argument was made that the
minimum requirements for the poor
could also be made to apply to every-
body, so the law was made general and
applies to all buildings where more
than two families live and do their
own cooking. The result is that manv
of the rather minute directions which


97
seem to have been formed to cover
very definite and standard conditions
in the small tenement, of say two
apartments on a floor of a building 37
feet wide, were arbitrarily made to
apply to such buildings as the Astor
Apartments occupying an entire city
block of say 200 x 400 feet.
The result is a number of limita-
tions which make it difficult to plan
economically and simply, while at the
same time providing a profitable in-
vestment. One of the prime movers
in securing the adoption of this law
was Mr. Lawrence Veiller, who has
applied his energies with singular de-
votion to this cause. He has pub-
lished a book which is intended to be
a model for legislation for housing re-
form. This proposed law is based on
the New York tenement law and is
very specific in its regulations and is
most in-elastic in suggesting the same
regulations for buildings of widely
different uses and in all localities.
Mr. Veiller is so well recognized as
the father of housing reform in this
country and the results that may be
directly attributed to his efforts are so
important and far reaching that one's
impulse is to accept his findings as
final; yet there seems real danger as
his latest book. "A Model Housing
Law," was published about two years
ago and seems to have occasioned lit-
tle comment. The effects of the gen-
eral adoption of such a law would be
so far reaching from the point of view
of sociology and economics, and could
so hamper the development of the
Architecture of this country, that the
book should not be accepted as a
standard for lack of discussion and
criticism. This book purports to cover
all the possible conditions of "hous-
ing" in cities, towns, or even "on the
prairies," where, the book states, ex-
tremely bad conditions of housing
have been found. The proposed law
is defined as covering all "private
dwellings,'' ''two - family dwellings"
and "multiple-dwellings." The latter
class is divided into two groups A and
B. Group A is defined as covering
tenement houses, flats, apartment ho-
tels, bachelor, studio, duplex and kit-
chinette apartments; Group B includes
"hotels, lodging houses, boarding
houses, furnished-room houses, lodg-
ings, club houses, convents, asylums,
jails, and all other dwellings similarly
occupied whether specifically enumer-
ated or not." In brief it would include
every place where human beings sleep.
The law is recommended for adoption
by the various states regardless of cli-
mate.
Any one who has struggled to fit the
provisions of the New York tenement
law to a multiple dwelling in the sub-
urbs or to a large high class apart-
ment house, will appreciate the diffi-
culty of writing a general law which
shall cover all the possible conditions
arising in widely differing classes of
buildings.
The New York tenement law was
quite frankly framed to cover a spe-
cial set of conditions arising in The
Borough of Manhattan, where the unit
of a lot of 25' x 100' is an almost
constant factor, and the housing of
the poor, or less well-to-do portion of
the community, was the chief if not
the only consideration. Without in the
least degree wishing to discredit the
really immense benefit which has re-
sulted from the adoption and applica-
tion of this law, it seems necessary to
protest against certain tendencies to-
ward absolute standardization which
it involves.
The same tendency is even more
clearly marked in the "Model Housing
Law." Though it is avowedly a set of
minimum provisions it is written


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
around (or within) the customary
American unit of the rectangular lot
with a narrow frontage. While it is
true that there are certain provisions
which might apply to a less stereo-
typed system of city planning the ten-
dency is to force or at least strongly
suggest the adoption of a fixed type
of house.
There seems to he a real danger in
cramping the imagination by fixing at-
tention on a type which after all, is
only a minimum solution of condi-
tions, which are in themselves unde-
sirable.
As has been stated, the law is fram-
ed to cover all classes of housing, from
one family houses in cities and vil-
lages, to apartments, hotels and even
jails. It seems very unwise to attempt
to standardize accommodations where
conditions vary so widely. For exam-
ple under the proposed law, minimum
size of any room is 90 sq. ft. Now 90
sq. ft. in a high class apartment house
is not an unreasonable minimum. It
is, however, a question whether a min-
imum of 90 sq. ft. in a tenement would
itself be an improvement on the 70
sq. ft. required in the New York law,
in view of the possibility of putting
four, instead of two people, in a room.
This could easily be accomplished by
the use of "double decker" beds.
It has been found necessary, in the
case of certain workingmen's towns,
to insist that families consisting of the
parents and grown children of both
sexes should occupy at least three
rooms. It is manifestly impossible to
insist on this condition unless the ac-
commodations can be furnished at a
reasonable rent. Under condition of
congestion this might be made difficult,
if not impossible, by such a liberal pro-
vision.
Certainly a minimum of 90 sq. ft.
in all dwelling houses regardless of
location, number of windows, etc.,
would be very unfair and unnecessary.
In planning small houses in the sub-
urbs or in a village it frequently hap-
pens that a room of perhaps 8x9 feet
or 7x9 feet, can be arranged with
windows on two sides or even with
one window only. Under this law
such a space could not be used either
for a single bed room, or even for a
sewing room!
The proposed law requires that all
alcoves or alcove rooms must have an
area of not less than 90 sq. ft. and
that they must have independent win-
dows as if they were rooms. This is
very well for tenements, but it is also
proposed to apply this provision to all
private houses, hotels, and clubs. ( !)
The clear intention is to force the use
of rectangular rooms exclusively. Un-
der this law a closet projecting into
the corner of a room would produce
what might be technically an alcove.
A safe or elevator enclosure projecting
into the lobby or office of a hotel or
club would form an alcove which not
only must be of legal area but must
be independently lighted by windows.
It is difficult to imagine planning a
club or the entrance floor of a hotel in
the light of such a drastic limitation.
Mr. Veiller proposes to limit the
height of all stories for their whole
area to a minimum of nine feet. There
seems no good reason for attempting
to regulate the story height of detach-
ed dwelling houses in the suburbs or
country, and there is certainly every
reason why an attic story or other
story in a roof should be allowed in
such houses. Such provision would
impose a flat roofed architecture on
the whole country and would make
impossible such charming and commo-
dious houses as those designed by Mr.
Charles Batron Keene and Mr. Ay-
mar Embury II.


99
The practice in this country has
been to consider the regulation of
dwellings as a separate matter from
the regulation of other buildings and
to separate the Housing Law from the
Building Code.
In 1913 the legislature of the State
of Massachusetts apointed a Commis-
sion "to investigate the various stat-
utes, ordinances, or by-laws now in
force throughout the Commonwealth
. .. relative to the construction, alter-
ation, and maintenance of buildings,
with the view of establishing uniform-
ity in general requirements . . . either
for the state as a whole or under clas-
sification of cities and towns. . ."
The committee, after a very careful
investigation, reported in February,
1915, and included in their report rec-
commendations for the control of such
subjects as are commonly regulated
under a Building Code, such as struc-
tural and general sanitary matters and
also such general provisions as apply
to the regulation of housing and which
may be properly regulated by a state
law.
The recommendation was made that
any community might exact more rig-
id requirements but that at least the
minimum provisions of the law must
apply to all building. The general
method of framing the proposed law
was to make three different sets of
general classifications first into types
of construction as :—
Ordinary frame — protected frame
—slow burning and fire resisting: sec-
ond, to divide all building into classes
as: residence, public and business
buildings with various sub-divisions:
third, to provide for the formation of
four typical districts or "zones." Any
community may elect which zone or
zones it is to be classified under: pro-
vided, however, that it must come un-
der class 4 "wherein only a few gen-
erally accepted requirements are im-
posed on ordinary domestic build-
ings."
There are detailed schedules pre-
pared determining what types of Con-
struction may be used in the various
classes of building and depending on
the size and purpose of the building
and the "district" in which it is to be
built.
For example, in district 1 there
would be no buildings allowed except
those built of Type 5-C, i. c, the best
class of fire proof construction; while
in the other districts the type of con-
struction is governed by the use of the
building and the number of stories in
height.
Obviously such a system of classifi-
cation would facilitate the application
of the law to the diverse conditions
which would arise under a state code.
In the regulation of "housing" the
law confines itself mainly to the regu-
lation of the multiple dwelling and, as
these are minimum requirements, to
such matters as are clearly necessary
and about which there could hardly
be any controversy.
This method of regulating all build-
ing, including housing, under one law
seems to be more reasonable than the
separation of the law into two distinct
codes. There are so many matters
that apply equally, both to general
buildings, and to housing, and the in-
clusion of the whole matter in one
code makes it so much simpler to ap-
ply the law and avoid duplicating reg-
ulations, with the resulting danger of
confusion and contradiction, that there
seems no question that it is the ideal
method.
To sum up, it seems clear that too
minute or drastic regulations are a
mistake when they are intended to ap-
ply generally to different kinds of


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
buildings regardless of locality or spe-
cial requirements, and that extreme
care should be exercised by those
framing such laws to determine how
any regulation would affect all the dif-
ferent conditions it is intended to reg-
ulate.
This would seem to be a matter in
which Architects are vitally interested,
as it is the Architect who in the first
instance has to study the law with a
view to determining the exact limita-
tions which it imposes on the imagina-
tion.
BOOK REVIEWS
Handbook of Engineering Mathemat-
ics. By Walter E. Wynne, B.E.,
and William Spraragen, B.E. New
York, D. Van Nostrand Company,
iqi6. x -f- 220 pp. Price, $2.00.
The handbooks in the different de-
partments of engineering have grown
to such dimensions as to be somewhat
unwieldy. They are of approximately
1200-2000 pages filled with condensed
descriptive matter covering as nearly
as possible the subject matter of the
whole field.
The above handbook is the result of
an attempt on the part of its authors
to give the engineer a convenient ref-
erence book which shall contain in
condensed form the fundamental
mathematical formulas in engineering.
From the point of view of an en-
gineering student at Michigan its val-
ue may well be questioned. The part
devoted to mathematical tables and
formulas purely (about half of the
book) can not take the place of
Peirce's excellent "Table of Integrals"
which is a required book for all stu-
dents taking Mathematics 4.
The remaining part of the book
treats of the following subjects : Theo-
retical Mechanics. Mechanics of Ma-
terials, Hydraulics. Flow of Fluids,
Electricity. Measurement, and Physi-
cal and Chemical Constants.
The space devoted to each subject
is necessarily brief. Tt is thought that
the advantage of one of the larger
handbook's more than offsets the addi-
tional cost.
From the point of view of book-
making it is an excellent piece of
work. The binding is good, the type
large and clear, the arrangement of
material well planned. Very few typo-
graphical errors have been noticed and
they are relatively unimportant.

Principles of Quantitative Analysis.
An Introductory Course. By Walter
C. Blasdale. Associate Professor of
Chemistry in the University of Cal-
ifornia. Second Edition, Revised
and Enlarged, xii 4-402 pp. 1917.
D. Van Nostrand Co. Price $2.50.
This book, now appearing in its sec-
ond, slightly enlarged edition, aims to
give the student a thorough working
knowledge of the subject of quantita-
tive analysis, both practical and theo-
retical. The author first discusses the
general principles and methods under-
lying all quantitative methods, after
which he takes up the different types
of quantitative processes, including
the following: Gravimetric Gas-evolu-
tion Processes. Gravimetric Precipita-
tion Processes, Gravimetric Solution
and Extraction Processes, Partition
Processes, Volumetric Processes, in-
volving Precipitation, Volumetric Pro-


101
cesses involving Neutralization, Volu-
metric Processes involving Oxidation,
Physico-Chemical Processes. In each
case is given a clear statement of the
theory and reactions involved and the
general features, followed by working
details for one or more specific deter-
minations illustrative of the general
type.
The most striking feature of the
book and one which renders it of es-
pecial value is the amount of space
devoted to the theoretical portion of
the subject. There is entirely too
much tendency among teachers of
quantitative analysis to curtail discus-
sion of the principles underlying the
methods and thereby to turn out "cook
book" analysts. The author's view in
this matter is clearly indicated by the
following remarks: "Altho any per-
son who has acquired the necessary
manipulative skill may be able to exe-
cute the details of a carefully describ-
ed quantitative process, his ability to
make effective use of the process will
be decidedly limited, owing to the fact
that unforeseen contingencies, which
his carefully worded description did
not allow for. constantly arise. It is
only through a definite knowledge of
the theory of step of the process that
the analyst can work effectively and in-
telligently; the mechanical perform-
ance of such operations without under-
standing the reason for each step is
not worthy of being dignified by the
term 'quantitative analysis'." If more
teachers of chemistry shared this view
the standard of analytical work would
be greatly raised.
A valuable feature of this work is
the addition of a large number of
problems of a practical nature, thus
giving the student training in the ap-
plications of the principles studied.
The book covers more ground than
is usually possible in a course in ele-
mentary quantitative analysis, but
suitable omissions can be made with-
out in any way detracting from its val-
ue. Any course which follows the
lines laid out here, can only be broad
and thorough.

Elementary Mechanics for Engineers.
Author,' Clifford N. Mills, South
Dakota State College. Cloth, 4^ x
v in.; 127 pages, illustrated. New
York. D. Van Nostrand Company.
$1 net.
This little book, intended primarily
for use in engineering schools and col-
leges, is a comprehensive treatment of
the elementary parts of mechanics.
The work is on a par with that por-
tion of the courses in physics relating
to mechanics given in many technical
colleges. It is intended for use as the
basis of a semester's work of three
hours per week. Trigonometry and
high school mathematics are the essen-
tial prerequisites.
Kinematics, Kinetics and Statics are
the three divisions of the subject mat-
ter. In marked contrast to some of
the texts in general use, the detailed
discussion has in this little book been
somewhat curtailed, and the theory
gives way to the definition. The
proofs of the more complicated theo-
rems are followed by the solution of
examples. Over three hundred prob-
lems stimulate the student's interest
and serve to clinch the statements in
the text.
Well illustrated with line drawings,
the book is typographically forceful in
presence. As an elementary text, this
book should find its place in American
schools. It is to be understood, how-
ever, that it is in no sense a handbook
for engineering reference.

a course instructing the student how

quick repairs on the road.
And what is the reason for all this?
Simply stated—we are not intending
to duplicate the great mistake of Eng-
land when she sent the flower of her
highly trained men over to the trench-
es and then later ordered them home
again (what there were left of them)
when she found that she could not af-
ford to have them all killed on the
firing line. Seniors—look around you
and choose the branch of the service
for which you are best fitted and then
get busy and prepare for the examina-
tions that will admit you to as high
a position as you can get. If it comes
to the point where the United States
does take an active part in this strug-
gle there will be hundreds of places in
the engineering corps, signal corps,
ordnance and many other depart-
ments, for men who are capable of
taking up that particular work. So,
let's go, Michigan, and show the coun-
try that Michigan, who has always
done her duty, will find no reason for
not doing it now.
AN INVITATION
We are greatly handicapped at the
present time because of the excessive
prices which we must pay for necessi-
ties in publishing the Technic. We
are trying, however, to produce the
best possible magazine and still stay
within the not too abundant funds
available.
In order that we may do this we
would like to get your opinions on
what reasonable change you think
could be made to improve the Tech-
nic.
We invite your suggestions. Ad-
dress communications to the Associate
Editor.
SENIORS, SUBSCRIBE NOW
This is only the middle of May, and
Commencement may seem a long way
off. But it will come sooner than you
expect, and, before you realize it, it
will have passed by. You will say
goodbye to your comrades with a feel-
ing of sadness marring the joy of
achievement and success, and, quite
likely, a tear will dim the smiles. For
you realize that many of your class-
mates, those, perhaps, who were your
comrades in many a tough struggle,
you will never meet again. Perhaps
you will go to the Front, "Somewhere
in France" : perhaps you will be all but
swallowed up in the big world of bus-
iness.
A year or so may pass, and some
day you meet, quite by accident, an
old college friend. You all but em-
brace, and across the lunch table ex-
change the gossip. How's Jimmy
Brown and Runty Renfield? Did
Hank Howell get that swell jane he
used to fuss so hard out at school?
And so on. Some of the questions can
be answered, but many can not.
How much better would it be if
that old college friend came to your
home at regular and frequent intervals
with all the news of old friends and
the Campus that it was possible to
gather? Would you welcome him?
The Technic is such a friend. Its
all-hearing ears pick up the informa-
tion and carry it straight to your
door; and all the news will come to
you fresh four times a year, no matter
where you live.
Again, is it not pleasant to know


THE MICHIGAN TECH NIC
that your friends know where to find
you? To know that they are follow-
ing your career and are as pleased
over your progress as you are over
theirs? You cannot write to all of
them, much as you are interested, but
a few lines in the Technic will give
them the information you want them
to have.
There will come times later in life,
when perhaps you are spending a quiet
evening at hoine after a hard day's
work, and when thoughts of what the
fellows back at school are doing will
crowd into your mind. A few pages
of the Technic and you see again the
Arch, hear the droning of the engines
in the mechanical lab or the hum of
the dynamos, and hear the ring of
hammers over in the forge shop.
"Member the time you tried to make
your first weld? You will find that the
Spirit of the Campus reaches you in
the Technic.
CAMP DAVIS AND THE WAR
According to the present plans, con-
siderable stress will be placed on mil-
itary courses to be offered at Camp
Davis this summer. Among other
subjects, extensive work in military
topography will be taught, and it is
planned in addition to these, that, un-
der the supervision of army officers,
military drill rivaling that of Platts-
burg or other training camps will be
given.
Junior Civils, of course, are eligible
for camp attendance, but, if the plans
work out, eligibility will be extended
to take in any Juniors, and possibly
Seniors, as far as camp accommoda-
tions will permit. Courses given to
other than Civils will be modified so
as not to be too advanced.

WITH THE passing of winter, a great
new sentiment has gripped our en-
tire country. The advent of Spring
witnesses an intense martial fervor among
all the classes. Our staid college cam-
pus, sleeping peacefully heneath us, breath-
ing an atmosphere of culture, has suddenly-
awakened. The spirit of war is in the very
air, and every man realizes its true signifi-
cance. The deep far-reaching cry of "Pre-
pare I" has been heard and answered. Ev-
erywhere men are drilling. It is beautiful
and encouraging to see such hearty and
sympathetic response. In the most opti-
mistic light, the prospect of war is indeed
a gloomy outlook. But Love of Country
supercedes all things, and we have only an
intense desire to give our best efforts in
upholding her honor and dignity.
At a giant mass meeting for Junior and
Senior engineers, held on April 5, many
radical changes in the schedule of studies
were made. Seniors were given permission
to drop a part of their work, in order to
take up various courses to prepare them
for service in the army. Many of the reg-
ular advanced courses of study, in all de-
partments, were either completely dropped
or radically changed to meet practical de-
mands. The construction of temporary
bridges—the handling of field telephone,
telegraph and wireless apparatus—the rud-
iments of military road building—the man-
ufacture of munitions—the relation of met-
allurgy to the manufacture of war materials
—railroad transportation — camp sanitation
—automobile and aeroplane engines—mili-
tary stores — were among the courses of-
fered under the general heading, Elements
of Military Engineering. They have been
attended by large numbers of students,
practically every senior engineer enrolling
for one or more of the courses offered.
Drill was held throughout Spring vacation
under the direction of Prof. J. A. Bursley
and an army officer from Detroit. Here
again the enthusiasm of all manifested it-
self, and a capacity attendance was the
rule at every meeting.
THE NEW LIBRARY
This spring will see the completion of the
west wing of Michigan's new library. Due
largely to the difficulty in obtaining the
necessary steel, though somewhat handi-
capped by the winter's cold, the work has
been delayed. From present indications,
however, the west wing will be ready for
use by May 15th, and the east wing by July
first. It is planned that the west wing will
be used as a temporary reading room while
the old library is being torn down. Later
it will be used as a stack room. The east
wing is also designed to hold stacks, these
stacks having a capacity of. about 300.000
volumes. The two stacks, in the east and
west wings, will house the accessions of
the library for the next ten or twelve years.

They are built strong enough to be extend-
ed to more than double their present height
if there should be need for such an addi-
tion.
With the completion of the two wings
the old library will be torn down, that is,
with the exception of the two old book
stacks. They are situated directly between
the two new wings and are thoroughly fire
proof. The new library will be built around
these stacks.
The first floor of the new library will in-
clude a novel feature in university library
buildings, in that it will have a large study
room directly off the main entrance. This
is for students who desire merely to study
between classes using their own books with-
Progress of the Library
out drawing from the library. This will
aid materially in diminishing the noise in
the main reading room occasioned by per-
sons coming and going at the end of each
hour.
The main feature of the second floor will
be the reading room across the entire front
of the building. It will serve as a well-
lighted and quiet study hall accommodating
350 students. The third and fourth floors
are given over largely to graduate research
and instruction. Special rooms for faculty
members engaged in research are also pro-
vided on this floor.
With the completion of the new library
a beautiful building will have been added
to the Michigan campus. Its cost to the
State will be about $350,000, and it will be
fully able to take care of the needs of a
student body of as many as twelve thou-
sand.
During the week of March 5, a series of
lectures was given by Prof. L. W. Wallace
of Purdue University. The general sub-
ject was. "The Locomotive, Its Fuel and
Uses." This is the second of a series of
exchange lectures, which are given an-
nually by the two universities. Phases of
engineering which are foreign to the cur-
riculum of one of the colleges, constitute
the subject matter. Professor Zowski gave
the exchange course of lectures at Purdue
University. The general topic of his
speeches was "Hydraulics." a subject not
taught at Purdue. Professor Wallace's
talks awakened keen interest. The results
of exhaustive tests on locomotives were
given, and the various phases of locomotive
engineering clearly discussed. Large crowds
greeted him at every appearance.
Mr. Ivan Cuthbert, '15E, is conducting
a series of tests in the M.E. Laboratory, on
heat coefficients and radiators. The re-
search work is being conducted under the
fellowship of the U. S. Radiator Co.
On March 7, a very interesting lecture
was delivered by Mr. J. M. Riggs. His sub-
ject was, "The Fall of the Quebec Bridge."
The talk was illustrated, several excellent
slides being shown which gave a very clear
idea of the structure, as it appeared before
and after the catastrophe. Mr. Riggs was
an eye witness of the failure, and pointed
out the great possibilities of determining
the cause of the accident. At the present
time no one of the theories advanced is
generally accepted as authentic. A num-
ber of slides, depicting the progress of
construction on Hell Gate Arch, were also


107
shown. A large and enthusiastic audience
which more than taxed the capacity of
Room 311, greeted Mr. Riggs.
Prof. Henry E. Riggs of the Civil Engi-
neering department, attended the conven-
tion of the American Civil and Railroad
Engineers, held in Chicago early in March.
Next Fall, a new elective course will be
offered to senior electricals. It will give
the men an opportunity to experiment on
their own initiative, and will be known as
E.E. 9. The student is expected to make
an exhaustive study of some well known
phenomenon, under instruction. The fun-
damental purpose of the course is to en-
courage students to follow their own in-
clinations, and to give them a wider field
of activity.
Prof. H. H. Iligbie of the E.E. depart-
ment, is one of a committee of five ap-
pointed by the Society for the Promotion
of Engineering Education, to investigate
the teaching of physics in its relation to en-
gineering. There is a feeling that due to
the present methods of teaching physics,
students are unable to apply its principles
directly to problems of engineering. The
purpose of the committee is to recommend,
if possible, a method of teaching physics,
which will relate it more closely with en-
gineering proper.
On Wednesday evening. March 14, Maj.
Geo. G. W. Goethals delivered a lecture in
Hill Auditorium on "The Constructive
Features of the Panama Canal." He was
the guest of Dean M. E. Cooley while in
Ann Arbor. On Wednesday afternoon, the
General was initiated into Tau Beta Pi. as
an honorary member, along with the eleven
men elected from the junior engineering
class.
will be to aid in the solution of special prob-
lems of valuation, and will take him over
practically all of the 12,000 miles controlled
by this corporation. His headquarters will
be in the Grand Central Terminal, New
York City.
On March 22. Prof. J. R. Allen of the
Mechanical Engineering department, gave
a lecture at Columbus, Ohio. His subject
was ''Heat and Heat Transmission." In
the course of his lecture Prof. Allen stated
that formulas and mathematical solutions
cannot always be relied upon in solving
heating problems.
Prof. C. T. Johnston and Prof. H. W.
King will have charge of the surveying
work at Camp Davis during the coming
Summer. Other faculty men will include
Professors H. P&gt;. Merrick. H. G. Rasch-
bacher, H. Brodie and Mr. R. S. Swinton.
Besides these men, three graduate students
and seven senior engineers will assist in
the work. The graduate students are M.
Bleckman. W. Vintz, and R. A. Dodge.
The senior engineers are R. L. McNamee.
H. J. McFarlen, E. R. McLaughlan, V.
Donatelli. C. J. Pratt, K. H. Case and P.
C. Satterthwaite. Dr. C. B. Stouffer will
be camp physician.
On March 22, Prof. J. C. Parker of the
Electrical Engineering department, address-
ed the Detroit-Ann Arbor section of the
A. I. E. E., at the Detroit Engineering
Society Rooms. His subject was "Direct
Current Motors and Generators." This was
the fifth of a series of talks on difficult
problems which confront the electrical en-
gineer. Prof. B. F. Bailey addressed the
Society April 27, on "Alternating Current
Motors." On May 25 Prof. H. H. Higbic
will speak on "Alternating Current Trans-
formers."
Prof. A. R. Bailey of the Civil Engineer-
ing department, has accepted a position as
special engineer to the general valuation
council of the New York Central Lines.
He has been granted leave of absence, and
will not return until next Fall. His work
Mr. Porter H. Evans of the E.E. depart-
ment, is working on a device invented by
Ray E. Hall of Portland, Oregon, which en-
ables wireless signals to be taken on a tape
similar to the way in which telegraph mes-
sages are now taken.

Electrolytic Rectification of High Voltage
Alternating Currents
BY N. H. WILLIVMS AND J. M. CORK
Work has been done attempting to ob-
tain a high voltage direct current with a
minimum fluctuation, by use of aluminium-
lead cell rectifier. The arrangement of
cells used was the Nodon valve set-up,
which makes use of both parts of the A.C.
wave. With the four cell arrangement D.C.
voltages up to 300 volts may be obtained.
By the use of either a suitable inductance
in series, or sufficient capacity in parallel,
at such voltages, currents of the order of
two amperes were obtained, whose fluctua-
tion was no more than 5%.
For higher voltages a forty cell rectifier,
of same arrangement as above, was used,
having ten cells in series in place of a
single cell. With this arrangement it has
been possible to obtain a direct current of
3.000 volts, with a current of the order of
100 milliamperes. Further by use of suita-
ble capacity in parallel the fluctuation of
this current was reduced to about 8%.
Photographs of such currents were taken
by use of Siemens-Halsky oscillograph.
Effects of Cross-Magnetising Fields Upon
Hysteresis
BY N. H. WILLIAMS
The effect of an alternating magnetic
field applied at right angles to the direct
field while the hysteresis curve was being
traced has been investigated for steel spec-
imens of varying degrees of hardness. The
work was done with a Koepsel Permea-
meter, the specimens being in the form of
a tube. The tube was threaded with a
bundle of wires through which a sixty
cycle alternating current was passed. This
furnished a transverse field around the
tube while the longitudinal field for the
hysteresis curve was furnished by the in-
strument. The direct field reached a mag-
nitude of 150 gauss while the maximum
value of the alternating field was 80 gauss.
With soft specimens all traces of hys-
teresis disappeared, while with hard spec-
imens it was reduced till the width of the
hysteresis loop was less than one-tenth of
the normal width of the loop.
For soft steel, the magnetization curve
with the alternating field applied lies
almost wholly outside and beneath the
normal hysteresis curve. For hardened
specimens, it lies within the normal loop
except for large fields, it passes outside
and above it.
By assuming that the field at any point
in the iron is the vector sum of the two


109
applied fields, it has been possible to com-
pute the induction for any given field in-
tensity. The points thus determined are
found to lie very near to the experimental
curve. Two facts are clearly indicated:
(1) The observed effects are not due to
mechanical shock as has been assumed by
some. (2) With hard specimens there is
a distinct rotational hysteresis, i. e., a tend-
ency for the flux to maintain its magnitude
as it is forced to change its direction.
Magnetic Measurements
BY ARTHUR WHITMORE SMITH.
When a ring of Swedish iron is mag-
netized the iron does not instantly reach its
full magnetization, but the magnetization
continues to increase for some time. The
usual method for measuring the magnet-
ization of iron is to read the deflection of
a ballistic galvanometer when the magnet-
ization is reversed. But a galvanometer
reaches the end of its swing in 3 or 4
seconds and cannot measure changes tak-
ing place over a longer period. If the
change in magnetization lasts longer than
this, all of it is not measured, and the fol-
lowing investigation shows how much is
missed by the galvanometer in the case of
a ring of Swedish iron where it was ex-
pected to miss nothing.
A new form of galvanometer has been
obtained which stands practically at rest in
any position to which it may be deflected.
The action of this galvanometer is partic-
ularly interesting when it is connected to
a few turns of wire around a bar magnet.
When the magnet is slowly withdrawn, the
spot of light on the galvanometer scale
also moves slowly. If the magnet stops,
so does the spot of light. Every move-
ment of the magnet is reproduced as faith-
fully as though the mirror were carried
on the magnet itself. Perhaps the action
of this instrument is best explained by
saying that for every maxwell of flux cut
by the wire around the magnet, the coil
of the galvanometer must move enough to
cut one maxwell in the opposite sense.
When this instrument is used the total
change in the magnetization of the iron is
measured even though several minutes are
required to complete the full change.
In order to compare this galvanometer
with one of the usual type, both instru-
ments were used to measure the same flux.
The ring of Swedish iron was magnetized
beyond saturation and the current reversed.
Each galvanometer showed the same values
for the magnetic flux. At lower magnet-
izations the values of the flux as meas-
ured by the new galvanometer were con-
siderably larger than the values given by
the ordinary galvanometer.
In the case of solid pieces of iron it is
certain that there will be an induced cur-
rent whenever there is a change in the
magnetic flux, and this current will circu-
late in a direction opposite to that of the
magnetizing current. The effect of this
eddy current is to reduce the resultant
magnetizing force that is impressed upon
the iron, and of course the magnetic flux
cannot increase faster than the impressed
field.
It follows from this comparison of gal-
vanometers that the ordinary ballistic gal-
vanometer does not give the correct meas-
urement of magnetic flux even when the
cross section of the ring is only two or
three square centimeters, especially if the
permeability of the iron is high. In this
case it is necessary to use an instrument
which will measure the entire change in
magnetization even though this may be
extended over several seconds.
The full account of this investigation will
be published in the Physical Review.
ENGINEERING MECHANICS
Mr. Van den Broek, who has charge of
the Testing Materials laboratory this year
during the absence of Mr. Menefee, is en-
gaged in research on two problems.
The first problem is a study of the rela-
tive merits of square twisted against plain
steel hars used as a reinforcing material
in reinforced concrete beams. Some sixty
beams have been made ranging in size
from beams 6" deep and 4'-6" long to
beams t2" deep and 8'-6" long. Some of
these beams are designed to throw light
on the bond properties of the two different


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
types of bars, while others are designed to
compare the efficiency of the two different
bars under pure bending conditions.
The second problem is a study of "The
Effect of Cold Working on the Elastic
Properties of Steel." This problem is an
outgrowth of the first, but nevertheless in
magnitude overshadows the first problem.
It has been known for a long time that
cold working affects materially the elastic
properties of steel and recently Beilby and
Rosenhain in England have advanced some
very interesting hypotheses in attempts to
explain these phenomena. Nevertheless
misunderstanding relative to it is preva-
lent and no extended data treating with
the problem in a large aspect seem avail-
able. It is generally stated that "cold
working," by which is ordinarily meant
"cold stretching," raises the elastic limit in
tension but decreases the elastic limit in
compression even more than the amount
it is raised in tension. It is also stated that
cold working decreases the ductility of the
metal and makes it extremely brittle
About a hundred specimens have been
tested by Mr. Van den Broek and stress-
strain curves plotted for them. While
most of the previous investigations have
confined themselves to cold stretching in
tension and then testing the specimen
afterwards in tension again and rare-
ly testing such specimen in compression,
Mr. Van den Broek has designed apparatus
by which he can cold work specimens in
compression and then test the specimen in
compression, tension or torsion, as he
chooses. He has succeeded in compressing
a bar of I sq. in. cross section and 20"
length down to a length of 17" without
buckling the specimen in the process.
Not satisfied with studying the effects
of tensile or compressive cold working on
the elastic properties of steel in tension or
compression he has carried his experi-
ments over into the field of torsion. The
elastic limit of a shaft in torsion has been
raised 200% by cold working in torsion
while the elastic limit of mild steel in ten-
sion or compression can easily be raised
100%.
As to the contention that raising the
elastic limit intension by cold working
lowers the elastic limit in compression,
these specimens have shown that that is not
the case.
As to the statement that cold working
decreases the ductility, Mr. Van den Broek
believes that if there is practical signifi-
cance to his work it is largely in the fact
that the ductility of the high elastic limit
steel he obtained is relatively very large.
It seems pretty well established in metal-
lurgy that high elastic limit is usually ob-
tained aX the expense of ductility, whether
it is obtained as the result of increasing
the carbon content or by heat treatment.
An ordinary piece of steel with elastic
limit of 60,000 lbs. per sq. in. will break
without any appreciable percentage of
elongation or percentage reduction of area
and cannot be bent to any extent.
Steel which has its elastic limit raised
from 33,000 lbs. per sq. in. to 66,000 lba.
per sq. in. by cold stretching shows a per-
centage reduction of area of 64% and will
submit to being bent double and completely
close up on itself without showing any
cracking in the bend. Therefore, although
the ductility is reduced by cold working it
still more than satisfies the most stringent
specifications for structural steel.
It is well known that cold stretching de-
creases the density of steel. It is inter-
esting to know that four specimens of
steel, two of tool steel and two of mild
steel, which were compressed from ij4"
length to yi" length had their density also
decreased by 0.22 of one per cent, and not
increased as one might imagine. Mr. Van
den Broek will present the results of this
year's research on "The Effect of Cold
Working on the Elastic Properties of Steel"
before the Steel Treating Research Club of
Detroit in May.
THE FLOW OE WATER THROUGH
PIPES
BY O. W. BOSTON
In order to determine accurately the
discharge of any pipe, we must first know
the conditions under which the pipe is
discharging. These conditions are so in-


in
determinate that our theoretical formulae
give only approximate results. Accurate
results may be had for every particular
case, however, if we modify the several
quantities involved by coefficients or ex-
ponents which have been predetermined by
experimental work.
For instance in the case of a straight pipe
flowing full and discharging under a con-
stant head into the atmosphere the only
losses in head to be considered are: I,
the head loss at entrance; 2, the head loss
due to friction between pipe and the mov-
ing water; 3, the loss due to internal fric-
tion of the water. The second and third
losses are classed as friction loss as it is
too difficult to differentiate between them.
In this set of experiments constants will
be determined for: 1, entrance loss; 2,
friction loss; 3, bend friction loss; 4, sud-
den contraction loss; 5, sudden enlarge-
ment loss; 6, valve friction loss, etc. These
constants are to cover pipes ranging from
one to eight inches internal diameter and
discharging under heads from 6.8 feet to
o, (velocity 21 feet per second to o.)
The intention of this article is to discuss
the first of these losses, namely, entrance
loss. Consider water as it flows from a
tank through a straight pipe. The water
will enter the pipe under the same condi-
tions as it discharges through an orifice.
Just outside the orifice the area is con-
tracted so that the pipe does not flow full.
Farther along the pipe this area is in-
creased to that of the pipe and the pipe
flows full. This increase in sectional area
causes eddying which in turn gives rise to
considerable friction. This friction added
to the friction at entrance and along the
sides of the tube gives the loss between
the point at which water enters the pipe
and the point at which the pipe flows full,
called entrance loss.
According to an experiment by Prof.
Pardoe, of the University of Pennsylvania,
published in the Engineering Neies, Sept.
14, 1916, the length of a two inch tube, in
order to flow full, varies with the head.
The two inch diameter tube of his experi-
ment flows full at approximately six inches
or three times the diameter, under a head
of eight feet. It also shows that his length
decreases as the head lowers.
Eetween the entrance of the pipe and the
point at which the pipe flows full there is
a partial vacuum. This vacuum is a max-
imum at the point of greatest contraction
and equal to three-quarters of the available
head. It is for this reason that the dis-
charge of a short tube is greater than that
of an orifice. Engineers vary as to the
ratio of the length to the diameter in a
short tube, average values of length being
from two to three times the diameter.
In order to see that a successful ratio
is maintained with short tubes under all
heads from seven feet to zero, tubes and
flanges have been furnished through the
courtesy of the Crane Company of Chi-
cago, having diameters from one to eight
inches inclusive and a length of three times
the diameter.
For low heads, the tubes will flow full
through a portion of the length, from two
and one-half to three times the diameter;
however, this friction is slight and will not
be considered.
The tubes are threaded into their flanges
so that the end of the tube comes flush
with the face of the flange. The inner
edge is finished to present a knife edge
entrance or orifice. This flange is recessed
in a board which has been boiled in parafin
so that the surface of the flange and board
are flush and all irregularities on this sur-
face filled with parafin. The object of this
board is to present a plane surface from
three to four diameters of the tube on all
sides, to eliminate as much as possible un-
necessary eddies.
The apparatus used in these experi-
ments consists of a cylindrical cypress tank
eight feet diameter and eight feet staves,
a float and a chronograph, located in the
testing laboratory of the Civil Engineering
department. The short tube is extended
through the side of the tank about .8 feet
from the bottom, the wax board screwed
to the inside of the tank and the hole in
the tank about the tube stuffed to prevent
leakage. The opening in the tube is closed
by placing a piece of rubber gasket over it,
which is held in position by the pressure


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
of the water. A string is attached to this
gasket to control the discharge. A hook
gage is fixed in a position to register the
maximum convenient head above the center
of the tube and the tank filled till the sur-
face of the water coincides with the point
of the hook gage.
The weight of the float is greater than
the buoyancy effect of the water in order
to make the wave effects as small as possi-
ble, and is counter balanced. It is suspend-
ed on a small steel wire wound on an alum-
inum cylinder. The cylinder is of such a
size that one complete revolution will allow
the float to rise or fall exactly .4 of a foot.
A single brush is attached to the cylinder
and as the cylinder turns makes contacts
with four brass pegs, indicating equal low-
erings, .1 of foot each. At each contact a
circuit is completed and one chronograph
pencil registers the head. Another pencil
on the chronograph is attached to a circuit
in which there is a clock and registers the
time in half seconds.
In this way the time to lower each tenth
of a foot is determined from which data a
curve is plotted with the head in feet as
ordinates and the total time as abscissae.
The first differential of this curse multi-
plied by the cross sectional area of the tank
at that head, in square feet, gives the dis-
charge in cubic feet per second. Let this
be Q. Also the actual discharge is equal
to the area of the tube in square feet mul-
tiplied by the velocity in feet per second,
modified by a constant C, the coefficient of
discharge.
Q = C av = C a\'2gh. From which C is
determined.
It will be observed that the value of C
for one tube is determined for all heads
between the limits by one experiment.
A further discussion with data will fol-
low later.
ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
Mr. W. F. Davidson, Instructor in Elec-
trical Engineering, is investigating the rate
of growth of public utilities. He is devel-
oping empirical methods for predicting the
probable growth with a view to checking
estimates. This will provide an additional
basis from which to work when making
studies of the future growth and earning
power of a utility, the most economical
amount of reserve capacity to be installed,
and other questions of such nature. Up to
the present only electric power companies
have been studied and no data are availa-
ble for publication. However it may be
stated that for several central stations in
western New York, the average rate of in-
crease in total units sold is about twelve
percent per annum. The increase in light-
ing load is at a somewhat lower rate and
the increase in the power load somewhat
more rapid.
The various branches of the Engineering
Society have been quite active throughout
the Springtime. Many interesting lectures
have been given, covering the different
fields of engineering. Under the general
direction of the Society, a very interesting
talk was given by Mr. M. V. McMenimen
on Wednesday evening, March 21. His
subject was, "Subway Contracting and Es-
timating." Mr. McMenimen is a graduate
of the engineering college, and at the pres-
ent time, is vice-president of the Dock Con-
tractor Co. of Hoboken, N. J.
The student branch of the A. S. M. E.
has had two successful meetings. On the
evening of Thursday, March 1, three very
interesting papers were read by members
of the branch. Mr. Tom Tobey's subject
was, "Oil As Fuel." Mr. A. E. Hecker
read a paper on "The Mechanical Handling
of Concrete." and Mr. F. M. Sawin's paper
was entitled "Alcohol As Fuel."
On Friday evening, March 16, a very in-
teresting lecture was given in the audito-


"3
rium of the New Science Building, on
"From Ore to Finished Product," by a rep-
resentative of the \ational Tube Company.
The talk was illustrated with motion pic-
tures, and depicted the various steps in the
manufacture of National tubing.
The civil branch of the Engineering So-
ciety gathered in Room 311, on February
20, and enjoyed a lecture by Dr. H. W.
Emmen. His subject was "Bacteriology
and the Public Health."
The student branch of the A. I. E. E.
have also had two meetings. On Monday
evening, March 26, Mr. S. L. Crump spoke
on "Circuit Breakers." The lecture was
illustrated with slides and proved highly
interesting and instructive.
On March 1, Mr. A. M. Dudley, sectional
engineer for the Westinghouse Electric Co.
delivered an interesting lecture, "Induction
Motors." Mr. Dudley is a graduate elec-
trical of the class of 1902, and is considered
an authority on induction motors and in-
duction motor design.
The Chemistry branch of the Engineer-
ing Society held a meeting on the evening
of March 7. Mr. Van den Broek of the
Engineering Mechanics department spoke
on "The Effects of the Cold Rolling of
Steel." F. C. Binall, grad., talked on
"Methods of Increasing the Yield of Gaso-
line." D. W. Kaufman, '17E, who went to
the border with the troops, spoke on "Ex-
periences on the Mexican Border." All the
speeches were illustrated with slides. Re-
freshments and smokes were served and
everyone agreed that an enjoyable evening
had been passed.
Seniors—Fiuld Mapping


The Importance of Perspective to the Ar-
chitectural Student
BY ERNEST WILBY,
ASSOCIATE ARCHITECT WITH ALBERT KAHN.
Twenty or thirty years ago. every archi-
tectural student studied perspective as a
matter of course; to-day, judging by the
students and draftsmen who apply for posi-
tions in the office the writer is asosciated
with, very few have any knowledge of this
important part of an architect's education.
This would seem to be a serious mistake,
hurtful alike to the student and to the
work he expects and hopes to do in his
profession. Without an intimate knowledge
of perspective in all its phases, the design-
er is seriously handicapped in his work and
must of necessity fail to get the results he
would, if he had this knowledge.
Working in the flat and with lines in-
stead of planes, the success of his work
when produced in the building is more or
less of a guess, even with a good knowledge
of perspective. To make these mistakes as
few, and as unimportant as is possible
should be the aim of every designer. In
this a knowledge of perspective is invalua-
ble. Aside from its value as an aid to
design, the material value of perspective
should not be overlooked by the student.
If he has this knowledge in addition to the
usual qualifications of the draftsman, his
chances of obtaining a good position, a
good salary, and quick advancement in the
office in which he is employed, are greatly
increased; being more useful to the archi-
tect, more ambitious than his fellow drafts-
man, he obtains recognition more quickly
and he is given more opportunity to prove
his fitness to be entrusted with responsi-
bility in design.
Looking ahead to the day when the stu-
dent will himself become an architect, he
will also find that perspective is a good
business asset. Very few laymen have the
necessary technical knowledge required to
visualize the building from the architect's
line drawing. The architect speaks in a
language which the layman cannot under-
stand. It shows good business judgment
on the part of the architect, and is a nice
courtesy to the client to recognize this diffi-
culty to a complete understanding, by sub-
mitting one, or several perspective sketches
for criticism and discussion. It goes far
to win the client's confidence, removes many
difficulties likely to arise in satisfying his
client and makes the probability of the
building being entirely successful more cer-
tain.
To obtain the full mastery of perspective,
the student should take it up early in his
training. The theory of perspective is easy
to obtain from books or teachers, but its
full value can only be obtained by long
practice and constant use. The end in view
is to make it possible for the student to
think in perspective, to make it so inti-
mate a part of his architectural life that he
instinctively sees the lines and details, not
as they appear on paper, but as they wilt


"5
appear in the building. This is not easy,
and in obtaining this faculty perspective is
perhaps the greatest of all helps. Perspec-
tive also sharpens and refines the architect's
appreciation of beauty, the most illusive of
all things in a building and the most diffi-
cult to obtain. The quality of beauty in
architecture is apt to be lost in the mass
of detailed knowledge the architect has to
acquire before he can practice his profes-
sion with success; for this reason alone the
help of perspective more than justifies its
importance as a part of the designer's train-
ing.
The student in approaching perspective
should dismiss from his mind the highly
finished drawing made by the professional
renderer. These can always be obtained
for a price and occupies a very small part
in the scheme of things architectural. What
is wanted is the workaday perspective of
the office, a quickly rendered sketch in pen-
cil, ink, wash or color often made in a few
minutes, generally in a few hours but rare-
ly in days. With practice and a knowledge
of the short cuts and stunts used to save
time, making these sketches seems almost
like play, and very different from the tedi-
ous old-fashioned way of doing things. It
is not too much to say that a perspective
sketch can and should be made in from
one-half to three-fourths of the time re-
quired to render the two elevations in what-
ever medium is used for the sketch. These
short cuts are of the greatest help and the
student should make a point of finding out
how to apply them after he has mastered
the theory of perspective. This he can do
by careful thinking and experiment, but to
save time it would be well to get hold of
an experienced perspective man and get him
to divulge.
Rendering is naturally a part of perspec-
tive and should proceed hand in hand with
it, also as much outdoor sketching as time
and opportunity allow.
The essential thing is for the student to
start early and keep pegging away till by
constant practice, thinking in perspective
becomes natural, after which he may or
may not make perspective drawings. This
ceases to be important for having learned
how to think in perspective, the buildings
he designs will show this knowledge and
be the better for it.

Adams St., Chicago, III, Secretary.
The 1915 Class of the University must
certainly be commended in undertaking that
which has never been attempted before, a
Class History Book, "Facts for Fifteeners."
Returns on the "News-sheets" sent out to
each class member indicate the spirit with
which the idea is being taken up by every-
one and there can be no doubt of the ven-
ture proving a big success. The purpose
of the book is two-fold. It is to heighten
interest in the class reunion next June, and
to provide a complete current history of
the 1015 Class. The book will be issued
every five or ten years.
A fee of one dollar will cover the cost
of the book which will also provide for a
credit of fifty cents on the class dues, so
that the price of the History is virtually
only fifty cents.
We all know that the work of putting
out a publication of this kind must of ne-
cessity be tremendous, and we hope that the
1915 Engineers will do all in their power
to aid those in charge.
Incidentally, in picking the costumes for
the June reunion, it might be well to re-
member the '14E hats where service was
combined with "looks." Each hat would
hold a gallon.

OVERLAND SAVES
$40,000 IN COAL
Utilization of Sawdust and Scrap
Cuts One-Third Off Fuel
Bi'i of Plant.
The degree to which what were formerly
waste products are utilized in large menu
facturing establishments is surprising to
one not familiar with the present-day
methods.
In the Toledo plant of the Willys-Over-
Lana company utilization of sawdust and
scrap from the wood-working departments
alone saves $40,000 per year in the coal bill.
To operate the Willys-Overland drop forge
plant, in which there are 60 steam hammers,
and to heat the 25 acres ot new building*
just completed, 10 huge boilers of a total of
3,800 horse-power capacity are required.
These boilers would consume 200 tons of
coal for every winter day if it were neces-
sary to use coal. The use of waste from the
wood-working shops saves almost one-third
of this and virtually eliminates need for
coal in summer.
Can I Burn
Sawdust
and
Wood Refuse
in a
Murphy
Stoker?
iiiiiiiiimiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiMiiiiiiiiiiiii'-
Yes—the Willys-Overland 1
Company is doing it—at a saving of $4o,ooo.oo per year. Likewise such manufacturing s
plants as —
FORD MOTOR CO., Detroit AMERICAN HAROW CO., Detroit E
T. G. BRILL &amp; CO., Cincinnati MANSON CAMPBELL CO., Chatham, Ont. S
CINCINNATI COFFIN CO., Cincinnati E
are using sawdust and wood refuse as fuel for Murphy Stokers with great saving and high Z
efficiency. E
During this fuel famine the Murphy Stoker is proving its real ability to manufacturers in ^
every line of industry. In some big plants you find the Murphy burning sawdust and ordiu- —
ary wood refuse—in hundreds of others you will discover the Murphy efficiently handling the ZZ
poorest grades of bituminous coal—even the "stoker fodder" (mine refuse) which is prac- —
tically the only available fuel on the market at the present time. j~
The Murphy will Burn 1
Your Cheapest Fuel 1
Install Murphy Stokers in your boiler room and you can burn the fuel which comes at the S
fairest price and in the most abundant supply in your own particular locality. ™
The Murphy is easily adapted to burn practically any kind of fuel—and you will pay for the —
equipment in actual cash saving between now and the time normal fuel conditions are estab- E
lished again. «
As the largest individual manufacturers of stokers in the world we can make reasonably —
prompt shipments on all orders placed at once. Write us for absolute proof of big savings E
for representative concerns—and suggestions on how to handle the fuel question in your ~
own plant. S

CHARGING THE FURNACE
The modern method of charging the open-
hearth furnace is by means of the machine
shown above, which inserts a bucket full of
pig iron and scrap, turns it over and deposits
it in the furnace.
This is one of the first steps in the pro-
duction of steel castings, of which we have
an annual capacity of over 300,000 tons.

The Fall of thk Clock Tower


R.J. GRIFFITHS. VICE-PRESIDENT CENTRAL STEEL CO.
BETTER products require better material, and it was this demand created
by the need of higher strength steels that was the foundation for the
impetus imparted to investigational activity in metallurgical work in this
country.
This research activity has proceeded along definite prescribed chan-
nels and the experimental Metallurgist, like the Alchemist of olden days,
engaged in this meritorious occupation has contributed considerably to
the progress of American Metallurgy by the discovery of the properties
bestowed upon iron when alloyed with Chrome Vanadium. It is not a
little gratifying to contemplate the many problems which have been sur-
mounted as they presented themselves in the production of a Chrome
Vanadium Analysis Steel of general commercial value, and to witness
the growth of this Alloy Steel through the various stages of its develop-
ment, until it has assumed such dimensions as to be represented by a
large proportion of the total tonnage of accepted standard grades of
Alloy Steels manufactured today. The enthusiastic adoption of this par-
ticular Alloy Steel by the manufacturer of important parts which are sub-
ject to unusual stresses is silent testimony of the merits of this quarter-
nary alloy.
Chrome Vanadium Steel holds the position virtually at the head of
the commercial alloy steels and owes its prestige to the extremely
wide range of physical qualities which are capable of being developed
from this metal by proper methods of heat treatment. Like all alloy
steels it is, as its earlier name signified, a special steel, meaning not only
that it is designed for special purposes, but also, that its preparation for
the particular work it is called upon to perform must be carried out
along certain lines calculated to yield in the final result, those qualities
which shall represent a 100% efficiency in the final product. Many speci-
fications today allow an elongation range of only a percent or two variation
and restrict also the ultimate strength and yield point to extremely narrow
limits. Examination of these specifications alone would serve to show the
wide range of qualities of Chrome Vanadium Steel and the absolute delicate
accuracy with which by proper management it may be put into condition to
perform its highest functions.
Chrome Vanadium combines in such a manner with iron that the separ-
ate constituents of the final alloy produced cannot be distinguished regard-
less of the methods selected to separate them. Whether we adopt mechanic-
al means or use the microscope under large magnification the result is the
same, the discovery of a homogeneous blending of the allied elements which
defies detection of the constituent substances. This phenomenon indicates
a quite strong combination between the alloying elements and defines the
combination unmistakably.


It is generally recognized that when one metal alloys with one or more
other metals its properties are changed in a remarkable manner, the fusion
may be lowered, the hardness and strength increased, the ductility affected
proportionately and the transformation temperatures raised or lowered de-
pending upon the nature and characteristics of the alloying elements. There-
fore, by properly alloying a metal the properties of the metal resulting may
possess such profound qualities as to render the Alloy more adaptable for
the purpose for which its was originally intended. It is the endeavor to de-
crease injurious properties and to increase the desirable ones. For this
fundamental reason the iron alloys have become to a considerable extent
standardized and the alloys better known to metallurgy and fabricators are
the Nickel and Nickel Chromium Steels. Until recently little investigation
has been ventured to ascertain the definite properties of Chrome Vanadium
and the advantages secured by this alloying element were relatively un-
known except to a favored few who through their own research work ac-
quired intimate knowledge of the characteristics bestowed upon iron by the
addition of this alloy.
Chrome Vanadium alloys with iron in all proportions and affects the
properties to a marked degree depending upon the percentage of Chrome
Vanadium present. The qualities which become inherent are influenced also
more or less proportionately by the amount of carbon contained. In this re-
spect Chrome Vanadium Steel is a special steel in another sense of the word
and cannot be judged by the same standards as the old carbon steels. The
point of view of the examiner of the old commercial steels is always that of
the actual condition in which the metal exists as he sees it before him and
governed by the amount of carbon present. But this point of view has
altered gradually until with Chrome Vanadium Analysis Steel the carbon
range permissable to obtain specific characteristics has become narrowed.
The presence of Chrome Vanadium in Steel intensifies the effect of the
carbon in all the 'best qualities it is capable of producing alone. These
increases take form not only in physical results, dynamic strength, resist-
ance to wear, increased hardening power, lack of brittleness, etc., but also
in purity, soundness and homogeneity of the metal. These are the specific
contributions which chrome vanadium brings to iron as compared to the
older simple steel. Unfortunately many of these qualities enumerated have
no current and accepted method of measurement whereby they may be
offered on a basis for comparison. Figures, may be, and often are, offered
to show accurately the result of comparative tests which are intended as a
means of comparison of the functions of a particular steel, but ordinarily,
the test conditions would vary so much under the manipulation of other ex-
perimenters that no comparable results are really obtainable. In any event
the data submitted usually means nothing to the other man.
The property of soundness of the casting and ingots produced by the
use of Chrome Vanadium induces freedom from occluded gases and greatly
increases the desirable physical qualities of the forgings subsequently made
from this steel such as strength, ductility and resilience. These desirable
properties are amply proved not only from the results obtained from tests,
but also from the more vital trial of actual use. The user of an Alloy Steel is


'3'
concerned entirely with what ultimate qualities the metal is capable of de-
veloping regardless of the experience with which he may have previously
contended. Accordingly to the old view and judging from the results of
tests Chrome Vanadium Steel as rolled or annealed may appear to be a
worthless product. It may have, as in the examples given later, an elonga-
tion and reduction of area and an elastic limit and ultimate strength cor-
responding to simple carbon steel. I am laying stress on this particularly
because there is still a large and unreasonable prejudice in certain quarters
against the use of steels which have to be put in special condition, or more
plainly, heat treated, before they are capable of doing their best work. Of
course as we all know this feeling is largely giving away before the splendid
performance which steels of this character are offering in serivce and, given
sufficient time the special steels themselves will demonstrate the unsound-
ness of this objection based largely upon the limitations of the older simple
carbon steels.
In order to place the foregoing more definitely before you, in figures
rather than words, your attention is invited to the subjoined tests, which
are in no sense exceptional. They have been selected almost at random
from records merely for the purpose of illustration. You will note that
they cover briefly four classes of Chrome Vanadium Steel. First a steel
with a composition of about .31% Carbon, .95% Chromium at .14% Vanad-
ium; Second, a steel of 42% Carbon to .49% Carbon, approximately 1.10%
Chromium, and .15% Vanadium; Third, High Carbon Chrome Vanadium
Steel of a composition of .98% Carbon and 1.06% Chromium and .12%
Vanadium; Fourth, Low Carbon Chrome Vanadium Steel of an analysis
suitable for most structural purposes, namely, Carbon .24%, Manganese
.69%, Chrome 1.10%, Vanadium .15%. It is to be regretted that while we
are engaged on extensive tests of the third class of material mentioned, our
experimental data is not at present available for use here. However, the
extreme softness and ductility of this steel in the annealed condition may
be noted from the one example given. This result is rather surprising in
view of the high carbon content present.

After an examination of these tests which are concerned only with
the simplest quenching and drawing treatments, little comment is needed
to draw attention to what might be termed the versatility of Chrome Vanad-
ium Steel. One comment, however, based upon a practical consideration
and not upon theory, may well be made here. Tests results such as we have
just examined are valuable only so far as they are recognized for what they
are—Test Results. They represent, it is true, what it is possible todo with the
metal when it is in the finished state. But they do not necessarily represent
what the qualities of the metal in the final product will be if the heat treat-
ment is carried on under exactly the same conditions as those which obtained
in the tests. When it comes to a question of heat treating the final product
the conditions must of necessity be altered somewhat, and the treatment of
each class of articles then becomes a special problem. This should not be


Heating and Cooling Curves


considered in the light of an admission on the part of the .steel manufacturer
—it should be rather conceded as the principle by which he is most willing
to work.
One of the principal effects produced in steel by the addition of Chrome
Vanadium is to raise the temperature at which the Carbides dissolve in the
iron and the temperature at which they are precipitated out of solution.
This elevation of the solution temperature is quite noticeable, the carbon
content affecting this temperature but slightly. In connection with the ques-
tion of the position of the critical ranges of Chrome Vanadium Steel four
charts are inserted here showing both the heating and cooling curve ob-
tained by means of a Leeds-Xorthrup Transformation Point Apparatus.
Upon reference to these charts a quite remarkable characteristic is demon-
strated. The peak of each curve on heating occurs at between 770 degrees
C. and 793 degrees C. and the greatest extension of the cooling curve is
found to branch out at about 695 degrees C.
The curves, taken with the Leeds Northrup apparatus mentioned
above, indicate the temperature relationship between the sample being
tested and a uniformly heating body heated together in the same fur-
nace. In the chart the actual temperatures are plotted as ordinates and
the temperature differences as abscissae. The temperature differences
however are not given definite values in degrees in these curves in as
much as this is taken care of by the instrument itself which is specifically
designed to record this difference autographically.
These four steels have respective carbon contents of .17, .22, .49 and
1.05 percent with varying chromium and vanadium content, and show
the wide transformation ranges at the high temperatures characteristic
of this alloy. It will be noted from these charts that the range of tem-
perature intervening between the completion of the upper transforma-
tion on heating and the completion of the lower transformation on cool-
ing is approximately as follows:
Chrome Vanadium Steel with .17% Carbon 183 degrees C.
Chromc Vanadium Steel with .22% Carbon I/O degrees C.
Chrome Vanadium Steel with .49% Carbon 138 degrees C.
Chrome Vanadium Steel with 1.05% Carbon 100 degrees C.
These charts furnish conclusive evidence that when Chrome Vana-
dium is added to steel it raises the critical points on heating above the
corresponding carbon steel, temperatures, but on cooling the critical
point is considerably depressed roughly in proportion to the maximum
temperature reached the lower the critical range will be on cooling
temperature from which the steel is cooled. The higher the maximum
This fact serves to show the slowness with which the structural changes
occur in this metal and the additional time required for the transforma-
tion to be affected completely. It is unnecessary to point out the prac-
tical utility, in commercial practice of working with a steel in which
this slow rate of transformation can be taken advantage of by the use
of higher temperatures without resulting in injury to the product and


also by the fact that the steel can stand exposure at these higher tem-
peratures without the attendant harmful effects characteristic of other
steels subjected to the same conditions. In fact, Chrome Vanadium
seems to attain its greatest combination of desirable qualities at higher
treatment temperatures than would be expected from the location of its
critical range due principally to the greater length of time necessary to
effect the complete transformation of its constituents into a uniform and
homogeneous solid solution. This point is emphasized because certain
other commercial alloy steels, which although excellent in many re-
spects, have very narrow limits of annealing and hardening temperatures
and therefore require unusual care in their treatment and in which a
slight deviation from the correct temperatures results unsatisfactorally.
A single quenching and drawing treatment, as we have seen from the
tests submitted, is sufficient for general purposes to effect complete re-
finement and hardening of Chrome Vanadium Steel. This character-
istic of 'simplicity in treatment obviously insures a high grade product
under ordinary commercial conditions, and when compared with the
double and triple heat treatments required for the refinement of other
Alloy Steels, the economy presented is obvious. These properties pos-
sessed only by Chrome Vanadium Alloy characterize this steel as a
material universally applicable for any commercial requirement. These
properties also simplify the treating instructions necessary to handle
successfully Alloy Steel of this analysis. One heat treating specifica-
tion is adaptable for any carbon analysis whether the steel is destined for
case hardening purposes or for oil treating for gears and cones, etc. It
has been found by experience that a temperature of 775 degrees C. which
is suitable for hardening a case hardening steel and still retain desirable
toughness of the core can also be employed for hardening oil treated
parts.
The lower carbon Chrome Vanadium Steels are apparently pearlitic
in nature and and as such possess the increased strength and hardness re-
sulting from the effect of the special elements in producing a ferrite of
superior strength subsequently resulting in a more dense and improved
pearlite. With the increase in the carbon and alloy contents, this steel
becomes more or less cementitic and it is probably this quality which
demands the use of higher temperatures than usual in treatment in order
to produce complete absorbtion of its component parts.
The quality of Chrome Vanadium Steel often described as "Tough
Hardness" is one of its especially desirable properties and is due prob-
ably to the somewhat finer and denser structure of the microscopic con-
stituents and to their more uniform distribution. This effect is ob-
tained not only through the actual influence of the Chromium and Vana-
dium as component parts of'the Alloy, but also to the influence of the
combination of both of these elements in producing in the molten metal
a condition of purity and freedom from gases, and, therefore, subse-
quently forming a metal which, at the time when the structural changes
S


occur, is in the best possible condition for these changes to take place in
the highest form in which the Alloy composition renders it possible.
We have found then from the foregoing remarks substantiated by
conclusive tests that Chrome Vanadium Steel can be truly described as
a universal steel. With the carbon present in variable amounts, almost
any physical property desired can be secured. It is adaptable for case
hardening where the carbon should not exceed .20 percent. For axle
shafts, etc., where nominal strength is essential; for oil treated gears
and vanadium springs where great resilience and resistance to repeated
shock is required; for dies, where surface hardness and toughness
have to be hand in glove; for drills, etc.., where wear resisting qualities
and lack of potential brittleness is necessary; fo~ cones and raceways
of bearings which have to possess a glass hard surface accompanied with
proportionate toughness to prevent checking and cracking under the
stresses imposed, Chrome Vanadium Steel is employed to advantage. The
adaptability of Chrome Vanadium Steel is general and where, strength
and hardness and resistance to fatigue properties are prerequisite,
there is a Chrome Vanadium Steel for the purpose. When the steel is
case hardened a glass hard surface and tough fibrous core is easily ob-
tained. These properties are obtained without complex treatment. A
simple quench and reheat and quench completing the treatment. For
other heat-treated parts, a simple heat and quench and draw gives a steel
relatively so tough and strong that it is unlike any other hardening alloy
steel. Chorme Vanadium Steel is a universal Alloy Steel and stands
forth unmistakably as the Master Alloy.
Appendix
As a matter of interest we have pust now received a record of tests
made by a large automobile manufacturer using Chrome Vanadium
Steel for principal parts. The tests given represent those made from
.30% to .40% Carbon Chrome Vanadium analysis steel used for axle
shafts and demonstrate results that are secured from routine practice.
The uniform strength exhibited supplies incontestable testimony of the
dependable qualities inherent in this analysis steel when treated in com-
mercial qualities.

D. N. A. BLACET. METALLURGIST CENTRAL STEEL CO.
IT HAS only been within the last several years that the use of Alloy Steels
has become general. The advantages secured by their use were practically
unknown except to the favored few who through their own research work
acquired intimate knowledge of the characteristics bestowed upon iron
by the addition of the various alloying elemnts. Only within the last
fifteen years have Alloy Steels been seriously considered by metal fabri-
cators to be required to insure a quality of product manufactured and
placed in service. That Alloy Steels have become so popular in so short
a time is silent testimony of their superior characteristics as compared to
common Open Hearth Steel, and the success that has been attained by their
use is gratifying to the many pioneers, practical or technical, who have con-
tributed by their efforts to educate metal manufacturers to adopt Alloy
Steels for important parts.
To realize the practical importance of Alloy Steels it should be borne
in mind that the physical properties, that is those characteristics to which
this grade of material owe their unusual industrial application, are closely
related to their ultimate composition, which composition is revealed by
chemical analysis. The analytical chemist informs us that the steel con-
tains a given amount of carbon and nickel and chromium, or vandium, and
from his findings we can form an idea as to the properties that can be
obtained, whether the steel may have a tenacity of 75,000 lbs. per square
inch, or of some 200,000 lbs. per square inch, a ductility represented by an
elongation of 20% or without any ductility, or whether it can be treated in
such a manner as to be file-hard or so soft as to be easily machined.
We believe it is not out of place to reproduce here a discussion of
the manufacture of Alloy Steels given before a Research Club recently as
a preface to their impractical application before we enter into a discussion
of the definite properties of the different Alloy Steels.
In years past, the practice in steel metallurgy was to melt a charge
consisting of pig iron and scrap, with the addition of certain fluxes for
the oxidation and removal of the impurities contained in the bath of metal-
lic iron lying on the hearth. When the reaction between the oxidizing
substances and the inherent contaminations in the bath, namely, sulphur,
phosphorus, silicon, and carbon, was more or less complete, the beat was
tapped and the steel converted into merchantable product.
These remarks, in a rough manner, describe the prevailing method of
steel manufacture antecedent to the development of alloy steels. The in-
troduction of alloy steel, their gradual development and later popularity
required that the steel be of absolute purity, free from foreign and detri-
mental constituents, a steel which would withstand severe and continued
stresses and strains without any liability to fracture or failure in actual
service. The sluggishness of metallurgy's early advance underwent rapid
acceleration. It has been raised to a standard, a higher standard than was


thought possible to, attain to a few years ago. The steel of yesterday is dif-
ferent from the steel of today. It represents quality. Literally the manu-
facture of steel has been elevated to a work of art from the charging of
the material in the furnace to the finished product.
The manufacture of alloy steel does not commence in the open hearth
furnace. It begins in the scrap yard, or farther still, the director of pur-
chases is more or less directly responsible for the final product. Certain
specifications are adhered to; the selection of the scrap which enters into
the charge must comply to the limits of the specifications covering the
chemical and physical requirements. Samples are taken from each car
received and submitted to the chemical laboratory for analysis. If the
constituents do not conform to the particulars mentioned, in every sample,
the car is rejected. By this method, scrap, in all that its name implies,
any refuse or discarded metal that will melt, is not accepted, and only
carefully selected material is delivered to the open hearth for conversion.
The importance of the character of the scrap to be melted is obscured by
the pig iron selected for the charge. You are acquainted with the classi-
fication of pig iron depending on its composition according to the purpose
for which it is intended. The selection is arbitrary. Pig iron which was
formerly graded by breaking the pig and examining the fracture has been
altogether superseded by chemical analysis. If the alloy steel is manu-
factured in an acid open hearth furnace, an iron high in silicon is essential.
But if on the contrary, the alloy steel is to be melted in the basic open hearth
furnace, the content of sulphur and silicon is closely held within narrow
limits. The enormous tonnage of steel today of special analysis is made
in the basic furnace. The silicon content, therefore, of the pig iron is of
special interest. For, whereas, silicon is required in acid practice, its pres-
ence in a basic furnace is extremely harmful. It is so corrosive that it
attacks the bottom and sides very rapidly and special precautions must
be observed to prevent the destruction of the walls altogether. Silicon ef-
fects the slag in such a manner as to place the slag very quickly beyond
the control of the melter in charge. The slag becomes raw and thin, im-
pregnated with oxides. The steel in contact with this "rash" protective
covering is contaminated in direct proportion to the percentage of oxides
in the slag. For these reasons, where "Quality" is the watchword in the
manufacture of alloy steel, every consignment of pig iron is analyzed to
insure that the proportion of unavoidable impurities introduced into the
charge is reduced to a minimum. The charge for the ordinary mild carbon
alloy steel consists of approximately sixty percent of pig iron and the
absolute necessity of exercising every precaution in the pig iron preferred
becomes readily apparent.
Previous to the introduction of the scrap and pig iron into the furnace,
limestone is charged on the bare hearth. The stone is charged for the
mirpose of fusing with the barren minerals of the ore and pig iron and
scrap forming a union with these impurities, a molten slag, a silicate, which
rises slowly through the molten bath, accompanied by the oxidized min-
erals. As a result of this ascent through the bath the iron is cleared of


unavoidable contaminations and represents practically pure metallic iron
with impurities reduced to a fraction of one percent. However, to further
the result desired, steps must be taken to prevent the use of limestone with
impurities in greater percentage than is contained in the bath which it is
to purify. For this fundamental reason samples of limestone are taken from
each shipment received and if upon analysis the silicon content exceeds
one and one-half to two percent, the stone is not accepted. One of the princi-
pal functions of the stone added to the bath is to effect the elimination of the
silicon and if the content of this element in the stone exceeds that men-
tioned, an amount of silicon would be introduced equal to, if not greater,
than would be contained in the pig iron and scrap. The slag which holds
the relics of the barren minerals would become excessively oxidized.
The oxides of the slag would transfer themselves to the bath lying di-
rectly under the slag. When once steel is oxidized beyond a safe limit,
costly methods must be adopted to cleanse the bath of this unmalleable
impurity. It is problematical whether steel is every thoroughly deoxo-
dized, but when this detrimental product of oxidation is unnecessarily
introduced the harm produced cannot be over-estimated. With the crudest
materials entering into the composition of a melt, you can observe the
manufacturer has to be ever alert to reduce to a negligible amount the
introduction of impurities in the steel which would materially alter the
character of the finished product.
Consistent with the selection of the crude materials which furnish
the fundamentals for the manufacture of steel destined for important
parts is the care observed in the use and selection of the ferro alloys and
metals added intentionally to the bath for the purpose of obtaining dis-
tinctive characteristics in the resultant steel. Not content with accepting
the stated composition of the alloys as mentioned in certificates of purchase
as sufficient precaution against chance of possible variation in percentage of
required constituents in the finished steel, the manufacturer of "Quality''
steel depends only upon his own laboratory for information regarding the
amount of carbon or chrome or maganese or nickel the commercial alloys
contain. The analysis of the alloys is imperative before incorporating the
alloy in the steel. These precautions are very essential in view of the fact
that high grade alloy steels are purchased subject to rigid specifications. If
the analysis of the finished steel does not correspond to the "spread" al-
lowed in the specifications, the steel is rejected by the purchaser. The
loss thus entailed by the manufacturer is very great and not commen-
surate with the cost involved of being informed of the exact alloys which
have been added to the steel in the furnace before tapping. This pre-
caution of analyzing the ferro alloys profits the manufacturer in two
ways. The salvage of the heat of Steel and efficiency in the use of alloys,
especially the more expensive alloys. This double saving is of definite in-
terest both to the purchaser and the manufacturer, especially at a time
when the price of material continues to rise and in some instances are
rising to those of the period of reconstruction. As a consequence the
methods practiced insures the production of quality steel and husbands
the supply of high priced material.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
After the selection of the materials has been effected, they are charged
in the furnace. The usual practice among alloy steel melters is to charge
the stone on the hearth followed immediately by the scrap and a portion
of the pig iron. After the scrap is partly melted the pig iron is charged
and the melting operation is allowed to proceed without further attention
until the charge is melted or the bath becomes "clear" in the vernacular of
the furnace men. When the bath is melted it is the endeavor of the melter
in charge to have approximately .50 carbon in the bath. This amount of
carbon allows for the relatively complete purification of the bath of oxides
and other impurities by the process of reduction of these oxides and sub-
sequent oxidation of the carbon. When the carbon is reduced to the de-
sired percentage which percentage is governed by the ultimate composition
of the steel to be manufactured, the alloys or ferro alloys are added to
the bath and melted. A deviation occurs from this practice in the manu-
facture of nickel steel in that the nickel is added at the beginning of the
charge and melted. The reason for this procedure is that the nickel is
very little oxidized during the melting process, the iron in the bath oxi-
dizing in preference. After the alloys are completely dissolved and mixed,
the heat is tapped and cast into moulds for subsequent conversion.
We have seen what extreme care is exercised in selecting the materials
that enter into the manufacture of alloy steel. Precisely the same pre-
cautions are observed in the subsequent operations to which the steel
is subject to convert the metal into merchantable product. Intermediate
between the casting of the steel into the ingot, and the rolling of the steel
into the billet is the reheating of the steel in the soaking pit. The heating
of the steel preparatory to rolling is most vital. Steel can be injured
as easily in heating as in melting.
If steel is overheated, or, speaking in the vernacular, the steel is
''washed" in the soaking pits, the protective skin is destroyed and the
virgin metal is exposed to oxidation by the flame or air during the rolling
process. If the steel, however, is not heated thoroughly, cracks, seams
and snakes will develop when the steel is quickly reduced in dimension
by the rapid passes of the blooming mill. For these reasons only exper-
ienced heaters are in control of the soaking pits. A washed ingot is a
capital offense in a mill where quality steel is the object of the operations.
In line with the careful manner in which the steel is heated and
rolled, is the rigid inspection of the finished steel which the development
of alloy steel has compelled the manufacturer to adopt. This inspection
takes form not only after the steel is converted into merchantable product,
but before the steel is formed into useable sizes. A resume of this practice
should be of definite interest to the ultimate consumer. Each ingot is rolled,
top end first. In this way the piped portion of the ingot is the first to
reach the shears. An arbitrary discard, namely, fifteen percent of the
length of the ingot, is cut into the scrap bucket. Following this pre-
caution a fracture test piece, usually 24 inches in length, is cut off. This
test piece is marked for identification with the ingot position in the heat and
the heat number. After this fracture piece is sheared the billets cut from


the remaining portion of the ingot are stamped with the ingot number,
the heat number and the billet position in the ingot.
The fracture piece above referred to is conveyed to a press, where
it is broken. If upon fracturing this test piece is discovered to be defective,
that is, if the remnants of a pipe or any segregation is apparent, a memor-
andum to this effect is made for future reference and the steel is dis-
carded. A billet of the particular ingot tested is singled out of the heat
and taken to the press for fracture purposes. If the billet is sound, and
tree from any physical defects, the remainder of the ingot is accepted as
sound steel. This practice is carried on with each ingot of every heat
manufactured and the result of this seemingly rigid method of inspection
is the shipment of steel from the works which will insure no rejections
from the ultimate purchaser on account of pipe or segregation of impuri-
ties.
There are other safety practices which have been developed in the
manufacture of alloy steel and each manufacturer has adopted individual
methods of safeguarding his product, which, under ordinary requirements,
would never have been considered necessary. This includes double in-
spection for seams and other surface defects; also pickling certain
analysis of steel billets to more plainly show the surface defects. There
are other practices which are being employed, but which are too lengthy
to discuss at this time.
The properties which only alloy steels possess owe these characteris-
tics in a marked degree, to the presence of one or more special elements,
which characteristics, however, are influenced more or less proportionately
but not chiefly or exclusively, by the proportion of carbon present. Alloy
steels are usually classified in two groups—those containing but one special
element are called ternary steels, being made up of iron, carbon, and but
one special element, while steels containing two alloying agents are known
as quaternary steels because of the fact they contain four constituents,
namely, iron, carbon and two special elements.
An example of ternary alloy steel is plain nickel steel and an ex-
ample of quarternary steel, is nickel chrome steel or chrome vanadium steel.
The alloy steels which are of commercial value are nickel, nickel chrome,
and chrome vanadium, but other alloy steels are used in particular branches
of manufacturing, namely tungsten, chromium, silicon, molybdenum,
chrome tungsten and chrome molybdenum steel. The latter mentioned alloy
steels are not employed in large quantities and to consider them at this
point would be irrelevant.
Nickel Steel
It has been determined conclusively that the element nickel dissolves
in iron in all proportions. It is to this phenomenon that nickel steel owes
its superior ductility as compared to carbon steels. The nickel steels of
commercial value seldom contain more than 5% nickel and the carbon con-
tent barely exceeds .50 per cent. This type of nickel steel is pearlitic
in structure. By this we mean that the presence of the amount of nickel
mentioned does not lower the critical point of the steel below the tem-
S


perature where transformation may occur. For example, if we have a
5% nickel steel with .30 per cent carbon, the transformation occurs at
about 7000 C. At this temperature the metal is so plastic that the trans-
formation of austentite and martensite into pearlite readily takes place.
The steel, therefore, becomes pearlitic. It is the pearlitic nickel steels which
are most widely used.
The larger portion of the tonnage of nickel steel manufactured does
not exceed 3.5 per cent in nickel while the carbon content is seldom
over .50 per cent. When compared to carbon steels, nickel steels show con-
siderable higher strength and especially higher elastic limit with equal
ductility and when compared with carbon steels of similar elastic limit,
the nickel steels possess much greater ductility. To state this more plainly.
the addition of some 3.5 per cent nickel in a carbon steel of .50 per cent
increases the elastic limit quite noticeably, while having but slight effect
on the toughness of the steel. Nickel also increases the hardness of the
steel and therefore, nickel steels are more resistant to wear. Nickel also
increases the resistance to shock when properly treated, but not so pro-
foundly as other alloying elements. The treatment of nickel steel is con-
siderably different than that of plain carbon steel. To develop the in-
trinsic properties, the hardening and annealing should be conducted at a
lower temperature than the hardening and annealing of ordinary steels of
like carbon content since the critical point of nickel steel occurs at lower
temperatures. This temperature varies with the nickel content and the
carbon content but for 3.5 per cent nickel steel with low carbon content the
change in structure should occur at 7250 C. on heating and on cooling at
about 650° C. With a higher carbon content this temperature is lowered
slightly but not appreciably. While it is generally admitted that nickel re-
tards the carburization of iron by case hardening, the core of nickel steel
articles are not coarsened by the temperature of the carboning operation.
As a consequence, the carburizing temperature is not held within such close
limits and one treatment is sufficient to effect refinement of case and core.
However, this apparent advantage is often obscured by the natural ten-
dency of nickel steel to laminate. This defect causes a weakness to de-
velop in points of stress where the lamination occurs parallel to the prin-
cipal strain.
Nickel Chrome
From our knowledge of the properties of nickel steels and of chrom-
ium steels, it is easy to foretell the properties and constitution of the
quaternary chrome nickel steels. Nickel steels being pearlitic and chromium
steels being chiefly pearlitic, we may expect that in chrome nickel steels,
with the proportion of carbon and nickel and chronium that is common in
commercial grades, that these steels will be pearlitic. The presence of both
nickel and chromium in the same steel produces a metal possessing the
valuable qualities of both nickel and chromium. The elastic limit is in-
creased without accompanying loss in ductility. The steel is considerably
harder when treated, and the hardening power persists almost to the center
of the treated piece, depending, of course, upon the section treated. This


145
property increases the wearing qualities of the steel and also gives it a
higher resilience. When hardened and tempered, chrome nickel steels yield a
fine martensitic structure, having greater shock resisting power than the
same structure obtained with carbon steels. They are especially valuable
therefore, for the construction of parts to resist wear and shock. They are
used extensively in automobile parts, machinery parts requiring consider-
able strength and for armor plates. For armor plates of course, the outer
face is case-hardened to resist penetration. To case-harden chromium
nickel steel the process is similar to that for plain nickel steels. The steel
is reheated after the case-hardening treatment, to a temperature slightly
above the critical range of the case and then quenched. Oil is usually
utilized for quenching this steel. On account of the presence of nickel it is
not essential to heat and quench from a temperature superior to the critical
range of the core before treating the steel to obtain refinement of the case,
although such procedure would yield a much tougher core. The practice
is to quench directly from the carbonizing pot in oil and then to reheat and
10 quench in oil. Quenching directly from the pot effects complete control
of the core and the subsequent treatment refines the case. The use of chrom-
ium nickel steel as a replacement material for carbon steel means greater
strength, and therefore, greater economy.
Chromium Vanadium Alloy Steel
Holding a position virtually at the head of all commercial alloy steels
is the chrome vanadium alloy steel. The introduction of a small amount
of vanadium into the various alloy steels increases the soundness of the
steel and increases their freedom from occluded gases. The action of van-
adium as a scavenger is generally recognized and the presence of nitrogen
in the steel treated with vanadium is considerably reduced. Vanadium in
conjunction with chromium also adds other desirable physical qualities to
the steel, such as strength, resilienscc, ductility. Vanadium forms a double
carbide with iron and therefore, its presence in the steel makes it cementitic.
The structure of chromium vanadium steel is materially different from that
of other alloy steels. The ferrite is much tougher and has properties
different from ordinary ferrite since it offers more resistance to the pas-
sage of cementite through it preventing its segregation and causing a more
uniform distribution through the steel. Further, the ferrite has a stronger
cohesion between its crystal surfaces and also greater resistance to abra-
sion. The vanadium containing cementite in the pearlite is not only
more evenly distributed so that the pearlitic structure is improved, but the
nature of the carbide formed is such that it statically and dynamically
strengthens the steel. Summed up, the component parts of the grain or
structure, of chrome vanadium steel, is so well distributed that the wear
resisting qualities are much higher than those of other alloy steels. Al-
though chrome vanadium steel possesses intrinsic qualities superior to
most alloy steels, yet of all the high grade alloy steels, chromium vana-
dium steel requires less care and attention in forging operations. This is
due to its high heating temperature without attendant deterioration. It


flows readily in the forging dies and owing to its resistance to oxidation
at high tempeatures, the steel conies from the dies practically free from the
objectionable scale that is so noticeable on parts made from other alloy steels.
Xo special knowledge, therefore, is necessary to successfully forge this
steel. After forging an annealing treatment only is required to put the
forgings in the best posible condition to receive the final or hardening
treatment. The annealed steel machines readily, cuts clean and does not
drag or tear. Several users have reported that it cuts with almost the same
ease as machinery steel. Although chrome vanadium steel responds readily
to heat treatment, it is not a delicate steel nor a difficult one to handle,
[laving an extremely wide hardening range (1500 to 1600 degrees F)
makes possible a production of high grade parts under commercial con-
ditions. This point is emphasized because certain other alloy steels have
been placed on the market which, although excellent in many respects, have
a very narrow range of hardening temperatures and require unusual care
in heat treatment, a slight deviation from the correct hardening tempera-
ture resulting unsatisfactorily. A single quench and drawing treatment
is sufficient to effect the complete refinement and hardening of chrome vana-
dium steel. When this treatment is compared with the double and triple
heat treatment required for the refinement of other alloy steel, the econ-
omy presented is obvious.
Chromium Vanadium Steel is a universal steel. With the carbon
present in variable amounts, almost any physical property desired can be
secured. It is adaptable for case hardening where the carbon should not
exceed .20 per cent. For axle safts, etc., where nominal strength is es-
sential; for oil treated gears and vanadium springs where great resilience
and resistance to repeated shock is required. For dies, where surface hard-
ness and toughness have to be hand in glove. For drills, etc., where wear-
resisting qualities and lack of potential brittleness is necessary. For
cones and raceways and bearings which have to possess glass-hard sur-
face accompanied with proportionate toughness to prevent checking and
cracking under the strains imposed, chrome steel is employed to advan-
tage. Its adaptability is general and where strength and hardness and
resistance to fatigue properties are the per requisite, there is a chrome
vanadium steel for the purpose. When the steel is case hardened a glass-
hard surface and tough fibrous core is easily obtained. These properties
are obtained without complex treatment. A simple quench and re-heat and
cjuench completing the treatment. For other heat-treated parts a simple heat
and quench and draw gives a steel relatively so tough and strong that it is
unlike any other hardening alloy steel. Chrome Vanadium steel is a uni-
versal alloy steel and stands forth unmistakeably as the master alloy.
Xo one will deny the manifest advantages that are secured by the
use of alloy steels for important parts in automobiles. For members
subjected to excessive strain, repeated and continued shock, an alloy steel
is absolutely essential. The rapid moving parts of an automobile develop
considerable friction and this friction cannot exist without promoting
depreciation of some part of the mechanism where it is present. In the


147
case of bearings it means deterioration of the bearing parts, which in
turn often results in serious injury to the parts the bearing support.
The parts which have to resist high torque strain are frequent cause of
annoyance on account of failure in service. The average motorist is not
mechanically informed and is to a large extent dependent upon the hon-
esty of the manufacturer of his car for quality of materials and efficiency
of the component parts. Fortunately, this confidence is not misplaced as
all American cars are thoroughly practical and capable of rendering ser-
vice more than commensurate with the amount invested. This efficiency
is obtained because of the utilization of alloy steels for important parts
and explains the practical standardization of the automobile. The stand-
ardization was not attained in a short period of time but has required
years to develop. Originally carbon steel was employed but on account of
increased demands for strength and absence of brittleness, alloy steels
became the logical substitute.
These remarks also apply to other fields of engineering. Machines.
for working steel, have component parts revolving at a rapid rate and
subject to friction and strain. For these parts alloy steel, and especially
chrome vanadium steel is particularly adaptable. Whether case-hardened
or oil treated, an alloy steel is the ultimate solution of the problem
presented.

CAL BUSINESSES
GEO. H. GIBSON, 97
'T^HE application of science proceeds
-*. at an accelerated pace. The days
have about gone by when one good
idea would keep a family in business
for several generations. No one dare
rest content, for as Solomon remarks,
"Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a
little folding of the hands to sleep, so
shall thy poverty come." Every man-
ufacturer, and particularly manufac-
turers of engineering appliances and
products, must maintain a constant
out-put of improvements and organi-
zation, and good will, and indeed, to
stay in business. As has been justly-
said, the invention of a new machine
or process—by some one else—may
be as disastrous as fire, and far more
likely to occur.
Moreover, the more progressive, the
more advanced, a concern is, the
greater will be its volume of new de-
velopments and improvements. In-
ventions breed inventions.
At the same time, the investment of
time and money in research and de-
velopment is a capital risk, that is,
the preliminary investigation upon
which the design of improved appar-
atus is based and the provision of
manufacturing equipment and organ-
ization for turning it out must large-
ly be paid for before the market for
it can be developed. It is only by
prompt enlightment of the prospect-
ive customer, in other words, by edu-
cational advertising regarding the ap-
plications and advantages of the new
article that the loss of time and the
waste which always intervene be-
tween the perfection of a device or
process and its general use can be re-
duced.
The introduction of new things
in a speculative venture bars the
timid—but for that very reason is
'highly profitable. Patents more or
less effectively insure to the originator
a safety zone, protecting him from
competition for a limited period that
he may have the opportunity to re-
cover his initial outlay. Advertising,
however, is equally useful, since it
can shorten the period of loss, con-
serving for profit-making a greater
portion of the 17 years' monopoly
conferred by the patent and increasing
the volume of profit. Advertising it-
self exerts an accelerating influence
on technical development, for before
advertising, one should have some-
thing worth advertising. Much of the
strategy in the competitive selling of
engineering appliances consists in or-
iginating better methods or designs,
or new and improved products.
Good business has been defined as
the art of selecting probabilities, and
it is certainly true that the greatest
successes in the engineering business-
es have come to men who had the abil-
ity to do the following things:
(e) Foresee the need or oppor-
tunity.
(2) Develop the solution, and
(3) Focus the attention of the pub-
lic upon the problem and its solution.
As examples, I might mention Edi-
son with the incandescent lamp, West-
inghouse with the air brake and alter-
nating current transmission, Hunt


149
with the rope transmission, Sturtevant
with the fans and blowers, De Laval
and Parsons with the steam turbine,
Babcock and Neister with the water-
tube boiler, Diesel with the oil engine,
the Wheelers with surface conden-
sers, Hill with technical journalism,
Thurston with technical schools. Pat-
terson with the cash register, Hers-
chel with water meters, Kent with his
handbook, and many others.
The inertia and prejudice which
must be overcome in the introduction
of a new device may be illustrated by
the experience of Corliss with his var-
iable cut-off four-valve steam engine.
After he had perfected and demon-
strated the remarkable savings of his
engine as compared with the engines
then common in this country, he
was still compelled to give the engines
away and take his payment in the fuel
saved during the first year's oper-
ation, in order to make headway.
Many people have the idea that the
invention is the important thing. Very
few engineering businesses, however,
are founded altogether on exclusive
and basic patents. They are based
rather on a combination of scientific
knowledge and business sagacity, with
the help of such protection, monopoly
or trading advantage as can be obtain-
ed from the detail of patents which it
may be possible to secure as the devel-
opment of the art unfolds itself. A
man may have the germ of a good
idea for a successful business, but
still nothing that can be protected by
a patent, even though patentable im-
provements will doubtless be discov-
ered upon developing the idea. Never-
theless, the essential factor is the
broad judgment or foresight which
leads him to take up certain matters
at a particular juncture, with which
he may carry out his ideas. In
such cases, the best protection to the
idea is advertising by means of which
he can promptly get the full benefit
of the potential demand for his pro-
duct before competitors have had time
to imitate and develop. Once he has
his organization and business well un-
der way, competition will be at a dis-
advantage.
For businesses up to a certain size,
there is nothing that will beat one-man
efficiency. The man who can see a
need or an opportunity for a need and
act accordingly is fit to be at the head
of a business, if he is also an adminis-
trator. However, the organization of
modern industrial enterprizes branches
out into a great multiplicity of spec-
ialized details and we cannot always
get in one man all those qualities of
genius that are necessary in the in-
ventor, in the captain of industry and
in the promotion expert. We, there-
fore, have performing these functions,
a number of men who may be describ-
ed as follows:
First, there is the general strate-
gist, who may have the title of presi-
dent, general manager, chief engineer,
and not infrequently sales manager,
since the study of how to sell a pro-
duct as already built leads almost in-
variably to the discovery of improve-
ments whereby it can more easily be
sold in larger volume and at a greater
profit. It is his disposition and func-
tion never to be satisfied with things
as they are. He is continually study-
ing the trend of engineering, scientific
and business developments with a
view to visualizing their probable fu-
ture course. His policy is to build a
monopoly of information and brains
and then to serve the public with little
or no competition by having the best
solution for each new problem as it
arises.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
A good example of the necessity of
appreciating research on the part of
the directors of industrial enterprises
is supplied by the editor of London
"ENGINEERING," who relates that
the firm of Simpson, Maule &amp; Nichol-
son, in their day leading manufactur-
ing chemists in England, became mil-
lionaires largely through the fact that
Nicholson was a very able chemist.
When he retired, the firm ceased to
develop. They employed several very
able chemists, but these had no con-
trol over the business policy and the
end was disaster. At one time their
leading chemist was the late Prof.
Meldola. When he invented his
blue, however, the firm refused
to take it up, and he accordingly pub-
lished an account of his discovery
with the result that it founded the
fortune of a leading German firm. The
successor of Meldola was Prof. Green,
who invented primulin, a dye of an
entirely new type. This the firm re-
fused to patent, and within a few
weeks it was in consequence made in
Germany, the whole advantage being
lost to England.
Again, some 50 years ago an in-
genius engineer invented the duplex
steam pump, standardized the type
and in time built up an able and ag-
gressive engineering, manufacturing.
and sales organization. Its success
having been demonstrated, this type
of pump was taken up by numerous
competitors, each of whom developed
a complete line, and a comparison of
the bulky and closely printed cata-
logs with page after page of tabu-
lations of sizes and models of duplex
pumps issued by the dozen or so
builders will indicate the immense
amount of money invested in draw-
ings, patterns and manufacturing
equipment, not to mention catalogs
and advertising. Partly because of
pressure of competition, seven or
eight of the largest of these concerns
went into a merger and eventually in-
to the hands of a receiver. All of
their pumps, regarded as assets upon
which to base a growing business,
have now become practically obso-
lete, or at least greatly depreciated in
value by the perfection of the more
compact, simple, reliable and efficient
steam-turbin-driven centrifugal
pump as used in all services from
boiler feeding to city water works
supply.
The steam-turbine-driven centrifu-
gal pump requires precise, scientific
design, and accurate manufacturing
methods, in order to secure both ef-
ficiency and reliability, but if some of
the original pump builders had devot-
ed a modest fraction of the time and
money spent in copying other recipro-
cating pump builders, to intelligently
directed research and commercial de-
velopment work, they might, while
continuing to supply the demand for
reciprocating pumps then existing,
have created a new and exclusive mar-
ket for themselves. It, however, re-
mained for entire outsiders, steam
turbine builders, to perfect and intro-
duce the steam-turbine-driven centri-
fugal pump.
Second, we have, or should have,
the inventor or research man. His en-
deavor specifically is to put the exist-
ing business out of business by bring-
ing out something better. He must be
an independent thinker, and his de-
partment is primarily a thinking and
scientific intelligence department
largely free from dictation and direc-
tion by minds engaged in the routine
of the business. The business man is
generally about as good an inventor or
research man as the inventor is a busi-
ness man.


151
I have separated the research man
from the designer, as it is not so nec-
essary that the researcher inventor
should design as that he should be able
to see things from both the maker's
and the user's points of view, have a
wide play of fancy and the power to
co-relate facts.. He reads everything.
He may even at times take delight in
considering the improbable or the un-
likely from a spirit of mere novelty
and adventure. The man who makes
radical inventions is a man of vision,
and perhaps of visions. One thing
is sure, he must not be overburdened
with routine, must not travel in a rut
and must never entertain the idea that
anything has reached finality, or that
he has done his utmost. He can quite
properly be stimulated to venture free-
ly in the quest for good ideas by some
kind of contingent reward, something
that will make the work interesting.
He should not be discouraged by in-
definite, intangible promises or by the
offer of a mere fixed salary that may
stop at any time.
A few concerns have grasped the
value of always pushing forward; it
is said, for example, that one automo-
bile builder spends $500,000 per year
in research and development. A great
number, however, hardly do more
than trust for their progress to the in-
constant and flickering light of chance
ideas.
The third member of our ideal
technical business organization is the
designer, the man who works ideas
into shape for the shop and the user.
While upon his sagasity and skill de-
pend tremendous economies in manu-
facture, as well as satisfactory per-
formance of the finished article, he is
essentially conservative, a stand-pat-
ter, having a keen realization of the
fact that every scratch of a drafts-
man's pencil costs money in the pat-
tern shop, foundry and machine shop.
The attempt to conduct research in
the production department usually de-
moralizes the latter while rendering
the research potent. It is in this de-
partment that production branches
from the line of our present discus-
sion, and I shall therefore at once pass
to the next man—the one who proba-
bly most interests you, the publicity
or advertising man.
The advertising manager of a tech-
nical business should seek to grasp
new ideas in their full import, and in
all their applications, and endeavor to
estimate and appreciate their possible
and probable effects on existing prac-
tice in business. He works in close
co-operation with the administrative,
research and engineering departments,
in order that he may understand what
they have done and seek to do, and
that he may formulate and popularize
those ideas which will stimulate and
guide customers' demands in conform-
ity with their plans. It is his problem
to tell the public how to use the pro-
duct and why to use it, to make the
product more thought of and better
thought of, since the value which peo-
ple will place upon the product natur-
ally depends upon what they know
and think about it. He endeavors to
bring the user and producer closer to-
gether and seeks effective and econ-
omical ways for educating the user.
His problem is a little different from
that of the general adviser. He must
co-ordinate facts of physics, chemis-
try engineering and commerce "and in-
fuse into them the spirit and purpose
of a business. Exacting demands are
made upon his breadth of view and in-
dustry, but at the same time, his work
is facilitated because of the interest
which naturally attaches to new


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
things. There is nothing of human use
to which interest does not attach, and
anything that men may have to with
can be made to interest them in some
way. Engineers are naturally inter-
ested in new forms of construction,
new theories and tests and descrip-
tions of installations, and it is the ad-
vertising man's part to add pithy, suc-
cinct and forcible presentation.
In advertising to managers of enter-
prises, consulting engineers and oth-
ers who purchase engineering appli-
ances, he can to advantage appeal to
their desire for further knowledge,
and to the sentiments, beliefs and
ideas of wideawake, self-reliant men,
who probably have a large store of
systematically organized knowledge
which will bring to bear upon the
statements made to them. He must
therefore argue logically and with a
full command of the facts.
Engineering products are purchased
almost solely for their utilitarian val-
ue. Their usefulness can be weighed,
measured and computed in some way,
and they are usually purchased with
much deliberation, for the reasoning
faculties of the people who buy them
have been emphasized by technical and
business training.
The advertising should arise from
and carry forward the general ideas
and beliefs of the guiding mind of the
business. It finds inspiration in new
products and the exploitation of new
fields. As compared with this broad
purpose, the means and methods dis-
cussed in books on advertising, such
as typography and display, color of
ink, quality of paper, etc., are to a
degree only incidental—all that is ask-
ed of them is that they should do their
part in transferring ideas efficiently
and not get in the way of the main mo-
tive, which is the making use of the
spectacular qualities of advancement
and improvement and the doing or
saying of things interestingly.
The world is run largely on ideas
and the dissenination of ideas is the
business of the advertising engineer.

BEING A DISCUSSION OF GERMANY AND THE WAR
F. G. MARSTELLER, ELECTRICAL
HAVING HAD the great for-
tune,—or misfortune, if you pre-
fer,—to be born in Germany, and hav-
ing spent the greater part of my young
life over there, I have been asked
countless questions, by friends and
otherwise, just what I think person-
ally of the situation in general and the
fate of Germany in particular. Only
a small number seem to have any clear
conception and reliable impressions
concerning a few pointers of the im-
perial Germany; something of the his-
tory, form of government, her social
life. Only a few seem to be familiar
with her geography, with her mili-
tary clique, her weaknesses and
strengths. One of my acquaintances
greatly surprised me one day when
he squarely put up the question to me
whether or not they had street cars
in Germany. I told him that the more
well-to-do are being transported only
in carriages and the poorer classes
had to walk. If it would have been
within my control to suppress a smile,
while giving him this satirical reply,
I am convinced that he would have
swallowed the statement, pole, line,
hook and all. As a matter of fact,
the climax of my astonishment was
reached when one day, another devo-
tee of the fountain of knowledge re-
ferred in the course of a conversation
to "Berlin on the Rhine."
I have been requested for the bene-
fit of my fellow-students to give some
of my thoughts on Germany and the
great war. Naturally, since I am no
final authority on questions of such
momentous nature, my statements
must not be considered final, and be
taken for what they are worth. At the
outset, I wish to make it very clear,
that I am neither pro-German nor any-
thing but first of all pro-American. I
also desire to have it understood that
my sympathy for the great German
people is unquestionable, and that I
am a strong opponent to the present
autocratic and militaristic form of gov-
ernment. The philosophy of the lat-
ter rests upon the famous remark of
Bismark in the Reichstag that "not by
speechifying or a majority are the
big questions of our time settled,—as
was our great mistake in '48 and '49,—
but by blood and iron."
In spite of the fact that Bismark
warned his countrymen not to force a
war on any other nation without some
serious cause, history has shown time
and again that if the national objects
of Germany of his time, could not be
achieved by diplomatic intrigue or per-
suasion, the cure-all remedy of a blood
and iron policy was used as a final re-
sort. In mentioning the name of Bis-
mark, it is worthy of notice that he
was the one great diplomat Germany
ever produced, in fact one of the
greatest diplomats that the world has
ever seen. In spite of his unscrupul-
ousness and heartless brutality at
times, he showed a tact and a restraint
which stand in the sharpest contrast
to the diplomats of modern Germany
of which the name of Zimmerman is
infamously pre-eminent. It is a well
recognized fact, admitted even in Ger-
many, that in spite of her many-sided
accomplishments, her much-heralded


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
efficiency, Germany never yet suc-
ceeded in raising a respectable crop
of diplomats. The underlying causes
of such a consistent phenomenon
would indeed be well worth while of
the study of our physchologists.
The accession of the present Kai-
ser in 1888 marked the beginning of
a new epoch in the whole structure
of internal and foreign politics. It
must be remembered that the present
Kaiser, being jealous of Bismark's
powerful influences, entertained no
friendly relations toward him, These
became so acute that Bismark wisely
resigned in March, 1890, and the "Iron
Chancellor,'' who created a united
Germany, had vanished forever from
the horizon of political activities. It
is important to take cognizance of the
fact, that soon thereafter, Kaiser Wil-
liam ll allowed Bismark's treaty with
Russia to lapse and the hard-won
fruits of a skilful diplomacy were a
thing of the past. As a matter of
grave self-concern and under a vague
suggestion of suspicion, Russia com-
menced to court France and terminat-
ed this courtship with a defensive
alliance between these two countries,
which was formally agreed upon in
1896. In order to counter-move this
looming danger with its potential pos-
sibilities, the only solution German
statesmen could conceive of, was to
increase her already big army. Ger-
many saw herself surrounded on all
sides by jealous neighbors. With
characteristic German thoroughness,
she set about producing an army so
stupendous in size, and so appallingly
efficient in its discipline and all ma-
terial accessories, that it became the
object of awe and fear of Europe.
For every increase Germany made,
France and Russia made a correspond-
ing move, and all other European
nations followed,—some more, some
less. This military and naval rivalry
has been in full swing for the last two
decades.
If Germany sets out to do a thing,
ir will be done with such thoroughness
and method that it will produce the
admiration of the world. Every avail-
able contribution of science will be
utilized to the best possible advantage,
all material and intellectual resources
will be drawn upon until that thing
Germany sets out to do is the best
thing that can be done. Therefore, it
will be no less difficult to understand
that, if Germany troubled herself lit-
tle about her navy before 1888, she
now has a naval strength that can be
rivalled in first class fighting ships by
none but England. Germany saw a
possible menace in the paramount
strength of the English navy; she felt
that it was up to her to act, and as the
ex-chancellor Buellow correctly puts
it, "We must have a navy so strong
that, though not the most powerful,
no enemy will attack us without run-
ning the gravest risk." As a matter
of fact, the enormous superiority of
the navies of Germany's present ene-
mies, has made her first class fighting
machine upon the water more than
useless. And so the mad race for mili-
tary and naval supremacy went on re-
lentlessly, causing bad blood among
the nations, encouraging false pride
among the common people and rifling
the pockets of men.
It is naturally impossible here to
go even into the more remote details
of the commercial and economic caus-
es which finally brought about the ti-
tanic struggle opening with the fate
of the Austrian heir to the throne.
Frequently I have been asked what
the Germans mean by their "Kultur."
The fact remains that the German,


'55
boasting so much of that Kultur,
very seldom goes into details, but ap-
parently he means to point out that
Germany has institutions of learning
that are of much better standing than
all other institutions. He thinks that
the German mind and German accom-
plishments eclipse all others, and since
all these things have proven of such
success to Germany, they must be in
the right direction and it will be of
the greatest benefit to impose this Ger-
man culture upon the world in gener-
al. Such, in a nutshell, was the phil-
osophy of Treitschke, of Bernhardi
and his followers, and the almighty
military clique lent a willing ear with
much vanity and conceit.
Treitschke, being a university pro-
fessor, apparently a man of the high-
est responsibility,, assumed to himself
the airs of transcendental wisdom and
sufficiency. He reduced the policy
of Prussia—and therefore of Ger-
many—to an exact philosophy and in
a most painstaking manner, combined
with great force of suggestion, en-
deavored to make it appear axiomatic
that the state is all and the mere in-
dividual is nothing. With much vigor
he tried to convince his hearers that
the individual has no rights; he is
first and last and always a servant
of the state; in that function he must
obey the state to the best of his abil-
ities and to the letter. He made it
unscrupulously clear too, that the state
is all-powerful and any treaties are
good only so long as the interests of
that omnipotent monstrosity are not
at stake. Since there is nothing high-
er than that state, it is responsible
to no one in this world of ours, and—
very axiomatically, too—is subjected
to none of the moral laws which bind
the ordinary mortal individual. To
an impartial reader, more of a cos-
mopolitan type of mind, his' reasoning
is loose, if not frequently very shal-
low, and some of his most remarkable
statements are being pasted upon the
bulletin-board of publicity without the
slightest conscientious effort toward
a proof or moral justification. Yet,
the sad fact remains established, that
this man had many hearers, and was
considered especially among the
learned military clique, one of the
most conspicuous exponents of "mod-
ern" political philosophy. His great
success no doubt, rests upon the solid
phsychological foundation that, speak-
ing in the vernacular, he "delivered
the goods,"—which were wanted and
liked in his restless time.
General Bernhardi, a contempor-
aneous worshipper of Treitschkes'
philosophy, in his now famous book
on "Germany and the Next War,"
with a frankness unheard of, devotes
much space to the glories of German
culture, and with an ecstacy of pride
he points out that the exports of books
from Germany had exceeded the im-
port enormously. This alone, to his
mind, is a convincing argument of
Germany's culture and educational
initiative. Curiously enough, this ef-
ficacy of spreading German culture
among the people of the world, does
not seem to him at all sufficient. In
a most learned manner, in a way least
of all expected of a military man, he
gives pages upon pages on justifying
the existence, nay,—mind you— the
necessity of war. on biological grounds
alone. He apparently refuses to bother
himself about ethnological laws or
geographic divisions. The importance
of inherent racial characteristics never
seem to bear any weight with him in
his "Weltanschauungen."
It does not require much of an im-
agination to understand that, in the


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
course of years, this persistent ham-
mering of men like Treitschke, Bern-
hardt the cold blooded materialism of
Xietzschke, and a score of others of
a similarly disordered mind, had their
effects. Their ideas and thoughts,
sanctioned by high officials, gradually
spread, like the odor of a piece of
camphor in a room, in one form or the
other, and the influences which they
naturally created, ultimately possessed
the public mind.
The public was hypnotized, intox-
icated with a sense of power and a
false superiority, unknown in any
previous age.
Now no reasonably well informed
person will belittle the fact that Ger-
many stood singularly high in art, in
science and literature, and at one
time or another, was a leader in all
of these cultural advancements. Ger-
many has an intellectual history of
which she can be justly proud. Dur-
ing the Renaissance she had some of
the greatest meteors of scholarly at-
tainments. During the Victorian Age,
when scientific research was the dom-
inent intellectual preoccupation of Eu-
rope, she stood in a high place. Even
in her mediaeval architecture, she
produced works of supreme orig-
inality and warmth of style. Her
great cities were a magnificant ex-
ample in civil management and sys-
tem. By means of the invention of
the printing press, she made knowl-
edge universally accessible. In Leib-
nitz she had one of the greatest
analytical minds of contemporary Eu-
rope. In poetry, Goethe and Schiller
are immortal. In music, the stand-
ards set by men like Beethoven, Mo-
zart and Wagner, have never again
been attained. In philosophy, the
name of Kant stands out like the rock
of Gibraltar does above the waves.
Von Helmholtz, Ostwald, Herz, Koch,
Ilaeckel and a score of names are
household words in the scientific
world and these men enjoy a uni-
versal reputation and respect. In sci-
ence, Germany has produced an
enormous amount of the most ex-
haustive and painstaking research
and her achievements were still won-
derful,—but the work was no longer
unique,—it lacked that germ of de-
vine originality! In pure science, not
excepting chemistry, she was no long-
er supreme. The brilliant dynasty of
intellectual giants, of unremunerative
devotees of pure science, of valuable
and unselfish dreamers, of super-
eminent philosophers,—had vanished!
Since 1870 Germany has been too busy
with the commercial and industrial
application of art, of science and lit-
erature.
On the other hand, it would be less
of deliberate short-sightedness, to un-
derestimate the fact that Germany still
has her most conspicuous representa-
tives in all fields of human endeavor
and in several respects can teach the
world many an important lesson. Ger-
many stands for method, system, ef-
ficiency, iron discipline, and an organ-
ization almost awe-inspiring in its
perfection.
That the educational excellence of
Germany in cultural, scientific and
especially technical lines had attained
a high degree must be admitted. This
remains a well established fact, even
if, under present conditions, caused
by the world war, we might allow our
patriotism and human nature to
contradict a statement, which before
the European catastrophy we would
have tacitly agreed to be perfectly
self-evident. However, as with most
things in this world, so also has the
educational excellence of Germany


157
two sides from which it should be con-
sidered. One of these is to look at
it through the eyes of the German
government and the fostering of its
own interests, and the other side is to
weigh its effects upon the life of the
great mass of German people in par-
ticular and the world as a whole. In
speaking of Germany, or anything
pertaining to her, we must never lose
sight of the fact that in the latter
country a distinctive class spirit—or
call it a class instinct—and an atmos-
phere of caste are some of the pre-
dominant national characteristics.
These conditions of society, having
their roots resting in century old tra-
ditions, are in their larger and smaller
effects upon the people, difficult to ap-
preciate by the casual visitor or mere
book student of Germany's com-
mercial and political position in the
world shortly before the war.
In order to grasp intelligently the
contrast and to descriminate between
a democratic and an aristocratic com-
munity, it becomes essential, if not
necessary, to have been in one or both
for some length of time. Otherwise,
the element of personal bias and prej-
udice will play havoc with our sound
judgment in the attitude we will take
toward the one or the other. The rea-
son why I speak of these caste pro-
ducing tendencies of Germany in con-
nection with its educational system,
was to mention the fact that the lat-
ter, instead of improving these con-
ditions has actually aggravated them.
Any advanced or really broad educa-
tion in Germany is practically con-
fined to a small percentage of the mid-
dle class and the upper class. Ele-
mentary technical education is made
accesible to even the humblest, and
in this one respect Germany has made
great progress over all other nations.
It must be kept in mind, however, that
the entire curriculum of all institu-
tions of learning, not excepting pri-
vate schools, is more or less pattern-
made, standardized and under govern-
ment supervision. It has none of the
sudden makeshifts and alternations
which characterize some of our Amer-
ican institutions of learning. Per-
haps the latter may be a good policy,
since it encourages initiative and
pedagogical originality, but undoubt-
edly it has rather obvious weaknesses.
The percentage of illiterate in Ger-
many is very small, and if I under-
stand correctly, smaller than that of
any other single country. If we agree
to take this as a criterion of education,
we may well say that, with the pos-
sible exception of the Scotch, the Ger-
mans are the best educated people in
the world. Personally I think that
such a criterion has no logical justi-
fication as being the sole basis upon
which to judge the standard of a na-
tion.
Editor's Note:—We present below the
opinions of others on Germany's educational
system.
Prof. Ziehen of Berlin, in his book, "Prin-
zipien und Methoden der Intelligenzpruii-
fung." says: "Many mentally normal Berlin
workmen know almost nothing of the war
of 1870-1871. Many have no idea of the
capital cities of other lands. Historical
personages are confused in an unbelievable
manner . . . some of them do not even-
know on which river Berlin lies. Very
many do not know into which river the
Spree empties."
George R. Wells, Asst. Prof, of Psychol-
ogy, Oberlin College, says in the "New
York Magazine," "There is much reason
for ranking American education quite high
as regards technical training. Much of
Germany's supremacy in technical efficiency
is simply idle rumor ... a prominent Ger-
man pathologist who visited a certain,Amer-
ican medical school some few years ago ex-


pressed himself as being surprised at the
work done there by students, at its scientific
accuracy and success ... an instructor in a
prominent American university told the
writer a few years ago, when he was plan-
ning his graduate study, that if he, Mr.
Wells, wished an "easy" degree he should
go to Germany. The remark is not entirely
fair, but shows a tendency which I think is
growing."
"It is a significant and splendid thing that
the American university, to some extent, is
a hotbed of free thought and intense indi-
vidualism, while it is a symptom of malign-
ant disease that the German schools pro-
duce men whose mental processes and re-
sultant activities are always at the command
of constitutional authority."
As a direct consequence of the
caste, due to the isolation of the peo-
ple into sharply defined social groups,
the average German is almost ex-
clusively confined within his own nar-
row sphere of activity, meaning the
latter not merely in a professional
sense, but politically and intellectually
as we'll. The constitution of Germany
is shaped to make schooling of the
masses compulsory, then the govern-
ment has withheld all political rights
except on paper. The philosophical
back-bone of the German system of
education has been selfish and there-
fore illogical from the outset. Its
chief aim was not to increase the hap-
piness of the greatest mass of the peo-
ple, but to increase the "national" ef-
ficiency. But it is exactly this great
mass of people which deserves the
most careful consideration, and my
criticism is not directed against any-
one class or group in particular. I
am speaking of the effects upon the
vast bulk of the people, who, in any
case, form the real ground-work of
all nations, and by the intellectual
standing and by the manners and
morals of that ground work, a nation
must \)2 judged. It would be utterly
unwise, if not exactly silly, to pick
out a Tolstoy and base our personal
estimate of that man's greatness as
an embodiment of the national char-
acteristics of the Russian people. It
would be a very speculative thing in-
deed, to isolate and select a Goethe
or a Kant and allow our hero-worship
to reflect upon the whole German na-
tion merely on the strength of the
opinions we have formed of these
giants alone.
After the golden victories of 1871,
the German government became over-
selfconscious of its power and the
mind of the people has been saturated
ever since with a policy of aggression;
—not merely in a military sense, but
commercially also. For ambitions of
this nature, no form of government
than the autocratic is better suited.
More than ever before, it became but
a matter of a short time when all so-
cial and political activities were placed
within reach of some system of
subordination closely related to that
familiar phrase about Germany's "ef-
ficiency." So also here, the whole
structure of the German system of
education is based upon this sub-
ordinate system. In conformity with
it the German school boy is made so
forcefully familiar with submissive-
ness that, when he grows to be a man,
obedience and respect for authority
become second nature,—instinctive!
In the Germany of today, the aver-
age man's state of mind is that of a
person whose freedom of existence
and degree of personal liberty de-
pends upon the mercy and the good
will of a group of superior person-
ages, of whom the Kaiser represents
the apotheosis of reverence and re-
spect. The fact remains undisputed


159
that the homage which the average
German pays wealthy and titled peo-
ple approaches almost childlike naivety
in its expressions. How could he be
otherwise? As a mere child he un-
dergoes a systematic training, so to
speak, to treasure an exaggerated es-
teem for the higher officials he hears
of or even comes remotely in contact
with. From earliest youth on, he has
instilled in him an enthusiasm and a
blind devotion towards the old heroes
of Germany's history, the depth of
which is unexemplified and the sin-
cerety of which cannot be questioned.
Under such one-sided influences,
powerful as they are, and lasting as
they must be, the average German is
a victim of circumstances. His in-
tellectual horizon consists of an
artificial universe of German con-
stellations, of German accomplish-
ments, of German deeds of glory,
closely rivaling if not easily over-
shadowing all others. By this sys-
tematic training, by these methodical
suggestions, the German government
has been able to raise the pitch of
patriotism and nationalism as no other
form of government has ever been
able to do. The results are obvious:
A little careful thought will convince
anyone that but for the support of
the vast mass of the people, the Ger-
man government would struggle in
vain, and the war would have ended
long ago. Even in their agonies and
the terrible sufferings connected with
this wholesale slaughter, they are still
loyal to the thoughts and the ideas
upon which their minds have been
nourished from earliest youth. They
have hardly ever been in a position to
assimilate a more cosmopolitan at-
titude of mind, beyond their own na-
tionalism.
Looking at the entire situation from
a larger perspective, one can hardly
refrain from getting hold of the sadly
humorous aspect that, apparently, the
German nation and the German insti-
tutions have been created by express
order of his imperial majesty the
Kaiser and the aristocratic clique, for
whose sole benefit they exist and for
whose sole pleasure they are being
cultivated. Not that the average Ger-
man is a fool,—such would be far
from the facts. But the overdose of
the aenesthetic drug called nationalism
soon produced its effects in the most
vivid manner. Blind patriotism has
been running in his veins for too many
generations and a state of mind a
thousand years old cannot be wiped
out by a few years of privation and
pain. The traditions are too solidly
founded to be obliterated by individual
thought or mere personal suffering.
Therefore, real democracy, if it
comes, let us hope, must originate out
of the people's own convictions and
can hardly be purchased directly by
high explosive shells or even gas
bombs. The support of German auto-
cracy, which is equivalent to misdi-
rected German patriotism, has been
treated with the same cure-all ''ef-
ficiency" methods characteristic of so
many other enterprises of German de-
sign, so that it will require the utmost
persistence and most convincing argu-
ments to wipe it out.
We must never forget, that until re-
cently, any political, social, educational
and (very naturally) all military steps
of any importance, originate from a
highly centralized government. What-
ever that government decides to do
must be done, and it always is done
under that perfect system of subordin-
ation which is prevalent in Germany.
The people, or their supposed repre-
,


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
sentatives, have no voice in anything
connected with this centralized body
of men, and the decisions of the lat-
ter are usually taken as being beyond
dispute in their wisdom and precision.
These decisions are taken in about the
same spirit as a school boy takes his
lesson from his teacher. The Ger-
mans as a whole have no special gift
for politics, and the vast mass of peo-
ple is hardly qualified to render an
intelligent opinion on anything po-
litical even if it should be connected
with their own fate, because their
policies, domestic or foreign, have
either been misrepresented or with-
held entirely. Such a freedom of
speech of the press, as is known in
this country for example, is absolutely
unknown;—a possible exception in
this regard being the "Zukunf t" edited
by Maximilian Harden and the social-
ist organ "Yorwaerts."
Exponents of unbiased free political
thought are very few indeed, and the
alarmingly small number that did have
the initiative and the momentum be-
hind them to push their thoughts be-
fore the public, are gradually being
recognized. Some of them will, in
the course of time, stand out pre-
eminently and be the guiding light of
better days to come when Germany
will be an unadultercd democracy. In
the latter respect the growing power
of socialism is a slow but unfailing
symptom of real progress and inde-
pendent principles, but I know of no
other form of government that has
fought this body of national liberators
more persistently and more stubbornly
than the German. It is only less than
a decade ago when it was little more
than utterly disgraceful to be an advo-
cate of socialism and still worse to be
a real socialist. Me was considered
a dangerous and unique specimen of
a newly discovered category of luna-
tics, hven the large mass of the peo-
ple themselves did not hesitate in the
least to express their dislike, if not
antagonism, toward any man being a
socialist. In this manner they gave
conclusive proof of the measure of the
"success'' with which the government
had impressed upon the people its con-
sistent and characteristically one-sided
education of social, moral, political
(and naturally most of all, military
view-points.
Technically, constitutionally, the
German Reichstag is a representative
body of the people. But aside from
any theoretical speculations, in actual
practice, it was indeed little more than
a filibuster association serving the pur-
pose of a fine but useless dummy
show. Judging from recent events,
however, the Reichstag is apparently
getting more powerful in its direct in-
fluence upon the government and in
questions of national importance. Not
at all, that the men out of which the
Reichstag is composed are not men of
honest purpose and well meant in-
tentions, but their power is fenced in
and limited by the Bundesrath, or
Federal Council. The latter is a body
of delegates appointed by the govern-
ments of the different states and this
body is neither elective nor hereditary,
and out of the fifty-eight members
composing it, seventeen belong to
Prussia alone, the next of size being
Bavaria with six representatives. Nat-
urally, the wishes of these delegates
do not correspond to those of the peo-
ple, but their views and opinions are
shaped entirely according to the in-
structions received from their respec-
tive governments and the princes of
the states which they represent. The
Bundesrath can initiate legislation and
veto any bill sent up from the Reichs-


161
tag. Evidently, the German Kaiser,
being also king of Prussia, with seven-
teen votes at his disposal, and remem-
bering that many ot the smaller prin-
cipalities are virtually dependencies of
Prussia, has by far the most powerful
influence. In view of this single fact
alone, it will be less difficult for us to
understand that, although the power
vested in the imperial authority is very
small according to the letters of the
German consitution, his personal in-
fluence is a powerful one indeed, and
in fact so powerful that it always im-
plies a potential national menace of
the first magnitude. Therefore, in
spite of the fact that the German con-
stitution is a democratic one, and lib-
eral enough to satisfy even a demo-
cratic American, it is so on paper only.
The attitude, and indeed the spirit in
which this constitution is applied do
not at all agree. When we see the
blue-prints and then the actual ma-
chine in operation, we are astonished,
if not repulsed, at the flat contradic-
tion of it all. In a more reflective
mood, considering the association of
ideas in general, and the coincidence
of famous phrases in particular, we
will arrive at the profound conclusion
that the German constitution is indeed
as fine a "scrap of paper'' as was ever
devised by the ingenuity of man for
the wholesale consumption of make-
believe.
Unfortunately, too, the harmony
and the effectiveness of the four mil-
lion socialists who cast their- vote at
the last general election shortly before
the war, is far from being in such an
ideal condition for display as folks
are inclined to think. First of all,
many are socialists by instinct rather
than on the strength of any logical
reasoning behind their arguments;—
they are simply aware of the fact that
in many ways their interests conflict
severely with those of the government,
and the only channel open to raise
their voices is to vote for socialism.
Then too, unfortunately, even
among those being convinced social-
ists, there are technially two big
groups: The "orthodox" and the "re-
visionists," which in practice differ-
entiate themselves by the fact that the
former are the determined adherers
to those principles as laid down by
their great father Marx, and it is very
seldom that they can be induced by
any tempting bait not to oppose the
government in any irrational policies
it wishes to pursue. The revisionists,
on the other hand, are of a more con-
servative type of mind and much more
compromising in their attitude, and
at occasions have shown that they are
capable of being rather inconsistent.
Yet, in the course of time, when the
utter folly of it all is bound to react
powerfully upon the minds of the vast
multitude, the half-spirited socialism
of yesterday may be the irresistible
institution of a tomorrow.
I low and when will it all end? How
can that autocracy be wiped out, so
that it will never again return? These
are the questions that are being asked
daily by millions of thinking and suf-
fering people. No one knows. But
all seem to be sure of two things:
That it will end some day and that
the autocratic menace must be wiped
out. Some suggest that the German
merchantmen, whose trade before the
war depended chiefly upon foreign
commerce, will rise as one man and
demand any kind of a reasonable
peace. Although this sounds plausi-
ble, I am sure that they lack even the
rudiments of political initiative and
cooperation, and hence their will can-
not be imposed upon the present gov-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
ernment. Unqualified as we must
necessarily be at this distance, to com-
ment on the present internal political
situation, still to my mind, the social-
ists will be the final answer to the so-
lution. My belief in this regard is
based upon the fact that they are first
of all the real representatives of the
greatest majority of common people
who naturally have to bear the great-
est burden. Furthermore, the social-
ists in Germany are the one independ-
ent political body, and but recently the
military clique has condescended to
employ socialists as diplomatic tools
in attempted peace negotiations at
Stockholm. In their hour of need,
they are willing to make a friend out
of the man they dispised only a half
a decade ago. By doing this, they have-
unconsciously placed socialism upon a
higher and more dignified plane in
the eyes of the German people than
it has ever enjoyed at any time previ-
ously. This will ultimately lead to an
enormous increase in votes for social-
ism and will stimulate interest in it
throughout Germany. Some sort of
a social upheaval is bound to happen;
whether it will be pure socialism or
any other social phenomena closely
related to it or as a consequence of it,
we cannot tell definitely and thus must
beware of unfounded speculations.
I low soon and with what degree of
vehemence this new giant will rise, no
one can tell and no mere talk or
ratiocination will be able to predict it.
It may come shortly,—it may be
years from now, but ultimately it is
inevitable! Let us hope that with this
re-birth there will come a new Ger-
many of cooperative and not aggres-
sive ideals,—and a new German peo-
ple such as we loved and admired in
times gone by

THE opportunity to assist in one of
the greatest and most important
humane enterprises ever organized is
to be presented to the students of our
University and all others in the near
future. This mission, known as the
Students" Friendship War Fund, if
successful, will result in the saving
of thousands of lives, many of which
will undoubtedly be those of our own
soldiers.
There are at the present time six
million prisoners in the European
prison camps. Can you appreciate the
vastness of such a figure? Six million
men. hand in hand with arms ex-
tended, would form an unbroken line
from Chicago to St. Louis—plus, an-
other line from Kansas City to Den-
ver, Colorado—plus, a third line from
Cincinnati, Ohio, to Jacksonville,
Florida—plus, still another line from
Minneapolis to Galveston, Texas-—
plus, a fifth line running from coast
to coast from Boston, Mass., to Port-
land, Oregon. Those who have fig-
ured out this set of statistics say that
they have made an allowance for one
million out of the six being mere boys
who lack a man's reach.
If you should stand at the corner
of State and North "U" and these
six million prisoners should go march-
ing down State St.. single file, past
the corner, in the regulation army
quick time, pace and interval, you
would be there day and night for
nearly two months, if you stayed to
see them all go by.
To get something of a picture of a
prison camp, imagine the biggest
crowd you ever saw—which in most
cases will not exceed 10,000—and
then multiply that by five or six, and
you will have the population of an
average-sized prison camp. Now im-
agine that crowd dirty, unshaven,
ragged, lousy, most of them bare-
footed and about half clad, all of them
shivering from the cold of such a
night as last night. Picture this crowd
away from home in the enemy's coun-
try, packed into large, rough sheds,
and the whole camp enclosed by
barbed-wire, and guarded.
Try, if you can, to imagine for an
instant that you are one of these pris-
oners. Fully a third of those around
you are sick, really sick. Another
third are injured or maimed in one or
more of a thousand different ways.
Ever since you came you have had no
soap, towels, bedding, or clean clothes,
no books, no writing materials, no
games or amusements. In fact you
have been deprived of everything hu-
manly desirable, you have been denied
all the little creature comforts that en-
able one to keep clean and self-respect-
ing. You have been fed hardly enough
to keep you alive. You are perpet-
ually tormented by this consuming
hunger, by cold, by discomforts of all
kinds, and worst of all by the appar-
ently unending monotony of it. Many
of the prisoners about you have been
in the '"camp" since the first weeks of
the war.
Imagine that you have lived in this
way for weeks, for months, perhaps
for even more than a year. Do you
think that you would still be mentally
sound? Authentic reports state that
an average of one out of six of the
prisoners in these camps is absolutely
insane. Personally, I cannot conceive


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
how anyone could stay in one of these
unthinkable prison camps for any
length of time and still retain his rea-
son.
Experts say there are four feasible
things to do to prevent insanity or
the imparing of the minds of these
prisoners and prepare them to come
back and take their places in the
world when the war is over. These
are: to supply the prisoners with mu-
sic, with books, with manual occupa-
tions and with educational work. It
is possible to fill all these needs if the
means for doing so can be obtained.
The purpose of the Students'
Friendship War Fund is to raise this
money, and when raised it will be ad-
ministered by the Y. M. C. A., which
is the best organization in the world
for such a task. Under the direction
of secretaries sent into these horrible
camps by the Y. M. C. A. through
American capital, proper food and
care is being given the sick, and as
fast as possible warm clothing is be-
ing supplied for those who need it
most seriously. Classes in both ele-
mentary and more advanced subjects
have been established and many such
occupations as basket-weaving, book-
binding, shoe-making, are being
taught. The teachers are college stu-
dents, like you and me, together with
regidar faculty men, all of whom are
prisoners in the camp. They say that
it is an easy matter to organize a dis-
tinguished faculty in any of the prison
camps of Europe. But even if such
a force is organized it is useless un-
less we supply it with the funds for
necessities such as writing materials
and books.
Strange as it may seem. Germany
still recognizes the Y. M. C. A. Quite
true, all American workers were re-
placed by neutrals after we entered
the war, but the fact remains that the
V. M. C. A. workers can still get into
these camps and get supplies and let-
ters through to the soldiers in them.
Possibly they are allowed to do so
because their activities result in mak-
ing life less unbearable for the pris-
oners, making them more contented.
However, that is a mere matter of
conjecture. At any rate, it is esti-
mated that fully one-quarter of the
prisoners are now receiving packages
and mail regularly from friends at
home. Think what this would mean
to you if you were in one of thesa
camps.
When the appeal is made to you,
make the needful sacrifices and prac-
tice a little additional self-denial in
order that these men may be relieved
in their horrible distress. RememhEr
that even now' there are Americans
in those prison camps, and that if the
war continues, as they say it will for
some time to come, it is absolutely
inevitable that there will be many
more Americans in these camps. It
may quite within reason be your
brother, your friend or classmate, or
possibly later on yourself, that will
be among these prisoners.
We miss many a friend from the
campus this year. Some of our com-
rades are already in France preparing
to go to the front. Still others will
go to France after their period of
training in the cantonments. These
fellows are giving up their careers and
their all, even unto their lives, if nec-
essary, "to make the world safe for
democracy."
Those fellows are fighting for us.
They are fighting our battles. They
are undergoing the necessary discom-
forts and deprivations of camp life
for us, while we still have a comfort-
X


1*5
able bed, three square meals a day,
and our chosen career before us as
easily accessible as ever.
How, then, shall we square our-
selves with these friends of ours who
have thrown every personal desire
overboard to serve the nation. Shall
we give up movies and an occasional
dance? NO! Do you think for an
instant that the "giving up" of movies,
or smoking, or any of these small
things, compare with the sacrifices
which we know these friends of ours
have made and are making today and
every day?
We should have dispensed with
these luxuries long ago, devoting the
money to any one or all of the sev-
eral worthy movements which have
been advanced recently.
Xo; if we are even to begin to equal
the sacrifices our soldiers are making
we must give until it hurts, until we
are going without what we once con-
sidered necessities, just as they are
doing. We must do this so that no
such condition as still exist in many
of the prison camps will greet any of
our friends, when they get into one
of them, as some are sure to do.
Suppose we do go without a suit of
clothes we actually need. How does
that compare with the possibility
which our comrades must face of go-
ing around minus eyes, hands, or
feet?
This is a very serious problem which
we must face, fellows. Think this
over in all seriousness. Talk it over
with your friends. And when the
call is made respond to it as becomes
a Michigan man who is no quitter, as
becomes one who believes in meeting
his obligations like a man.

SLEEPER OK SLACKER even of life, while we live on prac-
Over in Europe there is a thin hu- tically as though our country were not
man wall separating the United States, embroiled in a war on the successful
not even yet fully prepared, from the outcome of which rests our very exist-
mcrcilcss, barbaric German military cnce-
machine. Each new day sees this Possibly we soothe disturbed con-
wall just a little thinner than before, sciences by reminding ourselves that
The British casualties alone are rough- we have been repeatedly urged to stay
ly two thousand every twenty-four i" college and complete our courses,
hours. Yet far too many of us are Quite so. BUT. let us also recall at
content to let someone else make the the same time the.fact that we have
sacrifices of time and money, and been thus urged, not that we might


167
further our personal ends, but that
we might prepare ourselves to be of
maximum service to the country in
the present conflict.
We engineers are here in training
to become industrial leaders, and it is
leaders that the nation needs so vitally
today. Now it is well known that the
qualities of leadership are quite uni-
versal, and that a man who can "boss''
a factory or gang of men can ''boss"
a company or regiment quite as suc-
cessfully as soon as he becomes ac-
quainted with the details of his new
job. The opportunity to obtain the
necessary training to enable us to en-
ter this new field of leadership is now
afforded us by the Reserve Officers'
Training Corps. Do you realize that
only about one out of three of those
eligible are enrolled in this corps? Yet
we are of the class to whom the en-
tire nation is looking for leaders.
Everything has been made easy for
us. Class and laboratory periods have
been rearranged so that we might en-
roll in this training corps and still
carry on our regular work. Where,
in a few instances, regular work un-
avoidably interferes with military
work, Lieut. Mullen has arranged, at
the expense of extra and unrequired
labor on his part, to give special in-
struction.
If, in this time of world-wide sac-
rifice, an appeal must be made to the
selfish instincts, then let us remember
that those who are in a position to
know best the true state of affairs
give us ''optimistic" statements of the
nature of the following: ''There is
more clanger today that the Allies will
be starved into submission than that
Germany will...."; "The country is
going to need the services of every
man in some capacity...." Thus,
since we must enter this conflict in
on,e way or another, let us, for our
own personal interests,—if we do not
feel it our duty to do so because of
our obligations to our country—seek
the highest position obtainable by en-
rolling in this Officers' Training Corps
and fitting ourselves to obtain com-
missions.
Think it over. Are you simply
oblivious of the danger the nation
faces, or are you a coward, a slacker,
one without honor who uses the fact
that he is in college as an excuse to
avoid service, if possible? Sleeper or
Slacker?
THIRTY TEARS
The appearance of our December
issue marks the completion of the
thirtieth year of publication of The
Michigan Technic, the oldest stu-
dent publication on the campus.
To properly mark this event we are
going to publish a big anniversary is-
sue. This number, it is planned, will
contain interesting history relating to
The Technic and the Engineering
Society.
You, old grad, haven't you some
recollections of the early days of The
Technic? Do you remember the
good old times you used to have Sat-
urday nights in the Engineering So-
ciety rooms? Write them out and
send them to us. Also, if you care
to, send in with your writeup the
names and addresses of one or two of
your friends to whom you would like
a copy of our anniversary issue sent.
Copy for the December issue must
be in our hands by November fif-
teenth. Do your bit. Do it now.
Help make this issue a success, make
it a number that you will like to keep
and get out and read once in awhile
to bring back the good old days.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
THE tVAK AM) THE TECHNIC STAFF
War is hell. We admit it, and re-
gret very much to announce that the
war, directly or indirectly, has caused
us to lose some very valuable mem-
bers of our staff.
H. S. Taylor, '18E, ex-Managing
Editor, whose term of office was but
half expired, has left college and ap-
plied for a commission in the avia-
tion corps. The magnitude of his
services to The Technic are quite
easily appreciated when one tries to
take up the work where he left off.
Our Engineering Notes Department
is also minus its Editor, due to the
fact that F. I. Sheahan, '18, has not
returned. W. H. Dorrance, '19, Cir-
culation Manager, has just resigned
because he has been drafted. L. K.
Ferris. '19, assistant in the Sales De-
partemnt, and M. R. Norcop, '20, as-
sistant in the Advertising Department,
complete the roster of our missing.
IN THIS ISSUE
We are very fortunate in being able
to present in this issue two articles
on steel, and though they overlap in
a few particulars, we considered them
both so good that we did not wish our
readers to miss either. So we are
publishing both, feeling confident that
you will agree with our estimate of
their value after reading them. The
first of these articles is "The Role of
Chrome Vanadium Steel," by F. J.
Griffiths, and the second, "Alloy
Steel," by D. X. A. Blacet.
George H. Gibson presents an in-
teresting article entitled "The Com-
mercial Development of Technical
Business." A rather unusual article
written by F. G. Marsteller. is found
under the title of "The Inside of the
Cup," it being an attempt by one of
our German-born engineers to let us
look at the German people from a
new view point.

LET US come to a frank under-
standing right at the very start, with-
out the customary preamhle about autumn
leaves are falling and how the air is filled
with the incense of their cremation and
how the golden moon hangs like a silver
disk in the hazy sky, and admit right off
the bat that our college notes department
for this issue is very much like one of these
patchwork quilts "like gran'ma used to
make." The reason for this is that these
notes are not the unified work of a single
man, but a collection of miscellaneous ma-
terial obtained from various sources on a
rush order.
The war, or war conditions, have raised
havoc one way and another with the Staff,
and among others our College Editor
turned up missing in the grand shuffle.
This simply meant that other Staff men
had to do double work—and we are even
now forced to break off this little explana-
tion because the night watchman is stand-
ing just inside our door and imparting the
information that if we don't get out right
away we'll be put out as we have already
stayed long after everybody else has shut
up shop and gone home. In fact, it's
almost tomorrow morning. Goodnight.
MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
Professor J. R. Allen having resigned as
head of the Department of Mechanical En-
gineering to be come Dean of the Engi-
neering College of the University of Min-
nesota, Professor H. C. Anderson has been
appointed as head of the Department here.
Professor Anderson returns to Ann Arbor
after an absence from the University of
two and one-half years, during which time
he has been engaged in the appraisal of
some very extensive engineering properties
in the East.
Professor C. H. Fessenden has received
a commission as Captain in the Ordnance
Department, and is now stationed at the
Frankford Arsenal at Philadelphia, Penn-
sylvania.
Professor W. T. Fishleigh has received
a commission as Major in the Sanitary
Corps of the Medical Department and is
now stationed in Washington. He has gen-
eral charge of all motor vehicles, includ-
ing ambulances, in that division of the
service. -
Mr. F. A. Mickle, formerly of the Draw-
ing Department, who was transferred to
the Mechanical Engineering staff last June,
has received a First Lieutenant's Commis-
sion in the Ordnance Department and re-
ceived orders in September to proceed to
the Rock Island Arsenal and report for
duty.
Professor W. F. Vcrner has resigned to
take up business for himself in Detroit.
Professor R. S. Hawley comes to the
Department of Mechanical Engineering this
year from the Colorado School of Mines,
where he has been head of the Mechanical
Engineering Department. Professor Haw-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
ley is a Michigan graduate, having received
his degree in 1907. *
Mr. Hugh Keeler has been secured as
Instructor in Mechanical Engineering, for
the coming year. Mr. Keeler is a 1912-13
man and has been connected with the Con-
sumers Power Company at Jackson for the
past few years.
Professor J. A. Bursley has been con-
ducting some very successful courses in
Army Stores in conjunction with the plans
of the Quartermaster's and Ordnance Di-
visions of the War Department. One course
was given during the summer, which was
attended by about 65 men. Another course
was begun about September 15, which is
now in session. There are 109 men en-
rolled in this group. It is Professor Burs-
ley's idea to repeat the course every six
weeks during the year, or as long as may
be required.
Professor J. E. Emswiler has been doing
some work during the past summer for the
Storage Committee of the General Muni-
tions Board at Washington. The work con-
sisted of a study of the possibilities of ap-
plying baling to a number of compressible
goods, such as clothing, blankets, tentage,
etc.; also the rebaling or compressing of
hay, with a view to reducing the volume
for shipment to a minimum.
CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
NEW LABORATORY
The most important development in the
Chemical Engineering Department for somc
time is the new laboratory which will be
installed this fall. The Swenson Evap-
orator Co. of Chicago has agreed to make
and install three typical evaporators, each
equipped for test and experimental pur-
poses, together with all accessories, pumps,
and the like. These machines will be
small, but still of commercial size. They
are figured to evaporate up to 3,500 lbs. of
water per hour, with a possibility of run-
ning considerably more if necessary. The
whole equipment and all connections is the
gift of this Company and will become the
property of the University as soon as in-
stalled.
It is scarcely an exaggeration to say
that an evaporator is to a Chemical En-
gineer almost as much as steam engine to
a Mechanical Engineer. It is a vital point
in the widest variety of processes. It comes
in as a necessary part of the manufacture
of sugar, salt, chemicals of all sorts, tan-
ning extracts, alkali, food products of
various kinds, and in the disposal of a long
list of waste products. The evaporator has
mainly been developed in Germany, but in
spite of its importance there are a large
number of very weighty questions with re-
gard to its design and operation which need
a great deal of study. So far as is now
known, this is the first laboratory to be
established on such a scale either in a Uni-
versity or by any private concern.
Besides the research that will be carried
on regarding the details of evaporator de-
sign and operation, the equipment will be
available for regular instruction purposes,
though it has not yet been decided if a
course in Chemical Enginering Laboratory
will be offered this year. The evaporators
will also be available as an aid to the solu-
tion of various research problems where
semi-commercial operation is necessary to
test the feasibility of an idea. In this latter
connection it is hoped, in the near future,
to add corresponding equipment for other
steps in chemical processes (such as filters,
precipitating tanks and extractors).
For the benefit of Technic readers who
are acquainted with the chemical industries,
a description of the apparatus now planned
may be given. There will be a vertical
tube evaporator, 30 inches in diameter and
8 feet high, with provision for increasing
the height to 16 feet when working with
long tubes. This will have a flat bottom to
be used with liquids which do not pre-
cipitate, a conical bottom and salt filter for
those which do. and a special bottom for
circulation of high density or viscous
liquids. There will also be a horizontal
tube evaporator. 30 inches wide and 4 feet
long. The body can be made from 4 to 10
feet high. This evaporator is so arranged
that there is the greatest latitude as to
the arrangement of tubes that may be used.
It is also equipped with several types of


171
bottoms. The third machine is a new film
type evaporator that promises to supply a
very large number of problems due to the
wide field it seems to offer. Each evap-
orator will have its own condenser, pumps,
drip receivers, etc. The equipment will be
located in the south half of the old boiler
house, and will use nearly half the entire
room. The rest of the space is reserved
for the apparatus which is planned for
the near future.
Delivery of the machinery will begin
about Nov. 1, and it is hoped that the
whole laboratory will be finished before the
first of the vear.
CHANGES IN STAFF
The Chemical Enginering staff has suf-
fered more changes from the war than al-
most any other on the Campus. Prof. A.
H. White has a Captain's commission and
is in the Nitrate division of the Ordnance
department, working on the question of
supplying the nitric acid needed for war
and fertilizer consumption by processes
starting from the nitrogen of the air. Prof,
(now Captain) A. E. White has charge of
specifications for ordnance materials. Prof.
Rue and Mr. Upthegrove both have Cap-
tain's commissions; Prof. Rue's work be-
ing uncertain at present, and Mr. Upthe-
grove being in the inspection of small arms.
To take their places a number of new
men had to be provided, and a very satis-
factory staff has been obtained. At the
head of the department is Dr. C. D. Holley.
Dr. Holley is a graduate of the University
of Maine, took post-graduate work at the
University of Michigan, was Professor of
Industrial Chemistry at the University of
North Dakota, and for several years has
been with the Acme White Lead and Color
Works of Detroit. Dr. Holley retains his
connection with this Company and only-
gives part time to the Department.
Prof. W. P. Wood of M. A. C. comes
to us on part time to take charge of the
metallurgical work. Prof. Wood gradu-
ated from this department, took his M.S.
here, and has since be en teaching Industrial
Chemistrv at M. A. C. He has had con-
siderable commercial experience in the line
he is now taking up. Mr. J. C. Brier comes
to take an Assistant Professorship. He
held the Acme fellowship in 1913, was with
the Acme White Lead and Color Co. for
some time thereafter, and has since been
in the manufacture of dyes and intermed-
iates. He leaves the position of Superin-
tendent of the Holland Analine and Chem-
ical Company. Mr. R. S. Archer, who
held the Detroit Edison Fellowship last
year, has been appointed Instructor to work
in Metallography. Mr. C. F. Smart, 'l6E,
who has been in the laboratory of the U.
S. Graphite Co. in Saginaw, comes as In-
structor to handle the work in Gas and
Fuel analysis. Mr. W. B. Parker, who
graduated from the University of New
Hampshire, and has had a number of years'
experience in sugar manufacture and in
steel laboratories, has an instructorship and
will have most of the work in the new
Chemical Engineering laboratory.
Prof. Badger and Dr. Laird of the old
staff still remain, so that the present staff
really is largei than the old one. All the
regular undergraduate courses will be
given. Due to the fact that no one is
familiar enough with the work, some of
the special graduate work will probably be
dropped, but the new members will un-
doubtedly replace this with other courses
along lines with which they are familiar.
Arrangements have been made to continue
the Paper Fellowship, the Detroit Copper
and Brass Rolling Mills Fellowship, and
the Detroit Edison Fellowship. The hold-
ers will be Mr. S. Kaplan, Mr. F. R. Neth-
away, and Mr. F. C. Carter, respectively.
Mr. Clifford Bottje will hold the Teaching
Assistantship in the Asphalt laboratory.
DEPARTMENT OF SURVEYING
The Department of Surveying will have
a part—map making—in connection with
the military training under General Or-
ders 49. The details have not yet been
completed. Some similar work, modified
to suit the needs of students, will be given
those taking the Army Stores Course.
A shipment of instruments formerly used
by the United States Coast and Geodetic


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Survey was received last spring. The col-
lection of instruments and apparatus of
historical interest increases each year. Most
of this material can not he displayed on
account of a lack of space and proper facil-
ities. When new quarters are provided for
the Department of Surveying a very inter-
esting and instructive exhibit will he made
at once.
Assistant Professor H. G. Raschhacher
has* tendered his resignation and accepted
a place with Mr. W. G. Clark, "84, Sanitary
Engineer, Toledo, Ohio.
BRONZE TABLETS TO FORMER DEANS REED AND

MDCCCCXVII
ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING IN SUMMER
SESSION
Prof. J. C. Parker reports that the en-
rollment in Electrical Engineering courses
offered this summer far exceeded that of
ar.y previous summer session. He attrib-
utes this increase to the fact that the En-
gineers are in a hurry to complete their
courses because of the condition brought
about bv the war.
MILITARY TKAIMXG
A course in Military Training has been
established in the University under the di-
rect control of Lieut. George Mullen of
the U. S. Army, and is open to all male
students on the campus. The course is to
include physical and infantry drill, target
practice, map making, first aid, and con-
siderable theoretical work. The latter work
will be given in a series of lectures by dif-
ferent professors on the campus.
Officers for the corps are to be chosen
from the Junior and Senior classes and
from the Post-graduates. Juniors will re-
ceive the non-commissioned positions while
the commissioned officers are to be picked
from the Seniors and Post-graduates. All.
however, without previous experience, will
have to start in as privates,. and, if pos-
sible, "rise from the ranks."
Seniors will receive four hours credit for
inis year"s work while the others will re-
ceive the same amount for this year after
ihey have completed the second year of
vork. The course this year is to be de-
cidedly intensive, as four year's work will
he covered as completely as possible in
the one. Seven and one-half hours per
week will he devoted to the work by each
man with some extra hours for those who
hop to be come officers. As to equipment,
all men taking the course will receive uni-
forms, and three hundred rifles have al-
ready been procured. So far about fifteen
hundred men have signed up for the course,


173
but Lieut. Mullen is expecting fully twice
as many.
Lieut. Mullen is going to ask those en-
rolled in the corps to wear their uniforms
to regular classes as well as requiring the
uniform to be worn at military drill and
lectures. The lectures are held one day a
week at the regular drill hour, four to
five-thirty in the afternoon, daily except
Saturday and Sunday.
Lieut. Mullen has so arranged the work
that Seniors, who would ordinarily he un-
able to benefit from such a course, may
complete in a single year most of the work
which under ordinary circumstances would
be covered in four. Thus a Senior who
does satisfactory work will be recom-
mended upon graduation next June for a
commission in the Officers' Reserve. The
same applies to the present Junior a year
from now, and the Sophomore two years
hence.
ASSEMBLIES
Beginning with this semester, new men
are in charge of the various class assem-
blies of the Engineering College. Prof.
C. T. Johnston is now chairman of the
committee on mentors and is in charge of
the Junior assembly. Prof. Riggs has the
Senior assembly. Asst. Prof. Hauhart,
the Sophomore, and Asst. Prof. Merrick is
the kind shepherd of the Freshmen.
MATHEMATICS
Professor Peter Field has since his de-
parture for Fort Sheridan received a com-
mission as Captain of the Coast Artillery
and has been transferred to Fort Monroe,
Va. He will most probably be again trans-
ferred from there to the Ordnance Depart-
ment to do research work and gunnery.
Leave of absence has been given him from
the University for the duration of the war.
THE NEW LIBRARY
The Selden-Brcck Construction Co. of St.
Louis, to whom the general contract for
the new library has been given, are mak-
ing a great effort to finish the north wing
by Jan. 1. according to their contract. Due
to labor troubles,.however, as well as de-
days in shipments, they have been hamp-
ered in their work to such an extent that
the completion of the building at that date
is practically out of the question. With the
fifty men employed by that company, as
well as the additional men employed by
the University, the building grounds have
become a scene of considerable activity.
Sub-contracts have been let to the Michi-
gan Portland Cement Co., Chelsea; the
Ohio and Michigan Sand and Gravel Co.,
Toledo, Ohio; The Perry Testing Lab-
oratory, Detroit; the Stone Mountain Gran-
ite Co., Stone Mountain, Ga.; the Ingalls
Bedford Stone Co.: the Atlantic Terra-
Cotta Co., New York; the Rochester Bridge
Works, Rochester, Ind.; the Interstate
Plaster Co., Detroit, and the Peoria Stone
and Marble Co. The Hydraulic Pressed
Brick Co. will do the face brick work; the
Robert Mitchel Furniture Co., Cincin-
nati, the cabinet wrk and interior trim-
ming; L. Ruda, Chicago, the sheet metal
and ventilating duct work, while the steel
windows and cast iron spanvals will be
furnished by the Crittall Casement Window
Co., Detroit. Kestener and Hecht, Chicago,
will build the elevators and Snead &amp; Co..
Jersey City, the stacks, floor framing, shelv-
ing and marble floors. Tiler and Hippach,
Chicago, will do the glazing.
The concrete work on the foundation and
for most of the first floor is almost com-
pleted. During the summer, electric lights
were strung up and work carried on thru
most of the night.
The building was designed by Albert
Kahn of Detroit, who also designed and
supervised the construction for the En-
gineering and New Science' buildings as
well as the Hill auditorium. The contract-
ing superintendent is J. M. McDonald, and
all of the steam fitting, plumbing, electrical
work and painting is being done by the
University itself.
The University is being represented by
Prof. John F. Shepard, of the Psychology
Department.

DAVIS
17
Nesting snugly at the bottom of a sixty-
foot hill, on the shores of an inland lake
about twelve miles southwest of Cheboygan,
is a double row of small tent-like steel
buildings. There are about forty in all,
carefully laid out on the arc of a wide
circle, and they look very white and neat.
The hill, on the south, which seems to rise
high, presents a pretty picture with
its hardwood trees, set off here and there
by a few birches. On the east and west,
still in its wild and tangled state of trees
and underbrush, the shore bends around,
horseshoelike. This—is Camp Davis.
There is no one, with the possible excep-
tion of Prof. Davis himself, who can better
state the purpose, work and ideals of Camp
Davis, than Prof. Clarence T. Johnston,
who has done so much toward making the
Camp what it is at the present day.
"There is no true synonym for the word
"camp" in the English language. Moses
conducted a camp,—so did Caesar. We
cannot associate these great men of the
desert, mountain and plain with picnics
and resorts. We are discriminating in our
choice of the proper word when such char-
acters are under discussion. To our minds
a picnic is a temporary affair and we count
among its appropriate parts, bright colors,
popular games and music, oratory of a
kind that frequently sacrifices thought to
phraseology and a lunch that brings delight
and often leaves regret. A resort fills the
gap between a picnic and a camp. It may
be as light and frothy as the former when
it is simply a place to loaf. Under such
conditions, its total influence is likely to
lie harmful. When a resort is a place of
refuge where people go to improve them-
selves physically, mentally and morally, it
borders on a camp. However, a camp rep-
resents the best elements of the resort and
goes further. A camp always has a definite
object in view. It is the center of accom-
plishment. It has to do with history, it
upholds ideals and it develops and retains
a spirit all its own. The citizens of a camp
are industrious. The work in hand may be
trivial in character, when viewed by the
eyes of the world, but the measure of its
importance is not fixed by casual observ-
ers. While industry is the rock which sup-
ports a camp, yet the experienced camper
knows that work without relaxation brings
about abnormal development. A camp pro-
vides time and place for play. A camp
stands for order, punctuality and cleanli-
ness. It furnishes opportunity for beauti-
fying surroundings, for improving health
conditions and for prayer and mediation.
The man who lives in a camp delights in


175
mental and physical exercise. He obtains
some of his mental recreation in dreams
concerning the beauties of his surroundings
and the part he may play to make Na-
ture's gifts more attractive and valuable to
him. His physical exercise may come, in
large measure, because of his desire to sea
his dreams realized in substantial form.
A man may live alone and yet conduct
a camp. When a camp embraces what we
term society,—that is a number of people,—
the individual has an opportunity to ap-
preciate some of the fundamental princi-
ples which should support good citizenship.
trading influences of ordinary, humdrum
existence are excluded. He is surrounded
by companions whose hopes and aspirations
all share in common. He discovers that
even his instructors are human and that
they have ideals and sympathies that did
not find adequate expression in the more
complex world without. Experienced camp-
ers know that when plants and animals are
brought into new environment they are
apt to show unusual tendencies. The man
from the mountains and plains often loses
his balance in the city. The city-bred man
may have similar trouble in the country.
'% y*
■■♦./ -
This—is Camp Davis
While a camp keeps its main working ob-
ject in view at all times, yet its citizens
must pause to consider those vital prob-
lems which concern the individual and his
relations with others. Here is an oppor-
tunity for the individual to learn some les-
sons, not taught well in the great world
of experience, where vital things are de-
graded or lost in the whirlpools of com-
merce, politics, war and a society which
represents wealth and idleness alone.
Where education is the great object
which supports a camp, the student en-
joys surroundings that are almost ideal.
He has an opportunity to concentrate on
the subjects which interest him. The dis-
Students recognize this quickly and dis-
cover that a camp is an ideal city which
enjoys all of the advantages of a rural
community. They find unity instead of a
compromise between a victorious majority
and a protesting minority. Selfishness, de-
sire for gain, commercial rivalry all of the
prejudices of modern society are suppressed
by common demand. The citizens of such
a camp co-operate harmoniously, inspired
by an appreciation of natural things, good
health, clean morals and an enthusiasm
which prevails only in a company made
up of the young and vigorous. In such an
atmosphere honor thrives without stimula-
tion, while surveillance is unknown.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
"Camp Davis is situated on the shore of
Douglas Lake, Cheboygan County, Michi-
gan. In and about the camp may be found
lakes, sandy beaches and plains, woods,
hills and valleys and a small stream. This
home for extensive field operations is sur-
veying,—the great educational object which
supports the camp,—has been occupied since
1909, when, by the purchase of lands, the
University lent encouragement to this
branch of instruction. For thirty-five y;ars
Captain Martin
prior to that time the camp drifted from
place to place. Its purpose and its spirit
have remained the same, because these
were introduced by the pioneer who organ-
ized the camp and whose name it bears.
Camp Davis enjoys the love and devotion
of all who have taken an active part in its
support. Its friends insist that it con-
tinue as a camp."
***********
The first step toward the actual invasion
of this delightful spot, that the '18 Civils
had heard so much about and were so anx-
ious to get to, was taken on June 28, 1917,
when a party, about fifty strong, stormed
the City of Mackinac at Detroit. The pas-
sengers and crew were somewhat puzzled
(the crew worried), to see such a large
party, carrying in addition to the usual
bags and suitcases, musical instruments and
many odd brown paper bundles. Were
these delegates to a special convention, or
actors going north to play at the resorts?
A good rousing Michigan locomotive served
as an introduction soon after the boat was
under way, and then there was "something
going" most of the twenty-six hours, till
the ship docked at Cheboygan. The trip
was livened up continually by humorous
little incidents such as Pat Graney leaving
the supper table and making a rapid bolt
up the stairs to answer a telephone call.
He was half way up when finally "tumbled."
An improvised orchestra of the camp men
on board furnished the music for a dance
on the main deck that evening. You see
one of the officials of the ship was a grad-
uate of the College of Literature, Science
and the Arts, but after they forgave him
for that, he temporarily suspended the
rules and regulations. Of course, there
were a few "fussers" along too.
After a few hours stay at Cheboygan,
and dinner at the New Cheboygan Hotel
(and a couple spins on the roullette wheel),
the party started to camp on a launch.
Not knowing what Congress might do be-
fore Camp was over, several of the boys re-
hearsed "How Dry I Am." Suitcases and
baggage were left at Cheboygan to be taken
to camp by auto.
The first night in Camp witnessed a
severe storm, the only storm that was had
during the whole eight weeks. The fol-
lowing morning, Sunday, the news came
in that the auto truck, bringing the bag-
gage, had broken down and had been out
on the road all night. The good old horse
and wagon had to be relied on, and when
the baggage finally got to its destination,
it was found that several of the suitcases
were in a semi-liquid state. (Moral—Don't
pay $1.98 for a suitcase.) However, this
did not interfere with the construction of


177
docks, furniture making and the arranging
of the details about the shack that was to
be ''home" for the coming eight weeks.
Everything was made as comfortable as
possible. So the first Sunday turned out
to be a very busy day.
Monday morning the regular schedule
was put into effect. There was no gradual
picking up of the work. It started at full
speed and stayed there until three in the
afternoon, August 24. Owing to the seri-
ous international situation, the program for
the summer of 1917 was heavier than that
of any previous year. The program was
as follows:
6 :oo A. M.—Roll call.
6:05 A. M.—Calesthenics.
6:30 A. M.—Breakfast.
7 :30 A. M.—Field Practice.
11:30 A. M.—It never came too soon.
12:30 P. M.—Back to the woods.
5 :30 P. M.—"Henry sure can cook I"
9:30 P. M.—Think of it—lights out!
In addition to this program, Captain Wil-
liam Martin, of Winncpeg, Canada, lec-
tured three nights a week on army organ-
ization, system of supply, field entrench-
ments, trench fighting, musketry, military
law and laws of war.
The 1917 Camp feels extremely fortunate
that Captain Martin was with them. He
is a graduate of Oxford University, Eng-
land, and was practicing law in Canada
when the world conflict broke out. He at
once entered the Canadian Army and spent
seventeen months in France. For seven
months he was in the front trenches, from
which place he had to be sent home to
recover from a fever contracted due to
inhaling poisonous gases. Captain Martin
made his lectures extremely interesting.
He pictured trench life as it really is, in
all its glory and dread fulness, for he knew
that in all probabilities many of those to
whom he was speaking would soon be hav-
ing the same experiences.' Captain Martin
also taught squad drill, manual of arms
and bayonet fighting every Saturday after-
noon. About two hours were devoted to
each period of this work. He also took
charge of field parties in military recon-
naisance. Captain Martin's frank, straight-
forward way won him the favor of every
man at Camp, and they will never forget
him.
The work in the field was very thorough.
Everything that a Civil Engineer and a
Forester should know about surveying was
taught, from laying out a railroad, to
"shooting" the sun for the watch time.

Dean Cooley Also Paid the Camp a Visit
The morning calesthenics was also a dis-
tinctive feature of this year's Camp. Cap-
tain Martin had charge of this. It had
Doc May's workout over at the gymnasium
beat a hundred ways.
Life at Camp Davis, however, is not
all work. Advantage was taken of every
facility that the Camp afforded for recrea-
tion. The Great American Game held
sway in the world of sports. Two leagues,


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
the Black Fly and the Mosquito, each
played three games a week. These were
played soon after supper. Quoits was also
a favorite game. "Doc" Stouffer was an
expert in this Held and was rarely beaten.
Swimming was indulged in at every op-
portunity. The nice sand beach and clear
fresh water was a temptation too strong
for anyone to resist. Many learned how
to swim here.
Every Thursday and Sunday night, a
large bonfire in front of the "Michigan
Union'' announced a sing. These were'
very popular, and formed one of the dis-
tinctive features of the Camp that its citi-
zens never forget. The distinguished vis-
itors and faculty men spoke at these gath-
erings, and were always well applauded.
The "Bug Camp," politely known as the
Biological Station, is located only a short
distance to the east of Camp Davis, but re-
lations between the two camps never be-
comes very intimate. The Bug Camp came
very near to closing up at one time during
the summer. They operated on Eastern
time, while Camp Davis ran by Central
Standard time. Early every morning—but
one—the B. C. bell would ring, waking
every one up within a half mile radius.
On this one occasion, however, the bell
was silent. The commander-in-chief of
said B. C. was soon seen running wildly
down "State Street" almost beside him-
self for despair. "How could the Biolog-
ical Station ever get along without the
bell!'' After some remarkable detective
work on the part of Prof. Johnston, the
bell was soon back into operation. But
not in its original position—-oh no—it was
put up high and firmly this time. Dick
Weske, "the strong arm squad," never
could clear up the suspicion against him
in this affair.
The neighboring resorts were visited
quite often. At Bryant's, also on Lake
Douglas, they had real ice cream. Straight
across the lake, at Ingleside, was located
the nearest piano. The fair ones at these
various places were very often the main
topic of discussion.
Camp Davis, beside having its own wa-
ter works, sanitary system and being up-
to-date in other ways, also has its own
newspaper, "The Black Fly." This is a
sheet which comes out in the form of a
blue print. There is one issue a week, and
the boys were always waiting for it when
it came out on Saturdays.
For the first time in many years, Camp
Davis was visited by the man who had
founded it, Prof. Joseph P. Davis. His
visit was an extremely enjoyable one to
both the faculty and students at the Camp.
Dean Mortimer E. Cooley and Prof. W. C.
Hoad also paid the Camp a visit.

Sack Wrestling—Visitors' Day
The last Saturday at Camp is set aside
for visitors. People (there were over two
hundred this year) for miles around come
to inspect Camp, be entertained—and fed.
Preparations for Visitors' Day are made
weeks in advance. There were several
rounds in the boxing ring, a hundred-yard
dash, three-legged race, pie-eating contest
(some practiced for this all summer), a
baseball game between the Faculty and the
champion student team, boat races, swim-
ming races and many other features. It is
strictly against the rule for Camp boys to
wear anything but regular working clothes
on this day. and the visitors were de-
lighted to see Several who dared to ven-
ture out in white trousers plunged into the
lake. "Little Eva" Buchman, the official
officer, was the hit of the day. He saved
Umpire "Doc" Stouffer from a severe
trouncing during the ball game when the


179
students, enraged by a prejudiced decision
in favor of the faculty, mobbed Doc en
masse.
**********
And now the old Camp stands on the
shores of Lake Douglas, deserted, except
for one man, Mr. Jarman, who will live
there all through the cold winter, until it
again receives the breath of life, and be-
comes once more the real Camp Davis.

WIT AND THE ENGINEERS
&lt;&lt;pvOMESTIC—none—the lady is in
.'-' charge. Social—dining car meals
on the New York Central are the only im-
portant item. Criminal—running a public
service corporation—?—"
This, together with many other witty
answers that we received in response to
our last Alumni card, lead us to believe
that the Engineer isn't such an awful bad
fellow after all when it comes to fun. De-
spite the hard and dry math., calculus.
and other extremely theoretical courses in-
flicted upon him during those brief four
years on the Campus, he has a strong and
keen sense of humor.
The above remark came from Alex Dow,
President and General Manager of the De-
troit Edison Co., at 18 Washington Ave.,
Detroit. Others were received from places
on all points of the compass. Ralph R.
Tinkham. '05. from Kctchikon, Alaska,
writes, "'Exiled' to Alaska as Superintend-
ent of the r6th Lighthouse District on the
coasts of our 'Arctic possession where there
is less snow and cold weather than in
Ann Arbor and where the 'hottest' on rec-
ord in summer is 83 degrees. I enjoy my
copies of the Michigan Tkchnic."
Then we got a new Ford joke from
"Ollie" W. Hall, '15, and formerly editor-
in-chief of The Technic. He says, "En-
gaged with my brother under the name of
HALL BROTHERS in pushing Fords on
the unsuspecting public. Also conduct gen-
eral garage and service station with full
line of accessories. Can't get enough Fords,
so we are now painting tomato cans black
and filling them half full of gasoline. Fish
some—hunt more—and worry very little.
Selah." ( We don't know just what the
last word stands for, but it was on the
card.) Mr. Hall also wrote, "Congratula-
tions on The Teehnic. It is a fine paper
and makes mighty interesting reading for
'us has-beens'." Then remember, gentle
reader, there has never yet been such an
issue of The Technic as the Thirtieth An-
niversary number coming out this winter.
Mr. Hall is located at 1112 West Oak St.,
Ft. Collins, Colorado.

Then Otto Klotz, way back from the

servatory in the Department of the Interior
at Ottawa, Canada, wrote: "Activities:
Domestic—Watching others work. Social
—Entertaining grandchildren. Criminal—

These are a few answers showing that
there is still some hope for the Engineer.
If you receive one of our cards for the
first time, fill it out and send in by all

time, send it in too, and tell us something

'17 MEN BUILD FORT RILEY
CANTONMENT
The Contonment at Fort Riley, Kansas,
to accommodate 70,000 men of the draft
army, is being built to a large extent by
Michigan Engineers. Among these are
twenty '17 men who left in a body shortly
before the close of last semester to take
up this work. Those who left were: H.
E. Baker. C. M. Burns, R. W. Collins, H.
M. H. Corey, R. J. Dandero, W. W. Larsh,
R. L. McNamee, A. D. Mott, A. L. Oppen-

C. E. Wells, H. C. Worfel, H. R. Erdman,
L. W. Frey, R. Birdsell, and D. B. Gard-
ner.
A Michigan reunion which included these
men in the service as well as those men
working on the cantonment in the vicinity
of Fort Riley was held in Junction City,
(jii June 22, 1917. Songs were sung, and
yells were yelled, quite startling the popu-
lace with their loyal Michigan spirit. A
committee is at present making plans for
periodic meetings of this kind for the fu-
ture.
MICHIGAN MEN WITH DETROIT
EDISON ENTER ARMY
There are many Michigan men employed
in the various departments of the Detroit

Hunt, '12, of the Cons't Engineering and
Drafting Dep'ts; Fred Compton. '14, of
the same dep't and Carl R. Daugherty, '16,
of the Property Dep't, have all joined the
Officers' Reserve Corps. George A. Chatel,
'15, of the Production Dep't, Delray, has
entered the Navy, while F. J. Chatel, '14.

ERNEST P. GOODRICH, 98, TAKES
NEW YORK CENSUS
Ernest P. Goodrich, '98, has been made
director for the City of New York of the
military census of New York State, men-
tiones a recent issue of the Engineering
News-Record. This work gives him charge
of the organization of administration ma-
chine which will aggregate nearly twenty
thousand people, consisting entirely of vol-
unteers. The census of almost three mil-
lion people will be handled by this organ-
ization.
Mr. Goodrich was also tendered the
chairmanship of a sub-committee under
the Council of National Defense to cover
certain phases of cantonment location, de-
sign and construction, but he shifted this
position to another individual so that he
could take care of the military census.
After graduating from the University of
Michigan, Mr. Goodrich immediately en-
tered the United States Navy as a civil
engineer. Later he became chief engineer


THE MICHIGAN TBCHNIC
of the Bush Terminal Co., and at present
enjoys an extensive consulting practice.
He has served as consultant for. the Bor-
ough of Manhattan and has been affiliated
with many engineering projects, such as
harbor improvement in the Philippine Is-
lands, investigation of possibilities of de-
velopments of slack-water navigation on
Ernest P. Goodrich, '98
several small tributaries to the Ohio River,
including dams, locks, railroad and coal-
handling surveys. He translated "Der
Kisenbetonbau,'' by Prof. Emil M6rsch.
Lately Mr. Goodrich has also been ap-
pointed director of the Bureau of Munici-
pal Research of Xew York City.

larsony?

ONE ON THE PROFESSOR
"Has anything ever been discovered on
Venus?" asked the student of astronomy.
"No," replied the old professor, whose

A PIRATE

OVERLAND SAVES
$40,000 IN COAL
Utilization of Sawdust and Scrap
Cuts One-Third Off Fuel
Bi'l of Plant.
The dcRrce to which what were formerly
waste products art- utilized in large manu
facturing establishments is surprising to
one not familiar with the present - day
methods.
In the Toledo plant of the Willys-Over-
lana company utilization of sawdust and
scrap irom the wood-working departments
alone saves $40,000 per year in the coal bill.
To operate the Wiliys-Ovcrland drop forge
plant, in which there are 60steam hammers,
and to heat the 25 acres ot new buildings
just completed, 10 huge boilers of a total of
3.800 horse-power capacity ore required.
These boilers would consume 200 tons of
coal for every winter day if it were neces-
sary to use coal. The useol waste from the
wood-working shops saves almost one-third
of this and virtually eliminates need for
coal in summer.

are using sawdust and wood refuse as fuel for Murphy Stokers with great saving and high
efficiency.
During this fuel famine the Murphy Stoker is proving its real ability to manufacturers in
every line of industry. In some big plants you find the Murphy burning sawdust and ordin-
ary wood refuse—in hundreds of others you will discover the Murphy efficiently handling the
poorest grades of bituminous coal—even the "stoker fodder" (mine refuse) which is prac-
tically the only available fuel on the market at the present time.
The Murphy will Burn
Your Cheapest Fuel
Install Murphy Stokers in your boiler room and you can burn the fuel which conies at the
fairest price and in the most abundant supply in your own particular locality.
The Murphy is easily adapted to burn practically any kind of fuel—and you will pay for the
equipment in actual cash saving between now and the time normal fuel conditions are estab-
lished again.
As the largest individual manufacturers of stokers in the world we can make reasonably
prompt shipments on all orders placed at once. Write us for absolute proof of big savings
for representative concerns—and suggestions on how to handle the fuel question in your

TAKING OFF HEAT
Molten steel is flowing from the open-hearth furnace into
twenty-ton ladles. In this case a bifurcated spout is used
whereby the metal is passed first to one ladle and then to
the other.
Improved methods are developed by the constant inter-
change of experiences among the organization of practi-
cal, technical men at our eight steel foundries.

R. S. SWINTON. INSTRUCTOR IN ENGINEERING MECHANICS
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
AS WITH most scientific develop-
ments each country, Sweden,
England, Germany, France and Amer-
ica claim some credit in the develop-
ment of photography. The success-
ful application of the principles date
from the discoveries and investiga-
tions of the Frenchmen Niepece and
Daguerre. To the latter appears to
have been given the vision, for in the
presentation of his famous discovery,
the daguerreotype, to the French
Chambre of Deputies in 1839, Arago
said, "That the subjection of photo-
graphic images in their formation to
geometrical rules will enable us with
very few data to determine from these
images the exact dimensions of the
highest objects, of the most inaccessi-
ble structures * * * We could give
some ideas we have entertained of
rapid means of investigation that the
topographer will be enabled to borrow
from photography * * *"
The general use of photographic
surveying has never come about, and
probably as much from a lack of
familiarity with the principles of de-
scriptive geometery and perspective
as the lack of a demand for the maps.
The methods have been taught in sev-
eral schools and used by the Ameri-
can and Canadian Alaskan Boundary
Survey. Elsewhere photography has
been applied in surveys rather by way
of experiment, unless we include the
tremendous strides recently made in
airplane photography.
There are two general divisions to
photo-surveying. In the first the
camera is pointed horizontally and
two or more pictures are taken which
cover the required area. These pic-
tures may be made (1) in parallel
pairs, (2) in any horizontal direction,
or (3) by means of the panoramic
camera may be made radially. The
second division includes those pictures
taken from the airplane in any direc-
tion in space, and those simultaneous
pairs of pictures used in observing
cloud formation and movement.
Zeiss of Jena, makes a very elabo-
rate instrument, a section of which is
shown in Fig. 1. It consists of a
camera capable of being levelled.
Clamps, slow motion screws, and hori-
zontal circle are provided. On the
top of the camera is a telescope ar-
ranged to point in a plane at right
angles to the camera pointing. This
telescope is furnished with a vertical
circle and in later models with an ad-
justable cross wire. In the cut the
telescope is pointed vertically down-
ward. The mirror in front of the in-
strument throws a ray of light from
the sky onto the upper "Hole mark"
or centerline mark which would other-
wise be in the shaded portion of the
picture. The lens is fixed and a cap
is used for making exposures.
The method of operation is to take
two pictures from opposite ends and
perpendicular to a base, pointing par-
allel and covering the area to one side
of the base which may be actually
measured or its length determined by
Stadia. The stadia board as furnished
stands horizontally upon an extra tri-
pod which is set up over the opposite
end of the base. It has only two grad-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
uations and the distance is determined
by measuring the interval between
these marks with a vertical cross hair
carried on a micrometer across the
field of the telescope. A mathematical
reduction of the micrometer readings
give the length of the base.

These rays do not converge. If any
single point as M is located in both
pictures rays through these points and
the centers of the lenses must con-
verge and meet, as shown for the
points Mj and M2 which meet in space
as M and project onto the plane as

Let the Base Line be drawn on the
map to scale as OVO'2 (Fig. 2) and
let the reversed plates be stood on edge

the paper of the center rays passing
through the lens at Ox and 02 and

M.M/'rM/'O, : : M M" : M" O, .
M M" is the elevation of the point
M above a horizontal plane through
O, to the same scale as the base line
was drawn.
Since all plotting is done on the


191
drawing paper the information re-
quired is the distances 0/ M/, M/
M2' and M1 M,". All this may be ob-
tained by the use of a micrometer
frame as shown in Fig. 3. 0/ M/ is
read on scale A; M/ M„' on scale B;
and M, M/' on scale C. A still more
a parallel to the base. For this rea-
son the reading of scale B, Fig. 3, or
the distance M/ M/. Fig. 2 estab-
lishes the best locus of point M' on
line C D, a line parallel to A B.
The wonderful feature of the Stero-
comparator is that when a little circu-
Fig. 2
Micrometer Frame
Fig. 3
elaborate device known as a Stero-
comprarator can be used for observ-
ing the plates. It is shown in Fig. 4
and the corresponding scales are X,
Y and Z. The points are observed
through microscopes of four or six
power on the plates directly. One
geometric principle is taken advan-
tage of in determination of distances.
All triangles having the same base
and altitude have the same width on
lar ring, or balloon, corresponding to
a cross wire, in the focal plane of the
right hand microscope is set over a
point in the right hand picture, and
a similar balloon is set over the same
point in the left hand picture, and the
observer places his eyes at the two
eyepieces, the pictures become plastic
and appear stereoptically in relief,
with the point under observation sur-
rounded by a single ring. When this


THE MICHIGAN TECH NIC
condition exists the instrument is set
for a reading. This little ring may
be caused to travel to and fro over
the picture as if it were a rodman,
except it has no regard for inacces-
sibility of the position. American
patent 1090494 covers an automatic
attachment or pantograph mechanism
which when attached to the Stero-
comprarator plots onto a map the
pointings desired.
Perspective screens or rows of
points have been derived geometrically
and superposed on these pictures.
These points are derived as if they
were spaced in straight lines at inter-
vals of say 50 meters and stood in the
sky over the landscape. When the
whole is viewed stereoptically the two
pictures and screen merge into one
plastic and it is possible by comparison
with the known points on the screen
to estimate the distance to any point
in the field. Thus we have a range
finder, not of one or two meters base,
but having a very great base. As
with most German instruments, how-
ever, these apparatus tend to become
cumbersome.
The American and English practice
does not require that the pictures be
taken in parallel pairs. Fig. 5 shows
a rather ancient English instrument.
K and K' are cross wires which leave
their trace on the picture locating its
center. L L are two celluloid tabs
upon which identification marks, such
as date, pointing number, and station
number are recorded. M is a mag-
netic compass carrying a graduated
celluloid ring which prints upon the
plate the bearing of the camera point-
ing. Above this a celluloid strip prints
a tangent scale. These are all in the
Fig. 5
sky portion of the picture as the image
on the plate is inverted and reversed.
An instrument made by C. L. Eerger
of Boston and costing about $500,
consists of a standard 4-inch the-
odolite, the wyes and telescope of
which may be removed and replaced
by a camera. Angles are read to
points on the horizon and to other sta-
tions, the camera is then mounted and
\


193
Fij. 6
oriented with the aid of the ground
glass so that the horizontal plate
readings correspond with- the tele-
scope pointings. The instrument is
simple, high grade, and satisfactory in
dry climates.
The process of plotting is shown in
Figs. 6 and 7. First the base O O'
is plotted to scale on the drawing, then
OC is drawn equal to the actual dis-
tance from the lens to the plate in
the camera, in the direction in which
the camera was pointed. A'C is the
trace of the plate and any points on
the picture, as A or B may be laid off
as A' or B' on this trace. The lines
A'O, B'O, etc., must contain the
points A and B on the map. By re-


THE MICHIGAN TECH NIC
peating the process from Station O'
as shown in Fig. 7 the points are lo-
cated by intersection. The elevation
of a point as A in Fig. 7 may be found
from the ratio X: Aa:: A"0': A O',
in which X is the elevation above the
camera, when it was set up at O',
taken to the same scale as used in
drawing of the base O O'.
It has been suggested that a pic-
ture might be projected onto a
screen and a transit placed at the
point corresponding to the center of
the lens used in taking the picture.
Let the picture plane in Fig. 7 be the
picture as projected onto the screen
and O' be the center of the transit.
The instrument man could then read
the angle and elevation to any point
as if in the field. Two such equip-
ments and two views of the same area
would make possible rapid plotting, by
intersections of pairs of observations
taken off the two pictures. This idea
led to planning an instrument consist-
ing of a low power microscope with
cross hairs. The microscope was to
have a vertical circle and trunnions so
as to be interchangeable with the tele-
scope of a small transit. A base was
to carry the instrument and the photo-
graphic plate so that horizontal and
vertical angles to points on the plate
could be read directly. There is no
reason why two such instruments
should not be set over the points o o'
of the map in Fig. 7 and attached
straight edges which swing with the
pointings of the instruments would lo-
cate points on the map automatically,
and much more simply than is done by
the German instrument. The idea is
sound but at present would not pay
for developing.
If a picture is taken over a level
surface and at a known height above
that surface, as from an observation
station pointing out over the water,
the plane may be divided, with the aid
of descriptive geometry and the prin-
ciples of perspective, into squares
which will show as trapezoids in the
picture. Such pictures taken of naval
maneuvers may be plotted quite simply
onto maps. From successive pictures
taken at equal time intervals positi-
tions and speeds of ships are record-
ed. E. Deville, General Surveyor of
Dominion Lands, Canada, shows in
his text, "Photographic Surveying," a
pantograph mechanism for plotting
such points directly from the pictures.
Cylindrical perspective is obtained
from a panoramic camera. The pic-
ture is taken on a flexible film curved
into a half cylinder by guides at the
top and bottom of the camera. The
lens is carried in the front of a flat
box which is pivoted to swing hori-
zontally and exposes the film through
a narrow slot in the back of the box.
This slot just sweeps over the curved
film as the box rotates through the
horizontal arc. Errors result from
the stretching and warping of the
films. The horizontal angle should be
proportional to lengths measured
along the film. The tangents of ver-
tical angles are in direct ratio to the
elevation of the point in the picture
above or below a horizontal center
line. If a picture of an ordinary
stadia board standing perpendicularly
at a known distance from the camera

Radial perspective has met some
favor both in this country and in Eu-
rope. A French instrument is shown
in Fig. &amp; The picture is taken
through the lens a and strikes an in-
clined mirror i at the back of the box
which projects it downward onto a
large horizontal photographic plate in

instrument revolves on a vertical axis

through the center, and registers the
horizon upon the plate. The pictures
may be tacked onto the map at the
point corresponding to the point of
taking and once oriented, the direction
to any point on the map and in the
picture is the same. Two such pic-
tures make possible the plotting of the
map. Similar pictures have been made
by pointing a box camera vertically
and placing over the lens an inverted
silver cone. Rays coming in from the
telescope of a transit. The work was
done by the Jesuites at their various
observatory stations.
Experience in Europe has shown
that the most reliable information
which aeroplanes can secure is ob-
tained photographically. The prob-
lems met in aeroplane cameras differ
from those met in surveying cameras
in several respects. The surveying
camera stands on a tripod and may
use a slow lens stopped down to give
Fig. 8
landscape strike the cone and project
downward into the camera lens re-
sulting in an annular picture of the
entire horizon upon the plate. Some
difficulties of lens design are met with,
however.
Simultaneous photographs of clouds
taken from opposite ends of meas-
ured bases have been used in deter-
mining cloud formations and ve-
locities. The stations were connected
by telephones and excellent pictures
were obtained. The camera was
mounted in the same manner as the
a sharp image. Exposures may require
several seconds. The aircraft camera
demands a rapid shutter yet must se-
cure a very sharp image. Lenses are
furnished with these instruments of
different focal lengths, or magnifica-
tions, for altitudes ranging from five
hundred to ten thousand feet. As the
magnification increases the tendency
to blur due to vibration increases,
various shock absorbing attachments
and suspensions are in use to over-
come the engine vibration. It is re-
ported that cameras for this work


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
have been developed which are motor
driven, taking pictures automatically
and at regular time intervals. The
film is said to show a record made
automatically of the azimuth, altitude,
and time on each exposure.
The lenses designed for great dis-
tances or altitudes include on the plate
only a small portion of the area in
front of the camera. The cone of
rays before the lens being much more
acute than the cone made up of the
same rays between the plate and the
lens. There are in use such magnify-
ing cameras for microscopic and as-
tronomical work. Results from such
lenses cannot he plotted as shown in
figures 6 and 7 without finding a new
equivalent distance from the lens to
the plate.
Green and yellow do not register
properly on the ordinary rapid
emulsions used to sensitize plates and
films. Ray filters are used in photo-
graphic surveying but they slow down
the action too much for aeroplane
photography. For this reason the
slower orthocromatic emulsion is used
for plates taken over the land but ray
filters are required over the ocean.
Equipment has been furnished the
aviation section of the signal corp for
taking pictures, equalizing the scale
of projection, and printing a series of
pictures into a map. Details of this
equipment are not available but it may
be observed that a projection lantern
might he pointed in the same direc-
tion, obliquely and downward, as the
camera making the picture. If the
picture were thrown onto a hori-
zontal sensitized sheet of paper a map
drawn to scale would result. It would
of course be impossible to focus a pro-
jection lantern on an oblique surface.
For general information a light out-
fit similar to a moving picture machine
is supplied the observer. Prints are
taken off and projected onto a screen
for study.
In closing, it might be worth noting
that the present war should bring
about some great advances in aero-
plane photography. The results ob-
tained in the Civil and Franco-Prus-
sian war are still interesting. We
read, "In May, 1862, the Union army
succeeded in photographing the vi-
cinity of Richmond. Prints were made
and divided into rectangles. In sub-
sequent actions telegraphic communi-
cation was maintained between the
observer (in a balloon) and head-
quarters. Locations were designated
by numbers which had been given the
rectangles." "Similar successful use
of the balloon was made near Cairo.
111." "The French allowed the ex-
posed plates in cases to slide down a
chord from the observing balloon to
the ground * * * Photographs were
taken from balloons during the siege
of Paris * * * The faults of man-
agement, and these were most espe-
cially noticable on the German side,
were due mainly to inexperience, im-
perfect apparatus, and lack of instruc-
tion :—In this connection, it may be
stated that the Germans, in 1887
added to their army an aeronautic sec-
tion of fifty men."


JOHN DARLING, 73E
ABOUT four years ago the writer
did the rather unusual thing to
lay aside his professional work of
engineering before quite reaching the
point when advancing age would re-
quire such a step. It is true that his
health was somewhat impaired by
overwork, but another impelling mo-
tive was the desire for study and
travel which could not be fully grati-
fied while engaged in active work.
Astronomy, geology and physics, and
especially the first of these subjects,
were peculiarly attractive. The wish
possessed his mind to know more con-
cerning the great universe about us.
I was always fond of astronomy,
this taste must have been inherited
from my father. I remember, when a
boy on the farm in southern Michi-
gan, holding the watch and record-
ing time when my father was observ-
ing an eclipse of the sun. The tele-
scope by the way was one which my
father had made himself, that is he
purchased the lenses and constructed
the mounting. He had been a carver
by trade in early life, in Connecticut,
and was handy with tools. This tele-
scope was a small refractor, with the
objective about two inches, I should
think, and a tripod support with alt-
azimuth motion. The tube was bored
out of a dark wood. I think it was
mahogany, which was more plentiful
in those days. This instrument was
unfortunately destroyed by fire, to my
great regret.
A three and one-half inch telescope
bought fifteen years ago. with the
back yard at my home for an observa-
tory, a wooden tripod for a pier and
the celestial vault for the dome, has
afforded considerable pleasure, to
both myself and to my neighbors who
were occasionally invited to take a
look at the planets, comets and the
like. Of course I tried to tell my
guests some of the most interesting
facts regarding the objects viewed.
One thing leads to another, and
with more leisure and means in these
recent years I have been led to get a
larger telescope. The observatory
shown in the accompanying illustra-
tions is an expansion of the simple
idea just mentioned. It consists,
briefly, of a nine-inch refractor
mounted on a suitable pier, inclosed
in a metal dome, with an adjoining
waiting room provided with chairs,
book shelves, a celestial globe, a screen
for exhibiting lantern slides, and a
basement provided with conveniences.
The writer does . not and cannot
claim to be a real astronomer, and
docs not intend, for the present at
least, to undertake research work.
The observatory will be used chiefly
for the pleasure of viewing the inter-
esting objects with which the sky
abounds and as a visual aid to the
study of astronomy. Duluth citizens
also will be afforded the use of it on
stated occasions, and it will be the
endeavor in this way to promote a
popular knowledge among the people
of this fascinating and inspiring sub-
ject*
The following details I trust may be
of some interest to readers of The
Technic, although outside of strictly
engineering lines. The nine-inch ob-
ject glass is by the John A. Brashear


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Company of Pittsburgh, well known
opticians of excellent reputation, who
figured and ground the lenses from
glass made in Jena, Germany. Ameri-
can makers have not as yet produced
glass of the quality necessary for
large lenses. This lens was further
tested by O. L. Petitdidier, a Chicago
manufacturing optician who in a re-
port pronounces it "certainly first-
class and reflects great credit on the
and shipped by freight to Duluth. The
glass being a choice and costly part
of the instrument I brought with me
on the train. The package weighed
twenty-six pounds and so was not too
heavy to carry. It is unnecessary to
say that this was handled as carefully
as it could have been by the express
company.
By way of contrast think for a mo-
ment of the transportation of the
The Framework of the Dome is Nineteen' Feet in Diameter
maker." Mr. Petitdidier would have
made the object glass but did not have
a glass disc on hand of suitable size
and could not import it from Europe
on account of the war.
Wm. Gaertner &amp; Co., of Chicago,
built the mounting and was contractor
for the entire telescope. His work as
far as I can judge was first class and
well up-to-date.
The instrument after completion
and assembling at the shops at Hyde
Park, Chicago, was taken apart, boxed
great ioo-inch mirror of four and a
half tons weight from Pasadena in its
perilous trip up to the Mt. Wilson ob-
servatory, with the elaborate prepara-
tions and extreme care for its safety
so fully described in recent reports.
The telescope was set up by me
without help from the makers, with
the assistance of only the carpenters
who had worked on the building. A
chain hoist with some timbering was
used for lifting the boxes from the
ground to the telescope room. For


199
handling the heavier parts in setting
up the telescope the same hoist was
attached to a short timber placed
across the dome opening overhead, the
steel frame being sufficiently strong
for that purpose. The setting up re-
quired ten hours, working at it all of
one day and until 10 A. M. next day;
which was less time than I expected
it would take. Of course there were
adjustments remaining to be made. It
was cloudy that day, but the next day,
April 15, 1917, was fair and then for
the first time the telescope was turned
on the stars.*
The focal length of the objective is
130 inches. There are six eye-pieces
with powers ranging from 65 to 520
diameters. There is a two and one-
quarter inch finder which covers a
field one degree in diameter. The
declination and hour circles are clear-
ly marked and read by verniers to 0°.i
and im, respectively. They are pro-
vided with electric illumination.
The hour circle can of course be
used for turning the telescope to a de-
sired right ascension, as is done with
many telescopes, but a more con-
venient device is provided for this
purpose,—a sidereal dial and setting
wheel, mounted on the north side of
the pillar as shown in one of the
views. With this arrangement when
it is wished to point to a faint star the
telescope is moved by the wheel until
an index (shown in the view lying
in a nearly horizontal position across
the dial) comes to the desired hour
and minute reading taken from the
catalogue position of the star. The
telescope is then clamped to the polar
axis (the driving clock having previ-
ously been started) and the declina-
tion set off on the declination circle.
Then revolving the dome until the
opening comes in front of the tele-
scope the star is seen in the finder.
By the slow motion knobs the star is
brought to the center of the finder
and then it appears in the field of the
telescope. This requires no computa-
tion, and the operation is done in less
time than it takes to write this de-
scription.
The weight of the telescope and
mounting is about 2,000 pounds. The
supporting pier is of brick and con-

date of the owner's seventieth anniversary.
Mechanism of the Nine-Inch Refractor
crete. For the first six feet in height
it is a rectangular eight-inch vertical
brick wall inclosing a space which if
needed may be used for a clock vault
with double doors having glass panels.
This is surmounted by a concrete
shell eight inches thick and five feet
high, with some steel reinforcement.
This concrete top is narrowed up to
the size of the base of the iron pillar.
The driving clock weights descend
through the interior of the pillar and


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
concrete. The pier rests on solid
rock.
A few tests of the optical parts
were made by me after the telescope
was set up. One was by reading print
at a distance. I was just able to read
print of seven point or minion type
at a distance of about 700 feet, using
a power of 260. Some unsteadiness
of the air would not permit of a high-
er power. The print was about the
same as that used by the Michigan
Technic under "Engineering" and
"Architecture." I cannot say just
what should be expected of a tele-
scope of this size with this kind of
test. Newcomb has given some rules
but I believe they were intended only
for smaller telescopes.
Another test tried was that for
spherical aberration mentioned by
Newcomb in Side-Lights on Astron-
omy, p. 92, by examining the spectral
images of a bright star with eye-piece
pushed in, and drawn out. I found
these images to conform well to the
standard forms.
Some close double stars were also
tried for a test. These were separated
down to distances of 1.0 and 0.7 sec-
onds of arc, and this when the seeing
was not the best. This I was told
by a practical astronomer, was proof
of a good glass. I consider myself
fortunate in obtaining so perfect an
objective.
An architect assisted in the prepara-
tion of plans for the building,—Mr.
Richard E. Schmidt of Chicago, who
was something of an astronomer him-
self, and had recently built a dome
for his eight-inch refractor. The work
of both the architect and the builder
of the telescope has been very satis-
factory. The dome design and plans,
however, were prepared by the owner.
A number of observatories were first
visited to get ideas. Three or four
entirely distinct types of shutter were
found, each having some points of
claimed superiority.
The type of shutter adopted is that
in which the shutter frame extends
from front to rear over the top of the
dome in form of a complete semi-
circle, of which only the front half is
covered. The rear portion is a simple
uncovered frame terminating in a
pivot at the base of the dome, while
the front portion of the shutter is pro-
vided with trucks, which run on a
circular section of track, the radius of
the track being the diameter of the
dome.
One or two modifications adopted
for my shutter may be worth mention-
ing. The track of those which I vis-
ited consisted of a T-bar with the
flange upward, and the truck wheel
had a groove, like that of a rope
shieve, whicli fitted over the top of
the flange of the track and was self-
guiding. The objection to this was
the narrow width of the track, only
about one-fourth inch, and also that
in case the track should not have the
exact curve required or be out of ad-
justment in position, the flanges of the
groove of the truck wheel would be
under considerable stress and with re-
sulting friction. The track adopted
is an I-beam which has a wider track
face, and the truck wheel has a flat
tread or, rather, slightly rounded.
The truck is also provided with
side rollers which are set about one-
half inch on either side of the flange
of the I-beam. With the track in
good adjustment these side rollers do
not touch the flange, as the stiffness
of the shutter frame is sufficient to
keep the truck wheels near the mid-
dle of the rail. This requires less
force to operate and prevents wear.
The trucks have roller bearings. They
also have lugs which reach under the


20I
upper flange of the I-beam as a pro-
tection against the shutter being over-
turned by the wind.
Regarding another detail, the shut-
ters which I saw all had two bearings
at the rear, that, is a pivot at the base
of the dome and another bearing a
few feet vertically above the pivot,
supported by fraces attached to the
dome, in which bearing a vertical
journl fitted which was carried by a
bracket secured to the shutter frame.
This was to give support and steadi-
ness to the shutter. A study of the
stability and stiffness of the shutter
frame and its supports led me to con-
clude that for a dome of the size I
was building (and for some of those
which I saw) the upper bearing at the
rear was unnecessary. This is con-
firmed by the eleven-months' experi-
ence which the dome has passed
through, including the usual wind
storms.
This dome is nineteen feet in di-
ameter and covered with No. 22 gal-
vanized iron. I was able to simplify
some of the main portions of the
frame as compared with some other
domes, and reduce the weight and
yet retain an ample factor of safety.
It is also, I believe, about as nearly
weather-proof as practical to build.
The extension of the metal covering
at the base of the dome in the form
of an apron reaching out over the
tower cornice and terminating in a
drip curtain seems to be a marked im-
provement over other forms as far
as I have seen.
The drawing of the plans for the
dome frame was a most interesting
problem. It brought into use the de-
scriptive geometry that I studied at
the University of Michigan way back
in '68 or '69, when Professors Wood,
Davis, S. W. % Robinson, and others
were on the engineering faculty.
Those old lessons seemed to stick
pretty well, at least they have never
been entirely forgotten.
The library in the waiting room is
as yet quite rudimentary, the book
shelves having the appearance of an
aching void. They contain, however,
a few really choice volumes which are
a gift from an old Lake Survey
friend, Mr. Thomas Russell of De-
troit, as follows: La Place's "Me-
canique Celeste" in five volumes;
Gauss's "Theoria Motus"; Oppolzer's
"Bahnbe.stimmung," two volumes;
Shutter Arrangement on Dome
Bessel's "Fundamenta Astronomia";
Bessel's "Astronomische Untersuch-
ungen,"—which are standard classical
works. The first volume of the "Me-
canique Celeste" bears the puzzling
date 'AN VII" (year seven), and re-
fers to the French Revolutionary era
which began on Sept. 22, 1792, so that
with our reckoning the date would be
1799. The most of my astronomical
books are for convenience of refer-
ence now at my residence, about three
blocks away from the observatory.
Each evening for about one full
week in every month is given to the
public. The time selected is when the
moon is at its best for telescopic ob-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
servation. Our nearest celestial
neighbor with its rugged surface
seems to be the most attractive ob-
ject for the average visitor. Planets
(when in position), double stars, star
clusters, and the like, are also shown.
Usually an illustrated talk, given in
the waiting room with the aid of
lantern slides, precedes the use of the
telescope and helps to a better under-
standing of what is observed. The in-
terest of the visitors is shown by the
questions asked and by various ex-
pressions of surprise or delight. About
two hours are thus pleasantly oc-
cupied of an evening. Xo charge is
made. Previous reservations are made
by phone so as not to exceed the ca-
pacity of the waiting room which is
about seventeen. The attendance so
far has averaged something over
ninety visitors per month. Each per-
son I believe is more or less profited
by the visit, as well as entertained.


BY OLD STAFF MEN
1887-1888
We regret very much not to be able
to present a write-up by either our
first Managing Editor, or our first
Business Manager.
1888-1889
My recollection of my experience
with this publication is extremely
hazy, but believe that I was Manag-
ing Editor from the Fall of 1888 to
the Spring of 1889. The only thing
that I recall now is that while we had
considerable difficulty in securing in-
teresting papers for our publication,
we had much greater difficulty in get-
ting sufficient advertising matter to
furnish the capital required. The
Technic was in its infancy at that
time and we were able to get out but
one issue during the college year,
which required our utmost efforts at
that time. The management has in
later years been able to do much bet-
ter than this, and one who has been
through the mill knows that the pres-
ent editors must devote a great deal
of time to this work.
I regret that lack of time prevents
my giving you an extended history of
work at that time, but feel sure that
you will appreciate the fact that it is
extremely difficult to call to mind, on
short notice, happenings 29 years ago.
I can only add that I hope the good
work will be kept up and The Tech-
nic will continue to grow in the
future as it has in the past.
Richard Khuen, Jr., '89.
1890
My recollections of details of the
work back in 1890 are a bit hazy.
What stands out is the writing of nu-
merous letters to obtain material for
publication, and the up-to-date editors
of the present day do not seem to be
able to overcome this habit. Though
The Technic has passed through
many vicissitudes it has grown with
the University, and is now a most
creditable college publication, and the
issue of four numbers a year we
should have thought quite impractic-
able when the work was done by a
smaller board.
The aim, of course, is to mark an
advance each year in its usefulness.
The worth of The Technic is mainly
to the undergraduate, and, with the
right veiwpoint, the judgment of The
Technic staff should be the best
guide in the selection of articles. Don't
use a lot of dry stuff you don't under-
stand, and don't want to read, simply
because you think it may appeal to
the alumnus and give a high brow ap-
pearance to the publication. I think
some of the most valuable issues of
the early Technic were those con-
taining articles by the professors, in
which they presented some branch of
a subject usually covered in a lecture
course; in the printed form it was
more fully and clearly stated and
more easily studied.
The mere description of engineer-
ing works and manufacturing plants
is more properly for the professional
newspapers, the weekly technical jour-
nal, unless some new application is


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
involved. Articles treating general
methods and principles, not already
fully covered in text books, are for the
college publication. Such articles as
"Dynamics of the Reciprocating En-
gine," "Deflection of Beams," "Dis-
integration of Cement Floors and
Sidewalks," that have appeared in
The Technic, illustrate this class.
The "Alumni Notes" is a good fea-
ture, although of interest mainly to
the alumni, but this is enough of a
which will be to many of us the most
interesting feature of this number, as
it has always been an inspiring one.
L. C. Sabin, '90.
1891
Those of us who worked on the
1891 Technic worked just as hard
and in about the same way as the
present staff is apparently doing. We
had no faculty supervision and the
staff, or board as it was then called.
Tin-: Technic Used to Have Its Offices in the Oi.n F.nginf.uk'ng Building
concession to the old fellows. They
have other sources for technical ar-
ticles—frequently more than they can
cover—and in The Technic they are
interested in seeing what the college
is doing—its professors and students.
The articles contributed by profes-
sors are likely to be of the greatest
value to the undergraduate, and per-
haps to the older men too. In any
case, the alumnus who is interested
in the University will read with the
greatest zest such matter as is cov-
ered on pages 169 to 186 of the last
issue, not forgetting the important
article at the bottom of page 168,
had to pay personally any deficit, if
there was one. So you may be sure
we tried hard to get out a good num-
ber and to obtain advertising enough
to pay for it. In my own experience
we were successful. Some other is-
sues of the publication were not.
Dwight B. Cheever, '91.
1891
A note from the office of R. P.
Lamont, Managing Editor in 1891,
and now President of the American
Steel Foundries, stated that he was
out of town and thus unable to send
us his write-up.


205
1894
Looking back over twenty-three
years I now realize that the The
Technic must have been well man-
aged in its seventh year to have at-
tained to its present growth and
prosperity. I can recall that it re-
quired much restraint to omit from
the frontispiece the photograph of
the Board of Editors all of whom
were some day to become prominent
engineers, and to substitute therefore
the photographs of plain professors,
four in number, Campbell, Patterson,
Ziwet and Wagner.
We did not attempt editorials in
those days, but devoted our time
instead to securing ante-mortem
euloguies of the aforesaid professors,
technical articles, and advertising con-
tracts.
There was great glee in headquar-
ters when Professor Carpenter of
Cornell sent in material for twenty-
two printed pages on engine testing,
thus assuring the volumetric success
of our journal, and that too without
a single half-tone illustration. For in
those days half-tones would almost
pass for legal tender.
Mr. F. C. Noble, our Business Man-
ager, was the man that traded adver-
tising space for trade and thus con-
verted the trade into the wherewithal
to meet printer's bills. He is now a
highly successful consulting engineer
in New York City.
I am writing this on my way to
California to testify as expert in
litigation connected with the specialty
of concrete bridge design and super-
vision that I have followed for the
past seventeen years.
Editorially you have made of The
Technic a creditable engineering
publication, but believe me, we of its
-earlier years were some managers.
Daniee B. Luten, '94.
1895
The 1895 Technic was a "corker,"
at least that was what the Technic
Board thought. Formally the Board
was listed as follows:
Alex. M. Haubrich, Managing Edi-
tor.
Herman Burr Leonard, Business
Manager.
Thomas Durand McColl, Homer
Wilson Wyckoff, Charles Henry
Spencer.
As a matter of fact, all the mem-
bers worked together so harmoniously
and earnestly that the credit for the
success of the '95 Technic was due
to each.
Looking back, the writer's most
vivid recollections are of the many
strenuous meetings in Leonard's rooms
to find ways and means to raise money
to finance the proposition. The at-
tacks on the faithful advertisers in
engineering publications were many
and varied but they finally "came
through." In the mean time, we sus-
tained many a shock when material
came in C. O. D. with nothing in the
treasury and not much more in the
"jeans" of the Committee. But we
finally "put it over" and left a clean
record.
Our great "hit" was a write-up on
the Observatory. Professor Hall pre-
pared the article. Interesting photos
were reproduced of the Observatory.
Biographs and excellent photograv-
ures of the many world renowned
astronomers that were associated with
the University of Michigan were also
included.
Another direct hit was the article by
Frank P. Davis, '76, on "The Nic-
aragua Canal Project," fully illus-
trated with maps and cuts.
Several other valuable papers were
included, and still others had to be


TUB MICHIGAN TECHNIC
omitted, due to the limited size of the
publication.
Another feature of the 95 Tech-
nic was that it came out on time and
with a new cover. The cover was
designed by Homer Wyckoff. Homer
was a thorough student, a born artist,
an efficient engineer and a gentleman.
He has since crossed the "Great Di-
vide."
Alex M. Haubrich, '95.
1898
At present I do not recall much
about the details of publishing The
Technic in 1898, except that of try-
ing to solicit sufficient advertising
funds to pay for publication.
The country had not recovered
from the severe financial stress of the
few preceeding years, and business
was not keen placing advertising in a
publication of small issue. Ours was
an annual of about one thousand
copies. The deficit amounted to about
thirty dollars at the end of the year
and was paid by the members of the
Hoard. The amount though small
seemed very large, I presume, owing
to the fact that we were just com-
pleting our college course, with our
future positions not yet assured.
I recall especially the keen interest
and kindly advice and help given us
by our much beloved Professor J. B.
Davis.
It has been very gratifying to me,
on recent visits to Ann Arbor, to
have the opportunity of going into the
well appointed office of The Tech-
nic and noting the business-like way
in which the publication is now con-
ducted.
Sutton Van Pelt, '98.
Business Manager.
1902
It has been nearly fifteen years
since our 1902 Technic was issued,
and I was Managing Editor. Just
previous to 1902, The Technic had
found the going not altogether
smooth. The Faculty had therefore
decided to give us some financial as-
sistance, which, supplemented with
our advertising which was supported
almost entirely by the alumni, enabled
us to get out our issue and pay all of
our bills.
Fifteen years is a long time and the
writer has forgotten most of the facts
regarding our 1902 Technic that
would be of special interest. One of
the special reasons for my failing
memory in this regard, is due to the
fact that all of the work for both de-
partments was done by Mr. Robert
Hall Merrill, one of my distinguished
classmates who is now with the New
York Barge Canal. Merrill was one
of these highly intellectual parties,
and college work, as he expressed it,
was a mere bagatelle, so that it took
practically none of his time, and the
last half of the year he devoted con-
siderable time and energy to The
Technic.
About all I can remember is sitting
up nights reading proof; some of
which I understood and a greater por-
tion of which was away over my head.
I have read The Technic continu-
ously since graduation, and take a
great deal of pleasure in noting the
continuous improvement. We had
about 84 members in our graduating
class and at that time the Engineer-
ing College was a part of the Literary
Arts Department. We had no sep-
arate class organizations, and there
were no engineering societies, and all
our student activities were in connec-
tion with the larger Literary Depart-
ment. C. W. Brooks, '02.

1904-05
In recalling my part as Managing
Editor of The Michigan Technic
in 1904-05, two things of especial note
occur to me. The first was the change
from the old annual to a semi-annual
publication, which was ultimately ac-
complished for little more than the
cost of the one issue in preceding
years, thanks to a change of publish-
ers. That was the first year the Ann
Arbor Press, under the energetic
management of Otto Hans, handled
The Technic, and I recall our joint
efforts and pleasant associations with
considerable satisfaction. The other
noteworthy recollection was the fact
that for the first time in the history of
The Technic, so far as then current
testimony proved, we closed the year
with a balance in the treasury, not-
withstanding the fact that we had
fallen heir to the usual deficit from
the year before and had fittingly cele-
brated the success of the new semi-
annual with a banquet to our loyal and
encouraging Advisory Board. This
record is a fitting tribute to our Busi-
ness Manager, Lyle Whitsit, whose
efforts coupled with the generous co-
operation of the publishers made for
our success.
In those days the Technic Board
was made up of five seniors and one
junior, the Chairman or Managing
Editor being he who had served on
the preceding Board as junior. I was
unfortunate in not having had the val-
uable experience of the junior year,
for as I recall, I was elected Chair-
man to fill a break in the succession.
Notwithstanding that, however, I
thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated
that year on the Technic Board, and
recall with pleasure the splendid cali-
ber of the men who were my as-
sociates, and the friendships cemented
at that time. There were besides
Whitsit, mentioned above, Ral Parker,
Walt Smith, Delmar Teed, seniors,
and Ben Braun, junior. Braun
crowned a strenuous apprenticeship
with noteworthy success as Chairman
in the succeeding year.
In commenting on Technic affairs,
1 cannot close without adding a word
of appreciation for the splendid publi-
cation now issued as The Michigan
Technic and the remarkable im-
provements of the last few years. All
those who have been connected with
this progress deserve great credit, and
I know I make no mistake in congrat-
ulating you and your associates for
the high standards maintained. Thk
Michigan Technic is the most wel-
come publication that comes to my
desk.
Ralph R. Tinkham, '05.
1006
It is getting to be quite a long call
back to the days of our struggles with
The Technic in 1906, but there are
two things which stand out prom-
inently in my memory. One was
reading proof and the other finances.
Seemed as if there was always some
proof to read, reams of it, and maybe
right at a time when you could think
of a lot of other things to do of a
lighter and more agreeable nature.
However, in this matter I happened
to be quite fortunate as there were
four other individuals in our house
who seemed to have a good deal of
waste time on their hands. Those
were Smith, Watson, Perkins, and
Kempton, '06 to '09, respectively;
evidently they had never read proof
before and were greatly interested in
my efforts. Right there I saw a splen-
did opportunity. Having read Tom
Sawyer at an earlier day and remem-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
bering the episode of painting the
fence, I decided to try out Tom's
scheme on the above worthy material.
Dilating on the importance of the
work and showing reluctance to sub-
let any of it, they were immediately
very eager to take it off my hands,
and so they did most all of it, and did
a splendid job of it, as The Technic
of that year will prove.
Then there was the matter of fi-
nances which was no little worry. As
The Technic was now a semi-annual
publication, funds must be procured.
Here again we were singularly for-
tunate as we had a genial and withal
exceedingly industrious Business
Manager, Justin Kingdon. The money
requirements began to loom up bulky
and thereupon we had a serious busi-
ness session.
Now any one knows who knows
anything, knows that "Business Man-
ager" means one who gets the busi-
ness. After much talk and agreement
it was finally made clear to Kingdon
that this was his entire function and
that he must get in all the money. His
duty being plain, he went at it with a
rush, and with great success.
We both left Ann Arbor immedi-
ately after graduation and before all
bills were paid, but were happy in
knowing that enough ads had been
sold to pay all expenses of publishing
for that year.
I cannot say there was anything
particular in our issues of The Tech-
nic that was new or different from
those published before. There was
one thing though we felt rather proud
of, and that was the design for the
front cover. We made a live drawing
of the archway under the Engineering
building and this cut was used for sev-
eral years after in all issues.
In closing I may say despite the
great amount of work required to get
out an issue in those days when no
credit was allowed for the effort, I
have only a pleasant memory of the
hours spent on The Technic.
B. N. Braun.
1906
Mr. Braun was the only veteran on
our Board and he did much of the
work. Our predecessors left us some
money in the treasury and kindly gave
their counsel whenever we felt the
need of it. To the rest of the mem-
bers of the '06 Board is due most of
the credit for the work we tried to
perform. I was pretty green at any-
thing of the kind and got a lot of
good out of it. It was my job to
rustle the ads and pay the bills. An
occasional trip to Detroit came with it
too (never mind what I did there).
Difficulty was experienced in getting
new advertisers. The scheme of ex-
changing space for the products of a
manufacturer was found to be a good
way to help the treasury. Anything
that might be secured in this way was
sold at a reduced rate to the students
so there was no difficulty in disposing
of it. Of course we took only what
the students could use. We found
that team work on the Staff is indis-
pensible and it is gratifying to note
our Technic bears evidence of this
to a considerable degree. I have felt
the more responsible positions on the
Staff should be given recognition in
some way by the Engineering College
and hope this may be brought about if
it has not already been done.
I enjoy The Michigan Technic.
Frequently it contains an article in
which I am especially interested and
it seems to me this is doing well con-
sidering the many activities to be
seved. I know the information is
right-hot-off-the-bat too. Congratula-


209
tions to those of you who have helped
make The Technic such a credit to
our Engineering College. I am wish-
ing you all possible success.
Justin T. Kingdon.
1907
I wish I could write you something
that would lie worthy of a place in the
Thirtieth Anniversary Issue of The
Technic, but in plumbing the well of
memory for what may have happened
ten years ago nothing much seems to
come to the surface.
However, there is one thing for
which we think the old Twentieth
Yolumn is to be noted for and which,
it seems, was the forerunner of a new
development in design. And that is
the article by Prof. S. J. Zowski on
the Design of Water Turbines. We
had considerable difficulty in inducing
Prof. Zowski to write the article for
The Technic. That was his first
year in teaching at Michigan, he had
been in this country only about two
years and pleaded considerable dif-
ficulty with the English language. We
co-operated with him to the best of
our abilities—which weren't much—
and as a rough draft the article was
a big success. Soon after graduation
I heard much praise for this new
treatment of the subject from engi-
neers of long experience.
D. H. McAllister, '08.
1908-1909
S. B. Wiggins, '09, Managing Edi-
tor, now Captain in the Heavy Artil-
lery, O. R.C.
I am sure that The Technic of to-
day more nearly fulfills its proper
function in connection with our En-
gineering School and I trust also that
it enjoys more prosperous times than
it did during the year that I contrib-
uted my poor efforts to its manage-
ment.
In my day The Technic was a
semi-annual publication. It did not
appear often enough to keep up in-
terest and was almost always strug-
gling along under quite a serious debt.
Instead of being run by a large num-
ber of students who could contribute
a diversity of opinion and share in the
issuing of a creditable publication, it
was really a private enterprise by the
Managing Editor and his Business
Manager.
A year or so after I graduated, I
was glad indeed to see the faculty
take an active interest in the welfare
of The Technic, and to see more en-
thusiasm among the members of the
Engineering Society about sharing in
the work.
To my notion The Technic is pre-
eminently a journal for the students,
and should feature the things that
will interest the student body. The
work of preparing the magazine is a
valuable experience, and a place on its
editorial staff should be coveted.
Here's to The Technic on its 30th
birthday. May its influence keep
steadily growing.
1908-1909
In 1908-09 The Technic had not
yet blossomed into a quarterly period-
ical, but modestly made its appear-
ance twice each year about two months
behind its schedule. The Business
Manager's job was to hustle for
enough advertising to enable him to
escape the ignominy of passing on a
larger debt than he had received. But
we were ambitious—my Managing
Editor and I—and we not only
planned to leave a smaller debt as a
tribute to our prowess, but even


THE M1CHIGAX TECHXIC
dreamed a rosy dream of paying it
altogether. We were doomed to dis-
appointment in that, but we did have
the satisfaction of coming out ap-
preciably ahead of where we started.
To do it we had to vigorously solicit
advertising of every description and
when the cash possibilities were ex-
hausted we accepted in payment or-
ders for merchandise, subscriptions to
technical periodicals, etc.. afterward
selling these to the highest cash bidder
among members of the Engineering
Society. In connection with this
work, I did my first and last "Ad"
writing—upon request of a prominent
Detroit firm. To my surprise the
copy was accepted without question
and was not only run that year, but
the following year as well.
Another interesting event which I
call to mind was our purchase of a
typewriter—it being bought second-
hand from a student after due and
solemn consideration. Xot having an
editorial room at our disposal it was
necessary to keep it at our rooms. The
Managing Editor very generously of-
fered the Business Manager the priv-
ilege of retaining possession of it dur-
ing the first semester, though I after-
ward suspected him of ulterior mo-
tives since both of us lived east of
the campus and it fell to my lot to
convey that typewriter from Division
Street to Elm Street, and it doubled in
weight with every block.
G. C. Blalock.
1910-1911
During the year 1910 and 1911,
The Michigan Technic for the first
time was presented to the public in
more than two issues. In 1909 to 1910
the Engineering Society decided to
publish The Technic quarterly. Dif-
ficulties were encountered and onlv
one issue appeared, and the 1910 to
1911 officers in charge endeavored to
successfully publish four issues.
Funds were needed to carry on the
work, but the various subscribers who
had contracted for advertising space
the previous year, refused to settle
their accounts because their contracts
called for four issues. This fact made
it obligatory on our part to print three
issues to complete all outstanding con-
tracts. New advertisers were secured
on a three-issue basis and the money
thus obtained enabled us to present
The Technic to the public on three
separate occasions during the year.
The issues were a success both
technically and financially, due per-
sonally to the untiring efforts on the
part of the Managing Editor, Mr.
Charles H. Benedict. Besides com-
pleting his own duties of collecting
valuable material, Mr. Benedict ac-
tively assisted in making collections
from the advertisers, with the result
that the financial report presented to
the Society at the end of the year
showed for the first time that The
Technic not only paid for itself, but
was able to reduce the standing debt
a considerable amount.
It has always been a proud satis-
faction to me to watch the success of
The Technic, and the time and labor
J spent in fulfilling my duties was
small indeed to the benefits derived.
A. J. DuFFEY, '12.
1911-1912
The year of 1911-12 was perhaps
not the most stormy of the thirty
years of Technic history, but it con-
tained enough worry to silver a few
hairs belonging to the managing heads.
What it was that brought on the dif-
ficulty is hard to state. Through the
cumulative misfortune of several of


211
the preceding boards, the nuances of
The Technic had become quite a
large negative quantity. At the be-
ginning it looked like a gigantic under-
taking and many of us entertained
grave fears of the result, but the
storm began to recede somewhat to-
ward the end of the year.
It was in a large measure due to
our new surroundings that the Board
was urged to do its best that year.
As a result the efforts of our respected
chief, Dean Cooley, The Technic be-
came possessed of separate quarters.
A room in the Old Engineering Build-
ing which was the private office of
Secretary Bird in our freshman days,
was ceded to us together with the use
of the vault off the old main office ad-
joining. This was not all, for shortly
afterward the room was fitted out with
a new set of office furniture that
caused the three top buttons of our
vests to pop off with swelling pride at
sight of it and aroused varying ex-
pressions of jealousy from the differ-
ent members of the English Depart-
ment who were quartered in the same
building. With this handicap in our
favor, the old typewriter two-fingered
many an urge to prospective contrib-
utor, advertiser, and subscriber, with a
generally pleasing result.
The literary standard of the four
issues of that year was of course bet-
ter from an engineering point of view
than that of any previous ones—we
admit all of that. Along toward the
end of the year, however, there were
those who strongly favored a change
in style to that of a mere college pa-
per and this idea was carried out for
a time in the succeeding issues. This
was well in that it brought about the
fusion of the two standards into the
present system of keeping the old
technical articles together with the
publication of university and alumni
notes as well as the "Gargoyle" sup-
plement. The present thirty pages of
advertising speak for themselves. The
improvement in the publication as a
whole has been steady.
In fact, we of the years gone by
heartily congratulate the men now in
the harness and express the hope that
in thirty years hence The Technic
will have advanced as far above their
dreams of the future as the present
has outdone the past.
Harry H. SteinhausEr,
Managing Editor, 1911-1912.
1913
We are in receipt of a letter from
E. S. Bigelow, who is the brother of
C. W. Bigelow, Business Manager,
1913, saying that C. W. is now on
duty in foreign waters, being an En-
sign in the navy.
1914
When Wm. C. ("Pete") Thomp-
son, Business Manager, and I were
put in charge of The Michigan
Technic, it was then a monthly pub-
lication with offices in the old Engi-
neering Building. We felt that publi-
cation each month was a little too
often, and took a concensus of opin-
ion from the various faculty mem-
bers as to the frequency of issue.
Quarterly issues were decided on, as
the standard for the future.
The next step was to move our of-
fices to the rooms of the Engineering
Society, in the new Engineering
Building, where we would be in closer
touch with the student body and Fac-
ulty, and where they could see what
we were doing. More interest was
aroused in this way, and soon we had
a loyal and earnest number of assist-
ants on the staff.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
By perserverance and earnest work,
"Pete" soon had a goodly number of
advertisements for each issue, and we
then felt that our path would not be
so hard. By the time the last issue
was printed, The Michigan Tech-
nic was on a paying basis, and a good
start was made on the debt that had
been hanging over for so long.
We worked hard to make The
Technic a journal of the Engineer-
ing Department, and not merely a
medium for printing a bunch of dry
articles. With the interest aroused by
our new start, and our new policy, it
was not hard to get articles from the
faculty, news from the classes and de-
partments, all of which helped to put
The Technic on its present basis.
We were helped greatly in our work
by the Faculty Committee which was
appointed by the Dean to aid us in
editing and publishing The Technic,
and a great deal of credit is due them
for the interest shown, and the efforts
exerted to make The Technic a suc-
cess.
It has always seemed to me that
The Michigan Technic has a place
in the Engineering College, that can-
not be filled by any other publication,
and for that reason should receive the
hearty support to which it is entitled.
O. W. Hall, '15.
1913 TO 1916
In the fall of 1913, during the time
that Ollie Hall and Pete Thompson
were, respectively. Managing Editor
and Business Manager of The Tech-
nic, begins the first of my experience
with that paper.
At that time there wasn't one stu-
dent out of a hundred, in the Engi-
neering Department, out side the
senior class, who knew that there was
an Engineering magazine, let alone
the name of it; and the name was all
that that few knew.
Ollie and Pete started in, early in
the fall (on the ground before the
opening of College), to put The
Technic where it belonged as the
leading Engineering College maga-
zine. They did not expect to do this
in a single year, but they did hope to
give it such a start along that line that
it would never get back where they
found it. And, from all indications,
the start was a good one.
It was an up-hill task at that time
to put out an issue. We were deeply
in debt. We had just passed through
an unsuccessful year. We had to have
advertising to make a go of it. Here
is where the difficulty started. The
advertisers who knew The Technic
were afraid of it, those who did not
know it, by far the majority luckily,
could see no advantage to using it.
We had a very small circulation which
was unfavorable in the eyes of the
advertiser. We plugged along during
that semester with no points in our
favor but our promises. We did have
the consolation of knowing that a lot
more business men knew there was a
Technic. Our advertising in that is-
sue was mostly local, excepting that
on contracts holding over from the
previous year, though we did have a
little from firms in Detroit and near
by cities. We finally got material
enough together to warrant the pub-
lication. The issue came off the press
in good order, and it looked fine. Pete
and Ollie had made this issue almost
unassisted and, on comparing it with
the previous one, showed that they
had worked well. We had a very
small staff, I can remember that Pete
and I spent all day Saturday and late
that night wrapping and addressing.
We sent out about a thousand copies,


213
a very few of which were paid for,
and took a chance on getting the
alumni to respond with a year's sub-
scription. Quite an encouraging num-
ber did. We managed to pay all our
bills and the interest on our notes, but
not to get anything ahead. Our next
issue was much more encouraging to
the ones working on the business end
of it, for we had some cash on hand
for the summer.
We came back in the fall of 1914
determined not to let the good work
end. Ollie Hall, burdened with other
duties, turned the management over
to Don Smith. Don not only took
over the management, but seemed to
take over, also, all of Ollie Hall's pep
and add it to a great abundance of his
own. It didn't take long to see that
he was going to be able to manage it
and manage it well. His eyes were al-
ways open to places for improvement,
and so he found them. One of his
first moves was to shift the office from
the Old Engineering Building to the
large room in the New Engineering
Building occupied by the Engineering
Society. He organized the staff men
and encouraged them to offer sugges-
tions. He boosted the Engineering
Society, he advertised Thf, Technic.
We had a big bunch out that fall for
the Staff, and most of them stuck the
year out. A new cover design, do-
nated by C. C. Cohagen, and the addi-
tion of Alumni Notes, Transitory
Slants, and College and Department
Notes, appeared at this time. We
were also receiving outside help. Otto
J. Klots, '72, presented us with $200
and R. C. Gemmell, '84, added another
hundred to our treasury.
Don Smith left College and Mac
McNamee acted in the capacity of
Managing Editor. Mac carried out
the ideas of Ollie and Don and was
always on the lookout for ways and
means of improvement. We had ;&lt;
large staff of very good men, all of
them interested in The Technic for
The Tenhic's sake, and The Tech-
nic showed it. It was not a two-man
paper at this period, it was more than
they could handle. The staff was
working together like the parts of a
machine and each man knew his duty.
At the close of the fall 1915 semes-
ter I turned over the books to Toby
Taylor, and I believe that we had
more than enough cash on hand to pay
debts of the two first issues of that
vear.

J. E. EMSWILER, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF MECHANICAL
ENGINEERING. UNlVtRSlTY OF MICHIGAN
'T'HE economical performance of
,*- small steam prime movers is not
a matter that usually engages the at-
tention of the engineer. Such units
nearly always operate in an auxiliary
capacity in connection with large
main units, and there is a sufficient
demand for all their exhaust steam to
be used in feed water heaters, so that
it matters little to the economy of the
plant as a whole whether the auxiliar-
ies have a high or a low steam con-
sumption. However, in certain in-
stances, the economy of a small unit
is a factor of importance and with the
cost of coal where it is now, it is likely
to grow more important, as time
goes on.
An opportunity was presented to
the Mechanical Laboratory recently
to make some rather extensive econ-
omy tests of a 10 k.w. engine-gener-
ator set, not only to determine the
steam consumption at various loads,
but to observe the effect of some con-
structional changes in the engine, and
to note the influence of varying the
exhaust pressure and the steam pres-
sure.
THE UNIT
The unit consisted of a 6x6 vertical
steam engine direct connected to a 10
k.w. direct current generator. The
speed of the set was regulated by a
combination centrifugal-inertia fly-
wheel governor which controlled the
steam distribution to the cylinder
through a piston valve. This valve
had no packing rings or grooves. The
governing was affected by varying the
cutoff.
OUTLINE OE THE TESTS
The tests that were made may be
outlined as below:
a. Trials to determine the steam con-
sumption of the unit as received,
cylinder dimensions 6" x 6".
b. A test to ascertain the effect of cut-
ting off 3/64" from the steam lap
of the valve.
c. A test for which the bridges of the
valve chest liner which stood in
the cylinder ports, were cut out.
d. Trials to determine the steam con-
sumption of the unit with the
cylinder dimensions changed to
5" x 6".
e. Tests to show the influence of va-
rious exhaust pressures on econ-
omy.
f. Tests to show the influence of va-
rious initial pressures on econ-
omy, both at full load and at one-
quarter load.
THE TESTS IN DETAIL
The engine was intended to operate
at 125 pounds steam pressure, and 5
pounds back pressure above the
atmosphere. These pressures there-
fore prevailed during all the tests, ex-
cepting those in groups "e" and "f,"
where they were intentionally varied.
The curve A, Fig. 1, shows the
steam consumption of the engine as
received, with cylinder dimensions
6"x6". It will be noted that the
curve is a straight line until well
above full load, where it begins to
bend up, due to the excessive loss of
expansive energy in the steam at the
high release pressure. The curve B


215
is the water rate curve, and is derived
directly from curve A. The best
steam rate reached was 59.5 pounds
per k.w. per hour at 20% above rated
load.
As stated previously, steam was
furnished the engine at 125 pounds
pressure, scaling the indicator dia-
grams showed that the actual initial
pressure in the cylinder was not more
than 106 pounds, so that there was a
wire drawing effect of about 19
ting the steam through, the smaller
overlap of the valve no doubt allowed
more than enough leakage to counter-
act the gain.
The valve chest was provided with
a liner, which could be replaced after
excessive wear. At the place where
the ports were in the chest this liner
had a corresponding slot extending at
least half way around its circumfer-
ence. At the middle of the length of
the slot there was originally a bridge

pounds. As the unit ran at 460 r. p. m.
a considerable amount of wire draw-
ing was to be expected. With a
view to giving the steam a better
chance to get into the cylinder, the
steam edges of the valve were cut
back 3/64" and a test made at full
load only, to determine the steam con-
sumption. The steam consumption
after the change was 625 pounds per
hour versus 610 pounds per hour be-
fore, representing a loss of 2% due
to the change. While the larger open-
ing of port helped somewhat in get-
to strengthen the sleeve where it was
weakened by the slot. This bridge
was of course on the cylinder side of
the valve chest, and therefore stood
directly in the path of the steam in
getting into and out of the ports. As
the bridge was about an inch wide by
one-half inch long, it formed a con-
siderable obstruction, and it was
thought that its removal might prove
advantageous. With the bridges cut
out, another test was made at full load
only, with the result that the steam
consumption was cut from 625 pounds


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
per hour before the change to 590
pounds per hour after the change,
which represents a gain of 5.6%. The
initial pressure on the diagrams was
appreciably raised by the removal of
the bridges.
A bushing one-half inch thick was
then fitted into the 6" cylinder, reduc-

vance of the eccentric was slightly
changed also, to accommodate the new
conditions, and a series of runs made

were maintained constant; the back
pressure was varied at will and the
steam quantity noted. It is interest-
ing and instructive to observe that the
curve indicates that little or no gain
in water rate of this unit would re-
sult from operation at a vacuum
greater than 20 inches.

Curves C and D, Fig. 1, picture the
results of this scries. The amount of
steam used is uniformly higher for
the 5" x 6" cylinder than for the
6" x 6". Moreover, the bend in the
curve C occurs at a lower load than
it does in the curve A, which is to be
expected since the cut-off must occur
later at any given load, as the piston
area is less.
Curve E, Fig. 3, shows the influence
of back pressure on steam consump-
tion of a unit of this kind. For this
maintaining a constant back pressure
and full load, and varying the steam
pressure at will and noting the steam
quantity. Curve G was secured in the
same manner except that one-quarter
load was carried.
Curve F shows that it is more
economical to operate this engine at
no pounds steam pressure, than at
125 pounds, when carrying full load.
Curve G shows that it is most eco-
nomical to operate at some pressure
lower than 90 pounds steam pressure,
when carrying a light load, such as

one-quarter in this case. Both these
curves illustrate well the effect of
leakages, past piston and valves in a
steam engine. Leakage is somewhat
proportional to the initial pressure
which is the motive effect to push the
steam through places where it should
not go. In the case of a light load,
when the engine operates under full
steam pressure as it does with an
automatic cut-off governor, the leak-
age steam is large in amount as com-
for this engine to produce its best
economy. For small engines, such as
this, where leakage is a big factor, the
throttling governor is unquestionably
more economical than the automatic
cut-off governor, although the latter
as usually constructed is more sensi-
tive in speed regulation.
Curve F shows that even at full
load, better economical results will
follow at a moderate pressure than
with 125 pounds.

pared with the total amount of steam
used in carrying the load, and the
economy is consequently poor. If the
initial steam pressure is reduced at
light loads, some sacrifice is made of
potential energy in the steam; but at
the same time, the loss of steam by
leakage is reduced so materially that
it overbalances the loss of energy in
the steam. The pressure at which
curve G would reach a minimum
would represent the best condition for
the one-quarter load.

AND THE BEGINNINGS OF ARCHITECTURAL AND ENG-
INEERING PRACTICE IN AMERICA
FISKE KIMBALL. ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF ARCHITECTURE,
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
THE beginning of architectural and
engineering practice in America
has an interest which greatly exceeds
the effort so far made to satisfy it.
Any part of the story of the struggle
to master the new continent and to
harness its vast natural resources is
absorbing, but no chapters of it are
more romantic than the earliest ones,
which remain largely unwritten. In
the period which they cover, embrac-
ing the beginning of our career as an
independent nation, not only the nat-
ural forces surrounding a pioneer
community, but also the human ele-
ments of ignorance and prejudice had
to be overcome, almost single-handed.
Before the Revolution neither archi-
tecture nor engineering existed in
America as a profession. The simple
Colonial buildings, which we esteem
for many fine qualities, were designed,
with few or no exceptions, either by
the craftsmen themselves or by intel-
ligent amateur students of architec-
ture. Many of these latter made but
a single adventure in the field, and
limited themselves wholly to the initial
sketch, without details or practical su-
pervision. A single case only is known
in the Colonial period where a design-
er was paid for plans of a building to
be erected by others—Christ Church
in Cambridge, designed by Peter Har-
rison, 1761—and Harrison himself
was in general a gentleman amateur.
Engineering works worthy of the
name then scarcely existed here. The
roads were notorious; rivers were
crossed mostly by fords or ferries;
canals were still only in the realm of
fancy; water supply and drainage
were rudimentary. A few forts and
batteries erected by British officers
alone confronted to any high standard
of construction. The only men who
devoted themselves to pursuits related
to engineering were the land survey-
ors, a notable example being George
Washington himself.
With the Revolutionary war came
a temporary influx of military engi-
neers, both British and French, but
the hastily erected works on which
they were employed had mostly a
temporary character. Some of these
men remained after the war, and were
employed on the more permanent
fortifications undertaken by the Con-
federation and by the United States.
Prominent among these was Major
I.'Enfant, the versatile and erratic
genius who laid out the city of Wash-
ington and also turned his hand to
architecture on occasion. The free-
dom and opportunities of America at-
tracted other immigrants of artistic
and scientific endowments. In the
competition for designs for the fed-
eral buildings, in 1792, two such men
of professional training figured con-
spicuously: James Hoban, an Irish-
man, winning the prize for the Presi-
dent's House, and Stephen Hallet, a
Frenchman, being entrusted with the
execution of the Capitol. Hoban
henceforth devoted himself rather to
contracting and building than to de-


219
signing, however, and Hallet, after
losing his position in 1794, soon
dropped from sight. In 1792 William
Weston, an English engineer, was
brought over specially to direct the
works of the Schuylkill and Susque-
hanna Navigation Company, but after
one or two other similar commissions
had been completed he returned to
England in 1796. None of these men
succeeded in establishing a continu-
ous professional practice.
Benjamin Henry Latrobk
The first established professional
here, either in architecture or in en-
gineering, was Benjamin Henry Eat-
robe, who was in unique degree -
master of both. A descendant of
French Huguenot nobles of a family
/ong settled in England, himself highly
educated in Germany and widely trav-
elled on the Continent, he was trained
in architecture by the elder Cockerell,
father of the more famous architect
and archaeologist of that name, and in
engineering by Smeaton, the foremost
English practitioner, best known as de-
signer of the Eddy stone Lighthouse.
After distinguished beginnings in
England he emigrated to this country
in 1796, and was soon entrusted with
important commissions in both branch-
es. Established first in Richmond, lat-
er successively in Philadelphia, Wash-
ington, Baltimore, and New Orleans,
he secured for the first time a substan-
tial practice, embracing often several
important works at once, and having a
truly national scope. To carry on this
work he also first gathered an organ-
ized staff of assistants — pupils,
draughtsmen, copying clerk, and
clerks of the works for various scat-
tered operations—a staff still few in
numbers, to be sure, and still leaving
to him all the task of designing and
much laborious clerical work.
As architect he designed and super-
vised the Penitentiary at Richmond,
the Bank of Pennsylvania, the Ca-
thedral and the Exchange in Balti-
more, and St. John's Church in Wash-
ington, with a multitude of other pub-
lic buildings and many private resi-
dences. The second Bank of the
United States in Philadelphia was
erected from his design after his
death by one of his pupils. From 1803
to 1817, with an intermission during
the war of 1812, he held the office of
Surveyor of the Public Buildings of
the United States, created for him by
President Jefferson. In this capacity
he carried on the building of the Cap-
itol in Washington, designing its most
impressive interiors and largely influ-
encing the completion of the exterior.
By all these works he contributed
powerfully to establish the classical
tendency in American architecture
which is so notable even to this day,
being the first to employ Greek forms
on this side of the water. To him also
was due the initiation of the Gothic
revival here, in his designs for Sedge-


THE MICHIGAN TECH NIC
ley and for the Bank of Philadelphia,
as well as in an alternative scheme for
the Cathedral in Baltimore. Through
his buildings themselves, and through
his pupils Mills and Strickland, who
became the leading architects of the
next generation, he exercised the
greatest influence on the subsequent
development of architecture in this
country.
As engineer, Latrobe was occupied
principally with projects of hydraulic
engineering, which then held the cen-
ter of interest. He was consulted or
employed on the improvement of the
navigation of the James River and of
the Susquehanna, on the building of
the Dismal Swamp Canal, the first
Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, and
the Washington City Canal—all ante-
dating the day of large and well sup-
ported projects like the Erie Canal in
New York on which he also gave ad-
vice. By executing the Philadelphia
Waterworks, 1799, with their supply
pumped by steam to an elevated reser-
voir, he was the first to provide an
adequate water supply in an American
city. At the time of his death he was
on the point of completing a similar
system for New Orleans. From 1804
he was engineer of the Navy Depart-
ment, designing the great drydock
projected by President Jefferson, as
well as many other works in the yards
at Washington and elsewhere. Me-
chanical engineering also came per-
force into his province. For the Phil-
adelphia Waterworks he himself de-
signed and supervised the making of
the steam engines at a time when there
were not three others in the United
States, and when boilers and flywheels
alike had to be made of wood lor lack
of adequate foundry and manufactur-
ing facilities.
Latrobe anticipated modern busi-
ness methods in keeping copies of all
drawings submitted and of every let-
ter sent—the copies of letters being
produced by an instrument with two
pens, the polygraph, which he was one
of the first to employ. As a result of
this, and of the preservation of the
letter books, embracing nearly ten
thousand pages, we are able to re-
construct not only his own practice,
but the whole condition of engineer-
ing and architecture in America at the
beginning of the nineteenth century.
From his drawings which are pre-
served we reproduce two which are
characteristic of varied phases of his
versatile talent — the great covered
drydock for twelve frigates at the
Washington Navy Yard, with its bold
masonry vault and severe architect-
ural character; and the design for the
dome and center building of the nat-
ional Capitol, which long covered this
most notable of American buildings.
A letter of Latrobe to Thomas
More, a Maryland Quaker who under-
took to direct several engineering pro-
jects near Washington, throws much
light on the prejudices which an engi-
neer of foreign professional training
had then to encounter:
"As to the prevailing practice of
trusting the execution of public works
to mere travelling European engi-
neers," writes Latrobe, "I do not think
that it exists.
"In the Middlesex canal and the
Connecticut canal no European engi-
neer was consulted. Weston was an
engineer of reputation in England. He
was expressly sent for to lay out the
Susquehanna and Schuylkill; and
Delaware and Schuylkill Canal and
afterwards was employed in the West-
ern Navigation of the State of New
York. He was not therefore a mere
travelling engineer. The Potomac
Canal is the work of Colonel Gilpin

arid other Americans. The Richmond
Canal and that of the Appomatox are
also the works of men who had never
seen a canal before. * * * The Santee
Canal indeed is the work of a German,
Colonel Leuf, but he was forced to
adopt a line he disapproved by per-
sons who had local interests. Local
interests also ruined part of the works
of Weston, and both Leuf and Wes-
ton bear unmerited blame.
"Immediately after the Revolution
a number of French pretenders to
to knowledge as architects and en-
gineers were the fashion long enough
to do mischief, but that fashion is
over. At present I do not know a
more unfortunate and unhappy being
than a European who brings a capital
of knowledge and experience with
him, and hopes to employ it here * * *
I know by experience that my being
supposed by some to be an English-
man, by others a Frenchman, has been
many thousand dollars out of my
pocket. * * * But your observation
applies to me only as far as it is not
known that my (mother's) family for
more than ninety years have been set-
tled in Pennsylvania, and that al-
though I was educated in Europe, on
the Continent and in England, I am
already an American of the fourth
generation. * * * I am therefore a
travelling Engineer only by having
travelled home.
"I hope that I may be excused if I
profess to have so much vanity as to
believe that I possess some of those
mathematical and mechanical talents
for which every branch of my family
in Pennsylvania is distinguished—
that I have had as good a professional
education as money could purchase
and instruction under the best masters
could bestow—that it has been an ad-
ditional advantage to me to have seen
and studied most of the great works
executed on the Continent and in
England up to the year 1793, and even
to have corrected ancient errors by
modern experience myself, and that
my own experience in the practice of
my profession is of some value—and
yet I am better convinced than any
one of those who prefer to me any
uninstructed Man of Genius, how
much I have still to learn and how
much I shall leave unlearned when I
die. Now with this vanity and this.
humility it is impossible for me to be-
lieve that education, observation and
experience are unnecessary—and yet
this is the prevailing and efficient
opinion.
"I have mentioned a number of
canals. Those who have seen no
others admire them. They are exactly
such as were executed in Europe four
hundred years ago. such as experience
has condemned to destruction there
and such as she will condemn here.
We err on the side of paying dear for
our own experience, instead of buying
cheap that of Europe, and in jealousy
to avoid pretenders, we place a mark
of disgrace on all foreigners whether
pretenders or not * * * One part of
this error branches into an opinion
that Europeans are expensive merely
for the pleasure of being so, that it is
part of a disease incident to their
climate as economy is a virtue in-
digenous only in our soil. Economy:
the economy of Pendulum Mills, of
building up the Capitol by piecemeal,
and canals receiving all the wash of
the land, and wooden locks, and a
thousand other cheap things! I am
ashamed and angry at it, as an Ameri-
can."
Similar mortifications then attend-
ed architectural practice, as is well
shown by some reminiscences of Lat-


223
robe's son. In Latrobe's work on the
Capitol in Washington, he "was
brought in contact with ignorance in
all its forms. Here the architect, his
plans and estimates, underwent the
criticism of members of Congress,
nearly all of whom seemed to fancy
that their elections made them com-
petent to determine' the merits of
works of art * * * The work on the
public buildings requiring annual ap-
propriations, these were never made
father had submitted his plans, to find
his services declined, and afterwards
to see his design in some mutilated
form erected by a builder whose em-
ployment saved the architect's five per
cent commission."
With such difficulties to overcome it
took a man of resolute temperament
and powerful physique to succeed. It
was often fortunate for the future of
his professions in America that Lat-
robe was a muscular giant of six feet
Latrobe's Plan for Exterior of Capitol, Washixgtom, D. C.
in those days without debate, when the
architect and those in any way con-
nected with the building were dealt
with, often without mercy * * * In
the private undertakings in his charge
his position with regard to his feel-
ings was not always more enviable.
His competitors and critics here were
'builders,' carpenters, bricklayers, and
masons, in whose judgment as prac-
tical men the employer had often more
confidence than in the accomplished
and experienced architect * * * And
it was not a rare occurrence, after my
two, and that in spite of constant ma-
laria contracted in his work, and in
spite of a sensitive disposition, he had
the spirit to triumph over every ob-
stacle. By the time of his tragic
death, in harness, in 1820, he could
feel that his own struggles and sacri-
fices had not been in vain, that the
value of professional education and
experience were now widely recog-
nized, and that for the first time in
America a body of professional men,
largely his own pupils, stood ready to
carry on the work.


ADDRESS GIVEN TO THE GRADUATING CLASS OF ENG-
INEERS OF 1912
MORTIMER E. COOLEY
I WILL ask each of you to look
backward a few years, to the time
when you were considering what
career you would choose for your life
work. For some of you the question
was still unsettled when you arrived
to take up your work in college; for
others there was a definite purpose in
mind from the beginning; and for
still others the decision may not yet
have been finally reached.
Of one thing you may all be cer-
tain: that for the sincere man, the
man of earnest purpose, who puts into
his work the very best that he has,
there will be returned unto him a
fair measure of success. There is no
great difference between the return
which comes to the young man for his
effort and the return which comes
from an investment of money. In
either case the return is a function of
the investment. The young man's in-
vestment is his brains and energy.
Care must be taken that the invest-
ment is a proper one; and there are
many things which one can do to
make the investment safe. I may
mention a few things which the young
engineer would do well to heed. First
of all, the duty one owes himself to
be honest with himself and to the
man to whom he renders service. For
a few years the amount of money you
may receive is of the least conse-
quence, so that it suffices to feed and
clothe you in a simple way. But it is
of the utmost importance that during
this period you should erect on the
foundation which you have been
building during your college life the
framework of a substantial super-
structure. You will be alone in this
work—there will be no one to guide
you; the questions which arise you
must decide yourself. Some of them
will be puzzling, but remember that a
part of the real work of the engineer
is to solve puzzling questions.
Every problem, however difficult it
may seem, has a geneology; and once
it is traced back to the fundamental
principles learned in college its solu-
tion becomes apparent. But we should
not forget the advice of our dear old
Xestor, whom we all delight to honor,
Professor Joseph B. Davis, who used
to tell his students: "Work out your
problems on the correct theory; but if
your theory and your common sense
do not agree, trust your common
sense."
Common sense in man is like in-
stinct in animals. It tells the natural
thing to do. Nature is always a true
mother and we may safely trust her.
Conscience is also an important factor
in life's work—particularly at the be-
ginning. Fortunate indeed is the
young man in whose mind there is a
chamber into which he may retire to
commune with himself. When there
comes up before you, as there surely
will some day, the question, ought I
do that thing? then if you retire to
that chamber you will find the an-
swer; and it will always be the right
answer.
The engineer often finds himself in
doubt in the solution of technical


225
problems—whether a thing should be
settled one way or another. In gen-
eral no question is settled at all so
long as there is any doubt about it.
If you are putting into a problem the
best that is in you, you may know
when it has been properly settled, for
then there will be no doubt. Too
many engineers take chances. That is
gambling—and the young engineer
must never gamble on work he is paid
to do. His employer can take chances
on the work, but the young man never
—without the full knowledge and con-
sent of those to whom he is responsi-
ble.
One thing more than any other
helps towards success: \vell directed
energy—the doing of the thing that
has to be done promptly and willingly,
no matter how disagreeable it may be,
the young man building up his future
should never shy at the task assigned
him, nor should he try to sidestep it.
He should reach out, grab it in his
arms, hug it and squeeze it; and al-
most before he realizes it there will
be a response which will assure him
that he has been successful. Remem-
ber, my susceptible young friends, I
am talking about engineering things
and not sentimental things. I wish I
might advise you in them, too, but
there must be a limit to my task. Then,
too, I have learned that where the
heart is concerned there can be no
teacher—each insists on learning for
himself.
And now I come to my real text—
the engineer and the citizen. Up to
the present time you have, for the
most part, been inclined towards spe-
cialization. The things which have in-
terested you most have been technical,
those which you felt were making an
engineer of you. Some things you
have taken because you had to. There
are very many things which I wish
there had been time to take up with
you; not from text-books, not so
much from formal lectures, but from
the relationship which comes only
when the student and teacher have
been drawn close together and talk
springs from the heart. There are so
many things for you to see if you
could but look out through older and
more experienced eyes. That cannot
be, however. There is not time. The
world moves too swiftly and you must
all too soon take up your own part of
the burden.
But in parting let me say that your
best and most profitable work will be
not as an engineer but as a citizen. I
do not mean profit measured in
money, but profit measured in the
good you can do in your own com-
munity. The engineering you have
learned to do will bring you bread and
butter to eat, clothes to wear, and
homes to live in. That is necessary,
and one's first and natural duty. But
in addition there is the opportunity to
do great good in helping to solve the
problems before the world today
which the people are striving to solve,
but making slow progress, because of
ill-directed effort, ignorance and prej-
udice.
These problems are engineering
problems because the world today is
an engineering world. Our whole
civilization depends on engineering.
To comprehend this it is only neces-
sary to conceive the machinery used
in supplying our wants to cease opera-
tion but for a short time. What, for
example, would happen if the trains
bearing food should stop running; if
the spindles and looms of our cotton
mills should cease operation; if there
were no harbors to receive our ships,
and no ships to ferry across between
the nations? It is not too much to
say that without the work of the en-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
gineer there would be no civilization
of the kind we now know.
But the engineer cannot claim the
credit alone. There is capital on one
side of him and labor on the other,
without which his work would be in
vain, no one of the three could suc-
ceed without the other two. It is the
great triangle of forces, and stable
equilibrium can only exist when these
forces are balanced. Capital is look-
ing for a return in the form of inter-
est and dividends, and labor is look-
ing for a living and for something
more of the comforts of life which it
believes its due. It requires but the
slightest knowledge of mechanics to
realize that any unbalancing of these
forces requires their readjustment;
and if they are to be constantly un-
balanced the need of adjustment must
be constant.
The situation as regards the rela-
tions today of capital and labor is not
unlike that which exists in our orch-
ards and forests. Trees and shrubs
and plants are dying from the ravages
of insects and parasites. Were it not
for the political charlatan, and the
trouble maker, there would be far
more stable and satisfactory condi-
tions throughout this broad land of
ours and the entire world. The very
real condition which exists in the
world among men must be met. the
same as among trees, if we are to live
and thrive as a nation.
Thus the work of the engineer as
a citizen becomes apparent. There
must be someone to take up the great
work of adjusting the forces of cap-
ital and labor so that equilibrium will
be reestablished more securely. The
engineer is the natural one for this
work. His training has in some meas-
ure fitted him for it. His training in
the future will better fit him, for to
do this work most effectively there
must be other knowledge than mere
engineering. Philosophy, political
economy, history and the classics will
all become part of the engineer's cur-
riculum—not so much for the culture
imparted, but for the practical value
in affording a proper perspective.
In conclusion, I would urge upon
you, young gentlemen, the importance
of the work which you can do as citi-
zens because of your training as en-
gineers. Interest yourselves in the
problems of your community and take
an active part in their discussion and
solution. So conduct yourselves as to
win and keep the respect of your
neighbors. Be a physician to them
when community conditions become
unhealthy. "Do this not for compen-
sation in the form of money or po-
litical favor, but for the sake of the
community. Any sacrifice you may
be called upon to make in this work
will be returned to you in proportion
to the magnitude of the sacrifice.
Xo young man can afford to sit
back merely as a spectator. Every-
one must play his part in life's drama.
One may wisely be neither a pessimist
nor an optimist; both are dangerous.
I do not know which is the worst, so
far as the general good is concerned;
but the optimistic point of view with
the proper light upon it. will bring
comfort and show the right road to
happiness. To each of you will come
burdens, heavy burdens for some, but
with the strength of reason and faith
in the good that is within us all, bur-
dens will become . lightened, life's
journey made shorter and we may
know that in the end, as Kipling has
so beautifully said:
L'Envoi
When Earth's last picture is painted,
and the tubes are twisted and dried,
When the oldest colors have faded.
and the youngest critic has died,


227
We shall rest, and, faith, we shall need
it—lie down for an aeon ur two,
Till the Master of All Good Work-
men shall set us to work anew!
And those that were good shall be
happy: they shall sit in a golden
chair;
They shall splash at a ten-league can-
vas with brushes of comets' hair;
They shall find real saints to draw
from—Magdalene, Peter, and Paul;
They shall work for an age at a sit-
ting and never be tired at all!
And only the Master shall praise us,
and only the Master shall blame;
And no one shall work for money,
and no one shall work for fame;
But each for the joy of the working,
and each, in his separate star,

This book is primarily a laboratory
manual, but considerable space is used
to advantage in acquainting the stu-
dent with actual commercial problems
and methods. Clear descriptions of
machinery used in manufacturing
chemical products are found in the
first chapter of this book. Succeeding
chapters consist of laboratory experi-
ments covering inorganic and organic
preparations, dyes and dyeing, pig-
ments and lakes, driers, varnishes,
paints and stains, soaps, and chemical
problems in the manufacture of leath-
er and paper. The concluding chap-
ter is devoted to a collection of data
useful to the industrial chemist.
The book is well gotten up, and the
binding is substantial, and pleasing in
appearance. The paper is of superior
quality and the type very clear.

Michigan Technic," a change which
was heartily endorsed by all.
It was about this time, too, that the
character of the magazine was altered
considerably. It was decided that what
the readers wanted was a news mag-
azine as well as a "text-book." With
this in view departments were added
to the magazine whose sole purposes
were to satisfy this demand for news.
These departments have developed in-
to our present Engineering Notes,
Alumni Notes, and Architectural
Notes Departments. It was also de-
cided that whenever research results
of importance could be obtained that
these should appear in Tmc Technic,
together with data which might be of
value to the readers.
Thanks to the splendid organization
which the old "Technic Boards" have
founded for us, and to which succeed-
ing staffs have added, we now have
The Michigan Technic as you, our
readers, know it today.
AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO OUR CON-
TRIBUTORS
Copy for the March issue of The
Michigan Technic will be received
up to and including February 10, 1918.
By special arrangements, such copy
may be held out a few days longer.
Photographs submitted for publication
should, if possible, be on glossy or
semi-gloss paper. The prints should
be sharp and distinct in order to re-
produce well.
TO THE ALUMNI
Several have asked us if we want
detailed notes concerning themselves
and other alumni. Yes, we certainly
do. We depend almost solely on such
voluntary contributions to supply the
material for our Alumni Department.
So far you alumni have responded loy-
ally, and many of you have expressed
satisfaction at the completeness and
real news value of these columns to
you. Accept our hearty congratula-
tions for success of the Alumni Notes
of The Technic, because you are the
ones who have made it what it is.
Don't be bashful about writing con-
cerning yourself. You are the one
who is best fitted to supply such infor-
mation, and you owe it to your class-
mates to see that we get at least one
note a year from you.
Let the good work go on.
OUR DECEMBER ARTICLES
An article which we are sure will
be of interest to all our readers is pre-
sented under the title "Photo-Survey-
ing." This article is by R. S. Swinton
of the Engineering Mechanics Depart-
ment. Mr. Swinton has made a spe-
cial study of this subject for a long
time.
We are also pleased to have an arti-
cle from the Architectural Depart-
ment. The article referred to is en-
titled, "Benjamin Henry Latrobe" and
is of peculiar interest to both engi-
neers and architects. S. Fiske Kim-
ball, Assistant Professor of Architec-
ture, is the author.
J. II. Darling, '73, nas sent us an
interesting account of his own private
observatory which is located at Du-
luth. Professor J. E. Emswiler pre-
sents the results obtained in some re-
search in his article on "Tests of a
Small Engine-Generator Set."
"The History of The Michigan
Technic by Old Staff Men" was com-
piled from letters which these men
sent in, and as far as possible, exact
copies were made of the main parts of
these letters. Besides containing items
of historical interest, the write-ups al-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
so have in them considerable com-
ment on the present Technic. We
wish to take this opportunity to thank
these men for their hearty cooperation
which has made this article possible,
and also to express our sincere regret
that several notes of considerable
merit arrived too late for publication.
Word has been received that II. S.
Taylor, Ex.-'18, Ex-Managing Editor
of The Technic, has successfully-
passed the entrance examinations to
the Aviation Section of the Signal
Corps. He is now awaiting his notifi-
cation from Washington to report for
training.

NOW THAT the excitement of the foot-
ball season is over we are beginning
to turn our attention once more to the
dusty books waylaid on the shelf that we
neatly piled up in order to impress the girl
from home how tidy we are, when she was
here to visit us on Nov. 10. Football ques-
tions, especially the foolish kind that were
asked by our fair visitors, no longer annoy
us but rather make us laugh. We are now
confronted with the problem of trying to
make a correct guess at the answer to a
question which the professor asks, when
deep down in our hearts we know we really
ought to say "not prepared." With the
coming of winter and the clear, frosty
days, when there is tang in the air that
thrills, we once more turn to Nature to
help out in our work and she never fails.
Fraternity and Honorary society initia-
tions are now over, military training has
taken its accredited place among the other
courses, research work in the laboratories
is in full swing, even "fussing" is well or-
ganized and the college year rolls merrily
on.
ENGINEERS AMONG THE FOOTBALL
MEN
Of the thirty-two men on the Varsity
1917-1918 football squad, eleven or over
thirty-three percent are engineers. This
upsets the pet idea that engineers do not
take part in campus activities and athletics.
One man has shown forth as the bright-
est light on a team composed chiefly of
stars. That man is Weston, small, daring,
pugnacious, speedy Weston, the quarter-
back who entered the limelight unan-
nounced a few weeks ago when Cliff Sparks
was disabled and gloom had settled men-
acingly over the Wolverine camp. For two
years he has labored on the scrubs and in
the Kalamazoo game totalled over three
hundred yards. Weston has proved that he
is a man to be continuously feared by op-
posing elevens and that he is able to arise
to emergencies great or small with the
skill and precision and accurate daring of a
seasoned veteran.
Last year Sparks was the mainstay of the
team and the opposing teams had built their
defense in an endeavor to stop the speedy
quarter but Cliff by his dodging and speed
many a time made a first down. Judging
from his remarkable playing last year many
sport critics considered him in line for a
position on the All-American this year. He
comes from the prison city, played football
on the high school team for four years and
gained the reputation of being the best
football player that Jackson has turned
out. Cliff has won his freshman numerals
and one "M" and has prospects of making
two more "M's" at least.
Weske is one of Yost's veteran linemen
and around this man the Wolverine coach
has built a veritable stonewall. Dick has
borne the centre rushes that opponents have


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
hurled at him for three years. He has of-
ten penetrated through the opposing line-
man on the defensive and tackled the safe-
ty as he returned the punt. He played four
years on his high school football team
which in his junior year won the cham-
pionship of Eastern Connecticut. In his
second year here he won his "M." Last
year and this year he has been the main-
stay of the right side of the line and the
husky boy has been playing a stellar game
at the right tackle'position. He is in every
play. This is his third year on the Var-
sity and fans will miss him next year as
his vacancy will be a difficult position to
fill.
Rye will be remembered for his excep-
tional good playing in the Case and partic-
ularly the Kalamazoo game. He is a good
halfback and is right there with the goods
when you need him.
Cruse, '19, is a mighty good half back
and always plows the line for several yards.
He's got the spirit and gives everything he
has to win the game.
Among the other players are: Louis
Crane, '18, Joseph Baker, '20, Phil Beath,
'20, Fred Hendershot, '18, L. O. B. Lind-
strom, '19, Thomas C. Garrett, '19. These
men are all good and fit perfectly into
Michigan's .fighting machine when called
upon.
COURSE IN ARMY STORE METHODS
The fourth course in Army Stores, un-
der the direction of Prof. Joseph A. Burs-
ley of the Engineering Department began
Saturday, Nov. 3, with an enrollment of
one hundred and sixteen men.
The first of these courses was given in
the spring at the University of Michigan
by Prof. Bursley as a special (two hour)
course in storage methods, the particular
aim being to train the men in army stores
practice. Shortly after this the Storage
Committee of the Council on National De-
fense arranged a meeting of various col-
lege heads which was attended by repre-
sentatives of the Chief of Ordnance and
Quartermaster General with the result that
colleges throughout the country established
similar courses in Army Stores methods.
Since that time courses have been given at
several institutions, following the plan of
the first course at Michigan with the addi-
tion of other subjects suggested by the
Quartermasters and Ordnance Department.
In the first course three classes at Mich-
igan, men were trained for both Ordnance
and Quartermasters Departments, but here-
after it will be for Ordnance only.
The Ordnance Department is charged
with the duty of procuring and distribut-
ing the guns, ammunition, and all other
fighting equipment of the army. Its need
is for men with business training for serv-
ice in the supply division and for men with
Mechanical Engineering training or experi-
ence for both the Supply and Repair di-
visions.
The work at the University consists of
lectures, recitations and laboratory instruc-
tion in the best industrial practice of hand-
ling stores, elementary accounting, the prin-
ciples of army accountability and paper
work, army regulations, French conversa-
tion and military drill. Drill is given from
10:30 to 12:30 every day with exception of
Friday when the Military men visit manu-
facturing plants in Detroit. The course
lasts six weeks and at the end of that time
the men will be enlisted as privates in the
Ordnance Department of the National
Army and then assigned for a further peri-
od of training of five weeks at some arse-
nal or cantonment. It is expected that at
least seventy-five percent of the men will
be made non-commissioned officers at the
expiration of this second period of train-
ing.
Once every week the class goes to De-
troit to study the methods of large plants
and to see how the theory taught here
works out in practice.
The list of firms to be visited are, Parke
Davis Co., Packard Motor Car Co., Bur-
roughs Adding Machine Co., Gemmer Mfg.
Co., Detroit Twist Drill Co., Standard
Bros. Co., Stearns Mfg. Co., Hudson Mo-
tor Car Co., Detroit Screw Co., Burnham
Stoepel Co., Michigan Stone Co., and the
Detroit Lubricator Co.


233
The Class is split up into squads of
twelve and each squad visits a different
plant, not all going to the same plant at
once.
Elbert H. Croul, '08, of Riverside Storage
Co., has been very instrumental in procur-
workout they were given the night before.
Drill is held every day, rain or shine, and
although for several weeks there was very
little "shine." the men were there just the
same.
The military suits have not yet arrived

ing permission for the men to visit these
plants. Officials of the plants visited have
been exceedingly kind, always giving from
a half day to a day of their time together
with all the information desired.
MILITARY TRAINING
Military training is now on in earnest
and almost any day one may hear some of
the "future soldiers" talking about the hard
but are expected soon. With their arrival
the campus will undoubtedly present a very
warlike aspect at all times of the day.
COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING COLLECTING DATA ON
THE DRAFT
Information in regard to the exemption
or extending the time of engineering stu-
dents affected by the draft is now being
gathered by the engineering college, and


THE MICHIGAN TBCHNIC
will be sent to the national advisory com-
mittee at Washington. No definite word
has been received as yet from the govern-
ment as to whether these students will be
exempted until they finish their course,
course. Preparation is merely being made
in the anticipation that such a provision, as
is already in effect in the case of dental and
medical students, will be made for all who
are taking engineering.
PROFESSOR WOOD HONORED
A new bronze tablet has been erected in
the Engineering Arch in honor of Profes-
sor DeVolson Wood, and the unveiling and
dedication are to take place soon.

FOUNDER
DEVOLSON WOOD
1832-1897
Mathematician — Engineer — Physic-
ist — Author. Pioneer in Applied Sci-
ence and Engineering Education. The
Act of 1837 organizing the University
of Michigan Provided for a Chair in
Civil Engineering. A Professor was
Elected in 1853 and his Successor in
1855. These were followed by De-
Volson Wood in 1857, who Resigned
in 1872. Here he Enlarged the Knowl-
edge of Engineering and Maintained
the Highest Standards in Every Field
of his Endeavor. This College of En-
gineering is a Monument to his Noble
Manhood, Vigorous and Inspiring Per-
sonality and Unreserved Energy.
Erected A. D. 1917, by his Former Stu-
dents and Friends in Grateful Mem-
ory of his Teachings and Life, and in
Testimony of his Distinguished Serv-
ices to the University and Mankind.
Professor Wood was a member of the
Engineering faculty from 1857 to 1872 and
during that time took an active part in
University life, and had also an interna-
tional reputation as an engineer and author.
The memorial was donated by alumni
-who attended the University prior to 1872.
DATA OK CIVIL ENROLLMENT
Professor Riggs of the Civil Engineering
department, has procured some data con-
cerning the effect of the war on the Civil
Engineering enrollment in various colleges
and Universities in the United States. Tne
data gives the number of Second, Third
and Fourth year students enrolling for the
terms of 1916-1917 and 1917-1918 and shows
the percentage of loss during the two years.
Following are the figures for a few of
the larger Universities:

for the present year is 32% of the 1916-17
enrollment.
ENGINEERING FACULTY BANQUET
The members of the Mechanical Engi-
neering Faculty held a banquet at the Union
Wednesday evening, Nov. 7. During the
evening a discussion was held concerning
the fact that the instructors of the different


235
departments were not familiar with the
work covered by their fellow instructors.
To overcome this disadvantage it was de-
cided that the head of the department
should have at hand at all times a synop-
sis of the courses being taught by the dif-
ferent men, which synopsis would be used
for reference by all. This synopsis will con-
sist of several synopses which are to be
made out by the instructors covering their
work.
ELECTRICAL DEPARTMENT
Professor A. H. Lovell has received a
commission as Major of Engineers and is
now stationed at Camp Custer, Battle
Creek, Michigan.

Professor H. S. Sheppard, also absent on
leave, has received the commission of Cap-
tain in a Signal Corps, and is in Washing-
ton, D. C, on detached service doing re-
search work on wireless.
CIVIL DEPARTMENT
Professor A. R. Bailey is absent on leave
doing special research work for the New

Instructor O. M. McNiel also has a leave
of absence and is now in the Navy acting
as Commander of a Company.
union building
The new Michigan Union Building is
now up three stories and work has been
started on the fourth. Students and oth-
ers are just beginning to realize what the
size of the finished building will be. If
those who do not yet appreciate it would
go through the part completed and then
mentally add on that yet to be finished,
they ought then to have a fair idea of it.
The firm doing the present work have
the contract for the outside work only and
expect to have the roof on by Christmas.
Probably the contracts for the inside work
will be let soon although the building is
not entirely subscribed for yet. When en-
tirely finished the building will be one such
as ought to make any Michigan man proud
to say that he had some part in its construc-
tion, that he in some way aided in making
the Michigan Union a success.
miss hall wins fame
Dorothy Hall, of Toledo, has the honor
of being the first woman to receive an as-
sistantship in the chemical department. As
far as can be determined this holds good
also for the entire engineering department.
Miss Hall is a Senior Chemical and has
been appointed laboratory assistant to Dr.
H. H. Willard.
FRESH-SOPH GAMES
The Push-Bail contest, the annual Spring
fracas between the Freshmen and Sopho-
mores, has been abolished and it is very
improbable that the Flag-Rush will be held
this Fall. The Freshmen met as usual this
year, a few days before the game was to
be held, in order to elect their captain for
the fray, but instead of hearing the pep-
arousing speeches as in former years, they
were told that the Flag-Rush would not be


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
held and were asked to name a substitute.
Several suggestions were offered such as
"Old Maid" and "Checkers" but none of
these seemed to meet with the entire ap-
proval of the audience. It was finally left
in the hands of the Student Council to pro-
vide a substitute, but none are as yet forth-
coming.
Since the Freshmen met there has lately
been some talk about allowing the Flag-
Rush to be held. The Freshmen Engineers
decided at their last assembly that the game
should be held and made an appeal to the
Student Council to that effect. The Stu-
dent Council has passed the appeal on to
the University Senate and their decision is
now being awaited.
According to some announcements it was
the wish of the Sophomores that the Flag-
Rush be abolished, but concensus of opin-
ion does not bear this out. From the re-
sults, it would seem that "Last Year's
Freshmen" rather enjoyed the frolic a year
ago and there are at least a few who were
looking forward to it with some joy this
year.
FOOTBALL
Michigan's eleven has proven itself to be
one of the most expert squad of pigskin
chasers that Yost has turned out for years.
Case opened the football season on Ferry
Field on Oct. " with just enough opposition
to make the game interesting from the
spectators' point of view. Yost had had
little chance to get the men in shape and
rooters were anxious as to the strength of
the team. Michigan won 41-0. Sparks,
Wieman and Rye were responsible for the
scoring. Yost decided to give the squad
a chance and many substitutes were used
before the end of the game.
Wednesday, Oct. 10, Michigan rooters
had the worst scare of their lives when Kal-
amazoo Normal came to Ferry Field and
held the big end of the score for six min-
utes. Michigan then displayed her come-
back ability and Kalamazoo left the field
a defeated team with the final score 17-13.
Berman starred for Kalamazoo while Rye
and Cohn did the work for Michigan.
Sparks was injured in the game and has
been on the bench ever since. Weston
went in for Sparks and proved a sensation.
Mt. Union followed Kalamazoo on Sat-
urday when Weston again proved his ex-
ceptional ability, running sixty-five yards
for a touchdown. First touchdown was
made after six minutes of play, the final
score resulting in a victory for Michigan
69-0.
University of Detroit wound up the
practice games by accepting a defeat 14-3.
They were the last team to win any points
from Michigan.
Sharks Tackled bit Still Gaining—
Cornell vs. Michigan
1917
The Farmers came down from East Lan-
sing expecting to be defeated and were, be-
. ing sent home with a 27-0 tag tied to their
agricultural tail on Oct. 20. This again
avenged M. A. C.'s former victories. Wie-
man and Weston were the main ground
gainers for Michigan.
The Cornhuskers from Nebraska were
swamped by Michigan Oct. 27 by 20-0. The
game was played on a muddy field with -
heavy rain falling continually during the
contest. Froemke's 90-yard run in the first
quarter took the heart out of the Nebraska
bunch and put confidence into the Michigan
eleven. He picked up a fumble and raced
down the length of the field through the
entire Nebraska team to a touchdown.
Weston and Wieman again hammered the
line for large gains. This game showed
what Michigan can do to a real team.
Kalamazoo went down to overwhelming
defeat, the Varsity rolling up a 62-0 score.
In this game Weston totalled more than


237
three hundred yards and Wieman made all
but one goal.
Fast defeats were forgotten when Michi-
gan whipped the Ithacans by a 40-0 score
on Nov. 10. Cornell was unable to resist
the powerful attack of the Wolverines and
struggled along, seldom able to gain more
than a yard or two. Weston, Lambert and
Sparks were prominent stars for Michigan.
Sparks was injured and had to be taken
out. On the defensive, Wieman shared
the honors with Lambert in breaking up
Cornell's attempted gains and his equal in
kicking field goals is probably not to be
found on any team this year.
1918
The first class meeting of the year was
held on October 18th, 10.17, Professor Riggs
having charge of the assembly. Several
speakers addressed the class, among them.
Professor Anderson who urged the senior
Mechanical Engineers to join the American
Society of Mechanical Engineers, thereby
closely connecting themselves with an or-
ganization of professional atmosphere. Af-
ter Dean Cooley's speech on Liberty Bonds,
the class passed a resolution that each one
should purchase at least a $50 bond. The
report of the Honor committee was given
by the chairman, F. J. Kortick, '18. The
following class officers were elected for the
year: President, Phillip Caroll; vice-pres-
ident, E. M. Schaffter; secretary, Dorothy
Hall; treasurer, Leo P. Tattersall; orator-
ical delegate, H. M. Stevens. A resolution
was also passed that senior engineers would
wear corduroy trousers.
1919
The Junior Engineers held their first
assembly on October 18, 1917. Dean Cooley
spoke on the Liberty Loan and after the
speech, the class as a whole subscribed to a
$200 bond which will later be turned over
to a worthy cause. It was also urged that
students subscribe individually to the Loan.
The Juniors took up the corduroy pant
proposition and decided to make their ap-
pearance on the campus in the light-colored
variety while the Senior Engineers appear
in the darker shade. The following offi-
cers were elected: President, Rex St.
Clair; secretary, Clifford M. Sparks; treas-
urer, William Cruse; oratorical delegate,
W. Dow; junior representatives to the
Honor Committee, R. D. Smith, C. T. Van
Dusen.
The second assembly was held on Nov.
15th, Owing to a mix-up on eligibility
rules the election of a vice-president could
not be carried out at the regular time, and
a special election was carried out under
the supervision of R. D. Smith, '19. Stu-
dent Councilman. H. J. Mack was elected
to fill this position. W. R. Cruse was elect-
ed Basketball Manager. Dr. C. L. Meader
of the Literary College gave an interesting
talk on conditions in Russia.
President J. R. St. Clair announced the
following committee appointments:
Advisory: Rex St. Clair, H. J. Mack,
W. R. Cruse. C. T. Van Dusen, W. C.
Babbitt, D. M. Springer.
Finance: C. T. Van Dusen, Chairman;
Rex St. Clair, H. J. Mack, R. D. Smith,
W. R. Cruse.
Auditing: W. C. Babbitt, Chairman; C.
B. Campbell, R. S. Cooper.
Social: D. M. Springer, Chairman; H.

1920
The first assembly of the sophomore en-
gineers was held in Room 348 of the En-
gineering Building and served to introduce
Professor Hauhart, who is in charge of
the class of '20. In his brief talk, he urged
upon the class the importance of attend-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
ance at the assemblies and also that the
students co-operate with their mentors as
much as possible and derive greater bene-
fit from their college life. Stanley Lowe,
the retiring class president, introduced Pro-
fessor Sharfman of the Economics Depart-
ment, the speaker of the day. After his
speech, a short peppy business meeting was
in order. A social committee was appoint-
ed and the following class officers were
elected: President, Carl T. Hogan; vice-
president, C. O. Barton; secretary, J. V.
Tracy; treasurer, J. T. Dickinson.
1921
That the Freshmen Engineers have "pep"
was displayed at one of their recent assem-
blies, when disgusted with the action of the
Senate Council in abolishing the fall con-
tests between freshmen and sophomores,
they submitted a resolution for continuing
them unless suitable substitutes be found
immediately. The resolution which was
welcomed by Student Councilinen reads as
follows:
"Resolved, That since the recommenda-
tion of the Senate Counil has abolished the
historic contests between the freshmen and
sophomore classes, we, the members of the
engineering class of '21, though cognizant
of the worthy intentions of the council,
nevertheless request, that, if a suitable sub-
stitute is not found, the customary contest
be held within a month."
Campus opinion is that the sophomore
engineers are in favor of the action but
C. T. Hogan, president of the class of '20,
stated that no official action had been taken
yet.
Ensign Dudley A. Nichols, '18, has been

interesting lecture on Mining Problems as
applied to Mechanical Engineers.
BROADWAY BRIDGE
J. P. Ruche, '88, of Grand Rapids, Mich.,
has the general contract for the new Broad-
way Bridge in Ann Arbor which is replac-
ing the old steel structure over the Huron
River.
The contract was awarded early in April
and work on it was begun almost imme-
diately. At present over two-thirds of the
work has been completed but due to the
labor shortage and other troubles connect-
ed with its construction it will not be fin-
ished as per contract Jan. 1, 1918, but the
finishing touches will be left until spring.
However, traffic will be resumed over it
about the first of the year.
The new bridge is being constructed of
reinforced concrete with a dirt fill and con-
sists of two arches, one, one hundred and
six feet long and the other fifty-three
feet long, supported on a central pier twen-
ty-four feet wide at the base. The total
width of the bridge is twenty-five and one-
half feet and the roadway from curb to
curb is seventeen feet. It will be remember-
ed that the old steel bridge was practically
level but the new structure will have a
grade of six inches in one hundred feet,
being raised four feet above the old level
at the south end and three and one-half
feet at the north end. A drainage system
will be installed to look after waste water
which will be caught in a catch basin and
taken down by a twelve-inch storm sewer
to the tail race from the Edison plant. Ap-
proximately 5,000 cubic yards of earth will
be used to make the fill over the ends and
arches and 3,000 cubic yards of concrete
and one hundred tons of steel will be used
in the construction of the bridge.
An interesting feature in the design of
the bridge is that the south arch being
twice the length of the north, will have
a great deal more thrust. To offset this,
the line of action of the shorter arch has
been raised so as to give a greater resist-
ing moment to the thrust from the longer
ajch. The under part of the north arch
is constructed of false work without any
reinforcement, designed for appearances,
the spring line of the two arches seeming
to be the same.
WORK BEING DONE AT THE HYDRAULIC
EXPERIMENT FLUME
Some interesting experimental work on
the flow of water over wiers is now being
carried out on the Huron River by Russel
A. Dodge.
The object of the work being done at the
experimental flume is to determine the co-
efficient of a standard Bazin weir, 3.74 ft.
high, for heads up to 0.80 ft.
A right-angled V-notched weir set in a
bulkhead in the upper part of the flume as
a part of the flume will be calibrated using
the lower part of the flume as a measuring
basin and will then be used to measure the
discharge of the Bazin weir. The basin
has a capacity of two thousand cubic feet


THE MICHIGAN TECHN1C
which makes the minimum duration of run
over two minutes. To insure a nearly in-
stantaneous starting and stopping of the
flow into the basin a car-trough arrange-
ment is used. This can be moved on a
track to either a position in which it inter-
cepts the flow over the V-notched weir or
one in which it allows the flow to waste.
It is expected that this set of tests will
clear up the discrepancies between the ex-
isting low head experiments.
ARCHITECTURE
Professor Victor Horta, noted architect
delivered his famous illustrated lecture,
"The Germans and Belgians in France." in
Alumni Memorial Hall on November 13th.
Due to the distinguished part he has taken
in the development of modern architecture,
Prof. Horta is an architect of international
repute. He stands at the top of his profes-
sion and at the outbreak of the war was
in charge of the construction of the Great
Central Railroad station at Brussels and
the Museum of Fine Arts building at Tour-
nai. For twenty years Prof. Horta was
faculty member at the University of Brus-
sels, which he left later to organize the
Royal School of Fine Arts.
CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
METALLURGICAL RESEARCH IN PROGRESS
NOVEMBER 14, I917
In the Metallurgical Department Mr. F
C. Carter, holder of the Detroit Edison
Fellowship, is working to develop electric
furnaces for heat treating and metallurgi-
cal processes involving comparatively low
temperatures. There is, at present, no fur-
nace which is at the same time practical
and economical. The purpose of this in-
vestigation is, not to develop a furnace
which can be patented and sold for profit,
but to make available for industrial use a
cheap and practical electric furnace. The
sole function of the Edison Company is to
produce and sell electric current.
Mr. F. R. Nethaway, who holds the Fel-
lowship of the Detroit Copper &amp; Brass
Company, has been investigating the effect
of zinc upon the physical properties of
cupro nickel. This alloy, containing 2j/j
per cent nickel,—remainder copper, is used
by the Navy for shell bands for projec-
tiles, and is hard to cast in sound ingots,
large pipes being formed. The purpose of
the present work is to determine whether
small amounts of zinc—for instance, 2 per
cent—will have any injurious effect upon
the physical properties of the alloy, for it
is known that this amount of zinc renders
sound casting easy.
The students in Chemical Engineering 12
are now undertaking some work in connec-
tion with the Detroit Steel Castings Com-
pany, on the physical properties and heat
treatment of steel castings. Metal of this
class containing .20 to .50 per cent of car-
bon is extensively used, both for Navy-
work and by the Ordnance Department, in
the manufacture of shells, gun carriages,
etc. The physical properties required by
the Government are high and it is hoped
to render a larger percentage of steel cast-
ings acceptable.
In the near future the Metallurgical De-
partment—in co operation with the rest of
the Chemical Engineering Department —
will take part in a general investigation of
aluminum alloys for airplane construction.
Dr. C. D. Holley and P. J. Wilson are
now carrying out tests leading to the de-
termination of the factors entering into
the commercial sublimation of Benzoic
acid.
Prof. W. L. Badger is at present work-
ing on new reagents for the determination
of the oxygen in gas.
The work on the new evaporator labora-
tory to be under the direction of Prof.
Badger is progressing very satisfactorily,
some of the parts having already been
shipped.
Under the direction of Prof. J. C. Brier.
studies are being made by L. W. Shoon
and R. E. McGee on Optical glass and the
purity of its ingredients. This is a govern-
ment problem and may lead to some rather
important results. Some experiments are
being made, also under Prof. Brier's direc-


241
tions on the production of dyes. P. G.
Wilson is trying to obtain sulphur dyes
t'rom rosin and other gums and R. E. Mc-
Gee is working on the preparation of Au-
ramin dye.
Another government problem, this one
concerning hard aluminum alloys is being
worked out by H. Rye and A. E. Barton
under Prof. W. L. Badger's directions. E.

C. Fries, with Prof. Badger directing, is
making experiments with a new pipe cov-
ering in which he is comparing the actions
of the new covering with those of a stan-
dard covering.
C. F. Kronbach is working on a method
to be used for the production of a mould-
ed carbon filter block. Mr. F. C. Smart
has charge of the work.
Under the direction of Dr. J. S. Laird,
A. W. Laird and A. W. White are working
on a problem which was taken up at the
instigation of the government. The prob-
lem is the determination of a method for
the oxidation of ammonia to nitric acid,
and may have some important results.
The development of plastic clays used in
the glass industry is another government
problem being carried out under Dr. Laird's
directions, by R. F. Geller.
F. P. Zimmerli is carrying on a series of
tests leading to the determination of the
grain growth of copper under different
heat treatments. Mr. Archer has charge
of the work.
With Dr. Holley as director, Y. S. Chen
is making a study of pigments and oils in
reference to the paint industry. Also un-
der Dr. Holley's direction, W. B. Parker
is doing some work having to do with the
commercial manufacture of ammonium
bromide, and the utilization of the waste
product, iron oxide, by heat treatments.
W. B. Parker has control of some tests
being made by Y. S. Chen to determine the
comparative values of the lime and stron-
tium processes for the recovery of sugar
from waste molasses.
STANDARDIZATION OF THE COLOR
OF PAINTED SURFACES
W. IV. Sleator and P. H. Gcigcr
The Fellowship in Chemical Engineering
maintained by the Acme White Lead and
Color Company has been transferred for
the year to the department of Physics. The
work to be done is in continuation of that
begun the past summer under the direction
of Doctor Holley at the Acme plant, on
the numerical expression of the color prop-
erties of surfaces. A Nutting colorimeter
made by Hilger of London, together with
accessory apparatus has been transferred
from the Acme works to the photometry
room of the Physics building.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
The results obtained in the use of this
colorimeter enable one to describe uniquely
a painted surface in terms of the wave-
length of the light constituting its domi-
nant hue and the percentage of white or
standard light in the total scattered light.
It is necessary that the sources used be
constant and reproducible, though their
quality and intensity are immaterial. It is
hoped that a numerical expression of the
color properties of a paint may serve as a
standard, in place of, or at least to supple-
ment, an actual sample.
The Nutting colorimeter embodies a
Lummer-Brodhun and a flicker photometer.
The intensity of the light is varied by pairs
of nicol prisms. A visibility curve show-
ing the relative sensitiveness of the eye to
different colors may be obtained by its use.
One may also measure the total reflecting
or scattering power of a surface, and de-
termine in how far the surface examined
obeys Lambert's Law.
MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
CURRENT RESEARCH WORK IN THE MECHANI-
CAL ENGINEERING LABORATORY
Owing to the relatively small number of
men electing the M.E. 22 course this semes-
ter, most of the research problems are dor-
mant for the time being, although a few
are in progress.
Investigations are being continued from
last year in an attempt to determine accu-
rately the rate of heat transfer from steam
in a pipe coil to water. It would appear
at first thought that this is a very simple
problem that could be disposed of by one
or two tests. The fact that it occupied a
large part of one man's time last year, and
that we are continuing the work again this
year, indicates both the magnitude of the
research and the difficulties in obtaining
consistent results. Our chief stumbling
block lies in the disposal of the air that
persists in accumulating in the coil. This
work is being conducted by Mr. L. W. Hel-
ler, 'i6E, holder of the fellowship of the
United States Radiator Corporation.
Mr. R. C. Corlett is continuing the inves-
tigation on screw threads, which was com-
menced by Mr. Foltz last semester. The
work has not progressed to the point where
any results have been obtained. The appa-
ratus is now nearly all built, and it is
hoped that actual testing can begin soon.
It is common knowledge that steam en-
gines in the Navy are operating successful-
ly without cylinder oil. Just why the same
thing can not be done, or has not been done
in land practice, is not quite clear. It is
more than probable that the matter has

Engineering
been investigated before, but no record of
such trials has come to mind. At any rate,
in order to throw some light of our own
upon the subject, an investigation is being
made in the Laboratory at the present time.
The Lansing engine, which is of the hori-
zontal type, 8 x 10 in size, has been selected
for the purpose. It is to be operated for
24 hours with cylinder oil fed at a regular
rate. Then the oil will be cut off, the en-
gine continuing to run at the same load
for another 24 hours, unless it begins to
"holler" too loudly for oil. All conditions
of operation, including brake load, remain-


243
ing constant throughout, the area of the
indicator diagrams will give a direct indi-
cation of the change in frictional effect.
Mi. VV. A. McKinley is conducting this
test, with the help of M.E. Assistants and
M.E. 22 men.
The second semester of last year proved
rather fruitful in the amount of research
work that was carried to a successful term-
ination.
Mr. W. A. Warrick presented an excel-
lent thesis on his investigation of the co-
efficient of heat transmission from a bare
steam pipe buried in the ground. The ex-
periments were made on a 3" pipe of about
100 ft. length, buried to an average depth
of 5 ft. Steam of an observed quality and
pressure was furnished to the pipe, and the
condensation resulting from cooling was
collected and weighed, thus giving a meas-
ure of the heat supplied. Electric resist-
ance thermometers indicated the tempera-
ture of the earth at a number of places.
The temperature of the earth at a sufficient
distance from the pipe not to be apprecia-
bly affected by its heat, was considered as
the lower temperature in the calculation of
K. Values of K were determined under
three conditions, viz:
(a) Low pressure steam (17.7 lbs. per
sq. in. abs. pr.), zero velocity of flow,
K = 1.284.
(b) Low pressure steam (18.9 lbs. per
sq. in. abs. pr.), 2,522 ft. per min. velocity
of flow. K— 1.186.
(c) High pressure steam (125.4 lbs. per
sq. in. abs. pr.), zero velocity of flow.
K = 1.332.
The influence of various factors such as
wind, rain, air temperature, etc. was noted.
Messrs. A. F. Caughey and F. H. Hollo-
way made some tests to determine the ra-
pidity of condensation when steam is turn-
ed into a cold, cast iron radiator. The in-
fluence of air in the radiator complicated
the investigation. Under the conditions
prevailing, the averages of their tests show-
ed the following:
During the first I min., 5V2 lbs. condensed.
During the first 2 min., S'A lbs. condensed.
During the first 3 min., 11 lbs. condensed.
During the first 4 min., 12!^ lbs. condensed.
During the first 5 min., 13^ lbs. condensed.
Messrs. G. Spender and D. L. Perkins
carried out an investigation to ascertain
the rapidity with which water evaporates
from an open vessel at various tempera-
tures. This knowledge is useful at times
in the weighing of warm water, when the
temperature is high enough to cause appre-
ciable evaporation and so introduce error
in the weighing. Their curve shows the
rate to be as follows for several tempera-
tures:
WATER
TEMP. EVAPORATION
ioo°F .2 lbs. per sq. ft. surf. per hr.
I20°F .55 lbs. per sq. ft. surf. per hr.
I40°F 1.0 lbs. per sq. ft. surf. per hr.
i6o°F 1.7 lbs. per sq. ft. surf. per hr.
i8o°F 3.0 lbs. per sq. ft. surf. per hr.
I95°F 6.0 lbs. per sq. ft. surf. per hr.
The room temperature was about 75°
and the humidity of the air 50 to 55%.
These men also investigated the rate of
weight loss from a sample of gasoline in
an open vessel sitting in a room for an
extended length of time, as well as the ac-
companying change in specific gravity.
Mr. Tom Tobey conducted what might
be called a semi-endurance' test of a 1"
packless globe valve. The valve was so
constructed as to eliminate the ordinary
soft packing for the stem. The valve was
installed in a steam pipe line, with the
wheel looking down, which is the worst
position for an ordinarily packed valve.
After opening and closing the valve by
hand some 5,000 or 6,000 times, and ob-
serving that it appeared to be about as
healthful and steam-tight as it was at the
beginning, whereas the soft packed valve
installed alongside had been weeping copi-
ously for several days, Mr. Tobey conclud-
ed that the packless valve has some merit,
and incorporated this idea in his report.
RESEARCH IX PHYSICS
MAGNETIC MEASUREMENTS
It has long been known that when a mag-
netic force is applied to an iron bar, or
ring, the iron does not become fully mag-
S


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
netized at once, but after the first large
effect the magnetization continues to in-
crease for a few seconds, more or less, de-
pending upon the size of the piece of iron.
This time lag in magnetization has usually
been ascribed to the "magnetic viscosity"
of the iron. In a former paper the author
considered the effect as due to eddy cur-
rents within the iron, but this explanation
has been criticized on the ground that such
eddy currents are of too short duration to
produce the observed effect.
The validity of this objection is not ad-
mitted. In order to examine further the
effect of eddy currents, four rings of Swed-
ish iron were made. The cross sectional
area of each ring was about I cm. by 1.2
cm. Two of the rings had an external
diameter of 15 cm., while the internal di-
ameter of the other two was a little larger.
When placed together, the four rings form-
ed a ring of larger cross section (2.1 cm.
by 2.5 cm.), but with the four parts sep-
arated by air gaps of about I mm. in width.
These air gaps could have no effect upon
the magnetization of the ring, but they do
prevent any eddy current circulating across
the ring as a whole; there can only be
smaller eddies in the separate parts.
Extensive experiments were made on this
compound ring to determine just how fast
the magnetization increases with time when
different magnetic forces were applied to
the iron, and curves were drawn express-
ing these results.
Now if this time lag in magnetization is
due to the "magnetic viscosity" of the iron
it should make no difference if the air
gaps separating the four rings were filled
with metal, thus permitting electric cur-
rents to flow across. This would not change
the amount of iron surface bounding the
four rings if the conducting metal is non-
magnetic. The effect of eddy currents,
however, would be increased four fold,
since this effect is proportional to the cross
sectional area of the solid metal.
In carrying out this idea, copper rings
were fitted tightly between the iron rings
and the whole soldered together into one
solid ring. This ring was rewound with the
same number of turns of wire as before,
and all of the magnetic measurements were
repeated. The curves obtained for this
solid ring showed that the magnetization
did rise more slowly than before; in fact,
it required almost exactly four times as
long to reach the same degree of magnet-
ization.
It is thus shown that the time lag in
magnetization is not due to "magnetic vis-
cosity," or any peculiarity of the iron, but
is the normal result of eddy currents which
are set up. in the body of the iron at the
time it is magnetized.
The full details of this work will be
found in the Physical Review.

THE ELECTROLYTIC RECTIFIER FOR
HIGH VOLTAGES
N. H. Williams and J. M. Cork. Depart-
ment of Physics
The frequent need for direct voltages
higher than those usually obtainable in the
Physical Laboratory led to the investiga-
tion of the electrolytic rectifier for this
purpose.
The lead-aluminium cell with a solution
of borax for its electrolyte will transmit
current freely from lead to aluminium but
permits only an insignificant current to flow
in the opposite direction even when the ap-
plied voltage is as high as 220 volts. Four
such cells properly arranged will give com-
plete rectification of a 220 volt alternating
current, utilizing both halves of the cycle.
In this investigation, for each of the four
cells in the ordinary arrangement, there
was substituted a group of ten cells in ser-
ies. By this means, a 2,200 volt alternating
current was rectified and when a consider-
able inductance was put into the circuit, the
current curve, as shown by the oscillo-
graph, was smoothed out so that it showed
less than 20% variation from its maximum
value.
When a constant voltage is desired but
with little or no current, a condenser across
the terminals is used with good results.

INVESTIGATION OF TEMPERATURE
RISE OF INDUCTION MOTORS
A. D. Moore, Instructor, Electrical
Engineering
The design of electrical machinery con-
sists in more than the name indicates. It
takes in the fields of mechanical, electrical,
magnetic, and insulation design, as well as
the problems of heat transfer and cooling
air flow. All of these are now a matter
of more or less exact calculation excepting
the determination of the temperature rise.
Mr. A. D. Moore, of the Electrical Engi-
neering Faculty, was engaged this summer
in working on a method of predetermina-
tion of temperature rise of induction mo-
tors, at the Westinghouse Electric and
Manufacturing Company.
Temperature rise of a given machine is
at present largely predetermined by refer-
ence to results obtained from similar ma-
chines already built, and by using more or
less empirical laws derived from a study
of such results. It was the desire in this
research to acquire data on heat transfer
and air flow, then to combine these data
in such form as to analyze the specific
problem of the induction motor, all work-
ing towards the predetermination of its
temperature rise.
It was forcibly brought out that lament-
ably little is known about such things as
pressure drops of air flowing through ir-
regular passages ; and that the present meth-
ods of measuring air velocities are entirely
inadequate where simplicity of procedure
is necessary. Little progress was made on
the main issue because of this lack of data.
It would seem therefore, that results of re-
search carried on by technical schools on
the problems of air pressure drops, meth-
ods of air velocity measurement, and inves-
tigation of the laws of heat transfer both
within the machine materials and from
their surfaces to the cooling air. would be
greatly appreciated by the manufacturers.
Once these problems are solved, the de-
signer will be able to carry out a true de-
sign of cooling air paths and heat transfer
piths.
Inasmuch as the ability of a machine to
carry load is dependent on the temperature
of its hottest spot, anything which will re-
duce this temperature will result in the sav-
ing of vast amounts of construction ma-
terials.
THE ENGINEER
BY THEODORE A. LEISEN
\\ hen the earth was young and our race was crude,
And the needs of the world were few,
The man of skill found no place to fill;
There was nothing for him to do.
But time in its steady, unceasing whirl,
Wrought changes both far and near,
And the wants of man grew by span and span,
Making work for the engineer.
And so year by year and from age to age,
With the growth of wealth and thrift,
There arose a demand for the skillful hand
Of the man of mechanical drift.
As science and craft and the useful arts
Increased in scope each year,
Came a call for the man who could build and plan,
And they called him an engineer.


Now what constitutes the so-called engineer,—
The man with a college degree?
The one who can frame a "C. E." with his name,
Or perchance an "M. E." or '*E. E."?
No, these are but symbols; they do not insure
That he's qualified for the career.
They are but the signs—the man's own designs
Constitute him the real engineer.
Take a glance at the records on history's page.
Note the names of the men who made good;
Of the "men of the hour' who showed their great power
'Way back since the time of the flood.
Their achievements all serve to inspire us yet;
Such names we respect and revere.
Men whose monuments stand throughout ev'ry land,
Each of these was an engineer.
First Noah excelled in the ship-building line,
At an age when he had no compeer.
Should he not be set down in the book of renown
With the grade of Marine Engineer?
Arid Jacob, an adept at hydraulic work,
Who furnished the water for years
To Israel's men. Why not class him, then,
Among Water-works Engineers?
Archimedes, well known as a builder of pumps.
And a man of mechanical fame,
Having made a good start in this branch of the art,
Could we not add "M. E." to his name?
Ben Franklin, electrical expert of yore,
Tackled Jupiter's realm without fear.
For the knowledge thus gained, 'twere but just he be named
An Electrical Engineer.
The annals of history are filled with such names
As Stephenson, Fulton and Watt,
Field, Roebling and Eads,—all renowned for their deeds,—
Or Bessemer, Corliss, or Scott.
And by myriads of others whose names we might quote,
Who stand forth as the pioneers
Of the world's great events. Each of them represents
The profession of Engineers.
So here's to the men of the present and past,
To the men who create and who plan;
Who have wielded the forces from Nature's resources
For the good of their fellow-man.
To those who have aided in mankind's advance;
To the men sans reproche et sans peur,
Who have builded and planned for the good of the land,
To the Eminent Engineer.

Prof. McConkey spent his summer vaca-
tion with the Michigan Central Railroad,
in Detroit. Prof. McConkey was connected
with the bridge department designing steel
and concrete bridges, and while on the job,
he devised a scheme for underpinning a
number of bridge foundations to allow De-
troit's enlarged sewer system to pass be-
neath.
The freehand drawing department has re-
ceived several architectural casts of orna-
ment, being used on the new Detroit News
Building. They were designed by Albert
Kahn of Detroit, and presented to the de-

Profs. Lorch and McConkey arc doing
volunteer service in drawing up preliminary
plans for the proposed gym at Camp Cus-
ter.
The Illinois Architectural Bulletin was
published this summer, containing notes of
the work of the last two years. The issue
of the year before last was impossible be-
cause of lack of funds.
A recent letter from P. O. Davis, '18A,
told of his having passed all ground school
examinations at Berkeley, and being or-
dered to San Diego, where he will do actual
flying. His recent marriage to Miss Nita
McDonald of Santa Anna, California, was
also announced.
Prof. Kimball is with us again, after a
year's leave of absence, which he spent in
the study of Colonial and other American
Architecture in the East and South. In
his quest for information, Prof. Kimball
visited New York, Baltimore, Washington
and Boston. He succeeded among other
things, in discovering a great number of
the actual architects' drawings from which
colonial architecture was erected.
During the year, appeared the folio vol-
ume, "Thomas Jefferson, Architect," in
Which Prof. Kimball published the many
designs made by President Jefferson, which
established his position as one of the found-
ers of American architecture.
The Architectural Society has started its
year with a bang. Prof. Lorch opened the

THE AMERICAS UNIVERSITY UNION
IS PARIS
ACCORDING to reports received from
France, the American University Un-
ion, opened in the Royal Palace Hotel in
Paris on October 20, has met with tremen-
dous success. Professor Charles B. Vib-
bert, '04, of the Department of Philosophy,
was appointed to represent the University
of Michigan and has been in Paris ever
since September 25. In a letter to Presi-
dent Harry B. Hutchins he writes:
"We have leased, with the privilege of
cancellation, a small hotel to serve as the
American University Union club house.
The place may be familiar to many of the
University faculty and students as it is the
Royal Palace hotel. It faces the Comedie
Franqais, the Louvre, and the Grand Hotel
du Louvre, and backs up against the old
Palace Royal. The location is an excellent
one, in the very heart of downtown Paris,
only a five minute walk from the Grand
Opera.
"We anticipate no difficulty in keeping the
house filled. There are 78 rooms in the
Union, none of them large, however. In
view of the fact that coal is now selling at
$48 a ton, the smallness of the rooms is
not the handicap it might otherwise have
been."
Prof. Vibbert took with him a complete
list of all Michigan Alumni on card cata-
logues together with the names of all Alum-
ni and undergraduates that could be ob-
tained who were now in the U. S. Service.
This Union is practically serving as a home
for University men in France during their
furloughs. The Michigan men will find
there all Michigan publications and books
pertaining to the University on file.
LEND A HAND
The Alumni Department is never cut.
We print all the news that we can lay our
hands on. There is never any danger of
us receiving too many Alumni Notes. The
example set by C. W. Brooks, '02E, who
is connected with the Wisconsin Bridge and
Iron Company with offices at 1619 Monad-
nock Building, Chicago, is well worth fol-
lowing. He writes:
"In looking through your latest issue of
the Tech xic, I do not seem to find a great
deal of information regarding the mem-
bers of our class of 1902, and would like to
take this opportunity of giving you what
information I have regarding the members
of my own class."
"My own work as Sales Manager for a
Fabricating Structural Steel Company,
takes me around over the country and thus
gives me a good opportunity to see a num-
ber of my classmates. There is also quite
a few of the 1502 engineers in Chicago."


250
We have printed the news that Mr.
Brooks sent us under the 1902 class notes.
In conclusion he says:
"I would be very pleased to look up any
of these fellows that I can if you want
special information, and would be of what-
ever assistance I can in helping you make
the Technic the best College Engineering
Journal that there is."
Think of what our Alumni Department
would be if YOU would write us a letter
like this. Not only that, but think of what
the Michigan Technic would be!
JOHN D. HIBBARD, '87, NOT AT
SOUTH BEND
In the October issue of the Technic it
was stated that John D. Hibbard, '87, had
entered the services of the Studebaker Cor-
poration of South Bend, Indiana. This
statement was found to be entirely incor-
rect, and we wish to rectify it with due
apologies to Mr. Hibbard. He is at the
present time Commissioner of the National
Metal Trades Association and is located
at 1021 People's Gas Building, Chicago, 111.

Merrill was one of those highly intellectual
individuals who took great pleasure in
working out original solutions for abstruse

us were playing football or prowling
around the town, Merrill's notion of real
enjoyment was reading "Chrystal's Pure
Mathematics." He has been with the Barge
Canal practically since graduation, and one
of the first things he did was to develop
an entirely new formula for determining
the flow of water in open channels; at the

follow his mathematical gymnastics."

The devil sat by a lake of fire,
On a pile of brimstone kegs;
His head was bowed upon his breast,
His tail between his legs.
A look of shame was on his face
And sparks rained from his eyes—
He'd sent his resignation in
To the throne up in the skies.
"I'm down and out," the devil said—
He said it with a sob—
"These others have outclassed me,
And I have to jump my job.
Hell's not in it with a land
That lies along the Rhine.
I'm a "has been" and a piker,
And I'm going to resign.
"I hate to leave my old home
And the scenes I love so well,
But I feel that I'm not up to date
In the art of running hell."
So he spat a quart of steam
At a brimstone bumble bee,
And left for Bridgeport, where they
Pick up shells beside the sea.
—Anon.
The Ford is my auto, I shall not want—
another;
It makes me lie down beneath it,
It soureth my soul,
It leadeth me in the paths of ridicule for
it's own sake.
Yea, though I ride through the valley, I
am towed up the hills.
And I fear much evil, for its rods and
engine discomfort me.
I annoint my tires with patches and my
engine boileth over,
I repair my blow-outs in the presence of
mine enemies.
Surely if this follows me all the days of
my life,
I shall dwell in the bug-house forever.
AMEN. —Aerial Age.

Cro.. Sectional View of MURPHY STOKER
The Murphy Principle that revolutionized coal burning
thirty-five years ago is the same principle that is used
in Murphy Stokers today.
There has been no change here—we found the right
way of burning coal then—we know it to be the most
efficient way today.
We have improved—refined—changed details wherever
we could make
THE
MURPHY STOKER
better. We have experimented—tried to find changes to
better the Murphy principle—we have net succeeded.
Our liberal policy of improvements shows that we are
constantly alert to any betterment that can be made—■
our tenacious hold to the original Murphy principles
shows how correct they must be.
If you want further proof, remember that it is the
Murphy principle—standardized as the best—that has
forged us from nothing to the largest exclusive manu-
facturers of automatic stokers in the world.

Murphy Iron Works
