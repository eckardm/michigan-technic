owners of the Hudson Light Six-40. These men
have tried and tested the Hudson in forty-three
countries. They are enthusiasts over the beauty, the
luxury, the economy and road-performance of the
car. Dissatisfaction and expense are sure to follow
if one experiments with novelties or buys a car
built at a venture. Experienced motorists always
advise the selection of tried and proven standard
cars built by makers of unquestioned stability.
You can't go wrong if you follow the trail blazed

Honor in Examinations?
The direct facing of the question of
cheating in examinations in generally
avoided as long as possible by both
Faculty and students. No College in
the University of Michigan has as yet
met this problem squarely and as a
result of this apathy, it was inevitable
that the practice should come to be
looked upon lightly by students, that
successful cribbing should even be-
come an achievement of which to be
proud, and that drastic measures
would finally be necessary to stop the
growing evil.
Following the recent final examina-
tions, a student in the College of Engi-
nering was suspended for one semester


for cheating and in many cases stu-
dents were given E's for cheating in
their finals. There was, however, a
strong feeling that all the guilty were
not being punished and that more dras-
tic measures must be taken. There is a
growing sentiment among the Faculty
that students taking examinations
should be watched so thoroughly as to
make cribbing impossible. This may
first be done by the systematic seating
of different classes in the larger rooms
so that classmates will be separated by
other students rather than by mere
vacant desks, and then having several
proctors actively, not merely theoret-
ically, on duty in each room. Of the
three common methods of conducting
examinations, that is admittedly the
most efficient in eliminating cribbing.
But Fellow-Students:—Must we be
treated as thieves? Do we want to
write examinations as under martial
law—in a state of siege? Will any
man in the College of Engineering,
either Faculty member or student, per-
mit his motives to be questioned when
he undertakes work of any nature
where ability, knowledge or honor are
at stake? Most likely not. His re-
sentment would know no bounds if his
every act were to be regarded with a
suspicion that even thieves are now
relieved of in the endeavor of Sociol-
ogy to make them better and more
trustworthy. Yet we are calmly al-
lowing this asperation to be cast upon
us, belittling our ability, reposing no
confidence in our trustworthiness and
undermining the self-confidence that
an education should bring to us, the
very essence of success in our profes-
sion.
The second method of conducting
examinations, the one in general use
at present in the University of Michi-
gan is at best a proved failure from
most every standpoint, and especially
in its influence on the students' sense
of honor. Under it, a man who will
not cheat in some more or less serious
manner in order to pass a course, raise
his grades, or help someone else, is
considered to be a crank. Cheat-
ing in examinations may not make
a man dishonest in the eyes of his
classmates and as a result, although
a man when a Freshman may scorn to
"cribb," by the time he is a Junior he
has become acclimated, so to speak,
and is not adverse to receiving a little
assistance in putting one over on the
Faculty. Instead of being a charac-
ter builder, the system of examining
now in vogue is, in this one respect, at
least, a character destroyer. Further-
more, relations between Faculty and
Students are kept in a condition of
strain and there is an absence of that
freedom of intercourse which both
sides desire and which goes to the
making of a college.
The third method under which ex-
aminations may be conducted is known
as the Honor System. It is at present
slightingly considered by a majority of
the Engineering Faculty, it is distrust-
ed by most of the students. But the
fact remains that it is in successful use
not merely at the University of Vir-
ginia but in Sheffield Scientific Insti-
tute at Yale,at Stevens Institute, at the
University of Texas, in many Depart-
ments of Cornell and Wisconsin, and
at other institutions, and that it is the
only solution of the problem which
appeals to us as engineers, the only
solution yet proposed that is not abso-
lutely offensive to us as engineers, and
the solution which would most cer-
tainly put faculty and students on the
same plane, on a sure footing with
each other, instead of widening the
breach between them.


Members of the Faculty: Is it too
much to assume that the large major-
ity of the students in the College of
Engineering are controlled by the def-
inite earnest purpose to take full
advantage of all the opportunities
offered for securing a training to fit
them for their selected vocation? Is it
too much to assume that the great
majority of us are innately honest and
that given an incentive, we will be
honest in examinations? Is it too
much to assume that we are capable
of self-government, capable of living
up to our given word of honor, of
seeking out and punishing those who
manage to get in amongst us and know-
no honor? We believe that you earn-
estly desire to reduce cheating to a
minimum, to come closer to the stu-
dent and to raise the morale and out-
side standing of the College. The
proper Honor System will do these
things and more. It will necessitate
careful thought and action and it
rests entirely upon a sentiment which
will be created among ourselves and
a sympathetic co-operation which will
be extended by you. The "system"
must, moreover, be less than and sub-
servient to the man.
We firmly believe that an Honor
System can be instituted in the Engin-
eering College and that the growing
importance of ethics in the Engineer-
ing Profession makes it imperative
that we have one. We offer this, which
differs from the one in successful
operation at Yale mainly in the method
of election of the Honor Board or Dis-
cipline Committee which at Yale is
appointed by the Student Council. We
would like to see the articles, in the
same or in an amended form, voted
upon by the several classes. If there
is sufficient student support, a petition
to the faculty will receive favorable
consideration.
THE HONOR SYSTEM
Article I.
Sec. i. There shall be an Honor Sys-
tem in the College of Engineer-
ing.
Article II.
Sec. i. The Honor System shall
apply to all students of the
College of Engineering.
Sec. 2. The Honor System shall
apply to all examinations and
papers written in class.
Sec. 3. To each written paper the fol-
lowing signed pledge shall be
appended:
"I hereby pledge my word of
honor that I have neither asked
nor received aid during this
examination."
Sec. 4. No paper without signed
pledge shall be marked as cred-
ited work.
Article III.
Sec. 1. There shall be an undergrad-
uate Discipline Committee of
five (5) members to which all
criticisms and complaints may
be addressed.
Sec. 2. 1. The Committee shall be
composed of the two engineer-
ing Representatives in the Stu-
dent Council who have been
longest in office; of two men to
be elected from the incoming
Senior class at its first meeting
in the fall, and of one man to be
elected from the Junior class at
its first meeting in the fall.
2. The nominations shall be
by secret ballot. In the Senior
election the five men receiving
the highest number of votes on
the first ballot shall be the nom-
inees and shall be immediately
balloted upon in the class meet-
ing. The two men receiving


the highest number of votes
shall be elected.
In the Junior election, the
three men receiving the highest
number of votes on the first bal-
lot shall be the nominees and
shall be immediately balloted
upon in the class meeting. The
men receiving the highest num-
ber of votes shall be elected.
3. No student on the warned
or probation list, or with an out-
standing deficiency, shall be
eligible to a place on the com-
mittee.
4. Should it be decided to
inaugurate the Honor System
this semester, the Discipline
Committee shall be made up of
the two Engineering Student
Councilmen who have been
longest in office, of two men to
be elected from the Senior Class
and one man to be elected from
the Junior Class.
Sec. 3. 1. The officers of the Com-
mittee shall be a Chairman and
a Secretary who shall hold
office for one year.
2. The officers shall be elect-
ed during the first month of
the Fall Term by a majority of
the members of the Committee.
3. The Chairman shall pre-
side at all meetings. In case
of his absence, the Committee
shall elect a Chairman pro tern.
4. All meetings shall be
called by the Chairman or by a
written notice signed by two
members of the Committee.
Not less than one (1) day's no-
tice shall be given of the time
and place of said meetings.
5. The Secretary shall keep
the minutes, have custody of
the Committee records, and
conduct the correspondence.
Sec. 4. The punishment of any viola-
tion of the Honor System shall
be by and at the discretion of
the Committee (probably sub-
ject to Faculty endorsement).
Sec. 5. Any punishment inflicted by
this Committee shall be the
result of a four-fifths (4/5)
vote, except in the case of
expulsion, which shall be the
result of the unanimous vote of
the Committee.
Sec. 6. A quorum shall consist of
five (5) members.
Sec. 7. The required vacancies shall
be filled by special elections,
provided no quorum can be had.
Article IV.
Sec. 1. An accused shall be present
at the examination of all wit-
nesses.
Sec. 2. Witnesses shall be examined
separately when called before
the Committee.
Sec. 3. A member of the Committee
accused of the violation of the
Honor System shall cease to
act as a member of said Com-
mittee until his individual case
is determined.
Article V.
Sec. 1. The rules governing the Hon-
or System may be amended by
the three-fourths (3/4) vote of
the Student Body.
This system of procedure, which
aims to do away with all dishonest
methods in examinations and written
tests in the classroom, can go into
effect at the examinations to be held in
June, 1915, or be inoperative until
next semester.
The examiners at each examination
will see that the question papers are
distributed among the students; will
make such statements as seem called
for in the way of explanation of the


questions; and will then use their own
judgment in leaving the room. Prob-
ably the best way is for the examiner
to show his confidence in the intention
and ability of the students to live up
to the System by absenting himself
from the room after the examination
is under way. Doubtless, also, it
would be well for the examiner to
come into the room occasionally, in
order to answer any questions which
the students might desire to ask.
You will notice that under this sys-
tem, matters of discipline are dealt
with by a committee of students.
There is no written obligation for one
man to report upon another for that
has been the cause of most of the
failures of the Honor System. But
when the proper and healthy sentiment
has been aroused, we believe that stu-
dents will not hesitate to report cases
which come to their notice to this
committee elected by themselves where
they know offenders will receive a
fair and square deal without publicity.
It will develop that many cheaters will
themselves report their fault to the
Honor Board if warned by a class-
mate that they have been seen.
We mentioned before that Faculty
co-operation is necessary to the suc-
cessful operation of an Honor System.
Generally speaking, they must become
imbued with the same spirit which
actuates the students in demanding
the system. Specifically, they must
abolish the practice, now more or less
prevalent, of allowing class averages
to affect passing grades. A man must
know that his success or failure in
passing a course does not depend upon
how good or how poor other men in
the class are. It must be up to him
entirely. Optional questions in some
examinations will be of great assist-
ance. Furthermore, a right of appeal
from any examination and any grade
must be provided for. The Standing
Committee of the College or a special-
ly appointed committee can act as a
Court of Appeals and be made readily
accessible to students.
In conclusion we reiterate that the
success or failure of the system
depends upon the spirit with which
Students and Faculty enter into it. We
maintain that, even if cheating is not
wholly eliminated, if 95% or even
90% of the students get the right atti-
tude of mind toward cheating and
remain honest, the Honor System will
be a marked success. The students
who must cheat will become known to'
their classmates for what they are.
and sooner or later their cases will
come up to the Honor Board for dis-
cipline. The plans which have been
tried out in other Departments of the
University, and have failed, have dif-
fered materially from the one we offer.
Furthermore, we believe that a differ-
ent spirit prevails in the Engineering
College and we place much faith upon
that. We are firm believers in human
nature as a whole. Both the Faculty
and Students of the Enginering Col-
lege stand for the highest in civiliza-
tion and morality. There is no reason
in the world why we should not get
together.
* * * *
It is the purpose of those favoring
this plan to seek the first opportunity
of putting this question up before the
several classes. We hope that even-
class, Freshmen as well as Seniors,
will demand a fair and square trial of
the Honor System and that the Engi-
neering College will adopt it as a unit.
Whether it should be instituted this
semester or next, we leave as an open
question.


Action of the Regents
The Board of Regents, at their reg-
ular meeting on January 21st, took the
following action:
Resolved, That the communication
of Dean Cooley regarding the needs
of the Colleges of Engineering and
Architecture merits mature consider-
ation and early action.
It would seem as if the needs of the
College of Engineering with 1600 stu-
dents, one quarter of the total number
on the campus, were important enough
to warrant immediate consideration.
These needs, which are very real, are
discussed by a Technic staff man, Gor-
don D. Cooke, '16, in the article "Ex-
pansion and Extension of the College
of Engineering." Their importance
is evident when it is considered that
the quarters now occupied by the col-
lege were originally planned for 800
or 900 men. At the present rate of
growth there would be at least 1800
students before buildings could be
completed, even if they were begun at
once.
Apparently the urgent needs of the
College of Engineering seem not to be
fully appreciated by the Board of
Regents. While they have been kindly
disposed and have probably done all
that means at their command permit-
ted, it is evident that there is work
for the Engineering Alumni of the
University to do in helping the
Regents to understand the importance
of a technical training in the world
today. The Engineering Alumni have
been altogether too modest in making
known to the Regents their own wish-
es concerning the College of Engin-
eering and altogether too lethargic in
furnishing ideas and providing means
for the Regents to work with.
We offer a suggestion for future
consideration. Engineers have been
proverbially non-political. But might
it not be well for engineers to consider
some one of their own number who
has achieved prominence in the profes-
sion as a candidate for the Regency?
Of the eight men on the board, not
one is an engineer. We believe there
are Michigan men, engineers, avail-
able whose presence on the Board of
Regents would be of immense value to
the College of Engineering, to the
University and to the State.
Our Faculty.
A glance at a recently prepared list
of the colleges and universities attend-
ed by the men to whom we look for
instruction and guidance, convinces
one that the policy of Dean Cooley is
to have a faculty in which we cannot
be accused of in-breeding. He appar-
ently has remembered the old custom
among housewives, who, when their
flocks were deteriorating, swapped
roosters and has applied it here in the
Engineering College.
From data on file in Dean Cooley's
office, we learn that of the one hun-
dred forty two diplomas which mem-
bers of the Engineering Faculty dis-
play in dusty picture frames or keep
tucked away in various tin tubes about
the Campus, only fifty-seven are from
Michigan. Forty-four different schools
are represented in the list, of which
thirty-four are located in the United
States, five in Germany, three in Eng-
land and one each in Canada and
Switzerland. Only forty-nine of our
Faculty have been satisfied with one
degree, the rest having received any-
where from two to five. Twenty-seven
of those with more than one degree
have received their entire instruction
at one college. The remaining six-
teen have attended between two and
four institutions.
The principal thought which one


gets from these statistics is that we are
in contact with a broadly educated,
deep thinking lot of men of whom a
spirit of provincialism can by no
means become characteristic. The sta-
tistics are, however, necessarily incom-
plete in one particular. They do not
indicate the extent of the experience
of our Faculty with that best of all
teachers, the practical world. That
school which is known by several
names but which seems to us to be best
summed up in the title, the University
of Hard Knocks, gives no degrees
which can be listed. But the presence
on our Faculty of many men, who,
like Professors H. E. Riggs and John
R. Allen, have graduated from that
school and rightly earned the degree
"Master of Men," is the dominating
factor in the preeminence of Michigan.
Culture.
In all the courses offered in other
departments which in the College of
Engineering are known as cultural,
there were only, 143 elections by engin-
eers the first semester of this college
year. Of these 143, ten were art
courses elected by architects. Ninety-
nine were courses in Political Econ-
omy, so that a bare 34, 2% of the
Engineering College, could find time
to take a non-technical course.
We do not believe that the fault lies
in the students themselves. In fact,
we have often heard men say, and said
ourselves, "I wish I could take that
course" referring to History, Philoso-
phy, or the like, "but I can't get it in."
All of us realize that the opportunity
of broadening out which we have here,
will never come to us again. But we
have to stick to our slide rules because
of the lack of time.
The reason is that the work required
of students for graduation leaves but
a few hours open for electives and in
these hours, of which civils have thir-
teen, mechanicals thirteen, electricals
seventeen and chemicals thirteen, must
come the special technical courses
along the line of work a man expects
to be in after graduation.
For the man who wants an engineer-
ing degree in four years, there seems
no relief. Rather of late years, the
tendency has been to increase the
hours of required work. When two
hours were recently taken off the
elective list of one department, we
heard a Professor exclaim, "Why,
some of our men have so little to do
that they go over and take Creative
Listening." We have heard that Cre-
ative Listening was a pretty good
course. If it fulfills its object and
increases one's appreciation of good
music, it certainly is worth while, even
to an engineer.
What is the remedy then. Probably
it lies in the combined Literary-En-
gineering courses. Many will take
advantage of the opportunity now
offered of obtaining an A.B. at Albion
and a B. S. in the College of Engineer-
ing at Michigan in five years. Plans
for such a combined course with our
own Literary College were ratified
by the Engineering Faculty some years
ago. They were rejected by the Liter-
ary Faculty but the set back is only
temporary. Sooner or later, A.B. and
B.S. degrees will be given for five
years work at Michigan. Tentative
arrangements with other colleges in
the state will soon be announced. The
day of the Lit.-Engineer has come.
Utilization of Waste Pyrites
Cinders.
Nearly 800,000 tons of iron ore,
high in iron content and convenient to
market, are wasted every year because
they contain too much sulphur to be
profitably utilized by the iron manu-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
facturers. These residues result from
the calcination of pyrites by the sul-
phuric acid manufacturer and contain
as much as two percent of sulphur.
Various methods have been proposed
to eliminate this sulphur by an addi-
tional roasting process but the expense
of this second operation raises the cost
of the finished products so that the
method has not found wide adoption.
Mr. W. W. Taylor, '93, describes in
this issue how he erected a blast fur-
nace and operated it in such a manner
as to permit him to use these undesir-
able pyrites cinders without further
treatment. It is noteworthy metallurg-
ical achievement.
Student Branches.
In another part of this issue appears
an announcement of a recently estab-
lished student membership in the
American Chemical Society. It would
seem that the plan of the Society
could be improved upon considerably,
for we are unable to find in the new
plan much of an inducement for a stu-
dent to subscribe.
The American Society of Mechani-
cal Engineers and The American In-
stitute of Electrical Engineers offer
student memberships for three dollars
in exchange for which the student
receives all the publications of the
society and enjoys all privileges except
the right of voting. The Chemical
Society offers a student membership
for six dollars which carries with it
the privilege of voting but gives only
one of the three publications of the
society. It also offers to students a
subscription to one of two of its pub-
lications at one half the regular rate
without any privileges of the society.
Inasmuch as they demand that a
student member become a full member
Jan. 1st following graduation, we
believe that thev should amend their
ruling to some extent. Would it not
be possible for them to offer a student
membership at five or six dollars
which would give a subscription to all
three of the publications but withhold
the voting privilege? The average
undergraduate cares nothing for the
voting privilege but is very much inter-
ested in the publications as they con-
tain all of the latest news of his chosen
profession. Many students will prob-
ably avail themselves of the present
offer but we believe that many more
would if the policy were changed
somewhat as we have suggested.
Initiative.
Prof. Ware, in speaking to a junior
chemical engineer the other day, said,
'"You will find, when you get out, that
it will not be the information you have
acquired that will be of help to you,
so much as the ability you will have
developed to apply yourself to new
problems." Here in a nutshell are, we
think, the greatest advantage and the
greatest fault in modern engineering
education. Advantage in that we all
do acquire, to some extent, this ability
to tackle new problems, to apply gen-
eral knowledge to specific cases. The
fault is that few of us acauire the abil-
ity to the extent which is to be desired.
We do not get it until after hard
years of experience. Opportunity for
original work, organization and ad-
ministration is not afforded the engin-
eering graduate until he has attained
a position of responsibility. Hence it
is usually a number of years before
he has the well developed bump of
initiative which he should have, if pos-
sible, when he leaves college. Unfor-
tunately, our curricula do not include
courses in "initiative." Such courses
are, obviously, impossible. Whenever
work is prepared for a man, when
what he is to do and what he is to


know are laid out for him, he does
"hack-work." Not until he does work
of his own choice, of his own concep-
tion, by his own will, is he doing work
that will develop his initiative. Where
is such opportunity to be found? In
the various fields of student endeavor
known as college activities.
What Are You Doing?
In the Departmental Notes of every
issue of the Technic you will find
something of what engineers are
doing on the campus. It is well
worth your reading, to know that
engineering students, in spite of the
strenuous inroads of the Faculty upon
their spare time, are taking their full
share and more in the activities that
distinguish a college from a library.
Is your name mentioned? If not, is
there any definite prospect that it ever
will be mentioned there? In short,
what are you doing?
Faculty Subscriptions.
At the close of exams a few weeks
ago, just when our marks were coming
in and we were not in the best of
humor, we chanced to look at the cir-
culation manager's card index of sub-
scribers. Then we phoned for that
overworked individual and demanded
to know where he kept the cards of
our faculty subscribers. He walked
to the file, found four cards and hand-
ed them over. Those four men
received the Technic because they
paid for it and they paid for it because
they appreciated the worth of the
Technic and the work some of us are.
putting into it.
What about the rest of the 82 mem-
bers of the Engineering Faculty? Six
are members (two honorary) of the
Engineering Society which publishes
the Technic. But 75 faculty men do
not get the Technic unless they buy
single copies at our corridor sales.
We don't blame you now. We did
at the time because our marks were
not so very high and it was whispered
that we had too many outside inter-
ests. But we know that you appreci-
ate the Technic. In spite of our last
semester's grades, we believe that you
appreciate our efforts in its behalf.
We believe, further, that the only rea-
son why The Technic hasn't been
aided with more of your dollars is that
said dollars have never been gone
after.
Believing, therefore that the maga-
zine we are publishing is worth a dol-
lar to anybody, and that, in particular,
it is worth a dollar to members of
the Engineering Faculty, we are going
after those dollars. Beginning with
our May issue, we will establish
a campus delivery system where-
by you will receive your Tech-
nic in your office the morning it
is off the press. Valuable time will be
saved if subscriptions are left in our
office. Those that are not will be
sought out immediately. Next issue
we will publish a list of our faculty
subscribers or possibly it will be a list
of faculty non-subscribers. We'd hate
to do it but we don't want you to miss
getting the Technic.
Foreword.
With a full realization of our
responsibilities, with an earnest desire
and definite purpose to make the Mich-
igan Technic the publication which it
can and should be, and with no
thought of failure in our minds, we
offer this, the first number of volume
XXVIII of the Michigan Technic in
the 28th year of its life.
The Technic has had a chequered
career and many harsh things have
been said, more or less deservedly,
about it. That there is a place in the
Engineering Department for the Tech-
nic, is not to be denied. That it is


THE MICHIGAN TECIINIC
possible to put it on a permanent pay-
ing basis is our sincere belief. With
a constantly changing student publish-
ing staff, it is necessary that there be
permanent faculty control and over-
sight. This control and oversight can
be very complete and yet at the same
time be very acceptable to the student
management. We are very grateful to
Dean Cooley and to the Technic Fac-
ulty Board for the way in which they
have responded to the needs of the
Technic and we hope soon to have a
successful plan in operation.
At this time we want to mention
the debt of gratitude which Technic
supporters owe to Oliver W. Hall and
Wm. B. Thompson, who graduate this
year. They took charge of the Tech-
nic when it was down and nearly out.
The issues which they put out in spite
of the obstacles in their way, have
made it comparatively easy for us to
go on.
Technic Ideals.
We are trying to give to alumni and
students authoritative and useful arti-
cles on technical subjects. We are
also trying to publish whatever news
of the Engineering College, its work,
and its graduates, will be of interest to
alumni and students. Particularly for
students, we are trying to give pub-
licity to the out-of-class activities in
which engineering students partici-
pate. If we succeed in arousing inter-
est where interest was not, in instilling
enthusiasm where lassitude was, if we
induce any student to "get out" for
something that will develop his initia-
tive and make him a better engineer,
we believe we are fulfilling one of the
greatest functions of a college publi-
cation.
"Every Issue Better Than the
Last."
You may have seen this boast on the
bulletin boards when this issue of the
TECHNIC was put on sale. It isn't
exactly a boast—it's a sort of motto.
We want in each issue to present arti-
cles just a little better, just a little
more carefully chosen, so as to interest
the greatest possible number of our
readers. We want to give our readers
the latest and most interesting news of
the College. Above all we want the
TECHNIC to be representative of the
Engineering College of the Univer-
sity of Michigan—representative of
the work of the Faculty and Graduates
and of their opinions and wishes; rep-
resentative of student activities and
student sentiment.
May Issue.
We want to say a word about the
May Issue. It will be the best Technic
ever put out and that's going some,
after this issue.
We can't tell you everything that
will be in it now, but we promise an
article by Professor David Friday. It
will probably deal with the relation
between economics and engineering
and whatever it deals with it will be
worth while. W. C. Smith, '05, Trans-
former Engineer with the General
Electric Company and one of the fore-
most authorities on transformers in
the country is writing us an article
"Some Recent Developments in Trans-
formers." Mr. Herschfeld, Construc-
tion Engineer with the Edison Illum-
inating Company, Detroit, will con-
tribute an article on the Conners
Creek Power Plant. The Conners
Creek Plant is the most modern and
complete generating station in the
country and, as such, is receiving the
attention of engineers the world over.
We expect to have the first authora-
tive account of it.
Is tint enough to make you want the
May Technic? We could go on and
mention some other features but we
think those names we have mentioned
are quite sufficient.


Volume XXVIII

PUBLISHED BY THE
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN ENGINEERING SOCIETY
EXPANSION AND EXTENSION OF THE COL*
LEGE OF ENGINEERING
The University of Michigan has
been conspicuous for several years as
one of the foremost institutions fur-
nishing technical instruction of a high
order to "the constantly increasing
number of young men attracted to
engineering as a profession. The
excellence of the instruction afforded,
the democratic spirit of the student
body, and the low cost of tuition as
compared with that at any other first
class schools, has proved especially
attractive to men of moderate circum-
stances who must often work their
way through school or obtain their
education at the cost of great personal
sacrifice. To such men Michigan pre-
sents unrivalled advantages.
The maintenance of Michigan as an
engineering school of high standing
for the especial training of this large
class of young men throughout the
country, is at present jeopardized by
the fact that the popularity of the
school has outdistanced its resources.
The Colleges of Engineering and
Architecture at Michigan are face to
face with a situation so serious that it
deserves careful consideration.
The growth of the colleges, the
available floor space and the ratio of
floor space to students is graphically
illustrated by the accompanying chart.
It will be noted that while the attend-
ance has been increasing, the ratio of
floor space to student has been steadily
decreasing.
This condition would be bad enough
if all other conditions had remained
the same, but it becomes alarming in
view of the changed methods of tech-
nical instruction. Every year sees an
increased appreciation of the value to
the enginering student of laboratory
wprk,—and by laboratory work we
mean work in the shops, in the draw-
ing room, in the laboratories, and in
the field. Every year sees the incor-
poration of more and more of such
work in the curricula of engineering
schools. This work requires for each
student space many times greater than
that required by the teaching in the
classroom. And yet there is in the
Engineering College today actually-
less floor space per student than in
1898 when technical instruction was
almost entirely a matter of the class-
room. The floor space per student is
the same now as in 1904 when the con-
gested conditions led the Regents to
consider extension absolutely impera-
tive and when the main part of the
Xew Engineering Building was built.


THE MICHIGAN TUCHNIC
In some Departments of the College
of Engineering there is especial need
of room for instruction. In many
cases there are, besides, exceptional
opportunities for the development of
research work and of increasing the
usefulness of the Engineering College
to the profession and to the State.
Some of these special needs and oppor-
tunities are worthy of specific mention.
Mechanical Laboratories.
The work in the Mechanical Labor-
atories is being carried on under lim-
itations of space and apparatus which
tend to lower the otherwise excellent
character of the work. Every engine
in the Steam Laboratory is at least
twenty-five years old, but even if new
ones were to be had, there is no room
for them. A fine piece of pumping
machinery recently offered by the Edi-
son Company will have to be housed in
a shed in the yard if accepted. A
few pieces of apparatus are being
used for experimental work in Heating
and Ventilation but there is no labora-
tory. The one which was expected was
turned over to the Forestry Depart-
ment and many experiments along this
line had to be discontinued. The Auto-
mobile Laboratory, although it is the
best equipped of all the Mechanical
Laboratories, has very little space and
that poorly arranged. There are, at
present, two engines which the lack of
floor space prohibits setting up and
there are several more coining.
Engineering Snors.
In the Engineering Shops, perhaps
more than in any other place, immedi-
ate relief from the congestion is nec-
essary and modern machines must be
provided. Since moving into the
shops in 1895 there have been several
additions,—the last one dating back
fourteen years. The enlargement at
this time was planned for the expected
increase in instruction of the next four
years. Since that time the enrollment
has increased 350% and this without
an additional square foot of space.
The last machine of any. importance
that has been purchased was put in
five years ago. With this single excep-
tion there have been no important
additions to the equipment for ten or
twelve years. With the modern devel-
opment of shop work tending toward
more highly technical instruction, it is
absolutely necessary to remedy this
condition of obsolescence. There is
now being offered a course in Scien-
tific Shop Management. When Pro-
fessor Bursley returns it is intended to
offer a course in Industrial Engineer-
ing which would include the design,
construction, organization and man-
agement of shops. For these courses,
and others to be developed, a modern
up-to-date shop is imperative.
Electrical Laboratories.
The second year men enrolled in the
electrical engineering work number 81,
an increase of 100 percent over the
enrollment of two years ago. Next
year the enrollment will be such that
the department will be severely
pressed for laboratory space. An
addition to the teaching staff will be
required which necessitates more office
room and this space is not to be had.
Laboratory space is especially needed
for a high-tension room which should
be separate from the general labora-
tory, as it is not safe to have high ten-
sion apparatus in a general laboratory.
In the illumination laboratory, the
space available is suitable for work on
single lamps only. Experimental work
on light distribution from large
sources is absolutely impossible. When
one considers the excellent showing
made by the photometry department at

THE MICHIGAN TECIINIC
the last engineering exhibit it is great-
ly to be regretted that this kind of
work is limited by lack of laboratory
space.
Chemical Engineering.
Since the completion of the Chemis-
try Building five years ago, teaching
work has increased in chemical engin-
eering 120%. There has been and is
at present a growing demand for
instruction and experimentation along
advanced special lines. Very import-
ant research has been carried out in
Portland cements and beet sugar and
Michigan graduates have played a
creditable part in the development of
these industries. The present demand
is for investigation in paper-making
processes and experimentations in cer-
amics. There is a good possibility of
the paper makers of the state establish-
ing a technical fellowship at the Uni-
versity of Michigan if it is possible to
install paper-making machinery which
they will donate. There can be no
broader field or more actual need for
investigation than in concrete, cements
and bricks, which would be included in
the ceramics course. There is at pres-
ent, however, no laboratory room for
either the paper machinery or the
course in ceramics. Additional space
for chemical engineering could only be
obtained by an addition to the Chemis-
try Building or assignment of space in
another building.
Civil Engineering.
The Civil Engineering enrollment
at Michigan in 1914-15 is in excess
of that at Mass. Institute of Technol-
ogy*, Wisconsin, Illinois, Purdue, Ohio
State and other institutions. Cornell
is the only other school in the United
States with a larger enrollment. In
square feet per student, on any basis,
our quarters are exceeded—classroom,
drawing room and laboratory—by
every one of these schools and by a
number of others. The Civil Engin-
eering department has no lecture or
recitation room available for structur-
al, sanitary, hydraulic, highway or rail-
road engineering in which heavy mod-
els can be kept and work scheduled as
is done by the Mechanicals, Electricals
and Marines. Drawing room space is
utterly inadequate, even when half the
work is scheduled in the morning.
Civil engineering enrollment in the
Graduate School is increasing rapidly,
yet there is not a single square foot of
room available in the New Engineer-
ing Building for research work in
hydraulic, structural or railway engin-
eering.
Hydraulic Laboratory.
No branch of engineering is more
dependent upon laboratory work than
hydraulics for, since our formulae in
hydraulics are principally empirical,
research work must be along experi-
mental lines. With the present labor-
atory facilities or rather lack of facili-
ties, it is impossible to outline a satis-
factory- schedule for graduate stu-
dents. This is the more regretable
since the engineering profession is
today in great need of experimental
hydraulic data. All existing formulae
have been derived by extending results
obtained with small volumes of water,
and many inaccuracies and inconsist-
encies are present in the formulae thus
obtained. No facilities are at present
available in any laboratory for carry-
ing on experiments on the large scale
needed. Cornell, Wisconsin and Wor-
cester Polytechnic Institute have the
best facilities in the country but their
usefulness is limited by insufficient
head, water supply or equipment.
The Eastern Michigan Edison Com-
pany has given the University permis-


«5
sion to construct a laboratory at the
west end of the Barton Dam. The con-
cessions made are most liberal and
assure us of the friendly co-operation
of the Eastern Michigan Edison Com-
pany. Their monetary value exceeds
$100,000. They are in brief as fol-
lows:
(1) A long time lease for a nomin-
al consideration, of such lands as will
be necessary for the construction of
the laboratory.
(2) The privilege of shutting
down the Barton plant, if necessary,
during construction.
(3) The privilege of using, with-
out cost, all waste waters.
(4) Agreement of rate to be
charged for all waters used, other than
waste water.
The State of Michigan is especially
interested in hydraulic matters be-
cause of its extensive water power
resources. Any data tending to a bet-
ter knowledge of the laws of hydrau-
lics will add to the economic value of
these streams, should they be devel-
oped. A laboratory built here at
Michigan with the assistance of the
Edison Company would prove a great
asset to the University and State and
would be unexcelled in the country.
Surveying Building.
The present building for Surveying
was built and used first as a hospital
in 1875. It was cheaply and flimsily
built so that after a few years of use
it could be burned down to destroy
germ life. After 20 years, (1895), it
was turned over to the College of
Dental Surgery who vacated to the
Engineering College, the present
Old Engineering Building. After the
Dental College had used it for 13 years
it was moved to its present location
(1908) where it has since been used
for Surveying. The building is liter-
ally falling down. Only the other day
the floor had to be boosted back into
place and propped. The fire risk is
high—for more than $30,000 worth of
instruments are in jeopardy. Many of
these instruments are rare, and could
not be replaced,—for instance the orig-
inal solar compass of Burt. The build-
ing is a rambling old structure not fit
for classroom, drawing room or lab-
oratory work. There is no opportuni-
ty for research work or for testing a
piece of apparatus. The dark room
will accommodate only 3 or 4 while
there are 30 to 50 students taking the
course in engineering photography.
There are no vaults for storing valu-
able maps and drawings. The teach-
ing staff and students suffer from the
cold—a condition which can not be
remedied in the present structure.
And this department, like the Shops,
continues to surprise us by doing the
work it does in the face of these
almost impossible conditions.
To summarize very briefly. The
present congestion in the College of
Engineering of the University of
Michigan and the unexcelled oppor-
tunities for increased service to the
state and nation make imperative an
immediate extension of the present
plant and an adequate enlargement of
equipment. The Regents are, doubt-
less, doing the best they can to meet
the urgent demands which come to
them from all parts of the campus.
These demands are of two distinct
natures: first, those things absolutely
necessary to take care of present
branches of instruction which have
clearly outgrown all room and facilities,
and, second, those branches of instruc-
tion which must be provided for the
proposed extension of the University.
Both are imperative but common sense


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
would make it evident that the first, at
least, must be taken care of if the Uni-
versity is to maintain its past standard
of efficiency.
With the record made and the repu-
tation established by the College of
Engineering since its separation from
the College of Literature, Science and
the Arts in 1895, there can be no doubt,
even in the mind of the layman, that
the College of Engineering is deserv-
ing in the highest degree of more ade-
quate facilities. This is necessary not
merely to extend but to maintain its
high reputation. One plan of exten-
sion is shown in Plan A, the frontis-
piece of this issue of the Technic.
Several other plans have been pro-
posed. Which of these particular
plans is adopted is comparatively a
minor matter. The fact remains that
some adequate plan should be adopted
and work started as soon as possible.
Even if building operations are begun
at once the conditions will have passed
the present serious stage and will have
become practically impossible before
additional room can be made available.


ENGINEERING WORK
H. H. ESSELSTYN
One of the matters of great import-
ance in construction work is the prop-
er sequence of- plans, material ordered
and delivered on the job, and work
started and completed. As each step
is necessary to properly pave the way
for the next, progress schedules of
some kind should be used to cover and
represent them all systematically.
Progress charts are generally used
to maintain a continuous record of the
work as it is done, and the chart which
is here described—although on the cut
entitled "Progress Chart"—is in real-
ity a Progress Schedule, wherein is
designated the desired date for
finished plans, material ordered, start-
ing work in the field, and completing
work in the field. The record of these
performances as they are actually car-
ried out forms the progress chart.
Progress charts are made in several
ways. In some cases areas represent-
ing the different parts of the work are
plotted on a large sheet and main-
tained at the office in the field, and
each day the work performed on any
portion is entered up on the chart by
means of color or cross-hatching.
Curves may also be used to indicate
the progress of the work.
The ordinary progress chart records
the result of work done but does not
give sufficient warning of efforts to be
made so as to take care of work which
must be done in the near future.
The chart which is here described
was designed by the writer to be used
in connection with the Connors Creek
Power Plant of The Edison Illuminat-
ing Company, of Detroit, Michigan,
and you will note that, while it records
the progress of work, it also records
the Progress of the Plans; the Per-
centage of Material Ordered; states
the date on which the plans must be
finished; date to order material (which
is the completion date of the plans);
date to start the work in the field, and
date to finish same; whereby the entire
undertaking will be completed at the
desired time.
In regard to the layout of the Prog-
ress Schedule, the first matter to be
decided is the required date on which
the building is to be occupied, or the
plant started up, and—in the case of a
power plant—it is the date when the
main generating unit will be put in
operation. After this date is decided
upon, one must work back and fill in
the various efforts to be performed,
beginning at the time when the chart
is first laid out.
Great care must be taken and con-
siderable study made on the required
time for each effort, as much as pos-
sible arranging them in proper
sequence so that the work which will
automatically follow the previous
work will be shown on the schedule
the same as it will be found to work
out in the field.
The Substructure naturally begins
with the excavation work and is then
followed by the foundation. The
Superstructure would normally be
started by the erection of the steel, and
the brickwork then erected, after
which the various portions of work
to make the complete superstructure
are installed. In the Boiler Room
Equipment, the boilers are naturally
first erected and after them the brick


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
settings for the boilers. Then follows
the ash hoppers, stokers, blowers, air
ducts, etc. The stacks are included
under Boiler Equipment and, while
they rest on the structural steel of the
building, they are in reality a part of
the Boiler Equipment. The Main Gen-
crating Units form another section;
beginning with the erection of the tur-
bines, installation of condensers, cir-
culating pumps, dry vacuum pumps,
etc. follow in natural order. In the
Piping Work, the main and auxiliary
steam pipes are considered of prime
importance, as they carry the energy
to operate the different units. Then
follows the exhaust piping, drip
piping, boiler feed, blow-off, etc.
In the General Plant Equipment,
there is practically no sequence of
importance except to see that all items
are properly included and, as much as
possible, incorporated on the progress
schedule in order, if they relate one to
the other.
The matter of sequence must be
decided independently for each job, as
power houses have been built where
the boilers were erected under the
trees before the building was started.
The columns which show the Fin-
ished Plans, Starting Work in the
Field and Completing Work in the
Field, have each a sub-column show-
ing the Estimated and the Actual
dates. This is for the purpose of
keeping a record as to whether the
work is up to schedule or behind it,
and, if behind the schedule, give the
information that it is necessary to put
forth more strenuous efforts to make
up the lost time. Is is often possible
to so push the work that lost time can
be recovered by putting on several
gangs doing the same work, or putting
on three 8-hour gangs, so that the
work will continue 24 hours a day.
This was done several times on the
Connors Creek Power House, and
found to work out very well not only
in regard to getting the work done,
but as a matter of economy. There
are various kinds of work which can
be done at night without any increased
cost except that of lighting. Also, the
competition between gangs employed
on the same work generally results in
a benefit to the job.
We had a case of pile driving gangs
which would compete with each other
as to the number of piles driven in 10
hours—there being two 10-hour gangs.
They were driving from 40 to 50 piles
in 10 hours when one gang started to
speed up. The result was that they
increased the number of piles driven in
10 hours up to 66, 76, and finally, 81.
Each item on the progress schedule
is given a number, which is used for
identification, and referred to in vari-
ous records of progress, as will be
later described.
"W. O. No."heading the column
adjacent to the Item, refers to work
order number, which gives the number
of work order under which the work
is being done. The spaces for cross-
hatching, entitled "The Progress of
Plans," Percentage of Material
Ordered" and "Progress of Work in
the Field" are divided into 10 spaces,
the total length indicating 100% or
the complete work, and, as the work is
done, that portion of the work com-
pleted is cross-hatched, so that a
glance at the progress chart will show
the percentage of work done on plans,
or matrial ordered, or the actual work
done in the field.
The progress chart should be put
into the hands of an engineer whose
duty it is to keep it up-to-date and see
that the percentages of the work in
each section are cross-hatched each

week. Blue-prints are made from the
chart each week, also the engineer in
charge of the progress chart writes
a criticism on each part of the work,
calling attention to the parts which are
behind the schedule. In order that the
criticisms may be honest and not
biased, the engineer is not kept
advised as to any matters which may
temporarily hold up parts of the work,
but his criticism comes through as if
there were no reasons for any part of
the work being retarded. Copies
of the blue-printed chart and also
the typed criticism are sent each
week to all interested parties, whereby
they will be advised as to the progress
of all parts of the work at that time.
The foregoing is a description of
one type of progress schedule, or
chart, which can be changed to cover
the needs of special undertakings; or
it can be simplified for smaller work;
but no construction work should be
done without a progress schedule as it
is sure to prove its worth many times,
acting as a printed conscience which—
when once given life—acts as a contin-
uous reminder that things must be
done today to care for the things of
tomorrow.
Permission was obtained from the
writer to use this type of progress
schedule on the new public library at
Cleveland, Ohio.


STEAM DELIVERED BY A NOZZLE
J. E. EMSWILER
Accurate empirical equations for
the calculation of the amount of steam
which will be delivered by a nozzle,
have been developed and verified for
saturated and superheated steam.
The best known of these Is Napier's
Rule
ap
W = — for saturated steam.
70
where
ff/=\vt. of steam discharged per second.
a = area of throat of nozzle in sq. in.
/&gt; = initial pressure in pds. per sq. in. abs.
Another formula is that of Gros-
hof's given in simpler form by Moyer
in his "Steam Turbines," as below;
ap"
IV =
60
The conditions under which the
above formulas are applicable must
not be lost sight of. They are:
Saturated steam entering the nozzle.
Back pressure less than .58 of the
initial pressure.
Well rounded entrance in the nozzle.
When these conditions apply, Nap-
ier's Rule will give results within
about 2%. The latter of the above
equations will give results correct
within 1% for all ordinary pressures.

H. Fessenden in Mich. Technic. (Jan.
1912.)
When steam is superheated, the
equations may be modified by the fac-
tor i/(i-)-.ooo65D), where D = the
number of degrees superheat Fahr.
(See Moyer's St. Turbines.) The
above two equations would then
become
W =

and

'60(1 + .00065.D)
These equations have also been veri-
fied and proved to be quite accurate.
For calculating the amount deliv-
ered when the steam is initially wet,,
no very satisfactory factor has here-
tofore been available. During the
year 1913, some experiments were
conducted in the Mechanical Labora-
tory of the University of Michigan,
under the direction of the writer, by
Messrs. C. E. Wolfstyn and E. J.
Bennett, senior students in Mechani-
cal Engineering.
Previous to this time, a considerable
amount of work had to be done in
developing the apparatus. The mois-
ture was produced in the steam by cir-
culating water thru a pipe within the
steam pipe. The steam was compelled
to pass thru the annular space, and the
moisture was formed by its own con-
densation. This was done in a verti-
cal line. A short distance below this
condenser, was placed a large orifice
which insured all the moisture being
directed to the center of the pipe, and
away from the walls,,where it tends to
collect. The nozzle on which the
tests were made, was located about
one foot below the large orifice. After
the steam had passed thru the nozzle,
its quality was ascertained by means
of a separator. The entire amount
of steam thus furnished the sample for
obtaining the quality. The remainder

■of the steam, freed from its moisture,
was condensed in a surface condenser,
and weighed.
All the tests were made at the one
pressure of about 30 pds. gage, and on
the one nozzle which was approxi-
mately 3/8" diameter at the throat.
The results obtained by these tests
are plotted in Fig. 1. The curve
shows how the flow thru this nozzle
was affected by moisture in the steam,
all other conditions being constant.
While the individual points deviate
considerably from the curve, still the
direction of the curve is quite well
defined.
In Fig. 2, on the left hand of the
sheet, the curve of Fig. 1 has been
reproduced. On the right hand side
of the sheet, the abscissas are contin-
ued as qualities over 100%, which, of
■course means superheat. Each per-
cent quality corresponds to about
183^ degrees of superheat. The ordin-
ates are the same as for the curve on
the left. On this right side, has been
plotted the curve of superheat correc-
tions. That is, the values of the
expression i/(i-)-.ooo65D), have been
calculated for various degrees of sup-
erheat (D); then these values have
been plotted on the respective quality
ordinates corresponding to D. The
curves of course join at the 100%
quality line.
The instructive thing about the two
curves is that they are practically con-
tinuations of one another. This is per-
haps to be expected, and leads to the
conclusion that the correction factor
for wet steam ought to be of the same
form as that for superheat, and, in
fact, should contain the same con-
stant.

Considering the fact that each 18.50
superheat is the equivalent of 1% in
quality, the factor for superheated
steam, may be written i/(i-|-.oi2q,),
where q = the number of percent dif-
ference 'between the actual quality
and 100%. In the case of wet steam,
the difference is the percent moisture,
which may be represented by m.
The factor for wet steam is then
1/1—.012m.
Values of this factor have been cal-
culated for different values of m, and
are represented by the broken curve
in the moisture region of Fig. 1. Its
agreement with the curve of actual

gence lying within il/i% for moistures
as high as 20%.

"WHOOPS-ER-UP"
To quote from the Chicago Herald's
"Bab ballad" the morning after the
. annual dinner of the Chicago-Michi-
gan Engineers' Club, which was held
at the New Morrison Hotel, Jan. 29, is
but to confirm our own silent opinion
and therefore here's a bit of the bab:
"It anyone thinks that a banquet of men—
'Grads of the yellow and blue—
Is a tame sort of "feed" with no
Whoop-er-up then
They don't know the rollicking crew.
"For the engineer men of the Michigan
School
Are live wires for sure, and they make it a
rule
To smite Old Dull Care as smiteth the mule
And to quaff to their fullest Joy's brew.
"Heading the list was Dean Cooley of fame;
Chief guest of honor was he;
Man of great wisdom and near-Irish name,
Subject of song rife with glee,
'Rah-rahs' some nine he received when he
rose
Simply because he's a good scout and knows
The right thing to say, how his eloquence
flows—
Just like a river to sea!
Emanuel Anderson, 99E, president,
acted as toastmaster and the following
faculty men were the guests of honor:
Dean M. E. Cooley, Professors John
R. Allen, H. C. Sadler, A. H. While
and G. W. Patterson. Among the
stunts of the evening were the apprais-
al of a box of cigars whose property
value was found to be 97 cents and
overhead charges $4.07. James R.
Bibbens, '99E, Bion J. Arnold's right
hand man, appeared on behalf of the
club and Morton R. Hunter, '13E,
Asst. western editor, Engineering Rec-
ord, was the engineer in charge of the
appraisal. The report occupied two
large volumes, but as the value was-
found as of June 30 instead of Jan. 1,
1914, the appraisal was ordered con-
tinued, until it was found that the
cost would reach $30,000, and as the
cigars had been smoked the case was
dropped.
"Prof." Sadler shocked the "dutch"
but pleased the crowd with a few
English ditties on the piano. "John
R." told the secrets of his Turkish
harem and other state secrets and the
"bunch" sang its "A Long Way to
Constantinople." Professors A. H.
White and "George Wash." Patterson
told us what was doing at A Square
and the king of them all, Dean Cooley,
in his own charming way pointed out
the possibilities open to us in boosting
our alma mater. "Jim" Hatch '92E
wrote a number of lyrics for the spec-
ial songs and his side-kick, Ike Stern,
'95E, one of the club's most ardent
boosters and former chief bridge
engineer of the C. &amp; N. W. R. R.,
aided in the cigar appraisal.
About 125 were present. Officers
for the ensuing year were elected as
follows: Howard M. Cox, '95E, presi-
dent; James R. Bibbens, '95E, vice
president; "Polly" Dratz, '00E, secre-
tary.
Here are two of the songs sung at
the banquet.
THE FAKELTY ENGINEERS
Now hist says Mr. Dooley to Mr. Hennesy
I've just found out a lot about
Me arly ancistry;
And miny of me kinfolks are min of high

Though now fer shame they spell their name
A trifel differently.

"How came the C
Insted of D,
I ask," says Mr. Dooley
"However came me good
Me good old name
Corrupted into Cooley?"
And ther are minny others I till ye Hennessy
Who now disclaim ther ancient name
In that same fackelty;
Yer mind the name McGriggsby sure who
raised the shart-horned pigs,
They've used the shears and trimmed its
ears till now its only Riggs.
Theyv'e spoiled the name
Long known to fame,
They changed the D in Dooley
It is a fraud
On the old sod,
All brought about by Cooley.
And yer own name I found all maimed, I
till ye Hennessy,
By that tall guy that views the sky they call
Astronomy.
Theyv'e cut the heart out of the name and
fixed it all up fussy,
They cut it twice and made a splice and now
they call it Hussy.
They've spoiled the name
Long known to fame,
And changed the D in Dooley,
They've cut in three

All on account of Cooley.
And Patrick Sloan and John Malone who
crossed from Cork wid me,
Have now two edicated sons in that fine

But what yer think ther names look like
that he may run who reads?
As Pat-terson and John-ston now, just like
a pair of Sweeds.
They've spoiled the name
Long known to fame
And changed the D in Dooley,
And now indeed
They'd be a Sweed
To emulate Mott Cooley.
Herb. Sadler drapped the Irish brogue into

And Anderson says he's the one that set

And Bailey wears a railroad tie pinned with

Now how is that for a cravat to bolster up

To make a green
Of emerald sheen
To shame the like of Cooley."

With Apologies to
IT'S A LONG WAY TO TIPPERARY
A letter came the other day, to whom we
will not tell;
We'll call his name John Doe for short,
which answers very well.
It said, "When are you coming back, we all
do miss you so?
Your smile was like a sunbeam, your voice
was soft and low."
Chorus
It's a long way to Constantinople,
It's a long way to go,
It's a long way to Constantinople,
But -we all do miss you so;
Good-bye till we see you,
Farewell, Johnnie dear,
It's a long, long way to Constantinople,
But we're all right here.
Then Johnnie Doe he grinned a grin as you
may well suspect,
And said, "Not on your tintype," or words
to that effect.
"Old Turkey has no charms for me when
peace is on the blink,
So if they think I'm coming they've got
another think.
Chorus
It's a long way to Constantinople,
It's a long way to go,
It's a long way to Constantinople,
And your siren song don't go.
Good-bye, dear old Sultan,
Farewell, Sultanette (plural);
It's a long, long way to Constantinople,
But I'm not going yet.


THE MODERN AUTOMOBILE
PROF. B. F. BAILEY
Practically all the lighting and start-
ing outfits on the market comprise a
storage battery, a dynamo or genera-
tor, a motor, a cut-out and a regulator.
In some cases two or more of these
units may be combined into one, and
in certain outfits the cut-out and reg-
ulator may be omitted. The battery is
necessary to supply power for crank-
ing the engine and for the lights when
the engine, and consequently the dyna-
mo, is not in motion. The dynamo
is required to recharge the battery and
the motor is necessary to crank the
engine. The cut-out is an apparatus
which connects the generator to the
battery when the voltage of the for-
mer is sufficient to charge the battery.
Some form of regulation is necessary
to keep the output of the dynamo with-
in proper limits. In some cases the
regulation is inherent in the windings
of the dynamo, and no external regu-
lator is necessary.
The voltage to be used in lighting
is one of the most important consider-
ations. At the present time most auto-
mobile lamps are operated either at
six or twelve volts. It is necessary
that this voltage be low in order that
the filament may be short and thick
and hence well able to withstand vibra-
tion. Until a short time ago practical-
ly all lamps were operated at six volts,
but at the present time twelve volt
lamps which are practically equal to
the six volt lamps are being produced
and are widely used. Lamps of even
greater voltage have been manufac-
tured and can be obtained, but the two
voltages mentioned are considered
standard.
If we consider only the lighting, the
six volt system is probably preferable,
since the lamps are slightly better and
since the weight of a six volt battery
necessary to store a given amount of
energy is less than that of a twelve
volt battery.
In cranking a car, however, the
power required is large and a corre-
spondingly large current is needed.
To keep the drop small with a six volt
outfit, very large conductors and
brushes are needed. With twelve
volts, the conductors may be less than
half as large and the drop at the same
time less. There seems to be a grow-
ing tendency in favor of the twelve
volt system.
In order that the battery in a car
shall be kept properly charged, the
dynamo should generate voltage suffi-
cient to charge the storage battery at
as low car speed as possible. By mak-
ing the dynamo of sufficient size it
could be made to begin to charge the
battery at a very low speed, say five
miles per hour or over. This would
require an expensive and heavy dyna-
mo and it is usually considered ample
if the generator "cuts in" or begins to
generate at about ten miles per hour.
This is in the neighborhood of 400 r.
p. m. of the engine.
The output of the dynamo must be
regulated in some manner so that the
current can not exceed a safe limit.
If the current through a battery is
maintained at a certain rate the bat-
tery finally becomes fully charged. By
continuing to force current thru the
battery we cannot increase its charge
and the energy will be wasted. The


27
water in the battery solution is decom-
posed into hydrogen and oxygen and
passes away, and at the same time the
battery becomes warmer. If this
charging is continued at too high a
rate the battery becomes overheated
and is seriously damaged.
The cut-out, as previously ex-
plained, is to connect the dynamo, to
the battery when the voltage of the
dynamo is high enough to charge the
battery. This is ordinarily accom-
plished by electrical means. A sole-
noid is connected across the terminals
of the generator. As the voltage of
the latter is increased, the current
through the solenoid becomes greater,
and finally the magnetism of the latter
is sufficiently great to attract an arma-
ture and close an electrical circuit con-
necting the dynamo and battery. In
addition to the winding mentioned,
there is also a coarse wire winding on
the solenoid, and the entire output of
the dynamo flows through this wire.
This is wound in such a direction as to
assist the action of the fine wire or
shunt coil when the dynamo is gener-
ating. When the speed of the dynamo
decreases and its voltage becomes
insufficient to charge the battery, the
current of the latter will reverse and
the dynamo will tend to act as a motor.
This reverses the current thru the
series winding, reducing the magnetic
pull of the solenoid and releasing the
armature. This opens the circuit and
the dynamo ceases to generate.
Regulation.
There are two types of regulation
commonly used; Constant Current and
Constant Potential. Theoretically, the
constant potential is the better. The
dynamo is supposed to generate the
same voltage at all times. If the bat-
ten- voltage is low, there will be a con-
siderable difference between it and the
dynamo voltage and the charging cur-
rent will be large. On the other hand,
if the battery is nearly charged, its
voltage will be high and the charging
current will be small.
With constant current regulation on
the other hand, the current is kept con-
stant at all times. Thus even if the
battery is fully charged, the same cur-
rent will flow through it and this, as
previously explained, is largely wasted.
At the same time the water in the bat-
tery will be exhausted more quickly
than would be the case with the con-
stant potential system.
In comparing these two systems, it
is necessary to understand that the so-
called constant potential system will
not by any means give a constant
potential. To obtain the best results
with a battery, it is essential that it be
occasionally overcharged for a consid-
erable period. This is done automat-
ically in the case of the constant cur-
rent system, and it is also done to a
certain extent in the constant potential
system, because, as previously ex-
plained, the voltage of the dynamo
itself rises somewhat as the current
decreases.
Batteries used on motor cars are
frequently left standing for a consid-
erable time without charging. If this
is done the plates become sulphated:
that is, crystals of lead sulphate, which
are always present in storage batteries,
particularly when they are discharged,
unite to form large crystals on the
plates. When the plates are in this
condition it is necessary that the bat-
tery receive a long overcharge in order
to put it in good condition. This
requires a higher voltage than under
normal conditions because of the high
internal resistance of the battery. With
the constant current system, the volt-
age automatically rises to the proper


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
point and the battery receives the
proper charge to restore it to normal
condition. With the constant poten-
tial system, the battery receives little or
no charge just at the time when it
needs it most.
Inherent Regulations.
By using a differentially compound
dynamo, that is, one in which a series
coil opposes the action of the shunt
coil, it is possible to build a dynamo
whose current cannot exceed a certain
value. The same object can be
obtained by the use of third brush reg-
ulation or by some similar means.
This inherent regulation is practically
always for constant current.
The Motor.
To crank a gas engine requires a
considerable amount of power. Other
things being equal, this power is pro-
portional to the volume of the cylin-
ders, since a large proportion of the
power is used in overcoming the com-
pression. The amount differs in dif-
ferent engines, but as a general aver-
age it requires approximately 0.2 of a
foot-pound per cubic inch of cylinder
volume to start a four cylinder, four
cycle engine. After the engine has
once been started it requires less
torque to keep it in motion, since the
fly wheel assists in carrying the engine
over the compression. The torque
required is approximately half as
much, or about 0.1 foot-pound per
cubic inch.
The starter must develop approxi-
mately one-half of a foot-pound per
cubic inch, or about two and one-half
times as much as the figure previously
mentioned. This excess is allowed for
several reasons. For example, the
motor may be very cold, in which case
the oil is very stiff and the torque
required may be double that necessary
with a warm motor. Moreover, in
cold weather the voltage of the battery
is lower than when it is warm. This
is particularly true if the battery is
nearly discharged. The excess torque
-mentioned is none too much to take
care of the combination of these three
factors.
Cranking Speed.
An engine may be started at any
speed; from a very few revolutions
per minute to about as high as one
cares to go. It is generally considered
at the present time that even a large
engine should be cranked at a speed of
at least 75 revolutions per minute, and
from this the speed ranges up to as
high as 250 revolutions per minute.
The power required is nearly propor-
tional to the speed. At first sight it
would therefore seem desirable that
we should keep the speed as low as
possible. We must, however, consider
that the higher the speed, the more
quickly the engine will be started.
Thus if we should turn an engine over
at the rate of 50 revolutions per min-
ute, it might take 50 turns to start it,
If the start required 25 amperes, we
should take a total of 25 ampere-min-
utes out of the battery. If the same
engine were rotated at the rate of 200
revolutions per minute, it would cer-
tainly not take more than 50 turns to
start it, and the chances are that it
would take far less, because the higher
speed would give a better vaporization
of the gasoline and a hotter spark
from the magneto and would warm up
the cylinders far more quickly. There-
fore, the engine should start with, say,
25 revolutions. The time required
would be only seven and one-half sec-
onds, the current taken from the bat-
tery would be in the neighborhood of
100 amperes, and we should have tak-
en from the battery 12J/2 ampere-min-


29
utes instead of 25. It would theerfore
require less energy to start the engine
at a high speed than at a low speed.
The application of these facts to a
particular engine may be of interest.
Consider a four cylinder, four cycle
engine of 160 cubic inches cylinder
capacity. Such an engine would ordin-
arily be rated at about 25 horse-power.
The torque required to turn this
Perhaps the most obvious way of
attacking the problem is to provide
two units, a motor to crank the engine
and a generator to supply the current
to charge the storage battery. The
dynamo, as shown in Fig. 1, may be
driven by a chain or gear, and ordin-
arily revolves about twice as fast as
the engine. The starting motor, which
is always series wound, is attached to

engine over cold would be about 32
foot-pounds; that is, a pull of 32
pounds on a one foot crank. To keep it
in motion after it was once started
would require one-half as much or 16
foot-pounds. If it were cranked at
the rate of 200 revolutions per minute,
a simple computation would show that
it would require 0.61 horse-power. If
the efficiency of the motor is 70%, this
would mean an input to the motor of
650 watts or 65 amperes at a pressure
of 10 volts. This is about the voltage
obtained from a 12 volt battery supply-
ing this current.
The Two Unit Type
Having now examined the various
requirements to be met, we may con-
sider the various types of outfits that
have been developed.
the engine through reduction gears at
a ratio of from 7 to 1 to 25 to I. This
reduction gearing may be made by
putting a pinion on the motor shaft
with which teeth on the fly wheel
engage. If a bigger reduction is
desired a double reduction gear may
be used. Since the reduction in speed
is so great, it is absolutely essential
that means be provided whereby the
starting motor will be disconnected
from the engine at the instant the lat-
ter starts to operate under its own
power. If this were not done the
starting motor would be driven at a
tremendous speed and would be seri-
ously injured. This disconnecting
means usually takes the form of an
over-running roller clutch. This holds
firm as long as the torque is from the
motor to the engine. As soon as the


3°
torque is reversed the clutch releases
and the pinion is then slid out of
engagement by hand or automatically.
The most obvious advantage of this
construction is that each unit may be
designed to perform its own function.
The motor can be built for high speed,
and consequently be small and light.
The speed for the generator may be
chosen without any regard for other
considerations, and is ordinarily made
moderate, say about twice the engine
speed. The principal disadvantage as
closed, the machine operates as a
motor and cranks the engine. The
connections of the windings are such
that the series winding assists the
shunt winding, giving a strong mag-
netic flux for starting. As soon as the
engine begins to fire and speeds up,
the unit, without any change whatever,
becomes a dynamo and forces current
into the storage battery. When oper-
ated in this way the current in the
series coil is reversed and opposes the
action of the shunt coil. With proper

compared with the single unit type, to
be described later, is that we are
forced to use the overrunning clutch
and sliding pinion, engaged with the
teeth of the fly wheel. The clutches,
in spite of the best design and con-
struction, cause considerable trouble.
The outfit is also more complicated
than the single unit type. When two
units are furnished, the dynamo of the
combination is fully as complicated, as
the combined dynamo and motor of
the single unit type.
Single Unit Non-Stalling Type.
Connections for this type of starter
are shown in Fig. 2. In its simplest
form it is a compound wound machine,
which acts either as a motor or as a
generator. When the switch, S, is
proportions of these two windings the
current is prevented from rising above
a predetermined value, and thus the
regulation of the machine is inherent.
After the switch S is once closed, it is
left closed under all conditions until it
is desired to stop the engine. The
engine cannot stall because, even if the
ignition circuit is open, the motor will
still keep the engine turning over.
This system has the advantage of
simplicity to a greater extent than any
other ever produced. The regulator
and cut-out are entirely eliminated.
The electrical apparatus is one sturdy
unit. It however, obtains these
advantages at the cost of some decided
disadvantages. If the unit is well
designed it must be very heavy. This
must be true in order that it may not


3'
take excessive current when operating
as a motor, and that it may have inher-
ent regulation. The fact that it is at
all times connected to the battery
means that in case the car is driven at
a very low speed, or in case the engine
is left idling at low speed, a very con-
siderable current will be taken from
the battery, perhaps for quite a long
this outfit may work all right, but with
one who habitually drives at high
speed, or low speed, trouble may be
experienced.
Single Unit.
The above considerations have led a
number of makers to adopt a modified
system. Connections of this system

time. In the case of a car that is hab-
itually driven at a low speed, this
would result in the battery being con-
tinually discharged, and it would be
necessary that it be charged by outside
means at regular intervals. The
charging current, moreover, is not the
same for all speeds of the car, but
increases gradually as the car speed
increases. If the car is driven habit-
ually at high speeds, therefore, the
battery may receive too much current
and be injured. Some of the makers
of this type of outfit provide a special
switch to be opened in case the car is
to be driven for a considerable time at
high speed. It will be seen, therefore,
that in the case of the average driver
are shown in Fig. 3. A switch is pro-
vided for starting, which is ordinarily
operated by the foot. This has a
spring return so that is is immediately
opened when the foot is removed. A
cut-out is provided of the type previ-
ously described, so that the generator
will be disconnected when its voltage
is too low. It is customary also to
provide some form of regulator, and
this is shown in the acompanying dia-
gram. In comparing this with the
non-stalling type it will be seen that it
is somewhat more complicated, but
that it does not exhaust the battery in
case the car is run at low speeds. If
properly designed, it is also very much
lighter than the non-stalling type. The

non-stalling' feature is, of course, quite
a "talking point," but the type
described has practically the same
advantage, since if the motor is about
to stall, it is merely necessary to press
the starting button, and the foot can
be kept on this just as long as neces-
sary. If the engine has actually
stopped, a mere touch of the button is
sufficient to start it in operation again.
36 foot-pounds is developed. Since
the starter is geared to the engine in
the ratio of three to one, this means
that about 108 foot-pounds is exerted
at the crank shaft. The maximum
horse-power which this starter can
develop is about 1.32. The horse-pow-
er at which it normally operates is
about 0.75. The efficiency at this horse
power is over 70%. To get an idea

Fig. 4 shows the internal construc-
tion of the Disco Starter of this type.
It is unnecessary to take the construc-
tion up in detail. We would merely
call attention to the use of ball bear-
ings, and the simple windings by
means of which the four pole machine
is obtained. Attention should also be
called to the curved brushes. This is
to permit any amount of wear without
any change in the angle or position of
the brushes on the commutator. The
brushes are also placed so that they are
very accessible. In Fig. 5 is shown the
performance curves of this machine.
It will be noted that when the machine
is at rest, and therefore taking its
maximum current, a torque of about
of the size of this starter, it may be
stated that the dimensions of the
starter are: 12 7/32" long, 4 7/8"
wide, by 6 9/16" high. The total
weight with the regulator is 43
pounds.
To sum up, we may say that the
simplest possible form of starting and
lighting outfit is the non-stalling,
single unit type. The obvious disad-
vantages of this type have led many to
prefer the outfit just described, in
which the non-stalling feature is omit-
ted, and the cut-out used. This gives
an outfit far simpler than the two unit
system and one less liable to cause
trouble and in the small sizes, at least,
it is considerably lighter than the two
unit type.


CINDER IN THE MANUFACTURE
OF PIG IRON
WILLIAM WILLARD TAYLOR, CH. E.
This paper deals with the use of a large percentage of high sulphur
pyrites cinder, in the mixture, in the manufacture of iron low in sulphur; a
recent development in American blast furnace practice.
Pyrites cinder, or "blue billy," as it is frequently called, is quite high in
sulphur, and generally not considered of value in the manufacture of pig
iron, without further treatment. It will be shown by this paper that, with a
photograph of the Lynchburg furnace of the Oriskany Ore &amp; Iron Corpora-
tion, built in 1912-13, where the practice referred to in this paper is followed,
properly constructed plant, selection of certain accompanying ores and fluxes,
and careful attention to slag composition, a large percentage can be used and
good commercial pig iron produced therefrom, practically free of sulphur.
It will further be shown that the furnace slag, if of proper analysis, will
remove the sulphur successfully.
This practice must not be confounded with the use of desulphurized
'blue billy" either in the form of "nodules" or "sinter." I present here a
Furnace Plant.
Stack Construction.—The furnace is 80 feet high, with 16 ft. bosh,
10 ft. hearth, 11 ft. stock line. The bosh angle is 70 degrees, and the distance
from mantel to hearth level is 17 feet. There are eight tuyeres, each six
inches in diameter. The bosh jacket is of reenforced sheet steel; two cast
iron water blocks are spaced between the "cone" and the tuyere jacket. The
tuyere jacket is cast steel, and the hearth jacket is of one inch steel plates,
double butt strapped and reenforced with iron bands. The bell is 7 feet
6 inches in diameter.
Top Rigging and Filling Device.—Above the bell is installed C. W. Hunt
top rigging, whereby loaded filling cars are dumped into a funnel directly
over the bell. With this arrangement irregular filling can be corrected by
shifting the stop block of cars in any direction with threaded bolt and nut.
Thus the filling can be always watched and in the event of too much material
going to one side, correction can be made at once by shifting the top rigging,
so that the furnace will receive its charges evenly.
Filling Cars and Track.—The filling cars are standard C. W. Hunt cars
of two foot gauge, with flanges on the outside. The cars are ball bearing.
The tracks are set with an instrument and buried in concrete. The grade is
with the loads, three inches to one hundred feet on tangents and five inches
to one hundred feet on curves. The curves are all 12 foot radius Hunt
curves.


35
Charging Scales.—Two Fairbanks scales weigh all material after it
leaves the bins for the furnace. Four men on each shift fill all the material,
and one man on top of the furnace handles the elevator and dumps all the
stock, and lowers the bell at the proper time.
Materials Constituting a Charge.—Each charge consists of two cars of
coke; one car of brown ore; one car of pyrites cinder, or nodules, as the case
may be; and one car of stone, either calcite or dolomite, as the men are
instructed to fill. The cars are trammed by hand.
Cage Hoist.—The stock is elevated to top of filling track by Otis elevator
with automatic safety cut-off. On top of filling platform are safety gates
•operated automatically by the cages.
I he Lynchburg Furnace of the Oriskany Ore and Ikon Company.
Stoves.—The furnace is equipped with four Hartman two-pass stoves,
]8 ft. x 70 ft., each with 27,000 square feet of heating surface. The hot sides
■of the stoves are lined with Harbison-Walker hearth and bosh quality fire-
brick, to stand extremely high heat without melting. An electric pyrometer
gives continuous blast temperature.
Pou'er Plant.—The power plant consists of four batteries of Stirling
water-tube boilers, set high for burning gas. Each boiler has a rating of
308 H. P. All are equipped with automatic water regulators.
Blowing Engines.—The blowing engines are Southwark vertical; one
high and one low pressure, capable of blowing against 25 lbs. blast pressure.
F.ach engine has Corliss steam ends; each blowing tub is 84 x 60, with
irridiron valves.


Pumping Plant.—The two main units are Wilson-Snyder heavy duty
river pumps, io-inch suction and 8-inch discharge, set in pump sump directly
at side of engine house, so that their operation can be watched by the blowing
engineer. One emergency Cameron pump is connected directly to water feed
pipe around furnace. One duplex compound Laidlaw-Dunn-Gordon 12 x 16
X20 is also installed at inlet settling basin for assistance in case of shortage
of water. There are two Worthington high pressure boiler feed pumps and
one auxiliary pump, with automatic regulators. Hot water heater is Coch-
rane make, which raises feed water to 210 degrees by use of waste heat from
pumps and blowing engine exhaust. The pumping plant has a capacity of
one million gallons per twenty-four hours. A settling basin of concrete
takes water from James River by gravity through an 18-inch cast iron pipe
line. The two Wilson-Snyder pumps are connected to this settling basin by-
separate lines of cast iron flanged pipe, which was laid in a tunnel 15 feet
below the surface. This allows the pumps to exercise their greatest effi-
ciency. A stand tank 16 x 75 feet, equipped with float, completes the water
installation.
Stock Trestles and Bins.—The stock trestles are of steel, erected to carry
100-ton standard gauge cars. The bins are of white oak, set free of trestles
on separate concrete piers. The stock is separated, and so placed that a
Brown Hoist locomotive crane with clam-shell bucket working on stock piles
from various points on the trestles will fill the bins when there is a shortage
of stock on wheels due to delays in transportation or other causes.
Cast House—Arrangement for Loading Iron.—The cast house is of
steel, with breaking blocks on each side, and on each side a railroad track
depressed so that car floors are on a level with the bench where the iron is
broken. In the event of labor troubles in moving the iron, locomotive crane
and magnet load the iron from the blocks into open-top cars. This is not
continuously practicable, as the magnet will take up scrap and dirty iron,
which is not liked by customers. Therefore, common labor is employed to
load the iron from the blocks. If the iron is put in stock on the yard, the
magnet loads it when orders for shipment are received. The crane is shown
in the cut below.
Pyrites Cinder—A By-product.
In various parts of the United States there are accumulations of pyrites
cinder, popularly known as "blue billy." This material is made from the
burning of iron pyrites in the process of manufacturing sulphuric acid. Scat-
tered over the country, particularly in the South Atlantic states, are located
fertilizer plants that make their own sulphuric acid from pyrite. The large
deposits of pyrite mined in Spain and shipped to this country are very pure,
and this paper deals with the pyrites cinder made from Spanish ore.
Deposits of pyrite are extensively mined in Virginia, but the grade is not so
high as that mined in Spain and the cinder therefrom is lower in iron content
than the product of the foreign ore.
The fertilizer business in the South is a growing industry and new
plants are continually being built. The soil rapidly becomes depleted from
cotton and tobacco raising and more and more fertilizer is being put on the


37
market. Digestion of rock phosphate with sulphuric acid is the base of the
various fertilizers. As the phosphate beds are located principally on the
slopes of the Atlantic states, the fertilizer plants are so located that the phos-
phate rock and pyrite can be assembled economically.
The imported pyrite is of two general classes. The first class consists of
pieces averaging the size of domestic nut coal. The second class consists of
the finest from the ore body, and varies from very fine dust to pieces the size
of a hazelnut; the two grades are mixed three to one.
In the vicinity of Charleston, S. C, miles of road were built of high
grade pyrites cinder. For years the product was considered waste, of no
value. Millions of tons were accumulated. When it banked up about a fer-
tilizer plant, it was used to fill in holes and wet places in that flat country.
Loading the Iron with a Magnet.
After extracting most of the sulphur from the pyrite, the residue con-
tains on an average 2.00% of sulphur, which is "fixed," that is, which does
not leave the ore at the heat of the furnaces at the acid plants.
Experiments.—Numerous experiments were conducted by chemists and
blast furnace managers trying to devise some scheme whereby this waste
product could be used commercially, as an iron ore. Very high in iron, low
in silica, and of proper physical character for good work in a furnace, the
sulphur acted as a barrier to extensive use.
In Bad Repute.—During periods of high prices in the iron business,
when labor conditions were bad and iron miners hard to get, local blast fur-
nace men have used sparingly some of this waste product in the manufacture


of the ordinary grades of foundry iron. It was discovered that a furnace
making high silicon irons, running very hot, could handle a certain per-
centage of the cinder with good results. Seldom more than one-sixteenth of
the mixture was used, though one furnace at Jackson, Ohio, uses 10%
regularly in the making of Silvery. The ''founders'' at the furnaces never
liked the stuff. Accustomed as they were to soft brown ores, they disliked
anything new. When forced to put a small percentage in their mixture
during times when ore was scarce, they would blame all the bad work of the
furnace to "blue billy."' It was often observed that a furnace working well
on all brown ore would "run off'' cold when so little as one-sixteenth pyrites
cinder was used. If the furnace "ran off cold" from improper filling, too
acid a slag, or from poor fuel, or similar reasons, the pyrites cinder would be
blamed for the bad work, whether or not it was to blame. It was in bad
repute.
Latent Possibilities.—The reason that the latent possibilities of this
waste product appeal to furnacemen is obvious. The iron ores of this coun-
try are becoming lower grade each year. Particularly is this true in Vir-
ginia, the first State to make pig iron. In order to compete, the mixture must
be enriched. With this object in view, numerous experimenters have been at
work the past few years, desulphurizing these pyrite residues. The most
successful thus far is the rotary kiln, though the sintering scheme has great
promise. Heberlein pots were used with fair results. All of these processes
will remove practically all of the sulphur, but the intense heat required for
nodulizing the fines produces silicate of iron, which binds the component
pieces, and the resulting product, though free of sulphur and high in iron, is
very refractory in the furnace. The formation of silicate is my theory.
The Problem Involved.—If then a large percentage of pyrites cinder
could hi used in the manufacture of the ordinary grades of iron, without the
expense of re-roasting or sintering, same would have a commercial value.
Experiments by the writer and theory combined seemed to justify most
strongly the practicability of the proposition. Theory indicated that a high
manganese ore would be most desirable on account of the affinity of man-
ganese for sulphur. High stove heats should be advantageous in maintain-
ing high hearth temperature. As the pyrites cinder contains more or less
"fines," the blowing engines must be strong and able to cope with high
pressures.
Securing a Suitable Iron Ore.—In order to procure a regular supply of
•ore rich in manganese, the Pittsville deposits were bought and developed for
economical mining. A word concerning these deposits may be of interest.
These ore bodies consist of a series of synclines lying on the south-east face
of a number of hills in Pittsylvania County, Virginia. The ore in many
places is almost free of cover, and can be mined, therefore, open cut. The
ore bodies dip to the south-east with a strike north-east and south-west and
3. "thrust" to the south. Two parallel ridges, distant a quarter mile across
country, carry the ore. The deposits are not continuous along the faces of
the ridges but at lines of fault will cut off, and where conditions are right
the ground again shows mineralization. The geology of the region has been


39
neglected, but we believe the ore is a replacement deposit in part and impreg-
nation deposit in part. The country rock, being shale of doubtful origin, has
been decomposed by meteoric waters and iron and manganese deposited
therein. Clays, sand and undecomposed country rock are found in the ore
bodies, making it necessary to wash and pick carefully the lumpy ores and
jig the smaller sizes.
The deposits continue downward from the outcrop an average of 300
feet on the dip, at an average angle of 20 degrees. The ore body has an
average thickness square across the measures of 30 feet, and an average
horizontal measurement on the cut floors of 60 feet. The ore content of any
deposit thus far worked, or prospected, is about one-third of the total vein
matter. Easily broken, soft and of great thickness, the material is economi-
cally mined and milled.
The "thrust to the South" may possibly require explanation. Numerous
faults having occurred, breaking the continuity of the shale hills, the thrust
of the fault in each case being to the south, percolating waters from shales
above, rich in iron, flowed downward and southward through the shale,
decomposing same and leaving their iron and manganese behind. The ore at
the south end of deposits is richer in iron than that at the north end and the
deposit is more free of foreign matter at the south end, showing to my mind
more flow of water along the southern end of each area.
The underlying rock is blue, close grained, compact, probably a syenite.
Our prospecting at the base of the hills has disclosed the fact that the deposit
stops in the hollows at the base of the hills where the original shales super-
imposed on the blue rock. No geological survey of this section was ever
made. In regard to the amount of mineralization, over a distance of three
miles along the strike, a mile and a quarter is thus mineralized.
Pittsville Mines.
The ore is loaded by steam shovel into four-yard side dump cars and
transported to washer and concentrating plant by locomotives. The lumps
are hand picked over conveyor belt and go directly into bin, thence into rail-
road cars. The clean undersize is elevated to top of building, then sized over
four revolving trommels, and each size passed through jigs of American
Concentrator design. The waste material, consisting of sand, flint, shale,
light pieces of ore, and mixed ore and sand, is carried to waste dump. As
shipped to the furnace the lump ores and fines are not separated; general
classification shows two-thirds lump and one-third fines, nothing being
shipped below 3/32". The ore is soft, porous and easily melted; it is dark
brown in color from the manganese.
Selection op Cinder for Stock
After a careful survey of available stocks, and the testing of many
samples by analysis, both for sulphur and metallic contests, we closed con-
tracts in the fall of 1911 with four fertilizer companies in Charleston, S. C,
for their entire stock piles and make of cinder over a long period of years.


THE MICHIGAN TBCHNIC
Pyrites Cinder from Spanish Ores.
As previously stated, the Spanish pyrite is probably the purest pyrite
used. It contains varying quantities of copper as well as small percentages
of lead and zinc, as analysis shows. In purchasing the cinder, we carefully
selected that low in copper, endeavoring to confine our work to cinder con-
taining a half of one percent, or less of this element. All the copper intro-
duced into the furnace will find its way into the pig iron, and the trade will
not purchase iron knowing that it contains an appreciable amount of copper.
Some of the Spanish mines, particularly some of the mines of the Rio Tinto
Company, produce a pyrite containing as high as ij^% copper.
Another View op the Furnace.
Sinter.—The Rio Tinto Company organized a subsidiary company
whose object is to treat the "blue billy" by digestion in wooden tanks with
sulphuric acid and precipitate the copper on old steel, etc. The cinder is then
mixed with pulverized coke and '"sintered" by the Dwight and Lloyd process,
producing a sinter which is used as an iron ore. The sintering treatment
costs in the neighborhod of one dollar a ton without royalty to Dwight and
Lloyd. The latter is on a sliding scale, dependent on the output of sinter, but
will average twenty-five cents per ton. Therefore, the actual cost of sinter-
ing is in the neighborhood of $1.25 per ton of sinter made. A furnace in
Virginia, using 50% of sinter, which is practically free of sulphur, is run on
an acid slag and produces a good grade of foundry iron. Great claims have
been made by the owners of the Dwight and Lloyd patents for low fuel con-
sumption and increased output from the use of sinter. I am informed by


certain parties thoroughly familiar with the action of sinter in the furnace
referred to, that the fuel consumption and also the tonnage of the furnace
have not been improved since the sinter was substituted for nodulized blue
billy in the mixture. My information further is that the fuel consumption
per ton of pig iron, using Toms Creek coke, is in the neighborhood of 3300
lbs. per ton of iron.
A Comparison of Raiv and Sintered "blue billy."—As it costs in the
neighborhood of $1.25 per ton to manufacture "sinter," not counting cost of
copper extraction, it is evident that the use of pyrites cinder "raw" has con-
siderable commercial value. The only marked difference between the prac-
tice of a furnace working "raw" and one working sinter being difference in
the composition of the slag. On the sinter furnace much lower stove heats
are used and the blast pressure is lower—higher stove heats would probably
reduce the fuel consumption to some extent, but are not available on account
of the type of stove in use. These stoves are small and seldom give more
than 11000 heat, whilst out stoves give an average of 13500 and are frequent-
ly run as high as 16000 F. The sinter furnace produces a slag, samples of
which are all glass, whilst our slag using the raw pyrites cinder is kept more
"limey" and shows no glass except the edges of sample where it is chilled in
the iron mold. We hold the silica and alumina combined about 47%. Unfor-
tunately I cannot give the chemical composition of the slag from the furnace
using the sinter.
Raw Materials.
The following is a description of the raw materials used at the Lynch-
burg furnace in its first year's operation, May 31st, 1913—May 31st, 1914.
The analyses of calcite and dolomite do not vary, but analyses of brown
ore and pyrites cinder will quite frequently vary 5% either way from the
averages shown due to changes in the quality of the ore body and to variation
in the character of ores used by the southern fertilizer companies.

Operating Dpfficulties Anticipated.
The local market and prevailing foundry specifications brought the
chemical constituents of the proposed product within rather narrow limits.
It so happened, therefore, that the ore burden ("ore burden" is to be under-
stood as including all iron bearing materials) assumed in meeting the prob-
lems involved in the construction of the furnace was quite close to that which
in practice has been adopted as standard. This tentative burden varied
between the following limits:
Pittsville Ore 50.00
(1) Raw Pyrites Cinder 25.00
Nodulized Cinder 25.00
Pittsville Ore 50.00
(2) Raw Pyrites Cinder 37-5°
Nodulized Cinder 12.50
A glance at the foregoing stock analyses will show the large percentage
of exceedingly fine ores involved, being practically identical with the Lake
ores used by northern furnaces. It was apparent, therefore that a relatively
large percentage of iron bearing materials would "blow over" and mix with
the gases from the furnace top.


Another difficulty indicated by previous experience with pyrites cinder
in even more limited quantities was the "choking" of down comer with zinc
cadmia and the closing of goose necks and gas burners by deposits of flue
dust and clinkers.
Special Features of Furnace Construction.
This was a new field, and in the final draft of plans I had the assistance
of Mr. Frank C. Roberts, C. E., of Philadelphia, who was our consulting
engineer. Mr. Roberts, with his broad experience in the blast furnace field,
and his ready sympathy, offered many suggestions and was not only of inval-
uable assistance along technical lines but a fountain of encouragement to me
personally in my new undertaking. The type of down comer, dust catcher,
gas main and connections to stoves and boilers as adopted involved a radical
departure, when compared with existing plants in this section of the country.
The only feature worthy of note, however, is their unusual size.
The down comer has a diameter of six feet inside the brick. The dust
catcher is of 20 feet inside diameter, fitted with a bell for drawing the flue
dust. The gas passes from the dust catcher at the top through two goose neck
pipes which connect into the overhead gas main, which, like the down comer
is 6 feet inside the lining. This main, which supplies the stoves and boilers,
has an auxiliary bleeder at the end farthest from the stack, which acts as a
relief valve in the event of an excess of gas at the stoves and boilers. This
bleeder has a diameter of 24 inches, like the one on the furnace top.
This system of gas control has been justified by the results obtained.
Furnace Practice.
The Saturation Point of Slag. I was confronted at the outset with the
accepted statement contained in the leading text books that blast furnace slag
generally contains about one and one-half percent, of sulphur and seldom
exceeds two percent. I found that the sulphur in the coke alone, combined
with the small amount in the brown ore, would put nearly two percent, in the
furnace cinder. The iron must be low in sulphur or no sales would be made.
Previous experiments had shown me that by judicious use of the two flux
rocks available, combined with high stove heats, with engines that would
blow against heavy pressures, hence keep the furnace moving, the practice
would improve and that the slag would take up an excess of sulphur.
Furnaces throughout this section are as a rule operated on a more or less
acid cinder. We found with more limestone in the charge a tendency toward
a lower fusion zone in the stack, and the stove heats being high also assist in
keeping the hearth at a high temperature, thus producing conditions which
cause the furnace slag to absorb the sulphur in the mixture.
The high heats referred to produce high pressure in themselves, and
further have a tendency to produce "sticking" of the stock. Most careful
watching of each flush of cinder and of the rapidity with which the furnace
takes its charges, and frequent gauging from the top, are necessary. In the
event of sticking, the blowing engines are immediately speeded up. In case


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
the furnace does not respond and promptly "go to work," the cinder notch
is opened and the furnace is "snatched"—that is, the blast is thrown off sud-
denly. This generally produces the desired result. If, however, it is
observed that the furnace is too hot and the cinder flames when tapped, we
drop the blast temperature 200 to 300 degrees by use of McCarthy by-pass
valve, which introduces cold air into hot blast main. The by-pass valve is
equipped with rack and perforated bar with pin and is placed quite close to
continuous reading Brown electric pyrometer. The valve is opened the neces-
sary amount to produce the temperature of blast desired and the furnace
generally responds at once. If not, it will "slip," and under slightly lower
hearth conditions immediately goes to work.
We have found that constant slipping on certain days causes partially
unreduced stock to drop into the hearth, and there coming in contact with the
molten metal, forge iron, mottled or white iron will be the result. It requires
most constant vigilance to keep the conditions constant and avoid frequent
occurrences of this kind. But after a number of months we found truth in
the old saying, "a stitch in time saves nine," and now the furnace runs along
cast after cast, week after week, with practically the entire ouput good
salable metal.
Burdening the New Furnace.—The furnace was blown in on straight
Pittsville ore. The nodules were then added, and gradually, as the heats
increased and the furnace began to drive, pyrites cinder was added to the
mixture.
During the first six months campaign of the furnace the iron market was
comparatively good, and the mixture consisted of one-half Pittsville ore, one-
quarter pyrites cinder, and one-quarter nodules. The market going off
during the holidays, when we resumed blowing we figured various mixtures
to cheapen the product. The price of nodules being high, the less of this
commodity used the cheaper the iron would be. In the early part of the
year we succeeded in getting some orders with phosphorus specified one
per cent. Therefore, we increased the amount of our Pittsville ore to five-
eighths of the mixture and dropped the nodules, using three-eighths pyrites
cinder from January 22nd to February 20th inclusive.
The Use of Z7lA% Raw Pyrites Cinder.
It was not without trepidation that we put this burden on the furnace.
We found after a few days that if we kept the furnace hot and made high
silicon irons we experienced little difficulty in holding the sulphur. Our
orders were a mixed lot, consisting of car load and 100-ton lots of No. 1 and
No. 2 foundry, and a main backlog order for No. 3, silicon 1.50 to 2.00, for a
local pipe shop. We had no trouble in making the hotter grades. The slag
volume was increased and the furnace yield dropped to 45%, while the fuel
per ton of iron increased 5%. When making the No. 3, however, we found
eternal vigilance the watchword. After a few days we trained our cinder
snapper to report immediately any marked change in the appearance of the
cinder. If too cold, the stove tender immediately put up the heats and the
engines were slowed down somewhat. If the slag appeared too hot, the


engine speed was increased and the blast temperature lowered. Thus we
soon learned how to handle the problem.
Here is an average analysis of the iron produced, also the average of
the daily slag analyses, prepared through the adding machine, for the 30-day
period in question: •
Pic. Iron. Slag.
Average of 120 casts. Average of 30 analyses.

Sulphur 059 Almina 11.02
Phosphorus 1.03 Sulphur 3.80
Manganese 1.57 Average Stove Heat i4io°F.
Average Blast Pressure isyi lbs.
The flux used was half calcite and half dolomite, and the fuel consump-
tion was 3300 lbs.
Other Mixtures.—The high phosphorus orders having been completed,
with a more pronounced dullness in the market, we found it necessary to
again make lower phosphorus iron in order to meet competition and conform
to buyers' views. The foundry trade as a rule insist that phosphorus shall
be below 1.00%. Therefore, we reduced the brown ore to 5% of the mixture,
and were successful in obtaining a lower cost by using the following ore
burden:
Pittsville ore 50.00
Raw pyrites cinder 36.67
Nodules r3-33
With our experience to guide us, we had no difficulty with this mixture,
and during the monfobof March, April and May this mixture was used. In
March and April tlift&amp;Trnace produced 6300 tons of foundry iron, all of
which was sold. During April a breakout of iron stopped the plant for four
days, which reduced the tonnage somewhat. During these two months we
used 4442 tons of pyrites cinder and 2078 tons of nodules.
The Use of 50% Raw Pyrites Cinder.
On March 9th the stock of nodules gave out and from the 9th to 12th
the mixture used was:
50% Pittsville ore,
50% Raw Pyrites Cinder.
The writer was away at the time and unfortunately no analyses were
made for sulphur in the slag. The nodules arriving, the regular burden of
50% brown ore, 36.67% pyrites cinder and 13.33% nodules was resumed
and kept on till May 9th, when, for experimental purposes, it was again
changed.
Experimental Burden.—On May 8th the furnace made 126 tons of iron
and conditions were good for making a trial of fifty per cent, brown ore and
fifty per cent, pyrites cinder. On May 8th the flux used was half dolomite
and half calcite.
Beginning with the nth charge May 9th, I changed the burden as indi-
cated, using half brown ore and half pyrites cinder. The ore beam was set


at 3375 lbs., the same as on the preceding day, and the only change made in
flux was that two-thirds calcite was used and one-thind dolomite. The lime-
stone beam was set at 3275 lbs., the same as on the preceding day. The idea
in using the larger percentage of calcite was to have in the furnace hearth
a cinder with more lime and less magnesia, the accepted theory being that
lime will absorb sulphur and that magnesia will not.
The furnace drove along smoothly making 112 tons on May 9th. The
new burden was continued through the night of May 9th, but began to
"stick" slightly on the morning of the 10th. We immediately reduced the
ore 25 pounds, so that beginning with 6 A. M. May 10th the charge was as
follows:
Brown ore 3350 lbs.
Pyrites cinder 3350 lbs.
Calcite 2183 lbs.
Dolomite 1092 lbs.
This was continued for 20 charges, or till 3 P. M., May 10th, when the
previous burden was put back. This was done because it was found that the
furnace worked "mucky" with this excessive load of pyrites cinder. The
tonnage dropped on the 11 A. M. and 5 P. M. casts of May 10th, and the
make for May 10th was 98 tons.
I attach hereto the reports of May 8th, gth, 10th, and nth,* as prepared
by the clerk doing this work; these reports show the conditions existing just
before and just after the change of burden as well as the results for the two
days in question.
The iron made from the half pyrites burden was first tapped 12 hours
after filling, that is, on the 5 A. M. cast of May 9th (a furnace day with us
is counted from the 11 A. M. cast to the 5 A. M. casfof the following calendar
day, in this instance May 10th), or cast 447. The iron analyzed:
Silicon 3.00
Sulphur 072
The metal would continue to be made from this mixture for four
additional casts of six hours each and these are herewith shown:
Cast 448—Silicon 2.03
Sulphur 050
Cast 449—Silicon 2.54
Sulphur 030
Cast 450—Silicon 2.44
Sulphur 056
Cast 451—Silicon 2.38
Sulphur 073
The average of five casts being—
Silicon 2.47
Sulphur 060

Method of Determining Sulphur in Slag.
In determining the sulphur in the slag, a piece is taken from each flush
of the furnace for twenty-four hours and pulverized and mixed. Two-
tenths grams are then placed in flask and 50 c. c. cold water added, also a
small piece of metallic zinc. The flask is then agitated, then connected to
sulphur absorption tube wherein is placed a solution of cadmium chloride.
The slag is suspended in water and dilute hydrochloric acid added and heat
applied. After complete evolution, the solution is titrated with standard
iodine solution. The iodine solution is standardized frequently against
Bureau of Standards standard pig iron. The same iodine solution is used
for titrating sulphur on pig iron, a five gram sample being used on iron.
The following materials were used by the furnace during the month of
May:
Coke—(an allowance of 8% is includ-
ed for loss in braize, etc.) 5350 tons
Pittsville ore 3523 tons
Raw pyrites cinder 2281 tons
Nodulized pyrites cinder 1076 tons
Natural Bridge dolomite 1533 tons
Indian Rock calcite 1859 tons
Pig iron produced in the month of May 3391 tons
Stone per ton of iron, May 1.00 tons
Furnace yield in pig iron 49.29%
Coke consumption per ton of iron, May (3140 lbs.) 1.57 tons
Average hot stove heat for month 1360 degrees F.
Average blast pressure to month 15 lbs.
The coke overran somewhat. We believe that the fuel used does not
exceed 3,000 lbs. The furnace bins are equipped with screens for taking out
the fines below j^-inch. This braize is sold to a nearby aluminum works at
nearly the coke price to us. During the month of May 100 tons of braize
were sold, but the amount sold was not credited to the fuel consumption of
the furnace.
I submit herewith, on separate sheets, a complete list of analyses of all
iron and cinder made for the entire month.*
General Observations.
Examination of the iron list for May will show a sudden increase in the
manganese and phosphorus on casts 534 and 535 on May 31st.
We found that zinc was forming in the necks from the downcomer and
in the stoves to such an extent that it was interfering with the passage of the
gas, and we decided to bank the furnace for a few days to clean the flues and
stoves. We have found it advisable to stop on an acid cinder with no
nodules or pyrites cinder in the furnace. Therefore, beginning at 6 A. M.
May 31st we began charging as follows:
Coke 4600
Pittsville ore 6000
Calcite 4000
* Omitted here on account of lack of space.


This was continued till 6 P. M. May 31st, when a blank of 23,000 lbs.
of coke was put in the furnace, followed by the same charge of Pittsville ore
and calcite shown above. At the 5 A. M. cast June 1st, that is, that last cast
of May 31st, the blast was taken off, all tuyeres and coolers removed and
the holes mudded up. The increased percentage of Pittsville ore filled the
last day explains the high phosphorus and manganese referred to.
Zinc.—After the flues were cooled down we removed 26 tons of lump
cadmia, analyzing 55.10% metallic zinc, from the down comer, dust catcher
and flues, and 27 tons of 30% zinc flue dust from the backs of the stoves,
underground stove flue, and boilers. This was shipped to a zinc smelter.
Rotation of Cars Constituting a Charge.—The common practice with
hand filled furnaces is to first put the coke in charge on the bell, followed by
ore and stone. Shortly after we blew in, a year ago, we observed that poor
distribution was taking place. At that time we were filling as follows:
The first two cars up—coke.
The third car up—Pittsville ore.
The fourth car up—nodules, or pyrite cinder, as the case might be.
The fifth car up—stone.
Examination at the top of the furnace showed that good distribution was
being had on the bell. Finally I took a Y\" iron rod and measured off the
distance from the end, as shown by the drawing, from the centre of the
furnace to the peep-hole of the tuyere and there made a mark with a cold
chisel. Calling two men I had this rod shoved in through a tuyere till the
end was at the centre of the furnace, then with watch in hand it was left for
30 seconds and suddenly withdrawn. Examination showed that the end of
the bar was much hotter, showing plainly that the wind was channeling
through the centre, and consequently driving faster at the centre than along
the walls. This was tried on different tuyeres and proven to be a fact.
Afer trying different combinations and watching the distribution on the
bell, and tests, as above explained, at the tuyeres, we found a system of rota-
tion which was satisfactory. A rod pushed through the tuyeres and sudden-
ly withdrawn would show a uniform heat from one end to the other. This
system is as follows:
The first car up—Pittsville ore.
The second car up—pyrites cinder, or nodules, as directed.
The third car up—stone, calcite or dolomite in rotation.
The fourth and fifth cars up—coke.
In explanation of this, I have the following comment to make. Pyrites
cindler and likewise the nodules contain a very large percentage of fines.
Pyrites cinder, having 32^% below 1/400-inch, and the nodules carrying
12^ %. In the other systems of filling, as tried, it was very evident that a
certain portion of these fines refused to be spread evenly across the furnace
along with the lumpy material, but, at the lowering of the hell went down
close to the walls of the furnace. Examination of the blue print of the
furnace stack and my past experience with other furnaces, told me that, at


the lowering of the bell, a certain proportion of the lumpy materials would
strike against the brick work of the furnace at the stock line and would bound
toward the center. This being true, if the fine material could be so charged
as to be carried along mechanically with the lump,, an even distribution
would be the result. This proved to be the case with the system of filling
finally adopted. The distance from the edge of the bell to the stock line is
21 inches, and the entire charge is lowered at one drop of the bell.
Ring Scaffold.—During the first six months operation of the furnace
numerous breakdowns of hoisting engine then in use, blowing engines,
pumps etc., incident to the starting of any new plant, caused repeated and
unexpected stoppages, varying in length of time from twelve hours to five
days. In the middle of December it was decided to install a heavy duty hoist
engine and strong heavy pumps. The holidays approaching, when shortage
of labor was all too apparent, we decided to blow the furnace out till the new
year, and make the necessary changes.
After the furnace had cooled down and the loose material had been
removed through the cooler openings, we found a mass of heavy material
sticking to the bosh of the furnace all the way around. This deposit was
two feet thick in a number of places. The stuff was chiseled and pried loose.
Close examination showed that it consisted of pasty blue billy fines, lime, fine
coke, and lead; it analyzed 55% metallic iron. It was thrown over into the
stock house and re-charged later.
This confirms the theory of the faulty distribution in the early days of
operating.
Even with the present system of filling, we are not entirely free from
trouble of this sort. Indeed, after a campaign of three to five weeks of fairly
uniform practice, we find it necessary to "scour the furnace out," that is, to
suddenly substitute all Pittsville ore for a period of twelve to twenty-four
hours. We put a coke blank ahead of the changed burden, and make the
necessary calculation for an acid cinder. The intense heat generated by the
extra coke and the acid slag combined cut the coating from the bosh walls;
the burden is put back, and immediate improvement is brought about.
In order to improve our practice and to save the flue dust, we expect
shortly to screen the pyrites cinder, and to sinter same here over a sintering
machine with coke braize. Pyrites cinder passing a 3^-inch screen will be
charged into the furnace without treatment, whilst the sinter will replace
the nodules which we are now using.
Conclusion.
Practice has shown that we can work three-eighths pyrites cinder in the
mixture without difficulty. It has also demonstrated that we can use as much
as fifty per cent, for short periods. We have found that the slag from the
furnace can be made to carry four per cent, of sulphur and that the iron will
be comparatively free of sulphur. During the past year we have used suc-
cessfully upward of 18,000 tons of pyrites cinder, and during the months of
January to May inclusive we used 9832 tons of this material just as received
from the fertilizer mills, without desulphurization.


Investigations of the United States Department of Agriculture-;- show-
that irrigating streams as diverted from main channels into lateral ditches
are not usually what they are supposed to be with respect to size and con-
stancy of flow and therefore the total quantity actually delivered is seldom
known.
Mr. C. T. Johnston in the discussion of these investigations, which were
carried on with the aid of automatic recording gages, states that several hun-
dred register sheets were examined and that "none of them show that a con-
stant depth of water passed thru the measuring flume or over the weir from
which the record is taken for more than a few minutes at a time. Many of
the laterals where continuous records were kept were supposed to furnish a
uniform discharge. That this has never been brought about, the register
sheets testify. Nevertheless, canal companys sell a specified number of cubic
feet per second to the irrigators under their system, and contracts providing
for the disposal of water under such conditions are often carried into effect
with but little friction." It was also shown by Mr. George L. Swendenf that the
size of the "irrigating streams" on a particular canal system were not even
uniform as they were supposed to be, but that they varied from 0.85 second
foot to 3.12 second feet. It is further known and shown by Government
reports that the quantity of water flowing into the main canals from the river
is a constantly varying quantity due to the daily variations in the flow in the
river. In the arid region, this daily variation in the flow of the rivers is per-
haps greater than in any other section of the country.
There are other factors which cause the quantity of water flowing past
a given section of a canal to vary. Among these are intermittent diversions
caused by the rotational method of irrigation and the effect of winds.
From the point of view of the superintendent of an irrigation system it
is necessary for the most efficient operation of the system to know not only
the total quantity of water served to each share-holder "under the ditch,"
but to be able to regulate this quantity both in total amount and in the
amount served per irrigation.
From the point of view of the share-holder or the irrigator it is neces-
sary, for the most efficient use of his water right, to be able to control the
amount of water per irrigation and to have his "stream" remain constant
during the time he is using it. If then we can divert a constant stream of
predetermined size, from the canal into the irrigator's lateral ditch we will
accomplish the most efficient distribution of the water in the system. It is
for the accomplishment of this purpose that the Automatic headgate herein
describer, is designed.
This headgate must then automatically divert a constant stream of pre-
determined size from a variable source. It is necessary, of course, in all
cases that the supply in the canal be sufficient for the demand of the
lateral.

The writer designed a headgate for the accomplishment of this purpose
which he described in the Michigan Technic of May, 1914. The headgate
described therein was intended to operate properly only so long as the water
surface in the lateral ditch did not rise above a certain level, or in other words,
so long as the water in the lateral ditch flowed away freely.
The headgate described herein, however, is designed to divert a constant
stream regardless of fluctuations in the water surface in the canal or in the
lateral ditch, so long as the difference in elevation of the water surfaces is
equal to or greater than a certain predetermined amount, the water surface
in the lateral ditch, of course, always being the lower.
In general the slope of the ground away from the canal is so slight
that any device entailing a large loss of head is impracticable. Many canals
carry water heavily ladened with silt hence the device must be able to operate
in silt bearing waters; it must be practically proof against being tampered
with to change the flow ; it must not be too expensive and must be durable.
Ax Automatic Headgate.
The writer has endeavored to design a headgate with these requisites.
Figure 1 is an isometric drawing of the device. Figure 2 is a photo-
graph of one of the headgates in operation.
From Figure 1 the headgate is seen to consist of a box of sheet metal
(noncorrosive), enclosed on all sides except the top and having an inside
partition, the partition and front sheet being perforated along the bottom
edge. This box is hung in a concrete channel by means of two rocker arms
which are supported near their middle on brackets. To the opposite ends to
those upon which the box is hung, are fastened two spiral springs, the lower
ends of which are in turn fastened to brackets. The box is supported against
horizontal displacement by four arms, the ends of which are pivoted to the
box and the sides of the channel as shown. There are small clearance spaces
between the projecting side edges of the front sheet of the box and the side
walls of the channel. A spade shut-off gate shown at S is located in the con-
crete channel in front of the box and is for the purpose of completely stop-
ping the passage of water from the canal to the lateral.

Figure 2—Headcate in Operation.
The trap door shown at X, Fig. 2, can be closed down and locked, thus
preventing any tampering with the device.
The bottom of the channel is set a little lower than the canal grade so
that when just enough water (Q sec. ft.) is flowing in the canal at this point
to supply the lateral, it will all be drawn to the lateral. Assume now that
just Q sec. feet are flowing in the canal. The box is hung at such a height


above the bottom of the channel that the given quantity will just flow under
the lip without touching it. Now assume the waer surface in he canal, and
therefore in the lateral, to rise slowly. As it rises it will strike the lip, and
the vein of water passing under it will be contracted slightly thereby. So we
will have the discharge taking place thru an orfice. The velocity of the flow
under the lip has been increased slightly by the increase in head and the
cross-sectional area of the vein has been decreased slightly by the contrac-
tion, with the result that Q is kept practically constant.*
The contraction caused by the lip is sufficient to compensate for the
increase in head on the orfice only for a short distance (i. e. small increase in
head) and the width of the lip is made equal to this distance. As the water
rises above the top of the lip the resulting contraction is not sufficient to
compensate for the increase in head therefore,- since Q is to be kept constant,
the cross sectional area of the vein under the lip must be decreased by the
lowering of the box.
As the water rises above the top of the lip it flows into the box thru the
perforations in the front sheet and this increases the weight to be supported
by the springs, consequently the springs elongate and the box lowers an
amount just sufficient to compensate for the increased head. As the water
continues to rise in front of the box, it continues to rise in the box, thus con-
tinually increasing the weight to be supported by the springs and hence the
box continues to lower, at all times keeping Q constant. When the water sur-
face lowers in front of the box the reverse operations take place.
To prevent the deposition of sediment in the box, a constant flushing"
action is maintained by a small quantity of water which is allowed to escape
thru the back and bottom of the box thru the holes shown at V and Z. (Fig..
1). The purpose of the perforated partition is to localize the velocity of the
water as it passes thru the box.
Referring now to figure 3, which is a diagrammatic cross section, assume
the water surface to stand in front of the box at W^ and behind the box at
W4S4. We have then the orifice under the lip discharging a certain amount,
Q, under a head represented by Ya-(-D and an effective weight of water in
the box which we can also represent by Yj+D. Now assume the'water sur-
face in front of the box to lower thru a distance D to the position W2S2. The
head on the orifice and the weight in the gate have both been decreased by
amounts proportional to D and the gate has risen by an amount correspond-
ing to D. Now assume the water surface to again stand at WjSj in front and
W4S4 behind the box and then assume the water surface to rise behind the
box thru a distance D to the position W3S3. Now, as before, the head on the
orifice and the water in the gate have both been decreased by amounts pro-
portional to D and the gate has risen by an amount corresponding to D. So
we see that a rising of water surface behind the box is equivalent to a cor-
responding lowering of the water surface in front of the box.
Let Y= the head on the opening under the lip; L= the length, and A=
the height of the opening; V= the mean Velocity of the water as it passes
thru ; Q= the quantity discharged thru the opening; g=gravity. Then Q=

V AL=V2gaLVY or since Q, y/2g, and L are all constants we can
combine them into K and write K/a= VY which shows that the height of
the opening under the lip z-aries inversely as the square root of the head on
the opening. It can be seen from the figure that the weight of water in the
box is directly proportional to the head on the opening. Therefore, for the

first unit increase in Y the box should lower a certain amount, for the second
unit increase in Y the box should lower a smaller amount, and for the third
unit increase in Y a still smaller amount, and so on.
It is to obtain this decreasing rate of lowering that the rocker is placed
between the box and the springs. And it is the character of the curve of this
rocker which determines this rate of lowering. This curve can be mathemat-
ically deduced from the known laws of hydraulics and mechanics.


To the mathematical deduction of the rocker arm curve we will now
proceed.
k = stiffness of spring r= weight which causes unit elongation.
W = weight of unit volume of water.
Z = elongation of springs.
N = length of arms.
W. S. = water surface.
/:= width of box (measured parallel to L).
K = effective depth of water in box.
b = depth of box.
e = width of projecting lip.
a = distance from bottom of projecting lip to bottom of channel.
V = maximum value of "a."
/ = horizontally projected length from point of support of rocker to box end of
same.
x = horizontally projected length of rocker.
L, = width of channel = length of orifice.
H = difference in elevation of water surface in front of and behind box = Y.
i= width of clearance space at sides of box.
t = weight of metal box.
0 = total area of holes in bottom and back of box.
Qx := quantity of water which passes under lip.
02 = quantity of water which passes through holes in bottom and back of box.
Q. = qutntity of water which passes through clearance space at sides of box.
Q = Q&gt;+q*+&lt;?.. .
C = co-efficient of discharge of an orifice.
C, = co-efficient of orifice under lip = C V~2~g L.
C, = co-efficient of holes in box = C V2~g 0.
C,= co-efficient of clearance space = C VT31' Y.
To simplify calculations without introducing any serious error, since the
total quantity passing thru the clearance space is very small, we can write
Ca=V2g d, where d is 1/3 of the total height of the box multiplied by i.
Q = Qi + Q* + Lh = — C.aY'A + C2Y'A + C3Y'A- Y'A
(Ca + C + C) (1)
Y-K = C, a/Q + C JQ + CJQ.
Combining constants we may write,—
1
- (Cta + Ct)'
Squaring the denominator and combining constants,—
Y=... .' r~r (2)
C«a- 4- C; a -j- C,
Now the effective weight of water contained in the box at any time
equals W f b Y, and substituting for Y its valve found in (2) we have,—
•(3)
W f 0 Y = _ .. , „ 7—^-
From the construction of the device it is apparent that there is only one
position of the box at which the arms are horizontal. To simplify our calcu-
lations let us assume that the arms are horizontal, when a = U. Whenever
the arms are not horizontal, the horizontal pressure of the water against the
box will produce a turning movement about those ends of the arms which
are pivoted to the sides of the channel. This movement we will call negative


since it tends to prevent the downward movement of the box. This tendency
or upward force on the box is equal to
Horizontal Projection of N
but since N is large with respect to (U-a) we here assume for simplicity that
the horizontal projection of N equals N. Therefore we can write that equa-
tion (4) equals,—
W/aN( Y + e)\U—0)= k, U — k,a) (F! -\-2eY + e1
where W/2N = K3. This equals,—
k,U Y: + kzU2e Y + k,Ue* — kza Y — 2ek,oY — Sk^i.
Combining constants and substituting for Y its value in (2) we get

The total weight to be supported by the box end of the rocker at any
time is equal to the algebraic sum of t, (3), and (5). For equilibrium of the
rocker we must have 5 M=0 or the weight on the box end of the rocker
work done by the other end. Therefore we may write

Also 5 work = O, or the work done on one end of the rocker must equal the
work done by the other end. Therefore we may write

This can be integrated by factoring the third and fifth terms. Let (A) rep-
resent the left hand side of (7). Solving (7) for Z we have Z = V2/rC (A).


57
Substituting this value for Z in (6) we have an expression for x in terms of
known constants and "a." We will not write this expression but will call it
equation (9).
The value of some of these constants will change as "a" changes due to
changes in the value of the coefficients of discharge.
With equations (2) and (9) we can construct a table containing the cor-
responding values of x, Y, and a.
Referring now to figure 4, which is a diagrammatic sketch of part of the
rocker arm, let E represent the box end of the rocker, and the line M N the
bracket upon which it rocks. The remaining part of our problem is: Given
the corresponding values of x and a; to determine the corresponding values
of the radius of curvature of that curve which will give us those correspond-
ing values of x and a when rocked on the plane M N. For if we know the
value of the various radii of curvature corresponding to the various values
of x and a, we can construct the curve by a succession of short arcs.
Let P=the difference betwen two sucessive values of "a."
r = the radius of curvature corresponding to this particular value
of P.
® = the angle between r and the line joining E with this center of curv-
ature.
* = the angle thru which the arm rocks.
d = 0—$.
R = the distance from E to the center of curvature.
J = the length of the arc which comes in contact with M N while E
moves thru a vertical distance P.

J' = r &lt;t&gt; therefore r = J/&lt;t&gt; and since &lt;P = 8 — a we have r = // 9 — a • but since
6 = tan-1 Ti/r, and o = tan-1 x~J(r -\-P), we have
J
tan-1 xjr — tan-1 Xt/{r + P)
This can be solved by successive approximations, using for the first
approximation the value of r given by the approximate solution above. This
permits us to construct the curve of the rocker.
The headgate shown in Fig. (2) was constructed in accordance with
these principles, and while the coefficient of discharge of the main orifice,
under the lip was not definitely known when this headgate was designed, it
discharges a constant stream of 4 sec. ft., within 4.2%, regardless of fluctua-
tions of water surface in the canal or in the lateral ditch, so long as the water
surface in the canal is at least 3 tenths of a foot above the water surface in
the lateral.
A very important feature of the gate is its adjustability.
The size of the stream to be discharged may be regulated so as to meet
a seasonal decline in the supply or a variation in the demand of the lateral.
By the use of narrow strips of boards placed betvven the angle irons
shown at R (Fig. 1), and into the small groove in the channel bottom shown
at T (Fig. 1), the orifice under the lip can be shortened laterally, a small
clearance space being left between the strips and the box so that the box does
not run on the strips. These strips, which are a part of every headgate, are
made of such width that each board will shut off, say, 2 tenths of a sec. ft.
When the discharge is changed in this manner the remaining flow is
automatically maintained constant as before.
From the construction of this headgate it will be seen that with a given
rocker and a given width of channel the stiffness of the springs will depend
upon the capacity (cubical contents) of the box, and this capacity depends
on the depth (dimension b Fig. 3) of the box. Now there are certain f ric-•


tional resistances to be overcome in moving the box and these resistances are
quite independent of the stiffness of the springs. But the two opposing
forces—the weight of water in the box and the pull of the springs—which
are brought to bear in overcoming those resistances are dependent on the
depth of the box, and the depth of the box is in turn governed by the amount
of frictional (or other) resistances.
By the use of these head-gates the following can be accomplished:—
A stream of the desired size can be diverted from a canal into a lateral
with but slight loss of head. The size of the stream will be maintained con-
stant regardless of fluctuations of water surface in the canal or lateral. By
simply multiplying the size of the stream by the time during which it runs,
the total quantity delivered, in second-foot-hours (or in acre feet), can be
determined. From the point of view of the Superintendent and of the Irri-
gator the most efficient use of the water can be accomplished.
These head-gates have so far only been made in the smaller sizes, thirty
five second-feet capacity being the largest, but it is the writer's aim to make
them adaptable to larger sizes, suitable for main canal intakes and regulat-
ing works.

EDWARD J. SMITH. 'I5E
In the issue of the Michigan Technic dated May, 1914, is a description
of the refrigeration plant together with a description of a method for supply-
ing heat to the hrine by means of an electric brine heater. This brine heater,
altho theoretically ideal, was not a success and its use had to be discontinued.
The heater itself might have been successful had it not been for mechanical
difficulties encountered in its construction and to difficulty encountered in
keeping the brine box full of brine. These difficulties came to light while the
heater was in operation and they consisted in the warping of the metal jacket
which surrounded the heating element whose ultimate failure allowed the
brine to come in contact with the resistance ribbon thus short circuiting the
heating element and burning it out.
A new heater has been developed and tested out. This new heater has
given no trouble in several trial tests and has worked excellently under the
most severe conditions.
The heater consists of six ten inch lengths of 1-% inch wrought iron
pipe connected together with two 2-l/2 inch branch tees. This heater is
erected in a vertical plane with the branch tees on a slope of about one inch to
the foot. Steam is led into the upper branch tee thru a y$ inch pipe and the
condensate is led from the lower branch tee by a 2-^/2 inch pipe containing a
thermometer well. This 2-J/&gt; inch pipe is reduced to a 24 incn pipe which
contains a water seal to prevent steam from escaping. The pipe terminates
in a cooling coil for cooling the condensate down to room temperature.
From this cooling coil the condensate runs into the weighing buckets.
A novel method has been devised for regulating the steam supplied to
the heater. A steam separator is placed in the J4 inch pipe leading to the
heater to insure dry steam at the pressure desired. Directly below this sep-
arator is a cock with a series of orifices in the plug. These orifices serve a
double purpose, that of reducing the pressure of the steam from the pressure
in the steam main to atmospheric pressure and also gives a means of predeter-
mining the amount of steam passing thru the heater. The value of this
method may be seen when one considers the difficulty of opening a valve to
exactly the same place every time desired or of regulating the amount of
steam passing thru a valve with any degree of accuracy. With these orifices
one may regulate the amount of steam flowing by either varying the pressure
above the orifice or by varying the area of the orifice or both. The amount of
steam flowing thru these orifices follows the law W = Pa/70 very closely.
The chamber containing the heater is the one made for the electric
heater. It is made of wood with air spaces to afford good thermal insulation.
This chamber is brine tight and is connected in the brine circuit in such a
manner that the brine cooler, heater, and brine pump form a closed circuit.


Computations for Designing Heater.

13 X 2000 X 144 = I56,ooo B.T. Us.
24
per hour that the machine is capable of taking up from the brine when work-
ing at rated capacity.
Considering the steam supplied to the heater to be dry and at a pressure
of 100 lbs. per sq. in. abs. we find that it has a total heat of 1186.3 B.T.Us.
per lb. above 32°F.
Assuming that the condensate will leave the heater at a temperature
above 32°F, say 50°F we have each pound of steam giving up
1186.3 —18.08= 1168.22 R. T. Us.
Now
^2. = 136.6 lbs.
1168.22
of steam which will be necessary for the heater to condense each hour in
order to supply the required amount of heat to the brine.
Kent gives the following table for heating water by steam coils and as
the heating of the brine is similar the table was consulted.
Mean temperature Lbs. of steam condensed per hour per sq. ft.
difference. per degree difference of temp.
50 0.150
100 0.185
150 0.215
200 0.240
Now with no back pressure on the heater there will be steam on the inside
of the coils at atmosphere pressure containing 1186.3 B.T.Us. per lb. which
gives superheated steam at a temperature of about 287°F.
Considering the brine entering the heater at I7°F which is about ice
making conditions there is a difference in temperature between the inside and
outside of the heater pipes of about 27o°F.
Referring back to the table, we can safely say that 0.25 lbs. of steam will
be condensed per hour per sq. ft. of heating surface per degree difference in
temperature.
Then 270 x .25 = 67.5 lbs. of steam will be consensed per hour per sq.
ft. of heating surface.
133-6
Now &lt; 2 sq. ft. of heating surface will be necessary. Con-
67-5
sidering pipe \\\ inches in diameter each linear foot gives .328 sq. ft. of
heating surface.

= 6.1 linear feet of pipe necessary to give 2 sq. ft. of surface.
.328
Owing to the fact that the box to contain the heater was one used with
the old electric heater the maximum length of pipe that could be used be-
tween the branch tees was 10 inches. For this reason 6-10 inch lengths of


ij4 inch pipe were used and it was assumed that the remainder of the heating
surface would be made up by the two branch tees which, although thick, had
over twice as much surface as was lacked by the pipes. It will be interesting
to note some incidents which occured during the trials of the heater.
In the first place it was feared that with low temperature of the brine,
the heater would freeze up but the peculiar thing about the condensate was
that with the lowest brine temperature obtained, the temperature of the con-
densate leaving the heater was never less than I40°F.
Below is given data from a couple of preliminary tests.

A couple of tests were run with the brine both entering and leaving the
heater at temperatures below o°F. and it was found that the temperature
of the condensate was always well above ioo°F from which the conclusion
was reached that the heater would work under the most severe temperature
conditions.
The next thing that attracted our attention was the low capacity and we
set out to find the reason for it. The explanaion was found in the fact that
the brine temperatures were too low and the heat transfer from the brine
to the ammonia gas was not as rapid as it should be owing to their tem-
peratures being too nearly the same. Under the same conditions as run 1
with the brine entering the heater at i6°F instead of 2°F the capacity was
more than doubled, while under the same conditions as run 2 with brine
entering the heater at 2i°F a capacity of over 10 tons was obtained.
Several recent tests on the plant have indicated that it will not develop
rated capacity under ice making conditions and the following conclusion
has been reached: the expansion coils are either too small or are coated with
sediment to such an extent that the heat transfer from the brine to the am-
monia gas is impaired.


CURRENT DISTRIBUTION FROM NEW
UNIVERSITY PLANT
JAMES J. MARKS, B.S. IN M.E.. 1908
SUPERINTENDENT OF BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS. UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
With completion of the new heat,
light, and power plant on Washington
Street and the tunnel connecting it to
the Campus, the problem of abandon-
ing the old plant on the Campus and
changing the steam and electrical sys-
tem for distribution from the new
plant presented itself for solution.
The change in steam distribution,
while not entirely simple, did not in-
volve so complete a change as that
required to adapt the old electrical dis-
tribution system to the new plant.
The old Power House contained 350
K. W. in generators for 220 volts di-
rect current and all of the distribution
systems throughout the tunnels and
buildings including a pole line to the
University Hospital were arranged ac-
cordingly.
The new Power Plant generates
2300 volt 3 phase 60 cycles alternating
current and has one 500 K. W. unit
at the present time. In order to pro-
vide for break-down service arrange-
ments have been made with the East-
ern Michigan Edison Company for
primary service to the switchboard
buses.
The main problem was to furnish
current at 220 volts to all the build-
ings and as almost all circuits have
motors or special direct current appar-
atus, a simple change from direct cur-
rent to alternating current was not
possible. Provision had to be made
for furnishing direct current from the
new plant until a gradual change to
alternating current could be effected.
Accordingly two 150 K. W\ direct
current generators driven by 2300 volt
synchronous motors were purchased
and arranged for both series and par-
allel running. The series running was
selected in order to have 500 volts for
a future electric locomotive for switch-
ing on the mile of side track to the
new plant, and in order to save invest-
ment in copper to carry the current to
the Campus, which copper will not be
necessary when the change to alternat-
ing current is completed. The mach-
ines are not connected for both to be
operated in parallel at the present
time, though equalizer connections are
provided on the generators. The par-
allel running is only used when one
machine is operated on light night
loads.
The direct current is carried to the
switchboard in the old plant by three
wires at 500-250 volts. An additional
bus bar was placed on the old board
and feeder circuits balanced against
each other giving 250 volts on the
original feeders as before. There is
one objectional feature to this ar-
rangement, and that is that polarity
must be reversed on alternate circuits
when a motor generator is cut out at
the new plant. The reason for this is
that the neutral becomes alternately
plus and minus according as the one or
the other of the series generators is
cut out and the other thrown to the
parallel position. This reversal of pol-
arity changes the direction of current
through arc lamps used in projection
lanterns and requires a short wait in
switching in order to permit no-volt-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
age releases on motors to operate. This
trouble will only be temporary, how-
ever, as the direct current load will
soon be lightened so that the three
wire transmission line from the old to
the new plant can be abandoned.
The alternating current is carried
in three conductor lead cables in ducts
in the tunnel leading from the new
plant to the Substation located between
the Medical Building and the Gymna-
sium. There is a distributing board
there from whence cables are being
laid in underground ducts to under-
ground transformer stations located
to feed groups of buildings in an
economic manner. There are two feed-
ers going west and two south from the
Substation one each for power and
light in each direction. Eventually
these feeders will form a ring system
for both light and power.
By the ring arrangement it will be
possible to sectionalize the feeder be-
tween any two transformer subways in
order to work on the cable or trans-
formers without disturbing the rest of
the system. In each subway the trans-
former tap to the feeder is fused, and
on either side of the tap is a three
pole enclosed disconnecting switch es-
pecially designed and constructed for
this service. Each end of the ring is
provided with an automatic oil switch
in the Substation to protect the cable
against overload.
The subways are eight feet wide by
six feet high, large enough to contain
three power and three lighting trans-
formers as large as 75 K.V.A. and
still leave plenty of room for working
in the subway.
To date, February 1st 1915, the
Law, Main, and Chemical Buildings
have been changed to the alternating
current system, and the conduits have
been laid and subways built for reach-
ing the Gymnasium, Medical, Physiol-
ogy, Economics, Surveying, Engineer-
ing, Engineering Shops, and new Sci-
ence Buildings, all of which will be
changed from direct to alternating
current for lighting and partially for
power within the next few months.
All of this work has been accom-
plished without interruption of service
except for about an hour and a half
on one Sunday morning during the
Christmas recess when the extra bus
was put on the old plant board, and at
that time service was not discontinued
to either hospital as it was furnished
directly from the motor generators
in the new plant.


RESEARCH
CIVIL
Sanitary Engineering
At the sanitary experiment station, the
sewage disposal plant has been in operation
for nearly a year. A connection in Glenn
Avenue, with the Ann Arbor sewerage system
supplies the station with a continuous flow
of sewage,which is at present treated by two
general methods. Part of the sewage is
passed1 thru a full depth septic tank for sed-
imentation and digestion, after which it is
automatically closed on to contact filters.
After remaining in the contact filters for a
stipulated time it is flushed on to sand
filters, whence it passes off into the Huron
river as a clear, odorless and attractive
water. The contact filters, mentioned
above, receive only half of the effluent from
the septic tank, the other half alternately
going on to two other primary contact
filters from which it goes on to two second-
ary contact filters and then into the river.
In addition to the above equipment which
is complete in itself there is a full depth
Imhoff tank unit, which receives the other
portion of the raw sewage. After the
sewage has been exposed to the anerobic
process, which takes place in the Imhoff
tank, it is aerated by means of a sprinkling
or trickling filter, the clear odorless efflu-
ent of which is discharged into the Huron.
In the operation of this plant the aim is
to determine, by special investigation, the
nature of these sewage treatment processes
under typical Michigan conditions, of soil,
climate, and sewage, and by using filter
media which are readily obtainable in
Michigan. Another field of investigation,
which comes within the scope of the sani-
tary engineer, has recently begun to receive
the attraction of the sanitary experiment
station, and that is a series of tests of
vitrified clay and cement sewer pipe to de-
termine both strength and durability. The
purpose of making these tests is to establish
a standard for Michigan sewer pipe and to
classify, according to their standard, the
pipe that are offered for sale on the Mich-
igan market, so that municipalities and in-
dividuals in this state who have occasion
to buy and install sewer pipe may have
reliable information to guide them in their
buying. The station is generously supplied
with test samples shipped in by pipe man-
ufacturers who are interested to know the
relative qualities of their product. The
methods and apparatus used are those re-
commended by the committee of the "Am-
erican Society for Testing Materials."
Among the graduate students who are
conducting the research work of the Sani-
tary Department this year, Mr. J. W.
Follin, B. C. E. '13, is in charge of the
station and is directing its operation in
detail. In addition, he is making a sanitary
survey of the Grand River in and below
Jackson, Mich., with a view to determine
the amount and character of the self-purifi-
cation of that stream. The Grand River
receives a tremendous burden of sewage in
passing Jackson and ultimately its waters
are used as a source of water supply by the
city of Grand Rapids.
Mr. Albert Roth, B. C. E. '14, has been
conducting an extensive series of tests on
required of such nozzles is exceedingly
to distribute the effluent of Imhoff or Sep-
tic tanks over trickling filters. The duty
required of such nozzels is exceedingly
exacting, so much so, that many of those
now in use have failed to give satisfaction.
The object of this investigation is not only
to compare those now in use, but also to
develop, if possible a new form of nozzle.
Mr. A. N. Laird, B. C. E., '14, has been
making a complete design with working
drawings for a sewerage and sewage dis-
posal plant, to be installed during the com-
ing summer, at Camp Davis, on Douglas
Lake. The sanitary equipment of the camp
at the present time is of the most primitive
character and altho no serious effects have
been felt, it is Prof. Johnston's aim to put
the Camp in the most sanitary condition
possible. The design of the plant presented
many unique problems since its operation


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
will be suspended during the greater part
of the year and it must stand idle during
the cold northern winter without undue
deterioration.
Mr. L. G. Lenhardt, B. C. E., '14, is
making an investigation of the extent and
character of the pollution in inter-state
streams and also the subsequent use of
such streams as sources of public water
supply. This work is one phase of a larger
problem being undertaken by a special com-
mittee of the American Society of Civil
Engineers.
Mr. W. G. Harmon, B. C. E., '09, is
working out the details of a special form
of contact filter for sewage treatment,
known as the slate filter.
This type of filter was first used in
England, but its possibilities have not been
fully developed. Mr. Harmon is devoting
the greater part of his time to sewer pipe
tests, referred to above.
Hydraulic Engineering
Mr. Frank L. Bolton has constructed a
flume in the river just below the Argo dam
for the purpose of investigating the loss of
head of water flowing through trash racks,
similar to those placed at the entrance to
wheel pits in power houses. His experi-
ments are along new lines and should pro-
vide some useful data.
Mr. F. D. Nagler has taken advantage of
the opportunity afforded by Mr. Bolton's
flume to obtain data relative to the obstruc-
tion to flow caused by bridge piers of dif-
ferent decigns. His investigation is orig-
inal and his results will doubtless be of
great value to the profession.
Mr. C. N. Ward and Mr. L. O. Waite
are working together on an investigation
of the relation between precepitation and
stream discharge. Their study covers the
available data for sixty water sheds and it
is hoped that they will be able to throw
some additional light on this complicated
subject.
Mr. C. O. Wisler is investigating the
posibility of determining the velocity of
moving water by means of pressure meas-
urements.
Mr. Wihtred Cook is investigating the
storage possibilities of the St. Joseph river,
as a means of regulating the flow of the
stream and preventing the floods. This has
included a thorough field examination which
covered a three months period.
Mr. A. Ruettgers is engaged in a compila-
tion of data relative to the causes of dam
failures in this and other countries.
Mr. K. F. Keeler, Mr. H. C. Smith and
Mr. G. F. Prussing are preparing to carry
on a set of experiments for the purpose of
throwing additional light on the new meth-
od of chemical gaging of stream flow.
MECHANICAL.
Mechanical Laboratory.
Several researches of interest are being
conducted in the Mechanical Laboratory this
semester by the men who have elected the
M. E. 22 Course.
The calibration of sharp edged orifices
placed in pipes carrying compressed air is
being continued from last semester by
Messrs. E. J. Smith, H. S. Parsons and S.
L. Thomas.
At the suggestion of Prof. Verner, a
series of experiments has been commenced
to determine the coefficient of friction of
low pressure steam flowing in pipes
Messrs. L. T. Daggy and J. R. Moser are
working on this.
The work on the Round Oak hot air
furnace has progressed to the point where
it seems that the developement of the ap-
paratus has been completed and extensive
tests can be begun. Messrs. Wyrth Allen,
H. F. Hutzel, and J. D. Roacli have this
work.
Messrs. R. C. McAllister and J. Le Valley
have begun some experiments to determine
the coefficient of flow of steam thru sharp
edged orifices. This work is parallel to
the work on the calibration of similar or-
ifices for air.
It is hoped that some results of value
will be obtained this semester from the ap-
paratus, located in the Mold Loft, for de-
termining the coefficients of heat transfer
thru walls of buildings. Messrs. Crocker
and Tazelaar have undertaken this work.

ELECTRICAL.
Professor A. H. Lovell has been engaged
in some studies on methods of preventing
rapid deterioration of lead sheath in over-
head telephone cable work and in conjunc-
tion with Professor Menefee has investi-
gated the elastic limits and modulus of
various types of steel messenger cable and
standard telephone cables from 25-pair up
to 600-pair. Dr. Randall of the Physics
Department has studied the coefficient of
expansion for the same cables using the
"heat treatment" method. Curves are being
prepared for stringing the cables so as to
bring the expansion of lead cable and steel
messenger as near together as possible in
order to eliminate excessive movement of
the cable and consequent destruction of the
lead sheath of same.
The Disco Company are now putting on
the market an electric starting and lighting
outfit manufactured under the patents of
Professor Benj. F. Bailey.
Prof. Bailey is at present conducting ex-
tensive Storage Battery tests for the De-
troit Storage Battery Company.
CHEMICAL.
At the request of the State Grange, the
University of Michigan has instituted an
investigation to determine, if, thru control
by specifications, the quality of fence wire
sold in the State can be improved. The
Chemical Engineering Department has the
supervision of this investigation.
ENGINEERING SOCIETY
CIVIL BRANCH
With the assistance of the Faculty of the
Civil Department two practicing engineers
of more than local reputation have thus far
been invited to speak under the auspices of
this Branch. On Friday, Nov. 20th, Mr.
Edmund T. Perkins, President of the Na-
tional Drainage Congress, gave an illustrat-
ed lecture on "The Reclamation of Arid
and Wet Lands" before some 300 members
of the Engineering College. Thursday,
February nth, Mr. H. H. Essylstyn, of the
Edison Illuminating Co. and President of
the Detroit Engineering Society, gave an
account of the construction of the Connors
Creek powerhouse. His talk was profusely
illustrated with progress pictures.
At the regular January meeting of the
Branch, Prof. W. C. Hoad explained the
workings of the Dewey Decimal System
of indexing as applied to the reference li-
brary of the practicing engineer. Outlines
of this system, consisting of bound mimeo-
graphed sheets, were prepared under Prof.
Hoad's direction and sold t.o the members
at the close of the lecture. Copies of this
outline may be obtained at the Technic
desk or from the Secretary, at 10 cents per
copy.
The committee on membership has been
conducting a personal canvas of the civil
group with the result that most of the
Civil seniors and a fair proportion of un-
derclassmen are members of the Civil
Branch.
MARINE.
Some time ago experiments were made
in the Naval Tank upon feathering paddle
wheels. The results were published in a
report of the Army Engineers upon Ex-
perimental Towboats, Prof. Bragg is now
engaged in correlating the results of these
experiments upon models with trial trip
results obtained from full-sized wheels.
During the coming semester part of the
experimtal work in the Naval Tank will be
devoted to investigations relative to the re-
sistance and speed of Submarines.
MECHANICAL BRANCH.
A regular meeting of the Local Branch
of the A. S. M. E. was held Thursday night,
February the seventeenth. Professor An-
derson, of the Mechanical Engineering De-
partment, made a very interesting talk on
the various fields of Engineering open to
the Mechanical Engineer. He spoke es-
pecially of the wide fields open to the En-
gineer in Efficiency or Industrial Engineer-
ing and in Automobile Engineering. Pro-
fessor Anderson says, that Efficiency En-
gineering is not confined to Shops and Fac-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
tories, but is applicable to any plant in gen-
eral. True Efficiency Engineering consists
not alone in increasing output, but at the
same time decreasing the cost of the pro-
duct. An idea of the field of the Automobile
Engineer may be gained when it is consid-
ered that the Automobile Industry is the
third largest in the world. Among other
fields open to the Mechanical, he mention-
ed, Operating, Steam, Contracting, and De-
signing Engineering. Other important fields
open to this class of man, are, Heating,
Ventilating and Refrigerating Engineering;
Steam and Railway Steam Engineering and
for the older men, there is always a good
field for the Consulting Engineer. "Too
many," says Professor Anderson, "make
the mistake of going into Consulting Eng-
ineering when they are too young and
have not yet made their reputations as good
and experienced Engineers."
Later in the evening, a business meeting
was held and plans laid down for a mem-
bership campaign among the Sophomores
and Juniors. The semi-annual election of
officers was held and W. W. Tuttle was
elected President and H. S. Manwaring,
Secretary-Treasurer. The local branch is
growing rapidly and efforts will be made to
point to both Junior and Sophomore, the
great benefits to be derived from member-
ship in this organization. Two meetings
will be held in March, at which there will
be speakers from large factories, probably
with illustrated lectures.
ELECTRICAL BRANCH.
Shawanigan Falls Power Plant.
The Student section of the A. I. E. E.
was addressed January 7th, by Asst. Prof.
T. J. MacKavanagh, who took as his sub-
ject, the development of the power avail-
able at Shawinigan falls on the St. Marice
river, in Canada. This river, which drains
an area of eighteen thousand square miles,
takes a drop of one hundred and fifty feet
at the site of the power plant. The head
thus created is now used in the production
of 100,000 electrical horse-power, which is
transmitted eighty-seven miles at a tension
of 100,000 volts, to Montreal and Quebec.
Near the latter city the power will be sup-
plied to a large district in which three
quarters of the world's supply of asbestos
is mined.
This lecture was repeated before the Ann
Arbor-Detroit section, on January 22nd.
A paper, the "Growth of a Modern Util-
ity," was presented by Mr. J. B. Gordon,
'06, before the Detroit-Ann Arbor section
of the A. I. E. E. This paper covered in
an interesting manner, with slides and mov-
ing pictures, the history of the telephone
with present status and opportunities in the
business. The pictures brought out details
of telephone plant equipment and also
showed views of the transcontinental line
under process of construction. Mr. Gordon
is district plant supervisor for the Central
District Telephone Co., Wheeling, W. Va.
On January 21st, Mr. Fishback, of the
Electric Controlled Co., Cleveland, O., gave
a very interesting lecture on the "Use of
Electricity in Steel Mills." The paper was
accompanied by slides showing the applica-
tion of electric drive in a number of large
steel plants.
CHEMICAL BRANCH.
The American Chemical Society has re-
cently decided to extend to students of
chemistry certain priveleges of the society
at a reduced rate. Undergratuates may
subscribe to the Journal of the society or
to the Journal of Industrial and Engineer-
ing Chemistry, for three dollars per year.
The regular rate for either of these pub-
lications is six dollars. The subscription
must be accompanied by a statement from
one of the instructors in chemistry that the
applicant is a student. Undergraduates
may become student members for six dol-
lars per year with all priveleges of the so-
ciety, except that he shall receive but one of
the society journals instead of all three
that the society publishes. A student
member must become a full participating
member on January 1st following his grad-
uation. In addition any student properly
recommended may become a full member
of the society at the regular rate of ten
dollars per year. Any student wishing to

avail himself of these priveleges should see
Prof. Willard, who is the Secretary of the
University of Michigan Section of Jthe so-
ciety.
IX THE DEPARTMENT
Commonwealth Power Appraisal.
The College of Engineering has been asked
by the Michigan Railroad Commission to
investigate the different electric properties
which it is proposed to merge in a single
corporation to be known as the Consumers
Power Company.
These several properties, eleven in all,
have been separately valued by Dean Cooley
and Professors Riggs and Anderson during
the past five years and now they are to be
re-examined to bring the valuation to date.
They are to be considered as a single pro-
perty.
The amount involved is above $25,000,000
and the work must be completed before the
end of March if possible.
CIVIL.
Highway Engineering.
In pursuance of the university policy of
extension service the College of Engineer-
ing recently completed a short course in
highway engineering. The course, which
was held from February 15th to 20th, was
given under the direct supervision of the
College of Engineering in co-operation with
the Michigan State Highway Department.
The lectures were well attended, there
being 168 enrolled. All of the larger coun-
ties of the state were represented.
The purpose of the course was to supply
to highway commissioners and engineers
information in regard to the construction
and maintenance of country roads which
is very much in demand but extremely dif-
ficult for the individual to get. It also
brought together the commissioners and en-
gineers for a general discussion of their
duties and work. Many of those in at-
tendance brought or sent in samples of road
material that were tested in the highway
laboratory. The general program consisted
of classroom work in the mornings follow-
ed by discussions, and laboratory instruct-
ion in the afternoons. Papers were pre-
sented in the afternoons and evenings. The
meeting closed Saturday, February 20, with
an inspection trip about the University at
which the senior Civil Engineers acted as
guides. A luncheon was given at the close
of this trip in the gymnasiums, at which
President Hutchins, Dean Cooley, Mr. Rog-
ers and others gave short talks.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Laboratory.
Evinrudc Boat Motor.
The Mechanical Laboratory is in receipt
of a boat motor from the Evinrude Motor
Co., of Milwaukee, Wis., which has been
loaned to the Department on the following
plan. The motor is loaned for test in the
Laboratory or for practical use by teachers
and students until the summer vacation. At
that time it will be sold at a discount of
25%, to any one wishing to buy it, or will
be returned to the factory. At the begin-
ning of the next school year, the Company
will send another motor of the latest type
under the same conditions and will follow
the same plan from year to year.
Scars-Roebuck Gasoline Engine.
The Sears-Roebuck Co. have kindly
loaned the Mechanical Laboratory one of
their 5 H.P. Economy gasoline engines for
illustration and experimental purposes. The
engine will soon be installed and ready for
operation.
Sullivan Air Meter.
Through the courtesy of Mr. M. R. Blish,
'11E., who is now with the Sullivan Ma-
chinery Co., of Chicago, his company has
very kindly offered the Mechanical Laba-
ratory the loan of one of their hydraulic
air meters, for use in the calibration of
orifices for the measurement of air. A
great deal of interest is being exhibited in
these tests and the hydraulic meter will be
of great assistance in the work.
Armstrong Steam Trap.
The Armstrong Machine Works, of Three
Rivers, Mich., has contributed a cutout
model of the No. 2 Steam Trap, which
they manufacture. This trap will furnish
a valuable addition to the illustrative appa-
ratus of the Department.
The Engineering Record for December
26th, 1914, published a continuation of Prof.
Zov.ski's article on hydraulic turbines.
ELECTRICAL.
Professor Higbee is at present writing
the second volume of his text on 'Alterna
ting Current Electricity." A serial article
written by Professor Higbee, "The Aims
and Methods of Engineering Education" is
now being published in the quarteily maga-
zine of Tan Beta Pi.
Xew Equipment.
A 2 K. W. Dynamotor and a 5 H. P.
3-phase squirrel cage induction motor hav:
been installed in the E.E. Laboratory. A
large amount of used apparatus has been
given the Department by the Edison Co. of
Detroit, Mich. This includes seven trans-
formers, a large inductor alternator, a 4600
volt electrolytic lightning arrester, 40 me-
ters, including ammeters, voltmeters, watt-
meters, frequency meters, and electrostatic
ground detectors, a motor starting compen-
sator, and several rheostats and circuit
breakers, both of the carbon-break and oil-
break types. A complete Ford magnet has
also been presented by the Ford Co.
MARINE.
Society of Naval Architects.
Professor H. C. Sadler, who presented
a paper, "The Expansion and Contraction
of Ship Forms and the Effect Upon Resis-
tance," before the Society of Naval Archi-
tects in December, has been re-elected a
member of the Council of the Society.
.-AVIATION IN THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN.
Several years ago enthusiasts of aviation
among the student body of the University
found encouragement and support from
Prof. H. C. Sadler, Head of the Marine
Department, and a University Aero Club
was organized.
Prof. Sadler constructed a wind tunnel
for investigating the behavior of various
bodies in wind currents, and the members
of the Club constructed a biplane glider
which furnished them with amusement dur-
ing 1911-12 and 1912-13. The untimely end
of this product of the Club put an end to
any further amusement in this direction.
Aviation in the University received fur-
ther encouragement with the coming in
1912, of Mr. Pawlowski The latter was
instrumental in bringing to the University,
in the fall of 1913, Prof. Marchis, of the


7i
University of Paris and Head Professor
of Aeronautics there. Prof. Marchis de-
livered a series of four lectures on Aero-
nautics while in Ann Arbor, giving full in-
formation in regard to the aero labora-
tories at his University and at the Eiffel
laboratories, these two being among the
best equipped in the world. He also spoke
on the most recent achievements in aviation,
such as looping the loop, hydro-aeroplanes,
and the latest French dirigibles.
Prof. Marchis' visit to the University did
much to stimulate interest in aviation and
added largely to the realization of the ne-
cessity of regular courses in Aeronautics,
to be given in the University. Unfortun-
ately, Prof. Pawlowski's English would not
permit him to take over this work and the
establishment of these courses was post-
poned for a year.
In the meantime, however, the Aero Club
flourished and a number of lectures were
given in the theory of Aeronautics in
which Mr. Pawlowski took part and a
second glider was constructed. This second
attempt was larger than the first, but pre-
pared with more haste than care and re-
flection, and as a result, came to an un-
timely end.
At the beginning of the academic year of
1914-15, the Aero Club went out of exist-
ance, not so much on account of the lack
of interest of the student-body, as on the
account of the lack of two or three men
with sufficient initiative to push the thing
properly. Thanks to the efforts of Mr.
Pawlowski, who received the support of
the other faculty heads, regular courses
are now to be had in Aeronautics.
There are three of these courses now
given by Mr. Pawlowski,under the auspices
of the Marine Engineering Department.
Two of these courses are on the Theory
of Aviation, called Aeronautics I and II.
The first of these deals with the general
questions relating to the aero-dynamics of
planes and the stability, resistance, and con-
trol of aeroplanes. The second course deals
with the propulsion of aeroplanes, propeller
design, and the principae features of the
various types of motors used.
The third course is in Aeroplane design,
consisting of lectures and drawing room
work in which all the details of the actual
construction of an aeroplane are discussed,
and a complete design made to fulfil a given
set of conditions.
ENGINEERING MECHANICS.
Area-Meter.
An instrument called an area-meter has
been designed by Mr. John Airey, of the
Engineering Mechanics Faculty, and is near-
ing completion in the Engineering Shops.
This instrument is to be used for obtaining
areas, either of plots of land or of railway
embankment, cross sections, etc., directly
in the field, thereby avoiding much office
work in computing. The operation requires
only the tracing of the contours of the area
to be measured by the end of a wire; when
the contour can not be closed a slightly
modified means is provided.
Professor Menefee delivered a lecture
before the Detroit National Brick Manu-
facturers Association, February 16, at the
Statler Hotel, Detroit. The general topic
for all speakers was, "A Night of Good
Roads."
SURVEYING.
Bogardus Camp.
With the addition of the 576 acres of
land, the purchase of which was authorized
by the board of regents at a recent meeting,
the University now owns about 2,200 acres
on Douglas and Burt lakes, all of which is
used by the surveying and biological camps.
The land just purchased gives the Univer-
sity complete control of Carp Creek, on
which it is planned to install, within the
next few years, a plant which will supply
the Camps with light and power.
The Faculty of the Surveying and Gco-
dedetic branches of Engineering have
started a thorough study of the relation of
the surveyor and engineer to the law. This
phase of the profession has heretofore been
almost neglected by writers of text books.

posal for Washington, D. C.
ENGINEERING SHOPS
Safety First
The State Accident Inspector has recent-
ly issued an order to the effect that all
dangerous elements of the machinery in
the Engineering Shops be fully protected
by coverings. As a result, all feedgears,
emery wheels, etc., are being covered.
Group Drive
The motive power in the Engineering
shops will be completely modernized after
spring vacation. The old Corliss engine
which has been in use for about twenty-
five years is to be replaced by a set of ten
motors. These are to be installed with as
few changes in the general system now in
use as possible. The group drive system
will be used. The line shafts will be speed-
ed up 50% when the motors are installed,
thus bringing the shops in line with current
machine shop practice. Since the shops
were installed high speed steel has come
into use and the new equipment is to allow
this to be used as extensively as desired.
The familiar old Corliss engine will
probably be moved to the Mechanical Lab-
oratory, leaving the space now occupied by
the engine foundation to be used for the
enlargement of the locker room. The pres-
ent engine room will be an addition to the
instrument shop.
ARCHITECTURAL COLLEGE
Course Notes
Mr. Leon Makielski has been engaged to
teach advanced work in freehand drawing
in the Department of Architecture. Mr.
Makielski studied four years at the Art
Institute of Chicago, won the foreign
scholarship and spent four years abroad in
drawing, painting and travel. During two
of his three years in Paris he exhibited in
the Salon. He also spent about seven
months studying masterpieces of painting
in Italy.
The first convention of Architects of this
state was held in Ann Arbor on Feb. 5.
The primary purpose of this convention
was to formulate the work of a state organ-
ization whose chief aim will be to raise the
standard of the profession. It was pro-
posed to introduce a measure in the Legis-
lature requiring an examination by the
State Board as a preliminary to the admis-
sion of professors to the University of
Michigan. This course is analogous to the
one adopted by the Departments of Law
and Medicine and proposed for the depart-
ment of Engineering.
A combined exhibition of Architectural
drawings by the students of this depart-
ment and of paintings by the Chicago Art
Institute was given at the recent conven-
tion here. The Convention has announced
its intention of coming to Ann Arbor again
next year.
The Department of Architecture has been
invited to send an exhibit of its work to
the Exhibition of the Chicago Architects
Club to be held in April at the Art Insti-
tute of Chicago. This department was one
of the ten leading schools to be invited to
exhibit in Washington during the recent
convention of the American Institute of
Architects.
Research
Research work in History will be given
in the Department of Architecture this
semester for the first time. It will be
known as Architecture 33 with Mr. Sidney
F. Kimball as instructor.
Architectural Society
The Architectural Society held a meeting
Feb. 11, 1915, for the purpose of eelcting a
secretary and: one director. Miss Ruby
Macomber was elected secretary and Mr.
Robert Frantz was elected to the board of
directors.
OJf THE CAMPUS
Campus Nomenclature
The Board of Regents recently adopted
some important changes in the nomen-
clature to be applied to the various depart-
ments and publications of the University.


73
In the future the Engineering Depart-
ment will be known as the College of En-
gineering. The term department will be
applied to: for example, the department of
Physics, etc. The term course is restricted
to the sub-divisions of a subject as, English
I, etc. The term school is restricted to such
departments as require two years of Uni-
versity training to enter, as the Medical
School, the Graduate School. The term
group is to be applied to related subjects
as, the civil engineering group. The term
curriculum is to be applied to a combination
of courses leading to a degree, as the Cur-
ricula in Chemical Engineering. The title
of Junior Professor is changed to that of
Associate Professor.
The names of the University Publications
are also somewhat changed: The Calen-
dar is now known as the "Catalogue of
the University of Michigan for 1915-1916."
The larger publication of each School is to
be called the Announcement of that partic-
ular School, and the smaller ones describing
special facilities are to be known as Bulle-
tins, as the Bulletin of the Forestry Depart-
ment.
These changes are in accord with the
rules and usages of the Carnegie Institute
for the Advancement of Learning and are
in general use in most of the Universities
of the country.
Michigan Engineering Society
Repeating its visit of two years ago, the
Michigan Engineering Society has again
made Ann Arbor the place of its annual
meeting. During the convention in Janu-
ary, the engineering building was frequent-
ed by well known engineers from all over
the state who seemed to take a lively inter-
est in our department and its work.
BOOK REVIEWS
Professor Fessenden's New Book on
Valve Gears
It has been a pleasure to see the material
of this book grow from a few scattering
notes on particular phases of the subject,
into a complete text. On account of the
many revisions and rewritings of the notes,
it is thought that it will be found much
freer from mistakes and errors in presen-
tation, than most first editions of technical
works.
In addition to the general style of the
book, there are four things which especially
distinguish it.
The use of both the Bilgram and Zeuner
diagrams is, as far as is known, unique.
No treatment of the subject of Valve
Gears can be complete, however, or even
satisfactory, without the use of both these
diagrams.
The five problems, covering nearly all
possible cases for the ordinary slide valve,
and completely worked out by the use of
both diagrams, furnish an admirable illus-
tration of the descriptive matter preceding
them, as well as an epitome to which any
one may refer for specific information.
The curve of steam speeds for different
percentages of cut off, together with its
rational derivation, furnishes information
that has long been sought and is to be
regarded as a distinct contribution to the
subject.
The figures show the transverse section
of valve and cylinder, as well as the longi-
tudinal section. This, together with numer-
ous perspective views, will certainly be of
great assistance to a beginner by giving
him a proper conception of the machinery
of which the valve is a part.
There are already several books on Valve
Gears, but the information is so elusive and
covers so much that it is thought that Pro-
fessor Fessenden's book will receive a
ready welcome.

75
This club, which organized shortly before
Christmas, has a membership of nearly a
hundred, a large percentage of which comes
from this corner of the campus. The team
of ten crack shots contains seven engineers,
while three others have been on it at vari-
ous times. Three of the officers, Pres. H.
A. Moul, Secy. F. A. Rowe, and Treas. M.
B. Cutting and the faculty member of the
board of directors, Mr. F. R. Finch, are
engineers. Mr. C. E. Wilson, Instr. in
Mech. Engr., is an honorary member.
The club is at present holding competi-
tive shoots with other schools thru the
country, three of these having been met
with great credit to the local organization.
As a result, the University is receiving
added attention in the press thruout the
state. It is to be hoped that the student
body will not only maintain, but increase
its present interest in the club for the abil-
ity of citizens to shoot straight is what the
defense of the country may some day be
dependent upon.
The following engineers are members:
A. C. Simons, H. D. Aspland, M. B.
Cutting, N. H. Davidson, W. R. DeGowin,
L. E. Delph, W. R. Harvey, F. K. Hirth,
E. K. McAllister, M. A. McKenzie, E. H.

The T-Square Society
When women first enrolled in the Engin-
eering Department they naturally felt
somewhat out of place among so many
men. The wives of the Engineering Fac-
ulty took a great deal of interest in the
women and, from the first, entertained them
a great deal at their homes. This year,
however, with thirteen women enrolled in
the department, the task of entertaining
so many became rather difficult. The young
women realized this and so decided to form
a society and hold meetings about once a
month. One main idea of the society was
to make the freshmen women feel at home.
Other objects were to promote sociability
and discuss things of general interest. The
name decided upon was "The T-Square
Society" and the pin a crossed T-square
and triangle. All women enrolled in the
Department of Engineering and Architec-
ture are ipso facto members. Meetings
are held on the second Friday of every
month in the Engineering Society rooms.
The officers of the society are: Pres. Hazel
Quick, 'isE, V-Pres. Alice Goff, '15E, Secy.
Ruby Macomber, 'i7Arch., Treas. Dorothy
Hall, '18E, Sargeant at Arms, Dorothy
Sturgeon, '17E. Mrs. Green and Miss Ban-
croft are honorary members.
Architecture "999"
Although no member of the Tcchnic
staff was present at the last meeting of the
T-Square society, it appears from evidence
found the next day in the Engineering
Society rooms that the society has taken up
the practical study of architectural con-
struction. Some wonderful results have
been obtained with toothpicks and parrafine
as a medium.
We strongly suspect from the samples
seen, that the parrafine was chewed before
using.
Student Council
H. S. Parsons, '15E, Chairman and T. P.
Soddy, '16E are on the Student Council
committee in charge of the Soph-Fresh
tug-of-war. A. R. Griffis,, '15E, is on the
committee in charge of cap night.
1915
Now that Finals are over and the second
semester is well under way, the class is
preparing for the all eventful occasion of
Commencement on June 24th. Committees
are hard at work, with the result that the
questions of programmes, canes, memorial,
class picture, and caps and gowns have
already been dealt with and disposed of.
On the Friday preceding the Christmas
holidays a Class dance was held at the
Michigan Union. This took the form of a
"Spot Light" party, and proved a success
in every way. A large atendance was one
of the features of the evening. Frank
Sheehy, Chairman, and his assistants, W. D.
Johnston, M. H. Toncray, H. J. Bogardus,
and W. T. Smith formed the committee.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
"Griff" Griffes acted as toast master and
chairman at the Senior Dinner held at the
Union just ahead of vacation and kept the
crowd going at all times with his inimitable
wit. Professors H. C. Anderson and J. H.
Bringhurst spoke to the Seniors on the
problems that would be met after gradua-
tion, and imparted many words of sound
advice. "Dad" Ricketts and "Ollie" Hall
made short talks. Between speeches Leroy
Scanlon and his quartette of instruments
entertained the class with some very laugh-
able and entertaining music and songs. The
committee on this dinner consisted of: Art
Griffes, Chairman, and P. L. Ulrich, C. R.
Greene, G. D. Douglas, J. E. Hughes, and
W. J. Clement.
At a meeting held on Feb. 24th, the class
voted $400.00 toward a Loan Fund for
Senior Engineers, this Loan Fund to be
presented as the Class Memorial. Gordon
McCabe was unanimously elected to present
the Memorial on Class Day, June 22nd.
Canes have been selected and will be here
about the early part of April. Rumor has
it that some of the Engineers who could
not handle a cane and slide rule at the
same time, prevailed upon a local inventor
to combine the two into one instrument!
They were unable to get this in front of
the class in time, however, and the conven-
tional stick will have to serve. Ed. DePree,
Chairman, and D. D. Stovell, H. W. Stubbs,
and C. L. Williams formed the personnel
of the hard working Cane Committee.
Another Union Dinner will be held dur-
ing the first two weeks of March, and a
large turnout is expected. A classy pro-
gramme has been arranged for the occasion.
The second class dance will be held on
March 19th at the Union, and will have
several original features to commend it to
the members of the class. "Mickey"
Sheehy, Chairman of the Social Committee
has announced that no one need stay away
because of having no date, for he expects to
ship in a carload of girls from our nearby
city and dump them out on State St. Come
early, Boys!
The Spring trips of the Mechanicals and
Electricals are now being planned, probably
to the East as before. It is not known
definitely how many will go as yet, but a
large crowd is expected. All of the larger
cities will be visited, and inspections made
of the representative plants.
1916
Handbook
The Class of 1916 has published a hand-
book of 40 pages, vest pocket size, contain-
ing the names, nicknames, Ann Arbor ad-
dresses and home addresses of the 350
members of the class. Class officers, dates
for class functions and Junior Mentors are
also listed. This idea, which is original
in its application, was carried out under the
editorship of Harry Baluss. Morton Reed
acted as Business Manager and took charge
of the distribution to class members and
faculty.
J Hop
The 1916 Engineers have every reason to
be proud of their connection with the J
Hop. They took the action which enabled
their officers to crystallize campus senti-
ment and bring evidence of the general
demand for a democratic hop before the
University Senate. They elected the gen-
eral chairman, R. C. Jeter, and he was
chiefly responsible for the success of the
function held February fifth.
The other engineer members of the com-
mittee, Ted Weaver, Fran Mack and Tiny
Stryker were prominently identified with
the staging of this, the first of a long
series of Junior "Junior Hops."
The class dance held at the Union on
February 26th was attended by many
couples who had first gone to the Band
Bounce. Waldo Fellows, '14 andGordon
Eldridge, '14, the stars of the Hill Auditor-
ium event were guests who utilized the
intermission for playing by far the best
dance of the evening. Mr. and Mrs. Mark-
wardt and Dr. and Mrs. Moriarty chaper-
oned the party.
About seventy-five of the boys had dinner
at the Union Friday, March 5th. Bob
Archer acted as toast master and talks were
given by Professors French and Case and


77
members of the class. The topic, "Cheat-
ing in Examinations," came in for consid-
erable discussion. There was a general
feeling that something must be done ■ im-
mediately to reduce "cribbing" in the
Engineering College but no decision was
reached as to what that something should
be.
1917
The Soph Engineers held their first
dance at the Union Friday, Jan. 15.
The rivalry between Lits and "Boiler-
makers" received another jolt Thursday,
January 14th, when the Soph Lits were
entertained at a smoker by the Soph
Engineers Mandolin Club.
1917 Engineers lead the campus in being
the first class to collect old clothes for the
Belgians.
All but five men on the Gargoyle staff are
Sophomores and most of these "wits" are
Engineers.
Officers and committeemen who have
been chosen for the Soph Prom comprise
the social committees of the literary and
engineering second year classes. Those
elected were: E. E. Mack, '17, treasurer,
and E. J. Huntington, '17E, secretary. R.
W. Collins, Chairman of the general com-
mittee, appointed the following sub-com-
mittees: Arrangements—J. H. Connely, '17,
and H. A. Taylor, '17E; Banquet—R. Craw-
ford, '17, and E. R. Akers, '17E; Decora-
tions—Gordon-Smith, '17E, and H. S. Nich-
ols, '17; Publicity—C. T. Fishleigh, '17E,
and W. K. Nieman, '17.

SOME PRINCIPLES RELATING TO
THE ADMINISTRATION OF
STREAMS
By Clarence T. Johnston, M.AMSoc.CM.
Presented before Am. Soc. C. E., Sept. 2nd,
1914
Synopsis
The laws generally applied in the United
States in the administration of streams
originated in the countries of Northern
Europe. These countries developed under
the feudal system, in contrast to Egypt,
India, and China where, at a very early
date, wise principles relating to the admin-
istration of streams were discovered and
applied in practice.
Northern Italy is a striking example in
so far as the development of principles
relating to the administration of streams is
concerned. Under the Dominion of the
Roman Empire, wise principles were
applied. Spain brought other ideas of a
beneficial character. The influence of the
countries of Northern Europe, from which
we borrow our laws and customs, was det-
rimental to the people of the Valley of the
Po.
The doctrine of riparian rights is of
feudal origin. It contains no positive prin-
ciple, and it has outlived its usefulness. It
can only be applied by the Courts, and the
decisions of our tribunals of justice are
not in harmony as to the interpretations
which should be given the doctrine accord-
ing character of uses and varying climatic
conditions. We should not depart from a
doctrine which has been followed for many
years, until we have something better to
suggest in its place.
The first principle that should be recog-
nized is that of public ownership of streams,
lakes, and other bodies of surface water.
The recognition of this principle lays the
foundation for an administration which,
without great expense to the various water
users, can protect all in proportion to the
uses perfected, the character of such use,
and with due consideration of all public
interests.
Priority in time of use shall give the bet-
ter right.
The right to use water gives the user no
property interest in the water itself, and
such right cannot be separated from the
use, or transferred to other uses by such
user. As long as the user has no person-
al control of the water supply, he has noth-
ing with which he can speculate to the
injury of others.
Preferred uses should be stated in order,
in the law, and then protected in proportion
to the value of each in preserving the lives
of the people and promoting the general
prosperity of any particular area.
Beneficial use should be the measure, the
limit, and the basis of the right.
A declaration of abandonment should be
made when the user fails to apply the water
to some beneficial purpose within a reason-
ably short specific time.
Even had these principles been recognized
by the Courts, it would have been difficult
for these tribunals to secure and judge the
relative importance of the technical data
that must be at hand before a just determin-
ation of rights may be made.
A compromise between Court and direct
administrative control brings but little
reform, because the responsibility is then
divided and the defects of both systems
are likely to be magnified.
The administration of streams lies within
the field of the engineer. The best gov-
erned countries of the world, in this respect,
have long since provided technical depart-
ments which administer this kind of public
business in a very satisfactory way. The
history of some of the countries of Europe
is being repeated in America, and the
engineer should be ready to accept the
responsibility that, sooner or later, must
come to him.

AN HISTORICAL OUTLINE OF AVIA-
TION FROM EARLIEST TIMES
TO THE WRIGHT BROS.
From a Lecture by Mr. F. W. Pawlowski.
4th Cent. B. C. The kite was invented by
the Chinese general Han Sin.
i$th Cent. A. D. The kite appears in
Europe, but its invention was attributed to
Archytas of Tarenth.
1809. Sir George Cayley, an English
Scientist, published in Nicholson's Journal
a complete design of a full sized mono-
plane; a light steam engine with a water
tube boiler for it; and also a theory of
aeroplanes and helical propellers. He also
built the first glider, which under a load of
two hundred pounds, descended on a slope
of ten degrees. His work being premature,
did not attract any attention at that time.
1842-3. Hensen rediscovered Cayley's
works and constructed a monoplane with a
30 H. P. steam engine. His machine had a
plane surface of 6000 square feet and
weighed about 3000 pounds. This machine
did not fly, but was of inestimable value as
he solved in a general way several problems
of construction and design. His work
became famous all over the world and
attracted a number of imitators in England
and France. This kept the problem alive
for a number of years until it died thru
lack of success.
1874. Alphonce Penoud again rediscov-
ered Cayley's works and made a strong ap-
peal to the scientists of England and
France to revive the problem. He himself
built the first successful model aeroplane
which was driven by twisted rubber cords.
More important than his models, which had
many imitators, he derived and explained
several fundamental laws for aeroplanes.
1891-96. Otto Lienthal. a German engin-
eer, constructed a number of men-carrying
gliders, and executed over 2000 flights dur-
ing the above period before he ended his
own eventful life as the first martyr to this
new science. He was the first man to make
successful flights in a motorless glider. He
also gave a considerable amount of theoret-
ical work to the science of aviation.
1900-03. The Wright Brothers made a
series of several thousand glider flights
which were preparatory to the actual birth
of aviation on Dec. 17, 1903, when these
two remarkable men made the first actual
and successful flight in a motor driven aero-
plane. Orville Wright made this first
flight and covered a distance of 850 feet in
59 seconds against a wind of 20 miles an
hour. The weight of this machine, with
engine, radiator and pilot was 740 pounds,
of which the motor weighed 138 pounds,
developed 16 H. P. and turned two pro-
pellers at a rate of 1200 R. P. M. The wing
span was 37 ft. 3 in. and the wing surface
506 square feet.
The Wright Brothers were the first to
apply the so-called wing warping for cor-
recting and maintaining lateral equilibrium.
The Wrights kept their inventions a
secret and when it was finally published
their work met with considerable disbelief.
The French enthusiasts were the first to
take the thing up and they developed such
activity that a number of more or less suc-
cessful imitators sprang up. (Santos-Du-
mont, Voisin, "Bleriot, Henry Farman, Cap-
tain Ferber, etc.)
Aviation has since become quite common,
and, as most of us know, aeroplanes hav«
attained a speed of 125 miles per hour, can
climb 1500 feet per minute vertically, can
carry 18 passengers, the duration record is
over 24 hours, and the height record some-
where near five miles.
International Engineering Congress, 1915
At San Francisco, September 20-25, 1915,
is to be held an International Engineering
Congress, under the auspices of:
American Society of Civil Engineers;
American Institute of Mining Engineers;
The American Society of Electrical Engin-
eers; American Institute of Electrical En-
gineers; The Society of Naval Architects
and Marine Engineers.
Colonel G. W. Goethals (now Governor
of the Canal Zone and formerly Chairman
and Chief Engineer of the Isthmian Canal
Commission) will act as Honorary Presi-
dent of the Congress and is expected to
preside in person over its general sessions.
Some 350 papers, representing some 18
different countries, are to be presented, and


THE MICHIGAN TBCHNIC
will be published in the transactions in ten
volumes of about 500 pages each, as fol-
lows:
Volume I.—The Panama Canal.
Volume II.—Waterways.
Irrigation.
Volumelll.—Railways.
Volume IV.—Municipal Engineering.
Volume V.—Materials of Engineering
Contsruction.
Volumes VI and VII.—Mechanical En-
gineering, Electrical Engineering.
Volume VIII.—Mining Engineering, Met-
allurgy.
Volume XI.—Naval Architecture and
Marine Engineering.
Volume X.—Miscellaneous.
Of especial interest is the volume on the
Panama Canal, which will be composed of
papers relating to the important engineering
problems of the project. The selection of
topics and of the authors has been made
by Colonel Goethals, so there will be placed
before the engineering world an authorita-
tive and full account of the chief features
of this greatest of engineering achieve-
ments.
Colonel Goethals will hmiself contribute
the introductory chapter to this volume, as
well as a paper covering the subject of Dry
Excavation.
All engineers and all others who are
interested in engineering work, its progress
and its achievements, are invited to sub-
scribe as members of the Congress. The
general fee for membership is $5.00 which
will entitle the member to receive the index
volume and any single volume of the trans-
actions he may select, together with the
right of participation in all the general
activities and privileges of the Congress.
Complete information concerning the
Congress and blank form of application for
membership can be obtained by addressing
E. J. Dupuy, (Executive Secy.)

training in the Domestic Science Dept. of
the Toledo public schools.
Myron G. Doll is now manager for South
America of the Sullivan Machinery Co.,
with headquarters at Santiago, Chile. He
writes that the European war has cut off
almost their only market for copper, tin and
silver, so that the mining business is some-
what dull. South American firms are so
dependent upon Europe for banking facili-
ties that it will be necessary for the United
States to open banking branches in the
countries with which they expect to do busi-
ness and provide for the sale of raw materi-
als and exports so that money may be avail-
able to purchase goods from the United
States. He writes further that he has had
to become proficient enough in Spanish so
that he can read and talk the language.

ties of a floating pump piston. The working
of the piston is caused by alternate com-
pression and explosion of a gas in a "U"
tube cylinder. A low head of water is
maintained in the tube and explosions force
a stream from first one side, then the other
of the "U" tube.

Essays on Pipe Courses
E.M. i
The entire subject of S. and R. is com-
paratively child's play when compared with
the stiff courses in the Lit department, sucli
as "Creative Listening," "Yodeling (i)," or
"The Theory of Modern Piano-fortes." If
E. M. i were an elective, thousands would
come from all over the country to drift
through it. As it is, it is a required pipe.
No shop work, no lab, no drawing boards
to lug around—why, not even a thorough
knowledge of theosophy, thereauputics, or
Spanish 15 is required before taking. All
a man has to do is solve kindergarten-like
problems, such as, given the moment of in-
ertia and the radius of gyration, find what
an ellipsoid with gray hair does with a
pink-striped gyrostat if the action of the
torque equals the vector sum of three young
accelerations. The average engineer uses
the following formula to solve such propo-
sitions:

Standards tor Water Purification
An Edmonton journalist, writing of a
rival town, said: "Edmonton is a young and
pushfull city which prides itself on its
water supply. We have no desire to depre-
ciate our Eastern rival, but in the matter of
water supply we are far ahead of her. The


85
wood, the flotsam, the jetsam and the tim-
ber are so bad in her reservoirs that they
have to filter their water thru a ladder. The
citizens have to extract the water from the
debris with a gimlet, and when they have
clone that they have to disinfect it with
chloride of lime, iron and manganese. This
clearing process, however, does not suffice.
After all these operations are carried out,
so many dangerous bacteria escape that
they have to be taken from the water into
the back 3rard and killed with a club."

Some of the Old Stuff You Always Hear
"Don't take such long steps, Jasper; this
skirt's too tight."
"Why, we looked all over for you,
really?"
"That's the best dance I've had in years."
"I had a wonderful time, Morris. Do call
again."
"Oh it was MY fault, I assure you."
"Sorry, Mr. Stickyfoot, but my dances
are all engaged."
"Where did you learn to dance so won-
derfully."
"Do I need any on my nose?"
"I'll be right out in a second."
Relentlessly, and with grim, dread pur-
posefullness, he was gaining the mastery.
Slowly, but oh, so surely, he was bending
her back, back, back. The fiendish smile
that had been playing on his hot face was
tired of playing now, and sat down to read
a book. Down, down, down. Back, back,
back, he forced her. She looked at him ap-
pealingly, but there was no answer in his
eyes. She was panting, nay, we might well
say gasping, for breath. And he? Oho,
the hot gusts of steam that rolled from his
quivering mouth told the story. Another
oho. (The first wasn't half expressive
enough.) Suddenly she felt herself freed
from her position and quick to take advan-
tage of it, she glided out into the more open
steps of the Lulu Fado. It was a peachy
dance.

GORDON GIN
Apologies to Rud, as Usual
You may talk o' Schlitz's beer,
You may babble hin my ear,
O' the fizzin' and the poppin' o' champagne.
You can stake yer bloomin' watch
On Kentucky rye, or Scotch.
You can drink yer Bourbon up and down
hagain.
You can mix a cocktail, too,
That'll make a pretty stew,
Or a 'ighball that'll fix you quick as sin.
But hof all the bloomin' show,
The best drink that Hi know,
Is the friend to woozy kidneys, Gordon
Gin.
Oh, it's Gin, Gin, Gin!
Come fill your glasses up with Gordon
Gin.
While yer pondering and thinkin'
What's the next one you'll be drinkin'
Sip the sweet and icy clinkin' Gordon
Gin.
Hi've been soused on Tokay wine
Hand no more o' that fer mine.
Hi've bought Cliquot by the bottle and the
case.
Halso Sparkling Burgundy-
Made an hawful 'it with me
And Hi've led the dry Martini quite a
chase.
Hi 'ave tossed off 3 Star straight
When Hi thought Hi couldn't wait
For the chaser. What a rotter 'ave Hi
been!
Why, Hi might 'ave kept my 'ealth,
Hand a damn sight more o' wealth
Hif Hi'd honly stuck to good old Gordon
Gin.
Oh it's Gin, Gin, Gin!
Now where in 'ell's that blawsted bottle
been?
'Ey there, waiter, stop a minute.
Take my glass and Hi want hin it
Four big fingers hof that peerless Gor-
don Gin.
Oh Hi stan't fergit the night
When our party was a sight.
They's been sloppin' big Manhattans by the
score.
Hi'd been drinkin' from the first,
But Hi satisfied my thirst
When Hi stuck to Gordon Gin, and nothin'
more.
When the tables 'ad been cleared,
Hit was just as Hi 'ad feared,
Hevery 'ead was bustin, like mine might
'ave been,
But my 'ead was like a bell,
And the answer to hit? Well,
Hi kept orderin' and drinkin' Gordon Gin.
So hit's Gin, Gin, Gin!
In a rickey, straight or fizzin', Gordon
Gin.
Hi 'ave drunk you, hand Hi've swilled

By the genius who distilled you
Yer the best drink hon the market,

EXPERIMENTAL CHEMISTRY
Bill, in search of something new,
Poured a pint of hydroflu
In his father's oxford shoe;
Just to see what it would do.
As research work it wasn't bad,
But 'twas rather rough on Dad.
Johnnie in his careless glee
Mixed up I with NHi,
When the stuff was dry and thick
Johnne hit it with a brick;
Johnnie's now in heaven, they say,
At least, he surely went that way.
Little Jane was happy when
She found a lump of KCN;
"Pa likes lots of sweets," said she,
So she put it in his tea.
(Strange how "died" and "suicide"
Rhyme so well with "cyanide.")
James put AgNOa
In his Ma's perfumery.
Saying, "She'll be pleased I hope,
With this fine expensive dope."
But when she used it, strange to say,
She didn't feel a bit that way.

COLLEGE DAYS
James N. Hatch, '92
My Son you've finished High School now
To College you must go,
To learn the wiles of Wisdom's ways
And the things you ought to know,
To train your mind to think aright
In things of deep portent,
So you can earn your daily bread
And pay your monthly rent.
So let us sit and chat awhile
About these college days,
Whilch time is still before you
But which behind me lays,
And listen while your Father tells
Of how things used to be
When he first launched his little bark
Upon that world's great sea.

To start his College days

Which all so brightly shone
And knew the sanctum had been reached
Of Wisdom's real envoy, •
He stood transfixed upon the spot
And wept with tears of joy.

"Full many a youth hath ventured here
To worship at this shrine,
Who proved that he were better fit
To herd his father's swine;
So that may be thy calling lad.
Instead of abstruse learning
To feed the pigs and mind the cows
And help about the churning."
I do not know what more was said
To close that interview,
But ere I left, the halos all
Had faded quite from view;
And why I've never seen one. since
May be explained away,
By saying that the styles have changed
Since that eventful day.
And I half b'lieve I would be right
If I should say to you,
That College Profs have changed a lot
Since eighteen ninety two.

That night within my attic room
I had a talk with me,
And drew some resolutions up
To which I would agree,
But not one word of any plan
To keep the pigs from pining
Of how I'd mix the food for chicks
To soothe their stomach's lining.
But then and there I vowed a vow
To push on day and night
And not admit a single thought
To shut hope out of sight;
"Go forth," said I unto myself.
"Go forth, O gentle youth
Nor storm nor stress nor awkwardness
Can keep you from the truth."
And I have found as years have sped
That those who help us on
Are often those who most oppose
The plans that we've begun;
And you may find as I have found
To work against resistance
Will often make us stronger men
Than all our friend's assistance.

The Wickes Vertical Water-Tube Boiler
Very high thermal efficiency is obtained from this boiler and
setting, because:—
ist—High furnace temperature results from Dutch oven.
and—Gases entirely surround and closely scrub heating sur-
face from entrance to release.
3rd—The gases cannot leave the heating surface. There is
no possible chance for short-circuiting.
4th—Boiler heating surface absorbs the heat—empty pockets
in setting lose heat. There are no empty pockets in this
boiler.
5th—The steel-cased settings are always tight. No cracked,

this setting.
6th—A steel-cased setting is a simple and sure cure for air

to contend with in boiler efficiency are excess air losses.
7th—A veiy long gas travel—hence long contact with heating
surface is provided—hence heat absorption is assured.

What 4 Years
Did for This Hudson
The HUDSON Light Six came oul first as a 1914 model. But two years
had been spent in developing it, and two years have been spent on it since.
So this new model is the result of four years ol refinement. Not only by
Howard E. Collin, its famous designer, but by our whole corps ol engineers
One result shows in its lightness—2,870 pounds. It is the lightest 7-pas-
senger Six. And lightness denotes refinement. Every needless pound is a
crudity, due to wrong materials or less skilful designing.
Other results show in finish, luxury, beauty and equipment. Every detail
in this HUDSON shows the final touch.
25-Million-Mile Tests
But the best thing those years have done is to prove that the car is right.
Over 10.000 owners have now driven this car, perhaps 25 million miles.
Half of them have proved it two seasons.
All ol those owners will vouch for this car. No mistake has developed, no
weakness, no shortcoming.
Another great appeal in the HUDSON lies in pride in ownership. The
HUDSON is the class car ol its type. It shows its class. And the name
HUDSON, in every mind, stands for the highest standards.
Another reason lies in HUDSON service. That means protection to you.
It means constant satisfaction.
Now is the time—before the rush season—to find out which Light Six is best.

EDITORIAL
THE HONOR COMMITTEE
REPORTS.
The final report of the committee
from the classes, which appears else-
where in this issue, is a distinct en-
couragement to the advocates of the
Honor System. It is also a document
which exemplifies the earnestness and
efficiency of the committee. We hard-
ly hoped that they would consider it
possible to immediately bring fifteen
hundred men to a realization of the
benefits of "being on their honor".
The history of the installation of
Honor Systems in other schools proved
to the committee that to ensure suc-
cess, the process must be gradual. The
student body must want to take exam-
inations (and blue books, probably)
under an Honor System and want it
almost unanimously. When that state
is reached, there will be no doubt as
to its success, and no doubt as to the
immense good it will do for the Col-
lege of Engineering.
How long will it take you '16, '17,
and '18 men to get the honor spirit
and demand the benefits, privileges,
and responsibilities which an honor
system will bring to you? Will you
be prepared to fight for it next se-
mester? We think you will, and we
heartily endorse the recommendation
of the committee that a permanent
committee be appointed. This com-
mittee can continue the study of local
conditions and be prepared next Fall
to carry on a campaign of education
and, we believe, submit a definite plan
which will be accepted almost unani-
mously by students and faculty.
THE MICHIGAN UNION.
The University of Michigan Union
will this Fall make a country-wide
campaign among Michigan Alumni in
the endeavor to raise $1,000,000 for
the building and endowment of a Club-
house. Without going into details, we
want to assure every Alumnus of the
Engineering College that the Michigan
Union is the one big factor standing
for all that is good in undergraduate
life. They must have a new building.
The campaign must succeed.
Nearly 2,000 Michigan students,
both rich and poor, have taken life
memberships in the Michigan Union at
a time when $50 means the most to a
man. Isn't this fact significant? Will
it influence you when you are ap-
proached in a few months? We hope
that our Engineering Alumni will
stand forth as the most loyal among


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
the 30,000 who have graduated from
Ann Arbor. We wish we could tell
you why you must make a stupendous
effort to help build this new Michigan
Union Club House, and what a won-
derful thing it will be for the Univer-
sity. Rut you will be given an oppor-
tunity to learn these things and to give
for your Alma Mater. We know you
have the Michigan Spirit.
HONOR IN THE CHEM. LAB.
In point of immediate interest to
chemicals, cheating in examinations
can not compare with the black art by
which apparatus and reagents are
made to vanish in the chemical labora-
tories. The variety of modes of dis-
appearance of property is at once a
wonder and a caution.
As in the case of shady methods in
examinations, such practices are due
more to carelessness than to actual dis-
honesty. The nature of the desired re-
form need only be psychological, not
moral. It is, nevertheless, quite a
problem to bring about in the student
body an attitude of mind that will
overcome the difficulty.
The installation of an honor system
in the College of Engineering will have
the desired effect, and this effect will
be felt in more ways than is at once
apparent. Petty thievery and malicious
destruction of property are but two
evils which will be considerably abated.
AN EDITORIAL PROBLEM
Not the least problem confronting
the editors of the Michigan Technic
is the selection of articles for publica-
tion. Many of the articles published
in the past have been too critical and
too technical to be easily understood
by the undergraduate, and as a result
the feeling has been engendered that
the Technic as a whole is "too deep."
We have heard student readers say,
"Give us something we can use in our
work." The demand is reasonable and
as a result of our efforts to comply, we
publish in this issue an article on shear
and bending moment diagrams by Pro-
fessors Patterson and Stevens. The
value of such an article will be thor-
oughly appreciated by students taking
E. M. 1, and reprints of the article will
be made for future use. Although
shear and bending moment diagrams
are taken up in this course, the text-
book in use contains no treatment of
that part of the work, with the result
that some have had difficulty in grasp-
ing it.
This, fellow students, is but one ex-
ample of the way in which the
Technic hopes to become a necessity
to you. But we cannot anticipate all
of your wants and we rely upon you to
assist us by making them known to
us. We will do our best to please.
A NEGLECTED ART
At the Junior Engineer's assembly
last month, Prof. Trueblood gave an
entertaining talk on the work in the
Oratory Department of this Univer-
sity, and on public speaking in general.
This subject is rendered specially in-
teresting by the rather startling state-
ments of Prof. Swain, reprinted in full
elsewhere in this issue. Cultivation of
the ability to speak in public is certain-
ly a most potent aid in the development
of engineers into men of affairs. A
keen appreciation of this fact is shown
at Cornell, where a majority of the
participants in oratorical work are en-
gineering students.
At this University there are two
fields for work of this kind: the de-
bating societies, with the debates and
oratorical contests held, and the reg-
ular work of the Department of Ora-


89
tory. The latter consists of prelim-
inary training in elocution, followed by
work in either interpretative oratory
or public speaking, as the student
chooses.
Among the multitude of cultural
courses with which we engineers are
urged to fill up our scant hours of
electives, work along this line is well
worth consideration.
FIRST AID
Speaking of courses which an engi-
neer should take, that in first aid is
one which we believe should be car-
ried by every engineer at some time
during his residence in the university.
It was given for the first time last year
and the number of men electing it has
shown a remarkable increase, there be-
ing over a hundred enrolled at present
against forty-five last semester. Any
man who has completed the course
may take an examination given by the
American Red Cross Association, and
if he is successful, will receive a cer-
tificate or diploma of the Association.
The course, as given, follows the re-
quirements of the Red Cross for First
Aid work and is extremely valuable to
the engineer. In his work in the field
or in the shop where he is in charge,
he may at any time have one of his
workmen laid off due to an injury. If
he can care for such injuries when
they are inflicted the workman will
probably be able to return to work
much sooner than if he had to await
the arrival of a physician. In many
cases it may also be the means of sav-
ing a life.
TO OUR ALUMNI.
In our last issue we made some
rather pointed comments regarding our
faculty subscribers, or perhaps more
correctly, members of the faculty who
were not subscribers. Those remarks
were beautifully effective and we
herewith express our thanks to them,
individually and collectively. Now
we want to say a few words to our
alumni. Our alumni subscription file
is not as full as it should be, although
many of you have shown a cordial
appreciation of our work. To some
of you we made the proposition that if
you would give us reasons why you
do not subscribe to The Technic, we,
in turn, would send you the four issues
following free of charge in an en-
deavor to convince you, that you,
Michigan Engineers, cannot afford to
be without this organ of the College.
Keep this in mind while you are read-
ing this and the following copies. See
if you do not feel just a little younger
and just a little happier for having
read them. We are doing our best to
make them achieve this result. If they
do, we will feel well repaid for our
work; if they do not, we want to know
why not.
, You can help us in making a better
Technic. Let us know what you are
doing of interest; send us write-ups
of your smokers and "get-togethers"
and anything that will interest Mich-
igan men, both old and young. If an
interesting proposition presents itself
in some phase of your work, we want
to know about it. This magazine is as
much for you as it is for the men now
in college. Michigan does not forget
you: why should you forget Michigan.
A WORD TO THE SENIORS.
By the time the next Technic
comes out you will have become an
Alumnus of Michigan, located perhaps
many miles from Ann Arbor. Do you
ever stop to think how much you will
miss the little old town where you
have spent four long years in the


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
quest of an education? How many
times you will find yourself dreaming
that you sit basking in the sun on the
benches of the Engineering court, and
when at last Library clock calls you to
your eleven o'clock, you wake up to
find that there is but twenty minutes
before you must be on that job or be
"docked" an hour's pay! How many
times you will be confronted by some
puzzling situation in your work, to
give it up as a bad job!
There is a solution for such difficul-
ties. Will you go home at night to
find there a cool pipe and your slip-
pers waiting for you, to come back to
Michigan just for an hour or so, to
think over what you did and to learn
what is being done in those old haunts
you knew so well, to lose yourself a
while from the work of the day?
Gradually you will find your difficul-
ties clearing themselves up. Life will
seem brighter generally, and you will
feel your old time "pep" again. Would
you like to know how to bring this
about? We will do our part; it's up
to you to do yours. See that you are
signed up for at least a year's sub-
scription to the Michigan Technic.
You have no idea what a welcome
visitor it will be.
FOBS AWARDED
Those men on the staff of the
Technic whose names appear in this
issue, will receive fobs in recognition
of their ability and energy. A second
award of fobs will be made at the end
of the first semester next year.
This Issue and the Next.
We want you to like this May Tech-
nic. We think it is the "Best Ever"
without a doubt. But it could be bet-
ter. For instance, we are sorry that
we have not got the article by Profess-
or Friday which we half-way prom-
ised. We are pleased to be able to
print Mr. Hirshfeld's article on the
Connors Creek Plant. It is probably
the first authoritative account yet pub-
lished. We make no apology for re-
printing Professor Swain's article. It
so well represents the views of Dean
Cooley, many of our faculty, promi-
nent engineers all over the country,
and lastly and leastly, us, that we must
give every student in the Engineering
College a chance to read it.
But we do now definitely promise an
article by Professor Friday in our next
October's issue. Also we will have
another article by Mr. Hirshfeld,
"Auxiliary Power" which is worth
reading by any engineer, graduate or
undergraduate. And we already have
in our office an article by Professor
R. D. Parker who is on leave of ab-
sence from the College doing special
work for the American Telephone and
Telegraph Co. in New York City. In
addition, we expect to surprise you.
Better make sure of getting the Octo-
ber Technic.


ILLUMINATING COMPANY
OF DETROIT
C. F. HIRSHFELD
Chief of Research Department, Detroit Edison Company.
Before the construction of the Con-
nors Creek Plant was undertaken the
total capacity of the plants of the Edi-
son Illuminating Company aggregated
about 100,000 kilowatts. Practically
all of the generating machinery was
located in what are known as Delray
Power Houses No. 1 and No. 2. The
location of these is indicated in Fig-
ure 1 by the two circular spots on the
river bank near the lower left hand
corner of the figure.
The very rapid growth of Detroit's
industries and population indicated
that the capacity of the Delray Plant
would soon be insufficient to supply the
demand and that greater generating
capacity was an imperative need. A
consideration of all of the conditions
finally led to the purchase of the Con-
nors Creek site and the planning of a
power house with an ultimate capacity
of 120,000 kilowatts in six turbo-
generator units. The location of this
plant is indicated by the circular spot
on the river bank near the lower right
hand corner of Figure 1.
The rectangular spots scattered over
the map of the city indicate the loca-
tion and capacity of the various sub-
stations of the company and show
plainly how the greatest concentration
of load occurs near the so-called "cen-
ter" of the city. The heavy black
lines indicate the principal street car
lines and the heavy dotted lines show
the right-of-ways of the various rail-
roads which enter the city.
It is obvious that the Connors Creek
site is as favorably situated with re-
gard to railroad connections and water
supply as is the older site at Delray.
The location of the new plant about as
far to the right of the center as the
old plant is to the left makes it pos-
sible to serve the Eastern section of
the city as advantageously as the
Western section is served from the
older plant, and also insures two dis-
tinctly separate routes for the cables
supplying the heavily loaded central
district.
The Connors Creek site is large
enough to permit of the construction
of two power houses upon it and to
still leave room for the necessary coal
storage. The location of the first of
these houses upon the property is
shown in Figure 2, which also gives
the location of the intake and over-
flow canals and tunnels and the ar-
rangement of railroad tracks. Two of
these tracks run through the coal shed
which will be described later, and two
run through the boiler room basement
immediately under the ash hoppers of
the boilers. The other tracks indicated
are to be used for the handling of ma-
chinery in and out of the plant. The
part of the plant indicated in the fig-
ure as present construction is roughly
one-third of the whole, containing two
turbines, their boilers, auxiliaries and
electrical equipment. Intake and over-
flow canals are complete for the entire
installation of six units.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
In Figure 3 is given a vertical cross-
section of the plant. This serves very
well to bring out the essential features
of design and construction. The coal
is brought in in full size railroad cars,
weighed on track scales, and either dis-
charged into hoppers beneath the
tracks in the coal shed or stocked in
the yard. If dropped into the hoppers
it is picked up by a pan conveyor and
carried up to a coal crusher which
has a capacity of 120 tons per hour,
described is duplicated for every two
boilers. The boilers are the same in
size and type as those installed at Del-
ray Power House No. 2; i. e. Sterling
Type W. rated at 2365 boiler horse
power each. The turbo generators are
rated at 20,000 k. w. on an 80% power
factor. On this basis there are 4.23
k. w. per rated boiler horse power, a
figure of the same order as has ap-
peared in other large stations recently
built.

breaking down to one inch or less
from any size up to eighteen inches.
The crushed coal falls into a bucket
conveyor which entirely encloses the
section of the boiler house as shown
in the figure. This conveyor carries
the coal up to the top of the boiler
house and then discharges it into the
overhead bunkers at the proper points
on the upper horizontal run. From the
overhead bunkers the coal falls
through the spouts and spreaders to
the stoker hoppers on opposite faces or
ends of each boiler.
There are two boilers per turbine
and the coal handling apparatus above
Each boiler is fired from both ends
with Taylor stokers, the stokers lying
beneath the mud drums of the boilers
as shown in the figure. There are
twenty-six retorts per boiler, thirteen
at each end. The ash and clinkers are
pushed toward the center and are ulti-
mately removed by rotating clinker
grinders which feed down into ash
hoppers. The distance from the top
of the clinker grinders to the bottom
of the center drum of the boiler is
about 36 feet, so that tne combustion
chamber is about 33 feet high. The
refuse is dropped from the ash hop-
pers of the boilers directly into full

size railroad cars so that cost of
handling is reduced to a minimum.
The products of combustion leave
the boilers at the top, just outside of
the outside drums and rise through
smoothly curved breechings to the
stack. There is one stack for each
pair of boilers. This is made of steel,
is brick lined and is supported on a
set of girders carried on top of the
boiler room columns. The stack rises
to a height of 325 feet above the boiler
room floor or 240 feet above the sup-
porting steel work. Its diameter in-
side of the brick lining is 16 feet.
Air is supplied the furnaces under
pressure by motor driven fans. There
are three of these fans for each pair of
boilers. One of these is a spare
located between the two boilers, and
can discharge to either through a Y
shaped duct fitted with dampers for
controlling the direction of flow. The
others are arranged so that each can
supply one boiler only. They blow
directly into the wind box which is
built around the ash pit, discharging
into it through a large expanding
nozzle to convert a large part of the
kinetic into potential energy. Each
fan is capable of delivering 74000
cubic feet of air per minute against a
static pressure of 6.5 inches of water,
and the same volume against a static
pressure of 7.25 inches of water when
run at a higher speed. Under the first
conditions it will require 133 shaft
horsepower; under the second set of
conditions it will require 162 shaft
horsepower.
In view of the large size of the
boilers and of the small number of
boilers per unit it is of interest to ex-
amine the conditions under which they
will operate. When two boilers sup-
ply steam to operate a turbo-generator
at full load the boilers will operate at
about 170% of rating. It will be pos-
sible to operate two turbo-generators
at full load with steam supplied by
only three boilers. This makes one
out of every four boilers a possible
spare so that cleaning or repairs can
be effected without diminishing the
capacity of the station. When running
in this way each of the three boilers
will be operating at about 225% of
rating, a value which experience at
Delray and other plants shows to be
easily attainable.
When two boilers are supplying
steam for one unit operating at full
load the velocity in the steam lines will
be about 12000 feet per minute. When
three boilers are supplying two tur-
bines at full load the velocity in some
parts of the steam piping will rise as
high as 16000 feet per minute. Steam
at these high velocities travels only
through straight pipe and long radius
bends.
Passing now, from the boiler house
to the turbine house, this is planned, as
already stated, to contain six 25000
k.v.a. units of which two are now in-
stalled. The turbines are nine-stage
horizontal, G. E. machines with ve-
locity compounding in the first stage
only. They run at 1200 R.P.M. and
the alternators generate 60 cycle, 3
phase current, at 4800 volts. The over-
all length is 47 ft., 10^2 in., the width
17 ft., 11 in. and the height 16 ft, 2
in. The steam leaving each turbine
passes directly into an expanding
nozzle of rectangular section, which is
housed within the foundation of the
unit. This nozzle expands to such an
extent that the steam is delivered
from it over an area practically equal
to the projected area of the tube space
in the condenser. The steam is thus
brought into direct contact with the


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
maximum tube surface without throt-
tling of any sort.
The condensers have circular tube
sheets with a diameter of 14 ft., 6 in.
The tubes are slightly over 18 feet in
length and give a total surface of
35000 sq. ft. The path of the circu-
lating water is different from that
commonly accepted as proper. In-
stead of leading the cold water
through a lower bank of tubes and
then back through an upper bank in
an effort to get a more or less fictitious
counter current flow, the water in
these condensers is lead into one ver-
tical half and the extreme lower part
of the other vertial half and returns
through the remaining tubes. The cold
water tubes in the extreme lower part
of the vertical half which contains the
return pass, are contained in the air
box. The air is thus cooled by the
coldest water. Since the upper tubes
of the other vertical half carry the
coldest water, they should be very
effective in condensing the steam
early in its entrance, thus minimizing
the resultant pressure drop. Since the
hotter water flows through a smaller
number of tubes than does the colder,
the higher velocity will partly offset
the decreased temperature head.
The water is circulated by a motor
driven, 42 inch, double suction pump
with a capacity of 36000 U. S. gallons
per minute. The motors are three
phase induction motors, are direct con-
nected to the pumps and are furnished
with controllers giving a 15% speed
variation, so that the amount of water
pumped may be increased during the
summer months, if desired.
The air is withdrawn from the con-
densers by rotative dry vacuum
pumps, arranged with two stages in
one air cylinder. The piston displace-
ment is 1650 cu. ft. per min. at 100
R.P.M. The cylinder is 35 inch diam.
by 30 inch stroke. This pump is
driven by a 40 H. P., variable speed,
direct current motor mounted on the
shaft.
The hot well pumps are two-stage,
six inch centrifugals, direct connected
to three phase induction motors. There
are two of. these per condenser, one
serving as a spare. Their rotative speed
is 1200 R.P.M. and they are fitted
with bronze impellers.
It will have been observed that all
of the auxiliaries thus far mentioned
are electrically driven. This is true
of all of the auxiliaries throughout
the plant with the exception of the
boiler feed pumps which are driven
by steam turbines. There can be no
question as to the conveniences re-
sulting from the use of electrically
driven auxiliaries; the only valid argu-
ment which can be urged against them
is the fact that they give no exhaust
steam for heating the feed water. In
the plant under discussion, an attempt
has been made to obtain all the ad-
vantages resulting from the use of
electrically driven auxiliaries end to
obtain at the same time sufficient ex-
haust steam for heating the feed water
without the usual disadvantage of
having more than sufficient exhaust
when operating under high load.'
For this purpose, a 100 k. w. turbo-
alternator, known as the station alter-
nator, has been installed with each
main unit. Each of these turbines and
the corresponding boiler feed pump
turbine exhaust into a barometric con-
denser. The tail pipe of each baro-
metric condenser dips into one end of
a tank, known as the boiler feed tank.
A condenser and tank are shown dia-
grammatically in Figure 4. The con-


97
densate from a main unit is discharged
into the other end of this tank and the
circulating pump of the barometric
condensers draws its water from the
same end of the same tank. The con-
densate from the main unit is thus
made the circulating water which con-
denses the steam from the station
alternator and boiler feed pump tur-
put and the feed water temperature.
The preferable method of control
depends upon the sensibility of the
steam turbine to changes of back pres-
sure. By increasing the back pressure,
the steam consumption at any load can
be increased; by decreasing the back
pressure, the steam consumption at any
load can be decreased. For the pur-

bines and it is heated by the steam
condensed. The boiler feed pump
draws its water from directly beneath
the tail pipe of the condenser, so that
the condenser is a feed water heater
as well as a condenser.
The auxiliary motors may be driven
by the station alternator or part may
be driven from the station bus. By
proper choice, it becomes possible to
control the load on the station alter-
nator and thus to control its steam out-
pose of controlling the back pressure,
an adjustable back pressure valve has
been placed in the exhaust line of the
boiler feed pump turbine, as shown in
Figure 4. By closing down this valve,
the back pressure against which this
turbine exhausts can be increased and
this will naturally cause an increased
production of exhaust steam. This
will raise the temperature in the
barometric condenser and thus raise
the back pressure on the station alter-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
nator, causing1 it in turn to discharge
more steam. Such a process may con-
tinue until a new point of stability is
attained or the result may be a com-
mutative rise of temperature and pres-
sure until the atmosphere exhaust
opens. To guard against such an oc-
currence, a thermostatic control is pro-
vided. This puts into operation one
or more of the surge pumps whenever
the temperature in the condenser ex-
ceeds a predetermined value, and
these pumps raise comparatively cold
water from the lower or surge tank
to the condenser head, thus giving the
excess quantity of water required to
bring down the temperature or to re-
establish equilibrium.
This arrangement should make it
possible to accurately regulate the
heat balance of the station, so as to
absorb the maximum possible quantity
of auxiliary exhaust with the resultant
high thermal efficiency.
The current generated by the main
units is stepped up in a one to five ratio
and is then switched and transmitted
at 24000 volts. It leaves the station
through submarine cables laid in the
adjoining marsh land, which connect
to the regular underground duct sys-
tem further from the plant.
REPORT OF HONOR COMMITTEE
To the Students of the College of En-
gineering:
Your committee, appointed for the
purpose of investigating a proposed
honor systems, begs to submit a final
report:
After a careful study of numerous
letters and pamphlets explaining the
honor systems which are in operation
at other colleges, we have arrived at
the following conclusions:
1. An honor system, adapted to lo-
cal conditions, would improve the
morale, efficiency and standing of the
College of Engineering.
2. The inauguration of a successful
system can be accomplished and a
workable plan formulated.
3. The successful working of any
system is dependent first, upon the de-
sire of the student body for such a
system, and second, upon a healthy
sentiment which will work to the
maintenance of a pledge and to the
building up of an "Honor Spirit."
4. The necessary attitude of the
student body, as given under Conclu-
sion 3, is not sufficiently matured in
the College of Engineering to warrant
the immediate adoption of an honor
system.
5. A campaign of education should
be carried on, and discussions of the
honor system should be fostered.
In view of the above conclusions,
your committee recommends:
First, that a permanent committee
consisting of two members from the
present Junior, Sophomore and Fresh-
man Classes be appointed immediately
and that said committee elect a sev-
enth man as chairman.
Second, that the committee continue
the study of local conditions with re-
spect to conditions elsewhere, and
Third, that they carry on a campaign
of education concerning the honor sys-
tem and foster discussions relating
thereto, and


99
Fourth, that they, together with two
members elected from the Freshman
Class at the beginning of next year,
be prepared to consider the advisability
of the adoption of an honor system
next semester.
Respectfully submitted,

In furtherance of our opinions we
append the following extracts from
Bulletin No. 632, U. S. Bureau of
Education, title, "Present Status of
the Honor System in Colleges and
Universities".
"The term 'honor system' is used to
connote the formal recognition and
adoption by students and faculty of a
system of mutual responsibility among
students for honest scholastic work.
In several institutions student govern-
ment is included under the general
term 'honor system'; in other institu-
tions, especially the larger universities,
the honor system is independent of any
form of student government; in others,
particularly the smaller colleges, it is
the natural outgrowth of the participa-
tion of students in the direction and
control of their various collegiate ac-
tivities.
"The chief arguments against the
honor system may be summed up as
follows: Classroom honesty is an
academic matter; some people believe,
therefore, that it should be under fac-
ulty jurisdiction and control. Some
executives do not care to give more
control to students, since these duties
are difficult to define and take the stu-
dents' time from the regular studies.
Students contend also that it tends to
burden the better or more honest stu-
dents with the shortcomings of the
delinquent ones. In some communi-
ties there is a sentiment that signing
a pledge implies dishonesty, and in
many institutions there is still a feel-
ing that individual honor does not in-
volve the reporting of theft and dis-
honesty on the part of others. Some
large institutions have such a cosmo-
politan group of students that homo-
geneity in the classroom ideals is diffi-
cult to secure and maintain; small in-
stitutions have younger preparatory
students to include in their regulations.
"The immediate and ultimate aims
of the honor system which may be
considered of most significance, are:
It rests fundamentally upon the initia-
tive of undergraduates, and initiative
always has potential good as a possi-
bility; it is dependent upon unity of
purpose and community of effort,
which is another valuable asset when
turned in the right direction; it tends
to bring about a frank and candid
relation between the students and the
administrative force of an institution;
it tends toward increasing the loyalty
to an institution, by strengthening pub-
lic opinion in regard to the virtue of
honesty ; it increases individual respon-
sibility, which may take a marked drop
during college days; it breeds confi-
dence and self respect in similar situ-
ations; as a rule it appeals to the
better class of students, and leads them
to look at their own actions and the
actions of other fellows from the point
of view of an adult; it utilizes the
stronger characters to help bolster up
the weaker ones.
"The success of the honor system is
due in the main to the natural desire

While the past few years have
brought forth nothing startling in so
far as developments in transformers
are concerned, they have been charac-
terized by continual progress along
certain well defined lines, resulting in
a present-day product of extraordinary
reliability under the widest range of
conditions.
To those who have not been actively
engaged in the work, it may be of in-
terest to have the more important of
these developments briefly reviewed.
The present article deals entirely with
constant-potential transformers, and
after outlining certain recent tenden-
cies in design, calls attention to some
special applications.
Self-Cooled Transformers.
Although an extremely economical
device, even exceeding 99% efficiency
in some cases, larger sizes of trans-
formers must nevertheless be able to
dissipate considerable energy to the
surrounding medium. Broadly speak-
ing, the loss will increase directly as
the volume of material. Since the
volume is proportional to the cube,
and the surface to the square of the
dimensions, as the capacity increases a
point is soon reached where a given
method of cooling becomes inadequate.
Using the oil-cooled transformer as
an example, in the smaller sizes it is
found that a tank large enough to hold
the machine will, of necessity, provide
more than the requisite heat dissipa-
tion surface. As the capacity increases,
it becomes necessary to employ a cor-
rugated surface, thus greatly increas-
ing the convection factor. Such trans-
formers are built in ratings as high as
500 to 1000 K.V.A., depending upon
various conditions.
Until recently, nearly all oil-filled
transformers above 500 K.V.A. were
built as water-cooled machines, but
we now have sizes as large as 5000
K.V.A. with self-cooling features. The
development from the large corrugat-
ed tanks has been to the compound
corrugated, then to the tubular, and
finally to the radiator type. In the
tubular and radiator types, the oil cir-
culation is, of course, up through the
winding and into the top of the tubes
or radiators, where it is cooled by the
natural air currents, thence dropping
to the bottom of the tank to repeat the
cycle.
Fig. 1 shows a modern outdoor in-
stallation of some 2000 K.V.A. trans-
formers of the radiator type. The
advent of the outdoor substation has
very strongly influenced the develop-
ment of self-cooled apparatus. In such
stations it is of the greatest advantage
to eliminate the complications intro-
duced by the necessity of providing
cooling water. In addition to the con-
tinual expense incurred for water, it
is difficult with water-cooled units to
avoid trouble during the winter
months from freezing; the attendance
cost, other things being equal, will
of course, much exceed that of the
self-cooled station.
In many locations, the expense of
providing any considerable quantity
of water would be absolutely prohibi-
tive. Until recently, it was necessary


in such instances to install several
medium sized transformers in mul-
tiple. The one large transformer
which supersedes them is at once less
expensive and more efficient, and is
therefore a definite step in advance.
The practical limit for this type of
transformer has not yet been reached,
occasional overload to be handled.
Such machines are now being manu-
factured. In addition to the provisions
for self-cooling such as radiators or
tubes, the t-ink of the combination self
and water-cooled transformer is pro-
vided with the usual form of water
cooling coil supplied with water-cooled
Fig. i.—Modern Outdoor Installation—2000 K.V.A. Radiator
Type Transformer.
and the future will no doubt see self-
cooled designs approaching in size
the present maximum capacities of the
water-cooled type.
Com di nation Self and Water-
Cool-ed Transformers.
From the foregoing it will be appre-
ciated that a logical step in develop-
ment was the combination of self and
water-cooled characteristics in one
transformer, where the expense of
water is considerable, and there is an
units. An example of this style of
transformer is shown in Fig. 2, which
illustrates a 60 cycle, 87000 volt, core
type outdoor transformer, of 1250
K.V.A. capacity as a self-cooled ma-
chine and 1750 K.V.A. when water-
cooled.
In this case it will be recognized
that there has been provided a machine
which can be viewed either as a self-
cooled unit with 40% continuous over-
load capacity when operated water-
cooled; or as a water-cooled unit


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
which, during the period of loading
under 70% of its maximum rated ca-
pacity can be operated as a self-cooled
machine, thereby eliminating the ex-
pense of cooling water.
Short Circuit Stresses.
There has been a marked tendency
within recent years toward an increase
in reactance on power transformers,
; -«*^7'-15

Cooled Transformer.
the average now being perhaps two to
three times the former value. This in-
crease has been coincident with the
advent of the modern power station
with its enormous generating capacity
feeding into underground cable sys-
tems. In such stations it is possible
to maintain practically normal im-
pressed voltage during the brief in-
terval of short circuit, the power trans-
formed being only limited by the im-
pedance of the transformer. The re-
sulting current and therefore the me-
chanical forces introduced in the wind-
ings are enormous, amounting in some
cases to as much as fifty tons.
This will be better appreciated when
it is realized that the forces are pro-
portional to the" square of the current.
A 6% reactance transformer on short
circuit under sustained impressed volt-
age will have 16 2-3 times normal cur-
rent and 278 times normal repulsive
forces on the windings. One with 2%
reactance under the same conditions
will have 50 times normal current and
2500 times the normal forces.
The familiar constant current trans-
former having a movable counter-
weighted secondary and rigid primary
winding is a useful application of the
principles involved. Here the repul-
sion forces resulting from normal cur-
rent are utilized, the direction of the
force of course being at right angles
to the leakage flux between the coils.
If the secondary be held rigidly in po-
sition and a heavy current drawn from
the transformer, the force exerted is
very apparent. In constant potential
transformers, the core resists the
stresses on the coils, but for that por-
tion of the windings extending beyond,
heavy retaining clamps must be pro-
vided. Where there is more than one
coil in a winding, as is almost always
the case, it is evident that a coil trans-
mits its pressure through the spacers
to the adjacent coil. There is thus a
resultant force on each coil equal to
the difference in pressure between the
two sides. Where the spacers are at
right angles to the turns, this force
tends to bend the conductor, and
where spacers are parallel to the turns,
it tends to slide one turn by the other.
It will be of interest to point out


103
the fact that in an auto-transformer
the reactance of the machine will, in
the external circuit, only be effective
in the proportion of high tension minus
low tension voltage to the high tension
voltage. If therefore, the ratio ap-
pacities is worthy of note here. In
this country, the field for the large
capacities was, until recently, almost
exclusively held by shell type trans-
formers. The introduction of the disc
type of coil on core type units, which

proaches unity as is very often the
case, it becomes practically impossible
to limit the short circuit current to a
safe value without the use of external
reactance.
Core Type Transformers.
The extension of the core type
transformer into larger and larger ca-
practice can be viewed broadly as the
combination of shell type coils with
core type core, has apparently left no
definite limiting capacity for either
type of transformer.

struction. The photograph was taken

from the high voltage side, which was
designed for either a 12000 or 24000
volt circuit; the low voltage winding
was laid out for 4800 volts. High and
low voltage groups of coils are inter-
leaved, all coils being positively spaced
at frequent intervals. The oil circu-
lates freely through the horizontal
ducts, securing low and uniform tem-

pcrature rise under load. Attention is
called to the great mechanical strength
of the design and to its simplicity of
construction.
Air-Blast Transformers.
The air-blast transformer still has
an open field in those locations where
insurance regulations forbid the oil-
cooled machines. As to the relative
fire risk of the two types, assuming
each properly installed, the writer be-
lieves that there is little choice be-
tween them, with the benefit of the
doubt on the side of the oil-cooled.
However, it is a fact that in many
crowded locations such as the down-
town districts of our larger cities, local
ordinances do require the air-cooled
types of apparatus.
While recent years have brought in
many refinements in design on the air-
blast type of transformer, probably the
most important improvement,—at least
the most noticeable,—is the change to
steel-plate construction. Fig. 4 shows
a recent example of a medium sized
single-phase shell type air-blast trans-
former, designed for 25 cycles and
with 13200 volt connection on high
voltage and 440 volt connection on low
voltage side. It is of 700 K.V.A. ca-
pacity and possesses a reactance of
approximately 15%, used for com-
pounding a 600 volt synchronous con-
verter.
The cast iron base and top castings
formerly used are seen to have been
replaced with riveted steel-plate con-
struction, the total weight being there-
by considerably reduced. To the top
plate are riveted heavy lifting-lugs
capable of sustaining the entire weight
of the transformer. A lever for regu-
lating the air-dampers is conveniently
provided, allowing the shutting off of
the air supply when transformer is out
of circuit.
A very recent development is the
core type air-blast transformer hav-
ing concentric barrel type coils. In the
previous types represented by Fig. 4,
"pancake" coils have been employed;
if sufficient mechanical strength were
to be secured to withstand short cir-
cuit under sustained impressed volt-
age, the necessary coil supports would


105
be so numerous as to very materially
block the cooling ducts, thereby raising
the required air-pressure to a prohib-
itive value. With cylindrical coils hav-
ing vertical supports at right angles to
the plane of the turns, great mechani-
cal strength is secured, at the same
time providing a free opening for the
amount of air necessary to take care
of the losses.
Insulation
First and foremost of the requisite
features for good transforming ap-
paratus are those of safety and dura-
bility, and these depend primarily on
the insulation. The modern long-dis-
tance transmission line of high volt-
age and large capacity often passing
through widely varying altitudes has
introduced insulation problems of
great importance. Sudden voltage
rises due to switching, arcing grounds,
etc., mean not only severe strains on
the end turns of the transformer, but
due to high frequencies often "pile up"
the voltage across some interior por-
tion of the windings far in excess of
normal values.
It is no longer sufficient to consider
the transformer merely as an induct-
ance which chokes down a high fre-
quency disturbance by flattening the
wave on the end turns. It must be
recognized that transformers, espe-
cially those of high voltage, also
possess distributed capacity. In any
given case then, there is a certain
critical frequency, i. e., the natural
frequency of the transformer, where
resonance will occur, and abnormal
voltages appear in the interior of the
windings.
Much study has been applied of late
not only to the production of new in-
sulating materials but to their adapta-
tion for transformer use. The ar-
rangement of the insulation, with ref-
erence to its specific capacity has been
carefully studied in order that the
dielectric stresses may be made as
uniform as possible. Insulating bar-
riers have been developed from spe-
cially treated thin paper laminae which

possess extraordinary strength, both
electrically and mechanically. For use
in thoroughly impregnating the wind-
ings of transformers subsequent to the
vacuum drying process, there have
been developed various synthetic gums,
giving high insulating and heat resist-
ing values.
Distributing Transformers.
A long step in advance was made
when the distributed core type of
transformer was introduced into the
lighting field some years ago. Since
then, constant effort toward refine-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
ments in design have evolved a line of
machines possessing remarkably high
efficiency, low average temperature
rise, good regulation and high insula-
tion values.
The general construction of this
type of transformer is shown in Fig.
5, representing a medium size stand-
ard lighting unit, having a voltage
rating of 2200 and 110/220 volts on
ment the wide range of conditions
which must be met in transformer de-
sign. We think of the transformer as
one of the simplest pieces of electrical
apparatus and broadly speaking, it is.
But when we note the demand for a
voltage range up to 150,000 for power
transformers and 1,000,000 for testing
transformers; for a capacity range
from a few watts to 20,000 kilowatts;

high and low voltage sides respective-
ly. It will be seen that both a short
magnetic circuit and a short mean
length of turn are secured, each being
necessary if low losses and good reg-
ulation are to be attained. Such trans-
formers are built in sizes ranging from
one (1) to one hundred (100) K.V.A.
Three representative sizes in this
standard line of transformers, as built
by the largest transformer manufac-
turer are illustrated in Fig. 6, which
shows the various styles of tank con-
struction employed.
Versatility of the Transformer.
In closing this portion of the paper
it is interesting to consider for a mo-
a frequency range from a few cycles
to thousands of cycles; for phase
transformation; for indoor and out-
door service; for mechanical strength
to withstand short-circuit stresses, and
for electrical strength to withstand
many times normal voltages; the prob-
lem of the proper design of trans-
formers appears somewhat complicat-
ed. It is the one piece of apparatus
which must always tie up the varying
characteristics of two systems or parts
of systems.
The increase in K.V.A. capacity
from year to year as built by the
largest transformer manufacturer is
shown in Fig. 7, and the voltage range
corresponding in Fig. 8.

In closing, I will briefly call atten-

plications for transformers. The high

age power to single-phase railway
equipments and the testing transform-
er designed for hundreds of thou-
sands of volts are no doubt fairly well
known.
The telephone line insulating trans-
former may not be so familiar. This
type, shown in Fig. 9, was designed
for use in connection with high volt-
age transmission lines. If properly in-
stalled it allows telephone conversation
while a ground on the transmission
line induces a potential of several
thousand volts between telephone line
and ground. These transformers are
given a very high potential test be-
tween windings, and are designed so
as to transform the high frequency
talking currents with minimum loss.
A recent industrial development that
appears to have opened up a very ex-
tensive field is that of electrical pre-
cipitation. The process makes use of
a strong electric field through which
the gases to be treated are directed and
the solid and liquid particles thereby-
deposited on the "collecting elec-
trodes." Single phase alternating cur-
rent at a potential of say 100,000 is
connected through a mechanical rec-
tifier to the treater pipes as positive,
terminals, and to the discharge elec-
trodes in the center of the pipes as
negative terminals. Potentials as high
as 250,000 volts have already been em-
ployed for this purpose. The trans-
formers must be capable of raising tho
ordinary local circuit voltage to these
high potentials and are particularly
well built to withstand the mechanical
and electrical strains associated with
such a process.

service where abnormal traffic must be
temporarily served, or for use in case
of disabled sections have been more

years. A recent innovation is the
semi-outdoor type of portable sub-sta-
tion, an example of which is illustrated
by Fig. 10. The transformer shown is
designed for 33000 volt three phase
supply at 25 cycles, and is provided
with high inherent reactance for com-
pounding purposes. The high voltage
bushings have been brought out in a
horizontal position due to the small
available overhead clearance, and the
transformer of course made complete-
ly weatherproof.

for voltage control and with oil spark
gap being assembled as a unit. The
supply circuit may be either 100, 200
or 400 volts with a resulting testing
voltage of either 15,000 or 30,000. This
set is found very useful for determin-
ing the dielectric strength of oil and
furnishes maximum convenience and
compactness. After testing a sample
of oil, the spark gap is turned in its
trunnions, the oil thereby being
emptied into the cast depression on the
cover, from which it can be drawn
through the pipe to the side of the
tank.
A miniature transformer, styled by
the manufacturer as the "All Nite
Lite" transformer has recently been
placed on the market, and due to its
novelty deserves mention here. As will
be noted from Fig. 12, the transformer
is contained in a brass shell and is as-
sembled with a miniature Mazda lamp.
The normal house voltage of no to
120 is transformed to six or seven
volts for use on a 2 candle power lamp.
These devices find a ready use for all
night illumination wherever a small
economical light is desired, such as on
door-fronts, in stairways, hospital
rooms, etc.

PROFESSORS G. W. PATTERSON AND F. H. STEVENS
The forces on a beam tend to shear the beam transversely and the
shearing action at any transverse section is equal to the resultant of the
transverse forces on one side of the section, i. e. "Shear at any right section
of a beam is the algebraic sum of all the transverse forces on one side of
the section."
In considering the shearing action at a section of the beam the loads
will tend either to cause the portion to the right of the section to descend
and the portion to the left to ascend (Fig. i) or vice versa (Fig. 2). It is
conventional in this College to call the former positive (-)-) shearing and
the latter negative (—) shearing.
The forces on a beam produce at any transverse section a bending mo-
ment equal to the algebraic sum of the moments of all the forces on one side
of the section taken about an axis lying in the section and passing through

its center of gravity in an appropriate direction. In what follows, this axis
will be a horizontal line; for we shall assume (a) that the beam is hori-
zontal and (b) that all the forces lie in a vertical plane in which the center
of gravity of every transverse section lies. With this understanding, we
define bending moment as follows: "The bending moment at any right
section of a beam is the algebraic sum of the moments of all the forces on
one side of the section taken about a horizontal line passing through the
center of gravity of the section, as an axis."
When a horizontal beam is bent by the action of the forces on it, it will
either become concave or convex on the top, and in this College, it is cus-
tomary to call the first case (Fig. 3) positive (-)-) bending and the other
(Fig. 4) negative (—) bending.
The forces which we consider in E. M. 1, as acting on a beam are:
(1) concentrated loads, (2) uniformly distributed loads, (3) loads which
vary as the ordinates of a triangle, and (4) the reactions which are neces-
sary to keep the beam in equilibrium under these forces. The reactions may
be concentrated or uniformly distributed.
Beams are of three classes: the simple beam, the cantilever beam, and
the continuous beam. A simple beam is a beam resting upon supports at its
ends. A cantilever beam rests on one support at its middle, or the portion
of any beam projecting out of a wall or beyond a support may be called a
cantilever beam. A continuous beam is a beam resting upon more than two
supports.


From our definition of shear and bending moment we have for a simple
beam:
F=Left reaction minus loads on the left of the section.
M=moment of left reaction minus moments of the loads on the left
of the section.
The above definitions apply to cantilever beams also, for which the re-
action at the free end is zero.
The following figures show shear and moment diagrams for a cantilever
beam, Fig. 5 being for a uniform load, Fig. 6, for a concentrated load at
the free end, and Fig. 7, for uniform and concentrated loads combined, the
upper diagram being for the shears and the lower one for the moments.
To explain the manner of their construction, it will be sufficient to con-
sider only the third case. Let the beam be 15 feet long, the uniform load
be 40 pounds per linear foot, and the concentrated load be 700 pounds. The
shear at the free end on the right of the concentrated load is F=—700
lbs.; at 5 feet from the left end it is F=—700—5X40=—900 lbs.; at
10 feet from the left it is F=&gt;—700—10X40=—noo lbs., and at the
wall it is F=—700—15X40=—J300 lbs. These values are laid off to
scale downward from a horizontal line and the line connecting their lower
ends is then drawn. The moment at the free end is zero, since the lever
arm of the concentrated load for this section is zero, the moment at 5 feet
from the left end is M=—700X5—200X2^2=—4000 pound-feet, at 10
feet from the left end M=—700X10—400X5=—9000 pound-feet, and
at the wall, M=—700X15—600X7^2=—15,000 pound-feet. These values
are laid off to scale and a line connecting their ends is drawn. The dia-
gram thus constructed shows clearly the distribution of the shears and the
moments throughout the projective part of the beam.
The following figures show shear and moment diagrams for a simple
beam, Fig. 8 being for uniform load, Fig. 9, for one concentrated load, and
Fig. 10, for both uniform and concentrated loads. For Fig. 10, let the
beam be 18 feet long and weigh 20 lbs. per foot, the larger load being
360 lbs. at 6 feet from the left end and the smaller one being 90 lbs. at
12 feet from the left end.
The reactions of the left and right supports are found to be 450 lbs.
and 360 lbs., the sum of which equals the total load, 810 lbs. To con-
struct the shear diagram a sufficient number of values of F must be com-
puted; thus at the right end of the left support F=450 lbs., at the left of
the first load F=450—120=330 lbs., at the right of that load F=45o—
120—360=—30 lbs., at the middle of the span F=45o—180—360=—90
lbs. and so on. It will be noticed that the area of the positive shear and
negative shear parts of the diagram are equal. This is true for cantilever
beams also if the shear diagram is made for the whole beam. To construct
the moment diagram several values of M are computed; thus at 3 feet
from the end M=45oX3—6oXiJ/2=I26o pound-feet, under the first load
M=45oX6—120X3=2340 pound-feet, at the middle of the span M=45oX&lt;)
■—i8oX43^—360X3=2160 pound-feet, and so on. These values being laid
off as ordinates and lines being drawn connecting their ends, the distribu-

tion of the shears and moments throughout the beam is graphically repre-
sented.
From the definitions of F and M and our diagrams it is seen that the
shears are always represented by ordinates to straight lines which are in-
clined when the loads considered are uniform, and horizontal when concen-
trated loads alone are considered. It is also seen that the moments are rep-
resented by ordinates to straight lines for concentrated loads alone, and by
ordinates to parabolic curves for uniform loads either alone or accompanied
by concentrated loads.
The above diagrams for simple beams show that the maximum moment
occurs at the section where the shear passes through zero; and this also
applies to cantilever beams, for at the wall there are reactions reversing
the shear in the beam and carrying its shear frequently to extremely large
values; for the positive and negative parts of the F diagram must have
equal areas. Figure n illustrates the case of a cantilever beam of total
length 13', of which 3' is in the wall. It is assumed that for one-half of
the thickness of the wall, the reaction is upward, varying according to a
triangle law; and for the other half, the reaction is downward, according
to a triangle law also. These reactions amount to no lbs. and 90 lbs.
in the aggregate with center of reaction 1' from the center of the wall. The
part of the wall immediately above and below the beam against which it
does not press are cut away in the diagram.
From the above, we are naturally led to see that the bending moment
curve is the integral curve of the shear curve and, of course, then the shear
curve is the first derived curve of the bending moment curve, and this is
made clear by referring to Fig. 12. Let W denote the resultant (in position
as well as in magnitude) of all loads for the distance b from the left
support, and w the intensity of the uniform load for the distance c. The
bending moment at any section z along c is then
M=Rx—W(x—a)—w(x—b) .J^(x—b)
Differentiating dM/dx=R—W—w(x—b)=F. To find the condition for
maximum or minimum bending moment, let the first derivative equal zero,
whence
dM/dx=R—W—w (x—b)=F=0.
The following principles are deduced:
1. The rate of change of the bending moment at any section is equal
to the shear at that section, i. e. the ordinate of the shear curve at any
section represents the value of the slope of the tangent to the bending mo-
ment curve for that same section; and as a rule the ordinate of the bending
moment curve at any right section represents the algebraic sum of the areas
under the part of the shear curve to the left of the section. In case, how-
ever, a bending moment is added at any section of the beam, to the left of
the section considered, by outside forces or couples which produce no trans-
verse shear, the total bending moment is represented by the algebraic sum
of the added couple and the shearing force area. In this case we shall find
that the bending moment curve is discontinuous at this section. The

area of the shear curve to the right of the transverse section is as rule equal
and opposite in sign to the bending moment at the section.
2. If the shear is zero at a section covered by a uniform load, the bend-
ing moment is a maximum or minimum at that section.
3. If the shear changes from positive to negative, i. e. passes through
zero at a concentrated load, then from "1" the bending moment is maxi-
mum or minimum under the load.
4. If the shear is zero for any distance, the bending moment is con-
stant for that distance, except as in "1".
We are now able to graph the bending moment curve from the shear
curve. Fig. 13 illustrates the case of constant shear, the bending moment
being represented by a straight line with a slope whose value equals the

positive and increasing; Fig. 15, positive and decreasing; Fig. 16, negative
and decreasing; Fig. 17, negative and increasing; and Fig. 18, shear curve
zero for some distance.
Perhaps a few problems will help to make the above clear.
Fig. 19 is a cantilever beam with a uniform load, a load of 100 lbs.
acting at an angle, and a constant couple and a force which gives no shear


or bending moment. We notice that it is necessary to get the vertical com-
ponent of the 100 lb. force in order to draw the shear diagram. To draw
the bending moment diagram, we first draw that part of the bending moment
diagram which represents the constant couple of 50 pound-feet and to this
add the ordinates got from the shear diagram. All the principal ordinates
are marked, the common tangents are marked T, and the parabola is marked
Par., and the vertex of the parabola is marked V.
Fig. 20 is a beam loaded as shown and supported by a rope passing over
two pulleys which gives the reactions to be 132 pounds each.
Fig. 21 is a beam with a uniform support. Notice in the bending moment
diagram that the points of inflection are marked P. I. and that the two lower
parabolas have not a common tangent since the value of the tangent's slope
on the left is 125, while that on the right is —125, hence N. T. is marked at
the ordinate of their intersection.
Fig. 22 is a beam 20 feet long supported at the left end and at a point
5 feet from the right end, and carrying a load increasing uniformly from
zero at the left end to 6,000 lbs. per linear foot at the right end of the
beam. Let the left end of the beam be the origin of coordinates, and x and
y the distance from the origin and the linear load respectively. Then y=30ox.
The shearing force equation up to the second support is evidently

when RL is the left end reaction. First we must find RL the total load is

and its center of gravity is at x=4o/3 (two-thirds of the length), or 5/3

To locate the points where the bending moment is zero we must equate
Mt to zero, or
20,ooox/3t=5ox3, this gives two values of x on the beam, x=o and x=i 1.547
(the negative root being neglected as before). A similar examination of F2
and M2 shows that at the right end of the beam both quantities become zero
with M2 a minimum from the negative standpoint. Examination of the
curves shows that the largest negative bending moment is at the second sup-
port (x=i5) for which point both Mt and M2 give the value 68,750 pound-
feet.

THE TRANSCONTINENTAL TELEPHONE LINE
J. D. GORDON. '06
Plant Supervisor, The Central District Telephone Co.
(illustrations by courtesy
The widespread interest which the
public has taken in the opening of
transcontinental telephone service has
been shared by engineers, but for dif-
ferent reasons. As President Wilson
said at the time, "It appeals to the
imagination to talk across the conti-
nent", and that appeal is what reaches
the public. The engineering features
of the achievement, however, are of
interest not only to the electrical man,
but to anyone whose job requires care-
ful attention to details. The success
of the project is not due to one or two
or three important discoveries or in-
ventions, it is the result of thorough
study of every detail, and the improve-
ment of every part of the complex
circuit.
It is often forgotten that the devel-
opment of hard-drawn copper wire,
on which we are so dependent for out-
side line construction, 1s due to the
demands of the telephone. Early in
telephone history, the growth of the
system demanded a better conductor
than galvanized iron, and soft copper
was tried. Its own weight soon caused
it to sag and break, and so Thomas B.
of the telephone news)
Doolittle, after a good deal of experi-
menting, found that if the wire were
not annealed after drawing, its tensile
strength would be great enough to
support it in reasonably long spans.
The wire used in the transcontinental
line is No. 8 B. W. G., diameter .165
in., weight 435 lbs. per mile. Thus
the four wires which stretch from
New York to San Francisco weigh
2,900 tons, a load for 58 freight cars.
When we remember that there are
130,000 poles in the line, and that each
one represents a point at which leak-
age over insulators may take place, it
is obvious why special insulators have
been developed. These are of porce-
lain and are much larger and more
costly than glass insulators. Wherever
insulated leading-in wires are connect-
ed there will be leakage over the wet
braid after a rainstorm. To prevent
this, the connection to the line wire
is made through a pin moulded into
an insulator with a deep petticoat.
Under this, two or three inches of the
braided insulation are kept dry even
in the severest storms. No care or
expense is spared to keep the line ab-

solutely free from tree interference;
in many cases rights of way are pur-
chased and cleared. Power and trol-
ley lines are sedulously avoided, for
the entire line is phantomed and phan-
tom circuits are particularly sensitive
to inductive disturbances. Great care
was taken in transposing the wires
against cross-talk between the various
circuits.
Loading coils were placed about
every eight miles along the line. Three
coils were used—one for the phantom
and one for each physical circuit. The
connections were such that while the
physical circuit passed through the


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
"phantom" coil, it was unaffected by
it, and likewise the phantom circuit
was unaffected by the "physical" coil.
The leading-in wires were connected
through insulators in the manner pre-
viously described and lightning arrest-
aim is to use as little as possible and
keep that at the highest possible effi-
ciency.
In general the transcontinental cir-
cuit follows existing long-distance tel-
ephone routes. Where possible, pres-

ers were provided to protect the coils
from damage from static surges.
While little has been said about cen-
tral office equipment, this is one of the
most important fields for the exercise
of engineering skill. Every piece of
apparatus connected to the line reduces
its transmitting power. The constant
ent circuits of No. 8 wire have been
utilized, but in the west much new
wire was to be strung, and through
Nevada and Western Utah nearly 500
miles of new pole line had to be built.
The line from the Utah-Nevada
boundary through to the Coast is the
work of the Mountain State Telephone


121
&amp; Telegraph Company, of whose con-
struction I am able to present pictures,
through the courtesy of the "Tele-
phone News". A 400-mile stretch of
line was built by this company across
the State of Utah in ninety days. The
13,900 poles were of sawed redwood
18 ft. long, having 4 in. by 4 in. top
and 4 in. by 8 in. butts. Although the
line followed the Southern Pacific
loaded, they returned to civilization
with real regret.
Great precautions have been taken
to provide for quick repairs in emerg-
encies. In addition to the switching
stations located just outside of each
city which the line passes, there are
test-stations at intervals of about 200
miles. Sometimes these are in farm-
houses where the entire family are able

Railroad, it was at some distance away
so that all poles were delivered to the
stakes by wagon. Unusual rains
turned the desert in many places into
swamps or shallow lakes and made
transportation difficult. As a contrast
it was necessary to haul water as far
as twenty-five miles for the men and
teams. Vans were provided for sleep-
ing quarters and meals were served
under tents. All the men worked with
great enthusiasm, and when the four
wires had been strung, transposed and
to comply with the nearest Wire
Chief's request to "give me a 'short'

ter-houses are provided with food and
fuel and a stock of material for re-
pairs. Sometimes there is a trap-door
in the roof for use when snow has
drifted above the doorway. In all
weathers linemen are patrolling their
sections and face the greatest hard-
ships to keep the lines in service.
Although the telephone company's
engineers are very much pleased with


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
their achievement, they feel that it has
only broadened their horizon. To quote
from J. J. Carty, Chief Engineer,
"This matter of progress is governed
by the laws which govern the diffusion
of light. The further away we go
from the center of our ignorance out
into the sphere of knowledge, the more
we will find to do. It will not be
twice as far away from the center;
twice as many new things to do; but
it will at least be four times as many
new things to do."
The most striking feature probably
of the achievement of transcontinental
telephony is that it is not the result of
any one man's work; a staff of 400
scientists, each doing wonders in his
own branch of the profession. One
man developed the insulator; one man
studied the transpositions; another
certain details of central office equip-
ment, and as a whole every feature of
the telephone system and business had
to be studied, reviewed and perfected
to a state not yet reached in the art,
in order to achieve this wonderful re-
sult.
It might be of interest to Michigan
men to know that Mr. L. F. More-
house, '97E, former Professor of Elec-
trical Engineering, at Ann Arbor, who
was in charge of the telephone courses,
has had a great deal to do with the
perfection reached in the apparatus
used in the making transcontinental
telephony possible. Mr. Morehouse at
present is Equipment Engineer of the
A. T. &amp; T. Co., and through the work
of himself and his staff, many pieces
of equipment were designed and per-
fected that made it possible to talk
from New York to San Francisco.
GRADUATE COURSES IN MUNICIPAL
ADMINISTRATION
W. C. HOAD
Professor of Sanitary Engineering.
During the past two or three years
inquiries have come to the University
in constantly increasing number, re-
garding courses of study in prepara-
tion for public service work in the
field of municipal administration. In
response to this growing demand,
which seemed to be the expression of
a real need, a program of study in
the Graduate School has been ar-
ranged leading to the Master's Degree,
and work under it has been placed in
the hands of a permanent committee
organized for the purpose.
This program of study is not in the
nature of a hard and fast curriculum,
but consists rather of a group of
courses, given in several different de-
partments of instruction, which have
the common feature of being definite-
ly related to some of the varied activi-
ties of the modern city. They bear to
municipal administration something
like the same relation that certain
groups of courses in the Department
of Mechanical Engineering, for ex-
ample, bear to manufacturing. No
one imagines that the program of
study in municipal administration will
supply a ready-made and complete
equipment for the important position
of city manager, any more than he
pretends that the successful comple-
tion of the group of courses in me-


123
chanical engineering will fully prepare
for the position of president of a man-
ufacturing corporation. It is believed,
however, that the program as outlined
furnishes an appropriate means of
preparation for entrance into a field
of useful public service which at pres-
ent offers many attractive possibilities.
While it is true that most American
cities have not yet reached the point
of choosing their mayors as the better
governed European cities select their
chief executive officers,—from consid-
erations of personal fitness for the
work which the city has to do,—-there
is nevertheless an ever widening move-
ment toward a greater degree of di-
rectness, and therefore of effective-
ness, in city administration, and as
means toward this end various forms
of government by commission have
been developed and are now being
tried out. Such positions as city man-
ager, public service commissioner and,
in the larger cities, department and
bureau heads, more and more are
coming to be filled by men sought for
and appointed because of their dem-
onstrated fitness for the particular
duties of the office. Usually these offi-
cials are fairly well paid, and tenure
of office is increasingly dependent up-
on good service and decreasingly upon
the vagaries of local politics.
In addition to these public offices
there are many semi-public positions
connected with or related to the devel-
opment of cities and to the conduct of
city affairs which now offer attractive
openings for public service careers.
Among these may be mentioned by
way of illustration, such positions as
those of civic and commercial secre-
taries, municipal reference directors
and efficiency experts.
The specific courses in the municipal
administration program are comprised
under two groups. The courses in the
first group are required of all candi-
dates for the advanced degree, and
are as follows:
REQUIRED COURSES.
Municipal Government (Political
Science 3 and 4), six hours.
Seminary in Municipal Administration
(Political Science 17 and 18),
four hours.
Principles of Accounting (Political
Economy 38), three hours.
Municipal Accounting (Political
Economy 42), two hours.
Mathematical Theory of Finance
(Mathematics 51), three hours.
City Planning and Civic Improvement
(Landscape Design 5), three hours.
Water Works (Civil Engineering
30), three hours.
Sewerage (Civil Engineering 32),
two hours.
Sanitary Science (Civil Engineering
34), one hour.
Municipal Engineering (Civil Engi-
neering 36), tivo hours.
Roads and Pavements (Civil Engi-
neering 40), tivo hours.
Municipal Corporations (Law 4), tzvo
hours.
Field Work, three months.
In addition to the foregoing there
is a group of courses designated as
elective, but which the committee in
charge of the program recommends
should be taken in large part by those
desiring to fit themselves for munic-
ipal service. They are as follows:
ELECTIVE COURSES.
Public Finance (Political Economy
4), three hours.
Public Service Industries (Political
Economy 16), two hours.
Public Officers (Law 6), two hours.


THE MICHIGAN TECHN1C
Highway Laboratory (Civil Engi-
neering 43), two hours.
Public Utilities (Civil Engineering
27), one hour.
Municipal Lighting (Electrical En-
gineering 32), two hours.
General Hygiene (Hygiene ii), tivo
hours.
Administration of Health • Laws
(Hygiene ii), too hours.
Problems in Sociology (Sociology
20), three hours.
This program of study may be read-
ily approached by either of two gen-
eral routes, one a somewhat special-
ized undergraduate course in Political
Science and Political Economy in the
the College of Literature, Science and
Arts, and the other a course in Civil
Engineering in the College of Engi-
neering. A candidate whose approach
has been by either of these routes may
ordinarily complete the required pro-
gram in about one year's time. A
second graduate year is usually re-
quired in case the candidate has not
come up through either of the routes
mentioned.
That an appropriate undergraduate
course in civil engineering is a logical
and entirely suitable avenue of ap-
proach to the advanced work in mu-
nicipal administration can hardly be
questioned. The undergraduate cur-
riculum is not highly technical as to
its content, the earlier years being
entirely occupied by broadening and
disciplinary studies such as English,
modern foreign language, political
economy, mathematics, chemistry,
physics, geology and other natural sci-
ences, the professional studies being
practically limited to the last year's
work. It is the constant and studied
purpose of the course to cultivate in
the prospective engineer a wide range
of interests among things worth while.
to develop his constructive imagina-
tion into a useful and usable faculty,
to stimulate in him the growth of the
scientific spirit, to lead him into the
power of doing things for himself,
and finally to awaken in him the true
professional spirit of unselfish and de-
voted service.
To the young engineer about to be-
gin his professional career the opening
field of municipal administration pre-
sents some attractive possibilities. This
is a perfectly logical field for him to
enter, for most of the activities with
which city life is concerned are defi-
nitely related to engineering. Aside
from the money spent on the education
of the young, which is not distintively
a city problem, in the long run the
bulk of the expenditure for public pur-
poses goes for pavements, water sup-
plies, sewerage and drainage, lighting
and the manufacture and distribution
of power, local transportation, sanita-
tion, fire and flood protection, the
building of parks and boulevards and
other features of the development and
maintenance of the physical structure
of the city. By reason of the broad
and fundamental character of his
training and the traditions of his pro-
fession, no less than because of the
technical knowledge and skill which
he has at his command, the experi-
enced engineer is especially well fitted
to undertake the administration of
such public matters. That this is now
somewhat generally recognized is evi-
denced by the fact that a large pro-
portion of the executive heads of the
various bureaus and departments of
large cities have reached their present
positions through engineering, and by
the further well known fact that prac-
tically all the city managers in the
thirty or forty cities of the country


125
that so far have adopted the commis-
sion and manager form of city admin-
istration have been appointed from the
ranks of the engineering profession.
The whole domain of engineering is
broadening, not only by the extension
technical knowledge and skill, but
especially through the cultivation by
engineers of fields of common human
endeavor in which technical attain-
ments are of less consequence than
a sound understanding of human na-
ture. Engineers themselves are devel-
oping a deeper sense of the essential
dignity and worth of the profession of
which they are members, and of their
responsibility toward the common wel-
fare. With a better appreciation by
the public of the large serviceableness
of the profession in the work of the
world there are being opened up for
cultivation many fields of useful en-
deavor hitherto unoccupied. Among
these none present larger or more at-
tractive possibilities than the one for
which the University is now offering
preparation in the new program in
municipal administration.
A WATER TURBINE PROBLEM
PROFESSOR H. J. GOULDING
The performance of a water turbine
depends, aside from the head under
which it operates, mainly on the pro-
portions of the runner and the shape
of the runner buckets, that is to say,
in order to secure certain desired re-
sults it is necessary to give to the run-
ner certain proportions and to shape
the runner vanes in a certain way. Of
the utmost importance are the angles
of the vane at discharge measured in
the so-called flow surfaces. As in the
modern types of wheels these flow sur-
faces vary from point to point in di-
rection and are surfaces of revolution
generated by curved lines, it is prac-
tically impossible to, measure these
angles after the runner is built and
hence impossible to determine how
close the runner has been made to
what it ought to be. Yet it is very im-
portant to check a runner in this par-
ticular in order to know, should the-
performance be found to be different
from what was expected, whether this
is due to mistakes in the building of
the wheel or due to mistakes in the
designing of the same. For this rea-
son it is necessary to check the angles
by an indirect method, namely, by
measuring the area at different points
on the discharge edge of the runner
after it is made, and comparing it with
the area found at the corresponding
points as determined from the work-
ing drawing of the runner.
The designer's problem then be-
comes that of finding a method of ob-
taining from his working drawings the
accurate shortest distance from a point
on the discharge edge of one vane to
the surface of the vane ahead. The
solution of this problem by the prin-
ciples of descriptive geometry follows.
In Fig. 1 is shown a water turbine
runner. Point P, on the discharge
edge of vane B, represents the point
from which the shortest line to the
vane C is to be obtained. The curves
on the surface of vane C lie in planes
perpendicular to the axis of the run-
ner.
Through point P, perpendicular to
these planes, pass any plane P-l-2-s-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
3-4 cutting the curve 2-S-3 from the
surface of vane C. The shortest dis-
tance in this plane will be PS, the
radius of the arc of a circle drawn
tangent to 2-S-3 with P as a center.
If the exact position of the *desired
shortest distance from point P to vane
C were known, a plane could be passed
through it as indicated and the true
The shortest distances measured
from the point P to the surface C in
the several auxiliary planes used, may
be taken as the elements of a conical
surface whose vertex will be located
at the point P. This cone is repre-
sented at D and E, Fig. 1. The point
P on the discharge edge of vane D
corresponds to the point P on vane B
length obtained. This exact position
cannot be located except by trial, and
therefore, the operation outlined is re-
peated several times by assuming the
auxiliary planes through point P so
as to include somewhere between their
extreme positions the plane containing
the desired shortest distance.
*To distinguish the shortest distance
called for in the problem from the other
shortest distances referred to, it will be
called the "desired shortest distance."
and PS corresponds to the PS of plane
P-1-2-S-3-4. PQ and PR are ele-
ments lying in similar auxiliary planes
and are determined in the same man-
ner as PS. The desired shortest dis-
tance PX will also be an element of
this cone and will, therefore, pierce
the surface of the vane in the line of
intersection SRXQ of the cone with
the surface. This line of intersection
will contain the extremities of the
shortest distances lying in the auxil-


127
iary planes; as for example, the point
S in plane P-1-2-S-3-4, Fig- l-
The next step is to develop the con-
ical surface showing the curve of in-
tersection on the development. With
is the true length of the desired short-
est distance sought for in the problem.

the vertex in its developed position as
a center, draw an arc of a circle tan-
gent to the curve of intersection in its
developed position. The line joining
the point of tangency with the vertex
is the shortest element of the cone and
vane B, the point P, the discharge edge
of vane C and the curves on the sur-
face of vane C contained in planes per-
pendicular to the axis.
The axis of the runner is taken per-
pendicular to the horizontal plane of


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
projection. The point of intersection
of the lines w-p-z and 10-8-5-3, F'&amp;- 2-
would be its horizontal projection and
its vertical projection would be con-
tained in a vertical line through this
point. These projections are omitted
for lack of space. In the runner under
consideration the discharge edges lie
in planes that contain the axis. The
angle a is the angle between these
planes. The lines i'-i', i'-$f,
5'-5'» 8'-8' and io'-io' are the vertical
traces of planes, perpendicular to the
axis, that cut the curved lines 1-1, 3-3,
5-5, 8-8 and 10-10 from the surface of
vane C. If the plane containing the
discharge edge of vane C is taken
parallel to or coincident with the ver-
tical plane of projection 10-8-5-3-1 will
represent the horizontal trace of the
plane and will contain the horizontal
projection of the discharge edge. The
vertical projection of the edge is the
line io'-8'-5'-3'-i'. The projections
of a part of the discharge edge of vane
B are given by the lines w-p-z and
w'-p'-z'. The point P is assumed on
the discharge edge of vane B and is
represented by its projections p and p'.
If, with p as a center, arcs of circles
are drawn tangent to any of the curves
as 10 and 8, the line joining the points
of tangency with p will determine very
nearly the position of the horizontal
trace of the plane which contains the
desired shortest distance. The hori-
zontal traces of the auxiliary planes
are then placed on either side of this
position as pt, pv, and pu, the latter
closely approximating the position of
the plane containing the desired short-
est distance.
To find the shortest distance in plane
PV from P to the surface of the vane,
first find the intersection of the plane
with the surface by locating the points
where the lines of the surface are cut
by the plane. Since the plane PV is
perpendicular to the horizontal plane,
such points as io1-81-51 on its horizon-
tal trace pv are the horizontal projec-
tions, and 10/-8/-5/ are the vertical
projections of points on the curve of
intersection. By revolving the plane
PV about a vertical line through P
until it is parallel to the vertical plane,
the line of intersection in its new
position will be shown vertically in its
true size. In this revolution line pv
takes the position pvu, points iol-81-51
take the positions io„-8„-5„ and
points 10/-8/-5/ take the positions
lOii-^'Sxi- The curve io./^'-s,/
is the true size and shape of the curve
of intersection. As the relationship of
this curve to p' is the same as the re-
lationship that actually exists between
the curve of intersection and P, an arc
of a circle can be drawn tangent to it
with p' as a center and p'-Sj/ will be
equal to the shortest distance in the
plane PV from P to the surface of the
vane. In revolving back to the orig-
inal position, line PS takes the posi-
tion given by its projections p-s and
p'-s'. This line is one of the elements
of the cone upon the surface of which
the desired shortest distance is located
and point S is a point on the curve of
intersection of this cone with the sur-
face of the vane. In the same manner
elements PQ and PR contained in
planes PT and PU respectively are
obtained, and points Q and R are
points on the curve of intersection. If
the elements of the cone are produced
until they pierce the horizontal plane
whose vertical trace is S'-o'-o^' the
curve joining the points of piercing
may be taken as the base of the cone.
The curved line through o-f-g is the
horizontal projection of the base and
the vertical projection coincides with
the horizontal line through O'.


129
In Fig. 3 is shown the development
of the cone. The curve O-F-G is the
developed base and S-R-Q is the devel-
oped curve of intersection. As this
curve joins the extremities of the
shortest distances from P to the sur-
face of the vane, the extremity of the
desired shortest distance is located
upon it. The position of this point X
is determined by drawing an arc of a
circle tangent to the curve with the
developed position of the vertex as the
center. The line joining the devel-
oped position of the vertex with X, the
point of tangency, is the shortest ele-
ment on the cone and the true length
•of the desired shortest distance from
point P to the surface. Its horizontal
and vertical projections p-x and p'-x'
may be located in Fig. 2 by making f-g
on the horizontal projection of the
base equal to the length F-G shown in
Fig. 3. Join g with p. This line inter-
sects s-r-q in the horizontal projection
of X. The vertical projection of X is
shown just to the right of r' on the
curve s'-r'-q'. The letter x' is omitted
for the sake of clearness.
The shortest distances from a series
of points on the discharge edge of
runner B to the surface of vane C may
be determined in the manner above
described. These distances, the curve
on the surface of the vane joining the
points where they pierce the surface,
and the discharge edge, determine the
discharge area which may be compared
with that of the runner after the run-
ner is built, and enables the designer
to account for whatever departure
there may be in the performance of
the built runner from what would be
expected of it if it were constructed
in every respect exactly like the run-
ner designed.
THE LICENSE QUESTION
James N. Hatch, '92
If Engineers were licensed,
How licensious should they be?
Would that lie with the licensor,
Or with the licensee?
Aqd if license equals liberty,
As Webster surely states,
Would we all be libertines,
•Or just licentiates?
And if they licensed us, no doubt,
We each will wear a tag,
A-hanging on our coat lapel,
Tied with a yellow rag,
And being licensed then you see,
Our motives will be clear.
And people won't get buncoed
When they hire an Engineer.

The new power plant of the Singer Manufacturing Company at South
Bend, Indiana, designed by Neiler Rich &amp; Company, Chicago, is meeting
the needs of one of the largest industrial plants in the country. Tests were
made on the old plant in order to obtain data for the new plant, where all
the power equipment is centralized.

The new plant is peculiar in that wood waste is used as a fuel instead of
coal. Special machinery had to be designed to handle this fuel. The boiler
plant and sawdust conveying system are shown in Figs. 3 and 5. Figs. 1,
2, and 4 are general views of the plant.
The boiler plant is composed of six Babcock and Wilcox boilers of 520
H. P. each. The sawdust is carried from various points in the factory to
the storage tanks by means of suction fans. From the tanks the sawdust
is fed to the furnaces by means of screw conveyors.
The generator system consists of two G. E. turbo-generators of 3,438
K.V.A. each having a speed of 3,600 R. P. M. There are also two smaller
turbines. The power is 440 volt, 3 phase, 60 cycle.
The new power house covers a space of 165' x 134', the boiler room
occupying a space of 161' x 58'. The plant has been in operation for about
eight months and has proved very efficient.
DEFICIENCY IN PERSONALITY RESPONSIBLE
FOR ENGINEER'S FAILURE TO
RECEIVE RECOGNITION
Professor Swain States Qualities Necessary for Leadership and Compares Engineers'
Fitness with that of Lawyers and Business Men.
(Reprinted by Courtesy of
Holding that if engineers do not re-
ceive proper recognition for their abil-
ity, there are natural and ascertainable
reasons. Prof. George F. Swain, of
Harvard University, in an address be-
fore the American Institute of Elec-
trical Engineers, on Feb. 17, found
that, on the whole, engineers are de-
ficient in clarity of thinking as com-
pared with lawyers, and in both clarity
of thinking and breadth of view as
compared with lawyers and business
men. These prime qualifications for
leadership are but two of many essen-
tials—all of which can be included in
the words "knowledge" and "personal
qualities." Other personal qualities
he considered necessary were charac-
ter, presence, tact and ability to handle
men.
While he conceded that these qual-
ities are to some extent inherent, he
believed that, more or less, they were
the Engineering Record.)
susceptible of development, and he,
therefore, urged that engineers use
their influence to have engineering
curricula changed so as to place great-
er emphasis on fundamentals, and to
have the young men broaden their
horizon by taking an interest in his-
tory, literature, psychology and other
lines which give a grasp on the pro-
blems of life. He believed, too, that
efforts should be made to present the
advantages of an engineering career
to the ablest of our young men so that
more of them would go into engineer-
ing instead of into law, as they do now.
Professor Swain spoke as follows:
Why the Engineer Fails op
Recognition
It is an opinion that is very widely
held, and particularly among engin-
eers, that the engineering profession
is not appreciated at its full value, and


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
that the engineer does not receive the
recognition in public life and as a
leader that his attainments entitle him
to receive. In times past I have not
hesitated on various occasions to raise
my voice, feeble though it may be, in
support of that proposition. I have
not changed my views at all. However,
it seems to me that possibly by em-
phasizing it continually, we may overdo
a little bit that aspect of the matter,
and I am, therefore, going to ask you
tonight to take a different point of
view with me, and to inquire, if the
engineer has not his recognition, what
the causes for it are, and how they
may be remedied.
Of course, as a purely professional
worker, the engineer is always neces-
sary and will always be called upon to
do engineering work. Moreover, sta-
tistics show that the remuneration
which engineers receive is as large as
that received by members of the other
professions, on the average. It is a
question of supply and demand, and
the engineering profession is not over-
crowded. I feel certain of this from
my experience in having turned out a
great many young men year after year,
and having placed them in positions.
Money and Happiness
Moreover, happiness and content,
real success, service to mankind and to
a man's family do not depend upon
money and are not measured by dol-
lars and cents; they can be obtained
just as well when the remuneration is
moderate as when the remuneration is
very large, and engineers, as a rule I
believe, receive compensation sufficient
to enable them to live comfortably.
In my opinion, in recent years the
respect paid to the engineer, if meas-
ured by financial remuneration, has in-
creased, and engineers now frequently
receive very large fees, fees that 25
or 30 years ago would have been con-
sidered almost out of the question.
However, those fees are not as large
as those received by lawyers or doc-
tors, of course, for the reason that the
engineer does not appeal to sentiment,
which is so potent a factor in the other
professions. I presume that fear, love
and avarice are the most potent emo-
tions. The law appeals to all of them.
Medicine appeals to fear and love. En-
gineering appeals to none of them.
Another potent factor in the human
being is vanity. Architecture appeals
to vanity. The architect can easily
convince his client to put up a costly
and luxurious building, upon which he
receives his percentage, the percentage
increasing as the work is less and less
necessary. (Laughter.) The archi-
tect rightly puts a tax on luxury.
However, these matters will take
care of themselves. We are chiefly
concerned here with the status of the
engineer as a leader in the community,
as a moving force, as an administrator
or executor, who leads in the solution
of greater problems.
Qualities for Leadership
The suitability of a man for leader-
ship depends upon two things—his
knowledge and his personal qualities.
Most of the great undertakings today
involve engineering; most of them, to
a very great extent. We recognize
this. We know that we live in an age
of applied science.
Law and business are equally neces-
sary in the solution of these undertak-
ings. There is no more reason, in-
herently, and no less reason, why the
engineer should lead and be the em-
ployer any more than why the lawyer
or the business man should lead and
be the employer. It gets down, there-


135
fore, in the end, to the matter of per-
sonal characteristics. The lawyer or
business man with personality can
easily lead, and can hire the engineer-
ing brains and knowledge, just as the
engineer, if he have the personality,
can lead and can hire the legal and the
business brains and knowledge.
If, therefore, the engineer does not
lead, it must be because he lacks per-
sonal qualities, and if he lack the per-
sonal qualities, he ought not to lead.
There is no mystery about it, no in-
justice. By personal qualities I mean
character, presence, tact, ability to
handle men, breadth of mental vision,
mental training.
Some of these qualities are inherent,
and others are developed, more or less,
by training and experience. There is
no reason to believe or to assume that
one class of men in the same country
and at the same epoch are inherently
superior in regard to personal qualities
to any other class. Have we any reas-
on to suppose that the engineers are
inherently superior to the members of
other classes in this country? It does
not seem to me that we have. What
indications there are might be consid-
ered to point the other way.
Best Men Take Up Law
This is a matter upon which a per-
son cannot speak at all positively or
dogmatically, but I have talked with a
good many college graduates as to
what becomes of the men in their
classes, and I have been rather inter-
ested to find that they almost all tell
me that the ablest men in their classes
go into law or into business. One
thing, therefore, we must do is to in-
duce young men of ability and char-
acter to become interested in engin-
eering and embrace it as a profession.
We can all of us do something in that
direction.
The problem is then reduced to this
further question, whether the personal
qualities that come by training, or are
developed by training and experience,
give to engineers, to the engineering
profession, pre-eminent qualifications
for leadership. Those qualities which
are influenced by training and experi-
ence are mental grasp, ability to rea-
son, capacity to discern truth, desire
for truth, and ability to deal with the
human element. It is generally claimed
that the engineer should be particu-
larly fitted, not only by his knowledge,
which matter I have already referred
to and disposed of, but by his training,
making him able to think straight, to
have a breadth of view to discern the
truth, a desire to get at the truth, and
the ability to know the truth when he
has got at it.
Do Engineers Think Straighter
Than Lawyers or Business
Men?
Now, how true are these claims? Do
engineers think straighter than law-
yers or business men? No positive
statements can be made. Of course,
I am speaking generally, and there are
exceptions to any statement that can
be made, but I doubt whether engi-
neers as a class think straighter than
lawyers, especially, or the well trained
and experienced business man. The
training of the lawyer in the exact
meaning of terms is one of the most
important factors in making him think
straight. We all know that misunder-
standings and errors in reasoning
come about because the exact mean-
ings of the words or terms we use are
not understood. The lawyer is con-
tinually concerned with getting at the
exact meaning of words. In drafting


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
statutes, in drawing wills, in all his
varied work, that is one of the prac-
tical courses of discipline which he
goes through and there could be no
better discipline.
Moreover, no man understands a
question if he can only state it from
the positive point of view, he must also
Ibe able to state it from the negative
point of view; he must see not only
the arguments in favor of it, but the
arguments against it. In that matter,
the lawyer has a most excellent train-
ing. When he assumes a case he puts
himself in the position of his adversary
and exerts his wits to the utmost to
discover the weak points in his own
case. He tries to discover every argu-
ment that can be brought up on the
other side, and then prepares himself
to meet it. I somewhat question if
engineers in their experience go
through quite as good a mental disci-
pline as that, or whether in the school-
room they get anything that is quite
as good a mental discipline.
I think, therefore, that the legal
training and experience on the whole,
train men better to think straight and
reason logically than the engineering
training. The single objection to the
legal training is that the lawyer is apt
to become an advocate. But still we
all know that there are many, very
many, capable, high-minded lawyers
who will not take a case unless they
believe that they have the right.
Breadth of View.
Now, how about breadth of view?
Can we say that the engineer's train-
ing and experience give him greater
grasp of subjects and greater breadth
of view than those of the lawyer or
the business man? Here again there
may be doubt, but I similarly question
whether today, and in the past, the
training of the engineer has given him
as much a grasp of subjects and a
breadth of view as the training of the
lawyer and the business man. I fear
that the engineer concerns himself in
college, and after college, too much
with the minor technical details of his
profession, and does not accustom
himself to study, does not take interest
enough in the consideration of the
broad questions affecting the commu-
nity in general. I know that is so in
the colleges. I know that the young
men get interested in the purely tech-
nical details, and that it is very diffi-
cult to get their minds away from these
things to any large extent.
I am a great believer in the business
man, and I believe that his experience,
bringing him in contact, as it does,
with law, with engineering, with all
the varied activities of life, is a very
excellent training. I should like to
see more engineers in Congress, I
should like to see an engineer become
the President of the United States,
but I should like to see, for once, a
really good business man in the presi-
dential chair. (Applause.)
Instead of complaining, then, al-
though it is true, that the engineer is
not recognized, I urge that we try to
realize that there is a cause for it. We
live in a world of natural law. For
everything that is, there is a cause,
not only in the physical world, but in
the mental and the moral. Let us find
the cause, if the engineer be not rec-
ognized and the remedy.
Among the things I think we can
do are the following: We can exer-
cise our influence to bring the facts in
regard to the engineering profession,
its possibilities, the high character of
its work, to the attention of our stu-
dents and to induce the able young
men of the coming generation to em-


^37
brace the engineering profession. In
the second place, we may influence
technical education and try to secure
a broader curriculum, with more at-
tention to fundamental principles and
less to technical details which the grad-
uate must learn in the field after he
graduates and which he can learn a
great deal better there than in school.
Let us insist on a training in the Eng-
lish language, so that our engineers
shall not only be able to speak and ex-
press themselves properly, but be able
to write a proper report, and therefore
impress upon people with whom they
come in contact that not only are they
qualified in their engineering specialty,
but that they are able to mix with men
and deal with large questions in a com-
prehensive way.
Narrowing Tendency of
Mathematics.
I agree entirely with what has been
said in regard to mathematics. I think
the fact that engineering is to so large
an extent a mathematical subject is
one of the main reasons why the engi-
neer is not recognized. In my opinion,
there is scarcely anything that tends
more to narrowness of view than deal-
ing all the time with problems that can
be solved, only by rigid mathematical
processes, because the great questions
which confront us are not mathe-
matical ; the data are shifting, variable,
and the human element comes in.
Therefore, the man who is accustomed
to solve his problems by mathematics,
and can only do the solving in that
way, finds himself at a loss in the
practical affairs of life—mathematics
do not apply. We should seek to
broaden the minds of our engineering
students by study in history, literature,
psychology and other subjects which
give a broad outlook upon life.
I urge, therefore, that in these ways
we help to give the engineer of the
future the personal qualities for lead-
ership. We may rest assured that if he
be possessed of these qualities, leader-
ship will come to him.
EXPERIMENTAL TOWBOATS
PROF. E. M. BRAGG
An important piece of research work
was recently undertaken in the U. of
M naval tank at the request of a spe-
cial board of engineer officers of the
U. S. Army.
In the River and Harbor Act, ap-
proved June 25, 1910, there is this
item:
"The Chief of Engineers, under the
direction of the Secretary of War, is
hereby authorized to design and con-
struct two experimental towboats of
modern but different types, with a
complement of suitable barges and
necessary loading and unloading facili-
ties for towing and delivering supplies
along the Mississippi River and its
tributaries, and in making design for
such boats the said Chief of Engineers
shall investigate and consider types of
boats in use for similar purposes on
non-tidal rivers in this and other coun-
tries, and for the purpose of such in-
vestigation, designs, and construction,
there is hereby appropriated the sum
of $500,000."
Prof. Sadler was requested to make
the necessary experiments in the ex-
perimental tank to determine the re-
sistance of different types of models,


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
in various depths of water, when
towed singly and also when in groups
of six or less.
This type of towboat is very often
propelled by means of paddle wheels,
and as there was very little experi-

mental data on this type of propeller it
was thought best to conduct experi-
ments upon models of radial wheels
and feathering wheels.
The experiments required over six
months for their completion and neces-
sitated over 3,000 runs to define the
various curves. In the original report
there are over ioo plates containing
curves plotted from the results of
these experiments. In this article only
the conclusions drawn from these ex-
periments will be given with a few
characteristic curves. Anyone desiring
the full data can find it in Document
No. 857, House of Representatives,
63rd Congress, 2nd Session.
Models of barges of nine different
forms were tried at three displace-
ments, in deep water and also in
depths corresponding to 12 ft., 9 ft.,
and 6 ft. of water. The barges had
parallel middle body for one-half their
length and the two ends were made
alike and shaped as shown in Figs. 1,
2, and 3. The dimensions of the full
sized barges were: length 150 ft,
breadth 34 ft., depth 9 ft. The models
were one-twentieth full size. The
three displacements at which the
models were tested corresponded in
the full sized barge to 150 tons (empty
condition), 460 tons, and 832 tons.
In the group tests all the forms
were run in groups of six, two abreast,
three in line, in depths of water corre-
sponding to 12, 9 and 6 ft., and at the
three displacements mentioned. All of
the forms were run in groups of three,
two abreast and one ahead, in 9 ft. of
water, and at 150 tons displacement.
These experiments were sufficient to
show which forms were best and only
forms 2, 4, and 8 were run in groups
of two, three, four, and five, in depths
of water corresponding to "deep", 9
ft., and 6 ft., and at all three displace-
ments.
When the single barges were tested
it was found that at the lower speeds
the resistance curves tended to arrange
themselves in two groups; the types
with the straight deck lines (3, 4, 5,
and 6) having on the whole a greater
resistance than those with the rounded
deck lines (1, 2, 8 and 9). Form No.


139
7 is somewhat erratic, but in the ma-
jority of cases has a greater resist-
ance than the other models with
curved deck lines.
Form No. 2 is, on the whole, the
most consistent in maintaining its po-
sition among the better forms. The
amount of water under the vessel has
a great influence, particularly at high-
er speeds. Some of the water must
be displaced in the transverse direc-
tion and some, perhaps the greater
part, vertically. When the bottom of
the vessel is near the bottom of the
channel the vertical flow is impeded
and consequently forced into the trans-
verse direction.
The shipshape form (No. 8) is uni-
formly good, but, on the whole, when
cost of construction may have to be
considered, is not much better than
No. 2.
A comparison of Nos. 1 and 9 shows
that there is a gain in using the round-
ed instead of square corners at the
ends, but the difference is not very
great, particularly when the extra cost
of construction of No. 9 is taken into
account.
In a number of the resistance curves
there is a decided tendency to "hump"
at speeds between eight and nine miles
per hour. This is a typical effect of
shallow water upon resistance, and in
this case occurs at practically the same
speed in all types, showing that the
effect is due mainly to depth of water
and not to the type of model.
When the models were tested in
groups of six the relative positions of
the resistance curves for different
types changed somewhat as compared
with the individual models, and some
of the types with rather large resist-
ance when alone have a comparatively
smaller resistance when in groups.
This is due to two main factors; first,
the resistance due to the shape of the
bow and stern; second, the resistance
due to the spaces between the stern
and bows of successive models. Types
Nos. 3 and 4 as individuals, have a
higher resistance than some of the
other forms, yet when placed in groups
are better than these same forms in
groups. The reason appears to be that
forms Nos. 3 and 4 fill up more of the
space between the successive barges,
and hence the added resistance due to
each intermediate bow and stern is
somewhat reduced.
Model No. 2, which showed up well
as an individual, maintains its place
when arranged in a group of six, the
slight rounding in of the side between
the boats not causing an undue in-
crease in resistance.
Models Nos. 2, 4, and 8, were tried
in groups of two, three, four, and five,
arranged as follows:
Groups of two arranged two abreast.
Groups of three arranged one for-
ward, two abreast.
Groups of four arranged two
abreast and two deep.
Groups of five arranged one for-
ward, two abreast and two deep.
Runs were also made in the case of
three barges with the single barge
astern, but this combination proved to
have a greater resistance than where
the single barge was ahead.
The tests in deep water at the three
displacements showed that the resist-
ance does not increase as rapidly as the
number of barges. At first as the
number increases the resistance in-
creases rather rapidly, but as more
barges are added the relative increase
in resistance is less.
The tests in shallow water at higher
speeds and deeper displacements gave
some remarkable results. With six
feet of water, medium displacement,
and nine feet of water, maximum dis-
placement, the resistance reaches its


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
maximum amount in many cases for
two barges abreast and is less for 3,
4, 5, and 6 barges (see Fig. 4). In
general the resistance in shallow water
is less for three barges than for two
and is less for five barges than for
Fis.4-.
four. This is probably due to the fact
that in shallow water the flow is ap-
proaching the two dimensional state,
and the single vessel ahead acts as a
bow for the rest of the barge train.
The experiments seemed to give the
following results:
(1) In Deep Water.
No. 8 at practically all displacements
and groupings is the best; No. 2 is
better, on the whole, than No. 4, ex-
cept at some of the deep displace-
ments and in the larger number of
groups. In general, however, No. 2
lies between No. 8 and No. 4.
(2) 9 Ft. Depth of Water.
No. 8 at all displacements and
groupings is the best; No. 2 is better
than No. 4 at the lighter displace-
ments; No. 4 is slightly better than
No. 2 at some of the deeper displace-
ments, but at the deepest displace-
ments in all groups there is very little
difference between the three types.
(3) 6 Ft. Depth of Water.
No. 4 is on the whole the best at
both light and medium displacements,
and No. 8 is better than No. 2. At
the deeper displacements in all groups
there is very little difference between
the three types.
General Conclusions.
For cases where barges are to be
operated both singly and in a train,
the points to be considered in connec-
tion with the adoption of any type are
as follows:
(1) Its performance as an indi-
vidual.
(2) Its performance when ar-
ranged in a group.
(3) Its relative cost of construc-
tion.
From the above experiments it
would appear that the choice lies be-
tween types Nos. 2, 4, and 8; for while
Nos. 1 and 9 are amongst those which
have small resistance, their carrying
capacity upon a given draft is consid-
erably less than some of the others.
For simplicity of construction Nos. 2
and 4 are superior to No. 8, and in
some cases this may be the determining
factor. No. 2, the modified scow type,
is a good average performer, both
singly and in groups, and is decidedly
better than the types with the straight
deck line, Nos. 3, 4, 5, and 6. Type
No. 4, (circular rake) has the largest
displacement and hence floats at a
smaller draft than all the others,
which fact, as indicated above, places
it among the better forms in shallow
water. In group formations also this
type has practically no openings be-
tween successive barges and hence has
a smaller resistance in this case than
some of the other types.


RESEARCH
CIVIL ENGINEERING
Sanitary Experiment Station
Messrs. C. W. Smedberg and A. T. Rick-
etts, students in the Graduate Department,
are conducting a series of tests at the Sani-
tary Experiment Station to determine the
value of the excelsior filter in removing
colloids from sewage that has been par-
tially purified in septic tanks and Imhoff
Tanks. Sand filters are used to determine
the efficiency of the colloid removal pro-
cess. The complete apparatus for the tests
is set up in duplicate and continuous records
will be made so as to establish a comparison
between the work of the Imhoff tank and
that of the older and better known septic
tank.
Hydraulics
The field measurements in connection
with the rack tests being made by Mr. F. L.
Bolton, '09 Eng., as mentioned in the last
issue of the Technic, have been completed,
and the results are now being worked up,
and a study given to the theoretical end of
the problem.
Practically no information has been pub-
lished on the question of rack efficiency, so
that this scries of experiments has been
carried out with a view of covering the
whole subject as thoroughly as possible.
In water power design the engineer is fre-
quently unable to determine what particular
shaped bar will give the best efficiency, or
whether or not any appreciable saving can
be made by using a special bar instead of
the rectangular bar ordinarily used. As
some ten different shapes have been inves-
tigated in these experiments, it is hoped
to throw some light on this phase of the
problem. The effect on the efficiency, due
to placing the rack at an angle of inclina-
tion, and the losses that occur when the
rack is placed at an angle with the direction
of flow, are also puzzling questions. These
problems, as well as the effect of thickness,
width and spacing of bars, have been in-
vestigated, and from the data at hand it is
expected that the laws of flow may be
formulated.
Supplemental experiments have been
made in the Naval Tank, under Professor
Sadler's direction, to the end that the re-
sults obtained with the experimental sec-
tions may be extended to racks of any size.
Extensive experiments have been carried
on by F. A. Nagler to determine the ob-
struction to flow caused by bridge piers of
different designs. Since this obstruction
may cause several feet rise in elevation of
water surface in front of the pier at flood
stages, it is a vital factor in connection with
the study of flood control of a stream. Un-
fortunately, few experimental data along
this line are available.
256 experiments have been run on 34
different designs of piers. Present cal-
culations indicate that reliable coefficients
will be presented for each of the different
designs. These coefficients will not only
show the relative efficiencies of the different
designs; but also, when applied to a base
formula, which will be presented, will give
the increase in elevation of the water sur-
face caused by the insertion of one or more
piers in any given stream section.
Both the experiments on racks and the
investigation of bridge piers were made in
a flume built for this purpose at the Argo
Spillway. This was made possible through
the courtesy of Mr. Gardner S. Williams
and the Eastern Michigan Edison Company.
Highway Laboratory
The Regents have recently set aside the
necessary money for the much needed ex-
pansion of the Highway Laboratory both
in floor space and new equipment.
At present there are being conducted in
this department investigations to determine
1. The expansion and contraction of con-
crete pavements in service due to moisture
and temperature changes.


142
2. The desirable hardness, toughness,
and resistance to wear of aggregates used
in the construction of concrete roads.
3. The advisability of making paving
brick out of Portland cement concrete.
This investigation is being conducted by
Mr. H. A. Miles, student assistant.
Dover Township in Lenawee County has
voted to raise enough money to build two
miles of experimental sand clay roads and
has asked the Michigan State Highway De-
partment and the Highway Laboratory at
the University to take charge of the ex-
penditure of this money for them.
MECHANICAL
Mechanical Laboratory
A successful test was made April 1 on
the apparatus in the Mold Loft for deter-
mining the coefficient of heat transfer
through walls of buildings. The material
investigated in this test was glass. The
test box was first placed with the glass
wall vertical; then with the glass wall on
the top; and finally with the glass wall on
the bottom. In this way, information was
obtained concerning the coefficient of heat
transfer through windows, skylights, and
glass floors. While the test of the above
date is to be regarded as of a preliminary
character, the indications are that the co-
efficient for glass is somewhat higher than
the value generally used in practice.
This is the first successful test which has
ever been made on this apparatus, and so
fas as known is the first one of the kind
ever made in this country.
The work on the determination of the
coefficient of flow of steam through sharp
edged orifices has progressed so far as to
indicate that the value of the coefficient is
the same for all initial pressures, at least
in the vicinity of 100 pounds per sq. in.
The investigation of the effect of different
sized orifices will be taken up next.
A knowledge of this coefficient for var-
ious conditions will be of immense value
in the determination of the steam consump-
tion of steam units where it is impracticable
to condense the exhaust steam, and weigh
it.
Considerable use has been made of the
hydraulic air meter which was loaned to
the Laboratory by the Sullivan Machinery
Co. last March. In fact, the meter has
proven so valuable that the Department has
purchased it.
A great deal of difficulty has been ex-
perienced in operating the two Norwalk Air
Compressors which have been used to fur-
nish the compressed air for the calibration
of the sharp edged orifices. These com-
pressors have developed so many mechanical
troubles that the experimental work has
been delayed.
A 00 hour test was made on the Round
Oak hot air furnace in the Laboratory,
April 3 to 6. Coke was used as fuel, and
the furnace was operated under three differ-
ent rates of firing.
ELECTRICAL
Economy Tests on Tungstens
Prof. H. H. Higbie has just finished the
test of 10 makes of tungsten lamps for the
State Board of Purchasing Agents. A
$5,000 contract is about to be let for lamps
for the State institutions and it was very
important to know which lamp would be the
most economical one to buy. The compari-
son is made on the basis of first cost and
the energy consumption during the life of
the lamp, and the results show that the
cheapest lamp is not always the most eco-
nomical. The "Mazda" lamps gave the
highest average efficiency, and the best
among these was the "Edison." In order
to determine the life of the lamp the test
was continued 4.000 or 5.000 hours, being
started early in the winter; the work was
carried out last semester by S. G. Baits and
continued this semester by M. H. Toncray.
It is though that a saving of from $9,000
to $15,000 will be made by this test.
CHEMICAL
Professor Campbell
The work on the constitution of steel
which Prof. Campbell has been conducting
for some time is being continued this semes-


143
ter by Mr. Robt. Atkinson, who is study-
ing the electrical conductivity of steel, and
by Mr. W. V. Sternberger, who is working
on the state in which phosphorus exists in
steel. Prof. Campbell has been trying to
work out the exact nature of the individual
chemical compounds existing in steels, and
it has been necessary to attack the problem
from widely different points. Mr. B. A.
Standerline is using the methods worked
out for the preparation of large crystals of
the individual compounds in cements to
study the effects of substituting iron oxide
for aluminum oxide in celite. the main con-
stituent of Portland cement. Mr. H. L.
Campbell is taking up the possibilities of
reactions under enormous pressures, also
under Prof. Campbell. This field holds
great possibilities but has been so little
worked that much preliminary investigation
is necessary. Mr. G. W. Kysor is studying
binders for abrasive wheels. At present it
is impossible to predict whether a given lot
of wheels will be hard or soft, and the
hardness of the binder is closely connected
with the life of the wheel.
Professor White
Prof. A. H. White's work on the effect
of moisture on the volume changes in con-
crete is being carried on by Mr. G. Hooper
and Mr. W. N. Cowing. Prof. White has
shown that alternate wetting and drying of
concrete causes a corresponding expansion
and contraction. The work now consists,
in continuing the measurements over long
periods of time and under a wider variety
of conditions.
Several years ago the Michigan Gas As-
sociation, in connection with the U. S.
Bureau of Mines, began a series of tests to
determine whether exposure of gas coals
to weathering had any effect on either the
quantity or composition of the gas made
from them. This involves the running of
a test distillation in the experimental plant
at the Ann Arbor gas works. This work
is being done this semester by Mr. H. T.
Hood and Mr. A. S. Irvine, the holders of
the Gas Fellowships, Mr. W. H. Bond, Mr.
F. H. Helrigel, Mr. J. T. Naylon, and Mr.
G. Y. Cheng. Prof. White is also assisting
in the work of Mr. E. R. Young, who is
trying to find a means for automatically
proportioning the amount of disinfectant
to the amount of contamination in sewage.
The present line of attack is based on the
fact that the more concentrated the sewage,
the greater is its electrical conductivity.
This may be utilized in some device by
which a current varying with the conduc-
tivity operates the dosing apparatus.
Professor Ware
The manufacture of varnish, and espe-
cially the use of china-wood oil in varnish
manufacture, is the subject of several stud-
ies. Mr. Schumann has nearly completed
a study of the reactions occurring in the
manufacture of these varnishes. Varnish
manufacture has always been a rule-of-
thumb process; and it is hoped that this
knowledge will lead to a more rational con-
trol of such operations. The work has been
under Prof. Ware's direction. Mr. R. E.
Christman and Mr. J. P. Roberts have been
working on the metallic salts of the acids
in china-wood oil. This has as its object a
more definite knowledge of the constitution
of this oil. With Prof. Ware have also
been working Mr. G. J .Chertoff, on rubber
substitutes; and T. K. Hutson, on water-
proofing cements, especially on the effect of
waterproofing on the strength of the con-
crete.
Professor A. E. White
Prof. A. E. White has a number of prob-
lems under way, largely relating to the gal-
vanized wire investigations. Mr. R. W.
Brown is working on the laboratory meth-
ods used to determine the thickness and
the uniformity of the coatings. Mr. DePree
is making an investigation into the micro-
scopic structure of the galvanized materials,
and Mr. A. G. Sanders is studying the effect
of the different brands of spelter on their
suitability for galvanizing purposes. Mr.
Goettel has the problem of making paving
blocks from blast furnace slag, and Mr.
C. B. Worth is working on the effect of
heat treatment of steels on the size of grain.
Mr. W. P. Wood, who is now teaching
Chemistry at M. A. C, is continuing his


144
work with Prof. A. E. White on the possi-
bility of checking up the phase diagram for
the copper-zinc alloys by means of hardness
determinations. An exact knowledge of this
diagram is essential to the choice of com-
position or heat treatment of brasses for
any particular purpose, but its exploration
by ordinary methods is tedious and uncer-
tain.
Mr. Rue
The proposal of establishing fellowships
in paper manufacture mentioned elsewhere
in this issue receives additional support
from the fact that there are three men
working on paper problems this semester
under Mr. Rue. The disposal of the waste
liquors from pulp plants has always been a
serious problem, though in the soda pulp
mills the waste is burned to recover the
soda. A large part erf the original wood is
present in this waste in a form which sug-
gests distilling it for other by-products. Mr.
F. E. Ford is assisting Mr. Rue in studying
the yields of wood alcohol and acetone from
such distillation. If practicable, this should
be of great importance, not only to the pulp
producers, but also to the industries using
acetone.
Mr. W. E. Jominy is making paper pulp
from bamboo and determining the effect of
conditions on yields, etc. One authority has
predicted that one day bamboo will be the
world's most important source of paper
pulp, and it will very soon be of commer-
cial importance. Mr. V. E. Fishburn is
studying the reactions taking place in sizing
paper with rosin. This is a subject over
which there has been much discussion but
on which comparatively little is known from
a chemical point of view.
All asphaltic materials contain some sul-
phur, but the nature of the compounds in
which it exists and its effect on the proper-
ties of the material is unknown. Mr. S.
Shappirio is trying to isolate some of the
sulphur compounds, or at least to find some
relation between their amount and the prop-
erties of the asphalt. Mr. T. F. Fead is re-
viewing the various methods in use for the
testing of petroleums and petroleum pro-
ducts.
Dr. Gomberg and Dr. Cone
A few Chemical Engineers are doing re-
search in pure Organic chemistry. Mr. C.
S. Schoepfle, Mr. Webb, and Mr. H. F.
Wittaker are all working under Dr. Gom-
berg, and Mr. H. Langendorf is under Dr.
Cone. Dr. Cone also has some lines of
work under way which may be classed as
applied organic chemistry. It has long been
known that certain compounds could com-
bine with gaseous hydrogen under proper
conditions; but that this reaction was com-
mercially feasible for the preparation of
solid, odorless, edible fats from otherwise
unsuitable materials, is of very recent de-
velopment. Solid fats for soapmaking may
be made by this process from liquid oils.
Mr. J. M. Davidson, Mr. H. J. Rupright,
and Mr. E. J. Lewis, are all working on
some phase of this reaction.
Dr. Willard
Dr. Willard and Mr. Lucien Greathouse
have been developing the use of periodates
in analytical chemistry. The salts them-
selves are not new, but they have been of
purely academic interest heretofore. Their
properties have been utilized in this work
to develop new methods for the determina-
tion of chlorin, bromin, iodin, manganese,
and chromium. Mr. Foltz has also been
working with Dr. Willard on the action of
lime and gypsum on the potash in soils.
Many of our soils contain potash enough,
,but in an insoluble—and hence unavailable
—form. It seems that under certain condi-
tions this potash may be liberated by the
agents mentioned.

Professor T. R. Running has for some
time been interested in the application of
graphical methods to the solution of engi-
neering problems involving the use of the
calculus. These methods are made use of

Professor Peter Field is engaged in the
preparation of a paper on "The Kinematics
of a Rigid Body." Moreover, he and Pro-
fessor C. E. Love jointly have nearly com-
pleted the manuscript of a textbook on the
Calculus to be used in colleges and univer-
sities.
Professor C. E. Love is working on var-
ious types of functional equations. In Sep-
tember, 1914, he presented to the American
Mathematical Society at New York a paper
entitled, "Singular Integral Equations of
the Volierra Type." The paper was pub-
lished in the Transactions of the Society
for October, 1914. April 3, 1915, he read
before the Society at Chicago a paper entit-
led, "On Linear Difference and Differen-
tial Equations." This paper will be pub-
lished in the American Journal of Mathe-
matics. He also read a paper at the Feb-
ruary meeting of the Mathematical Club of
the University of Michigan.
The December number of the Bulletin of
the American Mathematical Society, con-

illustrated account of "The Caulking of
Mud-Seams" in connection with the new
locks at Sault Ste. Marie, and Karl Keeler
spoke on "Some Irrigation Problems."
On March 23rd, three papers were pre-
sented. N. S. Flook gave a short history
of the-Pere Marquette R. R. A. C. Simons
followed with an illustrated account of the
construction of the D. U. R. coal docks in
Detroit. The program was closed by R. B.
Sleight, wbo spoke on "Irrigation in Hu-
mid Regions."
MECHANICAL BRANCH
The regular monthly meeting of the Stu-
dent Branch of the A. S. M. E. was held on
Friday, March the twenty-sixth. Professor
Allen gave a very interesting talk on the
subject of Engineering in Turkey. Pro-
fessor Allen's material is almost entirely
drawn from his own personal experiences
in this land, and his accounts of ^je hard-
ships and difficulties under which any kind
of engineering is accomplished are always
of interest.
ELECTRICAL BRANCH
On March 4. Mr. E. H. Martindale, of
the National Carbon Co., addressed the
student branch of the A. I. E. E. on the
subject, "The Use and Misuse of Carbon
Brushes." The discussion covered the var-
ious methods of testing brushes and the de-
vices used for this purpose by the National
Carbon Co., also the various sources of
trouble met with in practice and how to
locate and remedy the trouble in each case.
During the discussion he mentioned that
the National Carbon Co. now makes 57
varieties of brushes so that Heinze has
nothing over them. The lecture was illus-
trated with slides.
The next lecture was on April 8, by Mr.
L. Earl Deane of The American Enamel
Co. His lecture covered the manufacture
and use of enamel wire, and brought out the
growing importance of the use of this kind
of wire in electrical apparatus. Slides
showing the various steps in the process of
manufacture accompanied the lecture.
IN THE COLLEGE
EMPLOYMENT BUREAU
The need for an organization in the Col-
lege of Engineering to assist Seniors and
Graduates in obtaining postions after leav-
ing the University has been felt for some
time, but definite steps were not taken in
this direction until the middle of the last
year. A committee consisting of the heads
of the different technical departments has
taken the matter in hand, drawn up a re-
port as follows:
(1) A committee consisting of heads of
the technical departments or their represen-
tatives, with a chairman to be appointed by
the Dean, shall form a central bureau or
general clearing house to which all requests
for positions whether from employers or
employees shall be referred.
(2) The method at present in operation,
whereby the head of a department has car-
ried on the correspondence connected with
requests for recommendation of men for
positions shall be continued as heretofore.
He is requested, however, to file with the
bureau a copy of his recommendations, par-
ticulars as to the firm, kind of work, etc.,
and such other information which may be
of future use in placing men in similar posi-
tions.
As such requests may come to members
of the staff other than heads of depart-
ments, it is suggested, that the person re-
ceiving the same immediately acknowledge
it, and report to the head of the depart-
ment interested. In such cases the person
receiving the communication will become a
member of the bureau and will render every
assistance necessary in order that the re-
quest may be fulfilled to the best advantage.
(3) In the case of a request, being re-
ceived by any member of the staff which is
of such nature that he feels that he has not
among his own particular students or grad-
uates one who is suitable for the position,
he shall immediately notify the other mem-
bers of the Bureau, so that they may en-
deavor to fill the same.
(4) In correspondence with alumni and
others who may have positions to offer, it
is suggested that members of the Bureau


147
notify them from time to time of the exis-
tence of such a Bureau and ask for their
co-operation.
(5) With the formation of the Bureau
as above suggested it does not appear as
if any elaborate organization is necessary or
advisable. The services of a stenographer,
who will also keep all files of letters, card
index of names of firms desiring men, or
positions vacant and desired, and a few
letter files, index cases, and general small
office supplies, would cover all the addition-
al expenses necessary. Such a stenographer,
when not engaged in work immediately con-
nected with the Bureau would be available
for other correspondence connected with
the College of Engineering. In this con-
nection it may be pointed out that at present
there is only one stenographer available for
the whole staff and Secretary's office, with
the result that correspondence connected
with the College is often delayed.
It is sincerely hoped that such plans may
go through for a Bureau such as outlined
in the committee's report would surely be
of valuable assistance to students and grad-
uates as well as to outside firms desiring
men.
DISCIPLINE COMMITTEE
The faculty discipline committee com-
posed of Professors Johnston and Fishleigh
and Asst. Dean Butts has formulated a
classification of punishments for misconduct.
The committee has the power to inflict
punishment but the student may appeal to
the faculty for reconsideration. The fol-
lowing grades of punishment have been
recommended:
I. Recommended by the board and im-
posed by the Faculty.
a. Expulsion.
b. Suspension.
1. Semester or remainder of semester.
2. One Year.
3. Indefinite.
II. Lesser punishment. Inflicted by the
board and reported to the faculty for rec-
ord. The Student may appeal his case
within three days in writing to have it re-
considered by the faculty.
a. Special Probation for one year or
more. May be accompanied by:
1. Apology.
2. Publication.
3. Exclusion from University Activi-
ties.
4. Reprimand by the Dean.
5. Periodical report to the committee.
6. Notification of parents.
b. Apology.
c. Reprimand by the Dean.
1. Before the class or faculty.
2. In presence of instructor or com-
mittee.
3. In private.
d. Special warning.
1. Parents may be notified.
It is the hope of the committee that their
work will be extremely light. They believe
that the men in the College of Engineering
have enough common sense to conduct
themselves as gentlemen.

Civils Organize for Camp
The early and enthusiastic action taken
by the class of Junior Civils in prepara-
tion for the summer surveying camp at
Douglass Lake argues well for a most suc-
cessful season. A meeting of the class was
called by Prof. C. T. Johnston in March.
The plans for the summer's work were out-
lined and points were suggested for special
work about camp. At this time a camp
manager who will be in direct charge of all
camp activities was nominated. At the
elections, held later, Louis B. Hyde, pres-
ident of the Sophomoie Engineer Class
last year, was elected to this position.
Two later meetings of the class have al-
ready been held. It was decided to adopt a
uniform suit of Olive Drab Khaki to be
worn at camp. Several other innovations
were suggested and adopted.
The staff of the "Black Fly" the camp
weekly publication has been appointed. It

The Sprinc Trip
On May 8th, a crowd of 18 Seniors and
Juniors, accompanied by Professor J. R.
Allen, and Commander J. H. Rowan, of the
U. S. Navy, left on the annual trip of the
Mechanical Engineers.
At the first stop, Youngstown, Ohio, an
inspection was made of the Youngstown
Sheet &amp; Tube Co., the Banner Electric
Lamp Co., and other manufacturing con-
cerns. Stops were then made in succession
at Pittsburgh, Washington, Philadelphia,
New York, Schenectady and Niagara Falls.
Trips of inspection were made to large
plants in these cities, which lack of space
prevents our writing up more in detail.
Display of Motor Car Parts
To make the demonstration apparatus
of the automobile engineering laboratory
more easily accessible to visitors, the de-
partment of mechanical engineering has ar-
ranged a display of automobile parts in the
second floor hall of the engineering build-
ing. The Studebaker "20" automobile chas-
sis, which was presented to the university
some time ago. has been moved into the hall,
and displays are being added to selective
and progressive type transmissions, cone
and multiple disc clutches, spur and bevel
type differentials, carburetors, and ignition
outfits. Most of the apparatus will be ar-
ranged so that the workings will be easily
comprehensible, and handles will be attach-
ed to the transmission and clutch outfits
so that visitors may operate the parts them-
selves.
New 1915 Reo Chassis
For demonstration and lecture use before
the classes in automobile engineering of the
engineering college, the Reo Motor Car Co.,
of Lansing, has just sent a complete 1915
model Reo the Fifth automobile chassis to
the automobile laboratory. The car will


149
also be used in making tests upon the var-
ious chassis units, by advanced students in
the automobile laboratory testing course.
Auto Class to Use Roads
To secure a place to carry on actual road
tests, students in an advanced automobile
engineering course under the direction of
Prof. W. T. Fishleigh, of the mechanical
engineering department, have been permit-
ted by the city of Ann Arbor to use a por-
tion of Fifth Avenue as an outdoor labora-
tory. Experiments are being conducted on
complete cars to determine the horse power
which must be delivered to the road by the
rear wheels to secure various speeds, and
tests will be made upon a number of differ-
ent classes of cars in the investigation.
ELECTRICAL
The Michigan State Telephone Company
through the efforts of Mr. C. Kittridge, '97E
has loaned the telephone laboratory '500 ft.
of 125 pr. No. 20 ga. cable for experimental
work in telephone transmission.
The telephone laboratory has recently re-
ceived a Vreeland Sine Wave Oscillator,
from the Western Electric Co. This is the
only apparatus which will give a pure sine
wave, and for this reason is very useful in
making tests on telephone instruments. It
is used to find the constants of telephone
and telegraph lines, as well as the constants
of terminal apparatus, and forms a valuable
addition to the laboratory equipment. It
will give any frequency from 250 to 2500
cycles per second and maintain a pure sine
wave at all times. The efficiency of the
apparatus is low, but this is unimportant
as it is only intended for refined work and
for research.
CHEMICAL
Fellowships
In January a meeting was held of a joint
committee, composed of representatives of
the Michigan Paper Manufacturers, and of
the University. The paper manufacturers
are feeling the need of men trained specially
for paper manufacture, and the University
is willing to co-operate so far as its funds
permit. This committee recommended that
such work be based on the present course
in Chemical Engineering, as it already in-
cludes much pertinent material. The manu-
facture of acids, alkalis, and bleach is stud-
ied in one course, and a brief study of cell-
ulose, fibres, bleaching, dyeing, and paper
making, is included in the course on Tech-
nology of Organic Compounds. A further
opportunity for specialization is allowed in
the course in Special Problems, where each
student makes a close laboratory study of
some selected problem. Thirty-eight stu-
dents graduated from the course in Chem-
ical Engineering in IQ14, so there should
be no lack of material. The courses in
general science, chemistry, or forestry,
might also lead to special work in paper
making. No attempt has been made as yet
to outline the course of study, as the co-
operation of the paper manufacturers them-
selves is desired in this connection.
The development of the course in Gas
Engineering is an example of what may be
done. In 1900 the Michigan Gas Associa-
tion, realizing the need of trained men in
their profession, offered a fellowship in
Gas Engineering. The one fellowship
grew to two, special equipment was needed
and was bought, until there is now a well
equipped gas experiment station at the plant
of the Ann Arbor Gas Company, and four
or five men go each year from the course
in Chemical Engineering to become gas
engineers. The research work conducted
by the holders of the fellowship has been
of material value and the Association feels
well satisfied with its investment.
The greatest incentive, which, in the opin-
ion of the committee, the paper manufac-
turers can offer, will be to found several fel-
lowships each with an annual income of five
hundred dollars, to be competed for by
graduates of the University and other in-
stitutions. In addition to the amounts to be
paid to the holders of the fellowships, there
should be an amount of perhaps one hun-
dred dollars for each fellowship, to be used
by the University as might be needed to
defray the expenses of investigations under-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
taken. The holders of the fellowships
would be required to give their entire time
to their studies and to the investigation of
such problems as are of interest to paper
manufacturers in general. It would be a
most valuable training to prospective hold-
ers of these fellowships if they could work
for one or more summers in some of the
paper mills of the state. This should, if
possible, be made a requirement.
The schools of Engineering and Forestry
at the University of Michigan are among
the largest in the country, and the an-
nouncement of fellowships in paper making
would at once direct the attention of many
ambitious students to the opportunities af-
forded in this direction.
It seems certain that there will be at least
one fellowship next year. The report of
the committee was mailed to all the paper
manufacturers in the state just before the
Spring Vacation. When the replies from
the?e are in there may be one or more ad-
ditional fellowships.
The Detroit Edison Co. is interested in
the causes of the brittlcness which some-
times develops in boiler tubes after two or
three years' service, and have under con-
sideration commissioning Prof. A. E. White
to make an exhaustive investigation of the
question.
The American Sheet and Wire Co. are
making up a special set of samples for
Prof. A. E. White to illustrate the effect
of strain on the properties of steel.
Chemical Engineers Spring Trip
During the spring vacation about thirty
embryo chemical engineers were given an
opportunity to find out what they would be
up against after graduation. Under the
guidance of Mr. W. L. Badger the party
left Ann Arbor April gth, visiting the Pos-
tum Cereal Co. at Battle Creek, and the
Bryant and Standard Paper Companies at
Kalamazoo on that day. The following day
was spent in visiting the Illinois Steel Co.
and The Universal Portland Cement Co. at
Gary and Buffington, Indiana. Sunday was
spent in sightseeing in Chicago. On Mon-
day the party visited the following plants:
Grasselli Chemical Co., Standard Oil Co.,
United States Metals Refining Co., and the
International Lead Refining Co. All of
Tuesday was consumed in seeing the con-
version of live stock into steaks, chops,
fertilizer, soap, and sausage at the Union
Stock Yards. On Wednesday the party
went to Argo to visit tht plant of the Corn
Products Refining Co.
Special mention should be made of the
Postum Cereal Co. Their plant is a mar-
vel of cleanliness and their products are
handled in such a way that the consumer
is the first to touch them. Everything is
done by automatic machinery to the pack-
ing and wrapping of the finished product.
The party was shown evtry courtesy by the
firm.
The Steel Mills at Gary proved extremely
interesting. There are so many things made
there that steel can almost be considered a
by-product. The waste gases from the
blast furnaces are used in gas engine gen-
erators and enough power is generated here
to supply the entire plant as well as the
City of Gary and the Universal Portland
Cement Co. at Buffington.
The party disbanded Wednesday after
the trip to Argo.
Simmer Employment for Chemicals
Prof. A. H. White, recognizing the great
value to students of industrial experience
in their chosen lines of work, has under-
taken a campaign to secure summer work
for the chemical engineers. He has sent
letters, chiefly throughout the State of
Michigan, to firms engaged in chemical or
chemically controlled industries, seeking
positions for such juniors of his department
as desire them. Many replies have been
received, quite a number promising work
for one or two students during the coming
vacation. It is significant that all the re-
plies express approval of the plan, some
firms attesting a favorable experience with
such arrangements in the past.
Of the three summer vacations, that be-
tween the junior and senior years is un-
doubtedly the most advantageous for such
vocational work. The student at that time
has learned enough theory in the courses in


151
chemical technology to make the experience
of value to him. He should return to
school with some more or less definite plan
of study for his senior year. In addition,
it is hoped that he may establish a per-
manent connection with the firm with which
he has been employed. The replies to Prof.
White's letter indicate that this is expected
by the employers.
ENGINEERING MECHANICS
An instrument known as an Areaform
Recorder is under construction in the Engi-
neering Shops. This instrument will, while
in the field, yield a small scale drawing with
recorded area of an irregular plot of land
or the vertical section of an embankment
or excavation, the required operation being
merely that of tracing the contour with the
end of a taut wire.
The design is by Mr. Karl Keeler, '15E,
and Mr. John Airey, Instructor in Engineer-
ing Mechanics. The instrument is the out-
come of combining the most advantageous
features of Mr. Aircy's "Arcameter," re-
cently constructed in the Engineering Shops,
and an "Integraph," of Mr. Keeler with
other improvements.
SURVEYING
Camp Davis
The present location of Camp Davis was
selected in 1908 and the camp was estab-
lished in August and September of that
year. Successive classes, since that year,
have added certain improvements during
the time spent in camp. These improve-
ments, combined with new equipment pur-
chased by the University, have brought the
camp at present to a fair degree of com-
pleteness, comfort and efficiency. The pur-
pose of this brief article is to indicate in a
general way the character of the improve-
ments which have been installed in the past
three years. Attention is called to the ac-
companying diagram, which gives the loca-
tion of the various improvements mention-
ed.
New Equipment: In 1912, the wooden
boxes filled with straw, used for beds, were
replaced by 20 double deck steel beds. In
addition, 10 single deck beds were purchased
for the teaching staff. At the present time
each tent contains as sleeping equipment, I
double deck steel bed, 2 straw ticks and 6
pairs of blankets. In 1912, a new mess tent,
20 x 40, was purchased.
In 1913, an additional mess tent, identical
with that purchased in 1912, was added to
the camp equipment. A 4 hp. Fairbanks
Morse Kerosene Engine, for pumping from
the new well and running the dynamo, a 3
inch Typhoon Pump, a 2j/j k.w. D. C. gen-
erator, with lights, wire, etc., were pur-
chased for the power house. A new range
and a complete outfit of dishes and cooking
utensils were installed in the kitchen.
In 1914, material for 10 steel buildings
was delivered at the camp. Five were erec-
ted in the summer of 1914. It is intended
to erect the remainder during the summer
of 1915-
Attendance: The enrollment at the camp
for the past 3 years is as follows: in 1912,
64: in 1913, 60; in 1914, 95. At the present
writing, the indications point to an atten-
dance of about 90 for the summer of 1915.
Improvements: The following improve-
ments have been installed in the past 3
years, entirely by the labor of the classes
attending camp during that time:
In 1912: the harbor, 28 x 65, at a cost to
the University of $16.00; the underground
tank and water pipe with faucets, at a cost
to the University of about $50.00; the con-
crete storehouse, 15 x 30, at a cost to the
University of $40.00; the concrete platform
known as the Michigan Union, 20 x 30, and
the lumber shed, 12 x 20.
In 1913: the new well, 4 feet in diameter,
23 feet deep, with 16 feet of 1V2 inch pipe
driven into the water-bearing stratum; the
concrete block powerhouse, 15 x 30; the
water pipe from the new well to the top
of the hill; a concrete floor in the concrete
storehouse erected in 1912 and the elevated
tank near the kitchen.
In 1914: a concrete floor in the power-
house; 5 steel buildings with concrete
floors: the power equipment placed in ser-
vice and the camp wired and lighted by
electricity for the first time.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
General Items: In 1913, on June 27, the
camp was visited by a cycline which wreck-
ed the fly to one of the mess tents, destroy-
ed one of the tents on the lake front, and
blew down the tallest of the pines growing
near the Michigan Union. In 1914, the stu-
dents were grouped into 4-man parties in-
stead of 8-man parties. This arrangement
permitted a greater flexibility in assigning
work in the field. The Office Assignment
was abolished as such. A party finishing

is intended to later convert the trail into a
wagon road.
Proposed Improvements: It is proposed
to install a complete sewer system in the
general location shown on the diagram. The
present power equipment will be adequate
for the additional pumping required and the
intake will connect with the engine now in
use. The system will empty into a septic
tank located at the extreme eastern end of
camp.

the work in the field is now brought into
the office by the same instructor who was
in charge of the field work. This arrange-
ment permits each branch of the work to
be considered as a complete problem, in
charge of the same instructor throughout.
The Camp Davis Meridian was established
in 1913 and prolonged in 1914. In 1914 the
triangulation system at camp was connected
with the triangulation system established
by the Lake Survey on Burt Lake. A trail,
known as the "Foresters' Trail," running
due east from the end of State Street was
built in 1914. This trail permits ready ac-
cess to the country lying east of camp. It
A new steel kitchen is sadly needed and
will be built as soon as funds for that pur-
pose are available.
The remaining five steel buildings will be
erected and the existing tents gradually re-
placed by steel buildings as they wear out.
It was generally expected that the steel
buildings would prove uncomfortable dur-
ing the heated portion of the day but the
reverse has been the case. At any hour of
the day or night they have proven much
more comfortable than the tents. This fact
combined with their additional head room,
(the steel buildings have 6 foot side walls),
their longer life and their adaptability for


153
storage when breaking camp make the steel

Professor Raschbacher to be Married.
Announcement of the engagement of Pro-
fessor H. G. Raschbacher, of the engineer-
ing college, and Clara Loveland, '08, of Sag-
inaw, the wedding to occur sometime in
August, has just been made. Miss Love-
land is also a graduate of Vassar College,
and a member of the Delta Gamma sorori-
ty. At present she is a teacher in the Sag-
inaw high school.
IN THE ART GALLERY.
Five framed pictures of old time locomo-
tives have been presented by Herbert L.
Fisher, of Taunton, Mass. These are old
time lithographs of the '50s and '60s which
show the old style ideas of advertising and
which give a good1 idea of the gaudily
painted engines of our daddies. The college
is laying great stress on the collection of
pictures of engineering works, especially
those of historic interest.
ARCHITECTURAL COLLEGE.
During the past month two trips to De-
troit were taken by the students of the
Architectural College. The trips were for
the purpose of inspecting the New Detroit
Athletic Club, Hotel Statler, and the David
Whitney Office Building.
The College has been invited to send
examples of its work through an exhibi-
tion circuit composed of a number of High
Schools of this State.
During the past month a convention was
held in Detroit by representatives from the
Illinois and Michigan chapters of Alpha
Rho Chi, a National Architectural Frater-
nity. On this occasion a chapter at the De-
partment of Architecture of Ohio State
University was given a charter. This so-
ciety was organized a year ago by students
of the Colleges of Architecture of Illinois
and Michigan.
The recent competition for posters for
the Michigan Union Opera was won by
John B. Jewell, 1915 Architect.
Mr. Lorch, of the College of Architec-
ture, was one of the speakers before the
Art Section at the recent meeting of the
Schoolmasters' Club. Mr. Lorch spoke on
"How to improve the instruction in draw-
ing in Public Schools of this State."
It is proposed to hold an exhibition of
paintings by Mr. Leon A. Makielski in
Alumni Hall at the time of the May Festi-
val. Mr. Makielski is instructor of draw-
ing and painting in the College of Archi-
tecture.
A number of important additions have
been made recently to the equipment of the
College of Architecture. One of these is
an original design and drawing by J. F.
Harbeson of Philadelphia for the decora-
tive treatment of an interior. A substan-
tial addition has also been made to the col-
lection of objects (pottery, copper, brasses
and the like) to be used in classes in still-
life painting.
A number of rare and important books
has been recently acquired for the Archi-
tectural Library from the estate of the late
E. E. Myers. Mr. Myers was the Archi-
tect of the Capitol at Lansing.
Lectures.
On Mar. 2, C. B. Lewis, Superintendent
of the construction of the New Science
Building, gave an interesting lecture on the
"Supervision of Building Construction," in
Room 311, New Engineering Building, for
architectural students.
On Monday, Mar. 22, Mr. Stephen M.
Wirts, Designer, gave an interesting lec-
ture on the "Design of Period Furniture,"
in the main gallery of Alumni Memorial
Hall. The lecture was illustrated by 24
original full size drawings.

flannel party. Owing to the cold spell, how-
ever, not all the class were there. The
Annual Formal dance of the Senior class
will be held on May 28th, and arrange-
ments are under way to make it a great
affair. It is the last dance of the class.
Canes have been distributed, and as soon
as the boys get up enough nerve they will
be seen. The canes ate very attractive;
hexagonal in shape and made of ebony. As
June approaches they will continue to ap-
pear in increasing numbers.
The class day officers selected for the
program on class day, June 22nd, are as
follows: Orator, H. L. Bockstahler; His-
torian, C. V. Johnson; Memorial Presenta-
tion, G. B. McCabe: President's address, O.
W. Hall. K. S. Baxter has been selected
as the Class Toastmaster, and will officiate
at the last dinner of the class.
Walt Stewart, Baseball manager for the
class, has issued a call for material and will
attempt to turn out a championship team.
All are preparing to hit the finals hard
so that there may be no chance of failing
to "cop down the sheepskin." Some of the
boys have both jobs and girls waiting for
them in June, others only jobs. Here's
hoping!
Announcements have been sent out of the
marriage of Loncta H .Kuhn, a school of
music student, and Angus V. Mclver, '15E.
Miss Kuhn is a member of the Mu Phi
Epsilon sorority, and Mclver is a member
of Kappa Beta Psi and the Monks. The
couple will be at home in Great Falls, Mon-
tana, after July I.
1916.
On Saturday evening. May 22, the Junior
Engineers held their third annual "Pow-
wow." This function was introduced by
this class, and has already become a tradi-
tion of the Engineering College, both of
the succeeding classes having followed the
example of the '16 Engineers.
The direction of the Juniors' Pow-wow
this year was in the hands of the following
committee:
General Chairman: "Bob" Archer.
Refreshments: "Bill" Robinson, Chair-
man; "Toots" Roeser, "Hor" Corey,
"Whitey" Headman, "Tiny" Stryker.

ray.
Publicity: "Bunny" Henderson.
1917
The sophomores of the campus have had
to come to the aid of varsity athletics which
have been hit so hard recently by the grad-
uation of former stars. Our class takes
great pride in the fact that we are furnish-
ing a large number of these men who are
already looked upon as stars. To track we
have given Carroll, known as the "Wizard
Miler"; "Max" Robinson, the "Soph"
Phenom," also Huntington, a runner; and
Leach, a weight man. To base ball we
have given Krausc and Gardner; also sev-
eral men who are still on the reserve list.
The last '17E dance was held at the Un-
ion March 11.
"Doc" May was the speaker at assembly
February 26. He talked on the Cultivation
of the Body.
Librarian Koch gave an illustrated lecture
on libraries at the assembly held March 26.
Don Smith, president of the 1916 class, gave
a pointed talk on the Honor System for
Exams.
Professor A. A. Stanley, of the school of
music, spoke at the Assembly April 23, on
the subject of music as applied to general
education. Professor John R. Allen, of
the mechanical engineering college, outlined
changes to be made in the mentor system.
In future a student is to be assigned to
one mentor throughout his college course.
Entangling his hand in the chain of a
gear-wheel in the engineering shops last
month, D. J. Canfield, '17E, had the first
and second fingers of his right hand badly
ground by the machine. He was taken to
the homoeopathic hospital, where his wounds
were dressed. Physicians found it neces-

ENGINEERING NOTES
Allen Haze.n Speaks on Probabilities.
Mr. Allen Hazen, Consulting Engineer
of New York of whom Professor Riggs
spoke in his introduction as "Preeminent
among Sanitary Engineers of the United
States," addressed the students and facul-
ty of the College on "Probabilities," on
April 5th. The purpose of his talk would
be, he said, "To interest us in a promising
field of investigation."
Mr. Hazen stated that rain fall was end-
lessly varying and consequently the flow of
water in streams is also varying. No con-
ditions are ever exactly repeated. For this
reason calculations relating to run-off, flood
flows, and storage are difficult. Engineers
have not been taught to handle data from
a probability standpoint but this method is
extremely serviceable in making estimates
for water available for irrigation, for water
power, and for public water supplies.
Up to the present time it has been usually
assumed that the rain fall and run-off in
the future would be measured by that of
the past. If, however, a complete record
of the flows of a 20-year period is at hand
and if an estimate is to be made of the
corresponding conditions of the next 20
years, it is perfectly certain that the con-
ditions of 20 years past will not be repeated
in those to come. The maximum flood of
the future period may not equal that in the
elapsed period but on the other hand it may
exceed it. There is about an even chance
that it will exceed it and if it does exceed it
the probabilities are that it will exceed it
by 20% or more. In a similar manner the
storage required to maintain a given out-
put may differ in the future period by 20
or 40% or more from that in the elapsed
period. The only reasonably promising
method of reaching an understanding of


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Engineer in charge of the Sewage Treat-
ment Works for the Baltimore Sewerage
Commission, Baltimore, Md. Associated
with Mr. McRae are Mr. I. P. Kane, prin-
cipal assistant, also formerly of Baltimore,
Mr. R. E. Takken '13E and Mr. L. G.
Lenhardt, '14E, of the University of Mich-
igan.
The City of Detroit has also undertaken
the investigation of the effects of Detroit
sewage on adjacent waters, and by what
means, if any, the City should undertake to
purify its sewage. It has retained Mr. C.
W. Hubbell, *93E, C.E. '04, formerly Chief
Engineer of the Bureau of Public Works
in the Philippines, as Consulting Engineer
on the investigation. With Mr. Hubbell
are Mr. J. M. Hartgering, formerly with
the Bemis D. U. R. Appraisal, Mr. Frank L.
Weaver, '13E, and Mr. Albert Roth, '14E, of
the University of Michigan.
The investigation is expected to extend
over a period of from eight to ten months.
these matters is found in the theory of
probabilities. This method has been applied
with success with many kinds of data more
or less similar to rain fall and run-off data.
Several efforts have been made to apply
these methods to run-off data but without
very much success. The difficulty lies in
the fact that the run-off data does not ex-
actly follow the ordinary probability law.
They do follow a law that is much like it
but differs from it sufficiently so that the
methods that are given in the text-books
cannot be successfully applied.
Professor Karl Pearson of the Univer-
sity of Oxford has developed a method for
analysis of data of this kind. Unfortu-
nately this involves mathematical processes
that do not permit their general use in en-
gineering work.
Mr. Hazen suggested a graphical method
of solving problems of this kind and stated
that considerable success had already been
made in applying it.
DETROIT SEWERAGE INVESTIGA-
TION.
By the terms of the treaty of Jan. 11,
1909, between the United States and Great
Britain, the boundary waters shall not be
polluted on either side to the injury of
health or property on the other. Two
questions were referred to the International
Joint Commission for examination and re-
port, namely:
(1) To what extent and by what causes
and in what localities have the boundary
waters between the United States and Can-
ada been polluted so as to be injurious to
the public health and unfit for domestic or
other uses?
(2) In what way or manner can these
conditions be remedied?
The first of these questions has been stud-
ied and a report submitted. It was proven
to the satisfaction of the Commission that
pollution of the boundary waters does exist.
In pursuance of solving the engineering
difficulties involved in the second question,
the Commission has opened an office in
Detroit and has placed in charge of the
work, Mr. H. C. McRae. formerly Division
AERONAUTICS
F. Eari, Loudy, '15E.
Pres. U. of M. Aero Society.
For centuries man has endeavored to em-
ulate the birds. Ancient philosophers told
us of the time when man would navigate
the air in a flying machine; when man
would be free, and restricted by no laws
except the universal law of gravitation.
Aviators today arc flying at will in three
dimensional space where it is not neces-
sary to follow the ocean's surface, nor the
contours of our mundane topography.
Samuel Pierpont Langley, late Secretary
of the Smithsonian Institute, was the first
man to construct a flying machine, heavier
than our largest birds, that would actually
fly. Orville and Wilbur Wright were the
first men to make a free flight in an aero-
plane. With these two historic and epoch
making events added to our credit, may 1
ask. what is our present status in this field
as compared with the nations of Europe?
We are not far from the foot of the list.
Foreign governments have stimulated and
even subsidized Aeronautics and Aviation;
but our congressmen arc too busy patching


157
up the worn-out cloth of previous adminis-
trations, and as a result our present needs
are sacrificed upon the altar of indiffer-
ence.
The possibilities of the aeroplane are
manifold. Out government could save mil-
lions by establishing "Aerial Mail Routes,"
especially in Alaska. Flying machines can
be used for rapid transit, carrying express,
and for pleasure and sporting purposes.
The United States must forge to the
front in this new branch of Engineering.
We must have experimental apparatus for
the testing of flying machines similar to
that now in vogue in England, Germany,
ALUMNI NOTES
An Appeal:—
Any bit of news forwarded by you to the Technic concerning
Michigan graduates will not only be highly appreciated by the
editor but quite assuredly by all alumni who read the Technic.
Send today what may come to your mind and it will be filed
safely away for publication in the next issue. Do not put it off.
Eight bits from W. W. Campbell, '86, As-
tronomer at Lick Observatory, Mount Ham-
ilton, California. He says: "Enclosed is
my check for $1.00 for the excellent Tech-
nic."
Matthew R. Blish, '11 Mech., writes, "One
bone herewith. I guess the Technic is
worth a dollar all right." Mr. Blish prom-
ises an article on the recent developments
in compressed air pumping. He states that
very little has been published of engineer-
ing value on this subject. Experiments have
proven that this method of pumping water
from deep wells compares very favorably
in efficiency and economy with other meth-
ods. These experiments have been car-
ried on by the Sullivan Machinery Co., and
have not been made public as yet.
Of the March issue of the Technic, R. E.
Carlson, sales engineer with the Westing-
house Electric and Supply Co., says, "Prof.
Bailey's article was worth the subscription
France, Russia, and Italy. We must es-
tablish courses in Aeronautics in our lead-
ing universities. Is the University of Mich-
igan going to blaze the trail? I think she
will. We have the men, the means, and the
popular student interest. It is up to us to
take the lead in Aeronautics as we have
in other branches of learning and to build
up an international reputation that will re-
main unquestioned.

the Technic on the application of the elec-
tric arc to welding. Arc welding is a rath-
er new and interesting application and a
rapidly growing one. Watch for it in an
early issue.
The faculty of the surveying department
is compiling a history of the camps which
have been held in previous years.
In order to complete the record, n* is nec-
essary to secure more information than is
at present in the hands of those in charge
of the work. Any facts in regard to past
camps will be most welcome, the list of
those who attended the camp in the years
1879 and 18S3 being particularly desired.

breakfast will take a turn at the grindstone
to keep the axes sharp." (Will some mem-
ber of the class of 1890 kindly inform us
whether Mr. May earned the position of
official "Axe Grinder" during that summer
or not? We're curious.)

he turned to her and said:

THE LICENSE QUESTION
(Continued from page 129)
A doctor gets a license,
To find out how you're made,
An automobile man gets one
To help the doctor's trade,
The organ-grinder has one too
To play his melodies,
The monkey needs no lice—ense,
He has a crop of fleas.
A poet has a license.
So he's a licensee,
Geo. Washington would not lie since
He'd cut the apple tree;
Mary had no license
To take her lamb to school,
The teacher had a license.
But he broke the Golden Rule.
You have to have a license
If you want to preach and pray,
Or keep a bench-legged bull-dog,
Or run a cheap buffet;
So when you think it over,
It does seem rather queer,
That you do not need a license
To be an Engineer.
And now you know my sentiments.
I hope I've made them plain,
A license is a license
As sure as rain is rain;
A tear-drop and a dew-drop
Are made of the same stuff,
But the sentiment that goes with each,
Is surely plain enough.
There once lived in Virginia,
A man named Billy Rugg,
Who didn't have a license,
But could always fill a jug,
One night some friends of Uncle Sam
Came riding o'er the hill
And now Bill sits inside a jug
His whiskey still is still.
Every nuisance needs a license.
That I think is very plain.
And an Engineer's a nuisance
That was proved by R. T. Cran;
So you see the situation
Is as plain as A. B. C.,
Engineers by legislation
Is the obvious Q. E. D.
To you who are striving for success in some field of endeavor, remember this-
Correct clothes play the part in every success. In the past, to be
dressed as well as the men of great means would have been very
expensive, but today through the ADLER ROCHESTER achieve-
ments in ready-to-wear clothes, you will be as well and as correct-
ly dressed as any man can be.

BOUNDARIES
BY RALPH R. TINKHAM, '05E
Riparian, "of or pertaining to the
hank of a river," deriv. Latin, ripa,
river bank. The meaning of Riparian
Rights, therefore, is literally the in-
terests of man appertaining to the
banks of streams: Boundaries, the
confines of these interests.
The generally accepted meaning of
Riparian Rights, however, has broad-
ened the definition to include the
banks and beds of streams and other
bodies of water and any unsurveyed
islands therein.
Probably no one detail of property
rights has been so fruitful of litiga-
tion and particularly litigation of such
an unusually puzzling kind, as has Ri-
parian Rights. Doubtless this is due
in a great part to the old dispute as
to whether Riparian Rights constitute
property at all. Nor does it appear
to have helped matters much from the
standpoint of litigation where such
rights have been declared, to be prop-
erty, because at best the property is
more or less intangible.
It is not the intent of this paper to
cover all phases of Riparian Rights
and Boundaries, nor yet to be an ex-
haustive study of those phases which
are touched upon, but rather, as the
title would indicate, to set down some
of the principles of the subject in this
country and their bases in fact as de-
veloped in the American Federal and
State Courts, more particularly as ap-
plied to Michigan. What follows is
merely the co-ordination of the per-
sonal notes of the writer taken at va-
rious times from the various sources
as the information was needed in the
settlement of claims and disputes with
which the writer has been identified.
It is believed that the method of
determining riparian boundaries on a
concave shore, as developed in the lat-
ter part of the paper, is little known
because of its limited application, but
that the principle might be broadly
applied to advantage.
* * *
As though the subject of Riparian
Rights was not sufficiently vague, it
is still further complicated in this
country by the potential conflict be-
tween state and federal sovereignty.
The sole federal power over ripa-
rian rights is that vested in the United
States by the Fifth Amendment to
the Constitution, which gives Con-
gress power to regulate commerce.
This clause in the Constitution has
been construed and repeatedly con-
firmed to give the federal govern-
ment the right to make any change
or improvement in navigable waters
for the benefit of navigation, i. e.,
maritime commerce. Three conditions
qualify this federal sovereignty, viz:
the right of eminent domain, the pro-
vision,—also in the Fifth Amend-
ment—that private property shall not
be taken for public use without just
compensation, and the definition of
navigable water.
The last qualification like practically
all phase of riparian rights, is open
to dispute, but it has been held and
is generally conceded that all water-
ways are navigable in the sense that


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Congress has the right to improve
and maintain the same as public high-
ways. An illuminating illustration
arose in the city of Detroit recently.
A certain canal constructed several
years ago, and incidentally partly at
government expense, is about a mile
long and twenty-five feet wide, with
a depth sufficient for pleasure launch-
es. Cottages have sprung up on one
bank for its entire length. A public
road borders the canal on the opposite
bank. One cottager imbued with his
rights as a riparian owner, drove a
row of piles along the center line of
the canal (the "thread of the stream")
which was to support one side of his
boathouse. His was to be a double-
ended boathouse into which he could
drive a launch without turning. The
fact that he had shut off half the
stream to other navigators, bothered
him not. The federal authorities then
called and impressed upon him that
while his ownership of the bed of the
canal to its center and his rights in or
on the water as a riparian owner were
sacred and undisputed, yet the canal
was a navigable body of water, con-
trolled and to be maintained by the
United States as a public highway
and, therefore, not to be obstructed
against the free use of all the citizens
of this country; and further that
should he persist in his pile driving,
he would be guilty of a misdemeanor
punishable with fine and imprison-
ment, etc., etc. The piles were re-
moved.
The first and second qualifications
need no explanation. The United
States may rightfully take any private
property anywhere, if needed, for the
good or benefit of the general public,
provided the owner is justly compen-
sated therefor. This is applicable
to riparian rights as to any other
property, since it is held in the courts
here that riparian rights are property,
intangible though-some of them are.
It not infrequently happens that an
owner knowing he has to deal with a
rich customer in the person of "Un-
cle Sam," asks an exhorbitant price
for his property. Then it is that the
government has recourse to condem-
nation proceedings in which the court
orders the owner to sell to the gov-
ernment at a price set by impartial
appraisers. The writer recalls a case
in which he was interested where the
government desired a piece of rock
cliff on Lake Superior. The owner
wanted $3,500.00 for it. Condemna-
tion proceedings ensued and the own-
er sold for $200.00. Another case
was that of the Chandler-Dunbar
Power Co. at the Soo, really a double-
barreled case in riparian rights; first
the government disputing ownership
of the site with the Company, in
which suit the government lost ,the
decision being based on a principle
given further on; second, the Power
Company demanding a price for the
property, based on all future planned
construction to the limits of their ri-
parian rights at the thread of the
stream, which the government refus-
ed to pay. condemnation being resort-
ed to with the result that the Com-
pany sold for the value of developed
resources only.
Another right of the riparian own-
er with which the federal government
is not infrequently in conflict, is ac-
cess to navigable water, and here
is meant his right to use the water as
a highway and to have access to such
depth as will float the boats common-
ly used there for transportation. This
right has been held to be property
and, therfore, of value, and when the
federal government in the exercise of


167
its power to alter these highways for
the benefit of commerce obstructs a
riparian owner's access to the high-
way, then the government must pay
for that bit of intangible property a
sum which it can be shown to be
worth, or in other words, must pay
the riparian owner damages for ob-
structing his right of way.
The question might be asked, "How
does it happen that the federal gov-
ernment is so often in conflict with ri-
parian owners?" One has but to recall
the activities of the Inland Water-
ways Commission and the phenome-
nal growth of inland maritime com-
merce the past few years and to re-
member that upwards of $65,000,000.-
00 was asked of Congress last year
for river and harbor improvements, tc
know that the government has not
overlooked that phase of the Fifth
Amendment. The conflict begins when
it becomes necessary to construct jet-
ties, breakwaters, retaining walls,
lighthouse and range piers and struc-
tures, to dredge channels and dispose
of the excavated material in spoil
banks, and to proceed with the in-
numerable accessories that go with
such activity.
So much, for the time, regarding
federal sovereignty and its qualifica-
tions. Next as to the relation of the
state's powers to those of the federal
government as regards riparian
rights; the "riparian twilight zone,"
if you will. I think this can best be
expressed by quoting from a supreme
court decision. The opinion contains
a review of English authorities on the
common law, of decisions of the sev-
eral states and of the decisions of the
supreme court. The conclusion reach-
ed was that the rights and title of
riparian owners in the beds below
highwater mark are governed by the
laws of the several states, subject to
the rights granted to the United
States by the Constitution.
"The Congress of the United States, in
disposing of the public lands, has con-
stantly acted upon the theory that those
lands, whether in the interior, or on the
coast, above high-water mark, may be tak-
en up by actual occupants, in order to en-
courage the settlement of the country; but
that the navigable waters and the soils un-
der them, whether within or above the
ebb and flow of the tide, shall be and re-
main public highways; and, being chiefly
valuable for the public purposes of com-
merce, navigation and fishery, and for the
improvements necessary to secure and pro-
mote those purposes, shall not be granted
away during the period of territorial gov-
ernment; but, unless in case of some in-
ternational duty or public exigency, shall
be held by the United States in trust for
the future States, and shall vest in the
several States, when organized and ad-
mitted into the Union, with all the pow-
ers and prerogatives appertaining to the
older States in regard to such waters and
soils within their respective jurisdiction;
in short, shall not be disposed of piece-
meal to individuals as private property,
but shall be held as a whole for the pur-
pose of being ultimately administered and
dealt with for the public benefit by the
State, after it shall have become a com-
pletely organized community."
The above principle has in some
cases been written into the law. Not-
ably in the Deed of Cession, executed
March 1, 1784, by the State of Vir-
ginia to the United States, of the
Northwest Territory out of which
Michigan was formed, and later June
16, 1836, by Act of Congress with
specific reference to the State of Mich-
igan.
It follows that the federal govern-
ment has no title in riparian rights.
i. c, the beds of waterways, but where
situated in territory not yet admitted
to the Union, the federal government


THE MICHIGAN TBCHNIC
holds these rights in trust for the fu-
ture state. The United States, there-
fore, not having title, cannot cede ri-
parian lands in the public domain. On
the other hand, the State, possessing
full and undisputed title to all riparian
rights within its boundaries, can cede
all such rights to a riparian owner de-
riving his title from the State. It
rests with the individual States to
make such laws governing riparian
rights within their own boundaries as
they see fit. In Michigan it is the law
in the case of riparian lands, i. e.,
lands abutting on waterways, titles to
which are derived from the State, that
such titles extend to and embrace sub-
merged lands as far as the thread of
the stream. This has been modified
as regards lands abutting on the Great
Lakes, notably in an Act of the Legis-
lature No. 94, Laws of 1869.
That is a statute which prohibits the
placing in waters where fish are taken
by the legal owner or occupant of ad-
jacent lands "any ship ballast, stone,
sand, coal cinder ,ashes, logs, slabs,
decayed wood, bark, sawdust, or ob-
struction or filth of any other descrip-
tion or placing or driving any pound
net piles or stakes or any other piles
or stakes or posts, or building any
platforms or pier or any species of
seines or continuous trap nets to the
extent of the breadth of such legal
owner or occupant's lands so far as
the channel banks of rivers, and to
one mile from the beach or shore, at
low water mark, of the lakes, straits,
inlets, and bays or said waters front-
ing such owner's or occupant's lands
* * *." A still further modification
with geographic restrictions was made
in an act passed in 1905, prohibiting
any person, for the purpose of fishing,
from driving any stakes or setting any
nets in the waters of Saginaw Bay
contiguous or adjacent to the shores
of Arenac and Iosco counties for a
distance of tzco miles from shore, un-
less such person is the lawful owner
of the shore frontage, or unless such
person shall have a license to do so
from the owner or occupant. Both
laws, of course, carry penalties for
violation.
Originally, i. c, in the early days of
the State as such, the Michigan Su-
preme Court let it appear that the title
to the lied of the Great Lakes as well
as other waterways, belonged to the
abutting land owners, but later the
same court reversed this impression
and now holds that title to land in the
Great Lakes beyond the meander line
(which is supposed to be the locus
high-water mark) belongs to the State
of Michigan in trust for all of its citi-
zens, except as modified by specific
statutes as quoted above. It might be
added in passing that these statutes
have been casually questioned as class
legislation, but never passed upon.
Considering the right exercised
by the federal government to main-
tain waterways as public highways,
one might well ask whether after all
riparian rights as such are not a
myth. Requoting a clause from the
first quotation above, waterways are
"chiefly valuable for the public pur-
poses of commerce, navigation and
fishery, and for the improvements
necessary to secure and promote those
purposes" The following is also
quoted from a court decision:
"Whether the title to the submerged
lands of navigable waters is in the State
or in the riparian owners, such title was
taken subject to the rights which the pub-
lic have in the navigation of the waters in
question. The primary use of the waters
and the lands under them is for purposes
of navigation, and the erection of piers
in them to improve navigation for the pub-
lic is strictly consistent with such use, and


169
infringes no right of the riparian owner.
Whatever the interest of a riparian owner
in the submerged lands in front of his up-
land, his title is not as full and complete
as his title acquired to fast land which has
no direct connection with the navigation of
the river or water on which it borders.
It is not a title at his absolute disposal,
but is to be held at all times subordinate
to such use of the submerged lands and of
the waters flowing over them as is con-
sistent with or demanded by the public
right of navigation."
It would seem hardly worth while
for a riparian owner to assert any
rights. But there is one right which
is his in common with all. and that is
the use of the water as a highway and
because of his right of access to this
highway, it is his privilege to con-
struct a pier or dock leading from his
shore to such depth of water as is
necessary to float boats used in trans-
portation. He may also improve his
frontage by dredging to bring navi-
gable water to his shore line or dock.
That, then, is one of his principal ri-
parian rights, but even that is re-
stricted by the desires or mandates of
the federal government in its control
of commerce, as evidenced by the
harbor lines and dock lines established
in our maritime cities and by the con-
formity of riparian owners to the
channel lines, artificial or otherwise,
along their fronts.
In this connection and amplifying
somewhat the discussion of a shore
owner's right of access to navigable
water, it should be borne in mind that
the federal government may erect
structures of any nature for the pur-
poses of navigation in water fronting
any riparian property without redress,
providing access to navigable water is
not thereby completely shut off. An
illustration of this power is the case
of a certain farm fronting on the
Ohio River, across the front of which
the United States constructed a dike
in the bed of the river, which the
owner contended interfered with
landing on the shore of the farm. The
court held (and was sustained by the
United States Supreme Court) that
because the riparian owner had ac-
cess over the dike to deep water dur-
ing the high water stage of five
months of the year and could reach
the channel at any other time by wa-
gon, there was no redress. In this
State lighthouse piers have frequent-
ly been built in water fronting private
shores, often but a few feet from the
bank, without permission or compen-
sation of the riparian owner. The
right has been upheld in the courts
and is unquestioned. During the con-
struction of the Livingstone Channel,
Detroit River, enormous spoil banks
were formed along more than a mile
of the channel excavated in the dry,
which fronted many beautiful sum-
mer homes on Grosse Isle, complete-
ly cutting off their view. There was
no redress because access to naviga-
ble water was not impaired.
One word in the quotation above,
however, is the key to one undisputed
and unrestricted right. That word is
"fishery." It is true that fishing is
the principal right of a riparian own-
er and in that he is fully protected, as
is indicated by the Michigan statutes
quoted from above. His fishing, of
course, must not interfere with nav-
igation, but that is a matter of little
concern, because of the small likeli-
hood of conflict. The kind of fishing
requiring stakes or pounds is carried
on in water navigable only to skiffs
and his deep water fishing is with nets
submerged well below vessel drafts.
To give an inkling of the value of this
fishing right the following statistics
are taken from the last report of the
Secretary of Commerce: — In 1914,


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
the enormous total of 4,047 millions
of fish were "planted." Of this num-
ber, 1,020 millions were planted in the
Great Lakes and 43 millions were
planted in minor interior waters.
"Plants of food fishes in rivers, large
lakes, and other public waters and in
many thousands of small lakes, ponds
and streams, were made in every State
and Territory. A majority of the
plants in minor waters were on
farms."
Tt is in the exercise of his rights to
exclusive use of waters fronting his
riparian property for fishing that the
riparian owner most frequently be-
comes involved in legal disputes with
his neighbors, and not the federal
government. Such disputes almost in-
variably involve Riparian Boundaries,
which is a subject more baffling, if
possible, than Riparian Rights. In
this class of cases also fall those in-
volving the right, in northern waters,
of cutting ice. It has been held in
Michigan, and supported that a ri-
parian owner has the exclusive right
to cut and remove ice within his ri-
parian boundaries, which in many lo-
calities, is a valuable right.
One phase of this subject many
times disputed and of particular sig-
nificance in Michigan, is the distinc-
tion between riparian rights on the
inland waters of a State and those on
its boundaries, especially where an in-
ternational boundary is involved. The
principal interest of this State in the
subject lies, of course, on the Detroit,
St. Clair and St. Marys Rivers. It
has been repeatedly held, however, by
the Supreme Court of Michigan and
sustained by the United States Su-
preme Court, that there is no distinc-
tion. The Michigan rules for riparian
ownership have been applied indis-
criminately to inland waters and to
those on its international border.
These cover riparian ownership to the
"thread of the stream."
Reference was made in a para-
graph above to the Chandler-Dunbar
Power Co. case, in which the govern-
ment lost its claim to right of owner-
ship in certain islands in St. Marys
Falls on the strength of principles al-
ready mentioned. One of these is the
inclusion (in this State) of unsur-
veyed islands as the property of the
adjacent riparian owner, and the oth-
er is the impotence of the United
States to give title to riparian rights,
also the prior right of the State to
grant such title.
Before proceeding to particular
phases of Riparian Boundaries, I de-
sire, in part recapitulation, especially
to make clear the salient principles of
Riparian Rights and the comparative
powers of State and Nation. This
has been clearly outlined in a recent
decision of the United States Su-
preme Court as follows:
"First. The original states which united
under the Constitution owned the land
submerged by the navigable waters within
their respective boundaries in right of
their sovereignty.
"Second. This ownership was not sur-
rendered by their union, and remained un-
affected by the exercise of the power dele-
gated to the United States to regulate
commerce between the states and between
the states and foreign countries.
"Third. Upon the acquisition of terri-
tory by the United States, such new ter-
ritory was held, the terra firma as well as
the submerged lands, in trust for the sev-
eral new states which should thereafter be
formed of such territory, subject, however,
to the right retained by the United States
on parting with it, to sell the land for rev-
enue; and this doubtless included lands in
islands, as well as elsewhere, which the
United States should regard as valuable
and claim for itself.
"Fourth. This trust was executed by
the United States and the ownership of


171
the submerged lands relinquished when
any state thus formed should be admitted
into the Union, for upon such admission
the new state was entitled to the same
rights of sovereignty and be upon an equal
footing "in all respects" with the original
states. And this was one of the express
conditions of the deed of cession executed
March 1, 1784, by the State of Virginia
to the United States, of the Northwest
Territory, out of which the State of Mich-
igan was formed.
"Fifth. In the case of the State of
Michigan, the condition was performed by
the Act of Congress of June 16, 1836, by
which it was admitted with its northern
and eastern boundaries on the internation-
al boundary, the new state to be "on equal
footing with the Original States in all re-
spects whatever." And thereupon the title
to the lands submerged by the navigable
waters of the state was transferred to the
State. But the. title to the mainland and
of such islands as it should claim was as
in other cases expressly reserved to the
United States by the act of admission, to
be sold for the benefit of all the states.
"Sixth. The title to unsurveyed and un-
claimed islands in submerging waters is
of the same character with that of the bed
of the stream or other navigable waters.
"Seventh. The ownership by the state
of lands submerged by navigable waters
is in all the states, and equally in them
all, subject to such control by the United
States as is necessary to the exercise of the
complete title ihipaired.
"Eighth. The United States has, there-
fore, in its several departments, legisla-
tive, executive and judicial, recognized the
right of the state in which such submerged
lands and unclaimed islands are situated
to make such disposition of them as it
pleased.
"Ninth. The State of Michigan, as have
other states, has relinquished them to the
riparian owner."
Riparian Boundaries as a subject
will be but lightly touched upon here,
aside from one specific application.
A brief summary of some of the
principles used and advocated, how-
ever, will not be out ,of place. I say
"used and advocated" advisedly, for
there is perhaps no subject so rich
with varying and often conflicting
opinions as this one, and the distinc-
tion between "used" and "advocated"
arises because of the power (ques-
tionable as it may seem to many of
us) of the judiciary to "establish,"
and the undeniable impotence of the
Engineer to fix boundaries of any na-\
ture, wet or dry.
The most ingenious and unques-
tionably the ablest solution of the puz-
zle of riparian boundaries heretofore
advanced was devised by our own be-
loved Professor Davis. It was the
writer's privilege to hear him explain
his proposed methods before the De-
troit Engineering Society a few years
ago. Briefly the method is to first
survey and map the contours of the
bed of the waterway fronting the ri-
parian property whose boundaries are
desired, and then to plot the raparian
boundaries beginning at the intersec-
tion of the terrestrial boundaries with
the high-water mark and proceeding
towards the thread of the waterway
so that the locus will everywhere be
normal to the nearest contour. As
Professor Davis says and as I heard
lawyers of note affirm at the time,
this method is (as are all other meth-
ods) valueless under existing laws
which leave it open to the courts to
fix boundaries for each individual case.
And up to date the subject has been
ruled upon by the courts only in cer-
tain isolated cases, none of which has
established a governing principle, but
has at best merely originated or af-
firmed a precedent. I am speaking
now of Michigan, of course, as I do
not pretend to cover or to know the
rules in other states.


THE MICHIGAN TBCHNIC
In this state it is the generally ac-
cepted rule that riparian boundaries
on the straight shores of rivers shall
extend from the intersection of ter-
restrial boundaries with High-water
mark normal to the thread of the
stream at that place. It has been ad-
vocated that in such cases the lines
should extend normal to the shore line
at that place, and also (as is frequent-
ly attempted but never to my knowl-
edge affirmed in court) that the ri-
parian lines should extend to the
thread of the stream as continuations
of the terrestrial boundaries and in
the same straight line with them. The
latter method has repeatedly been
claimed by owners on the shores of
the Great Lakes.
On straight shores of the Great
Lakes no decision has ever been made
by tli2 Supreme Court of this State
regarding a shore owner's riparian
boundaries. It has been advocated
that in such case the laws affecting
similar boundaries in the ocean should
apply. It is generally understood, I
believe, and is the usual practice, that
these lines extend from the meander
posts (supposed intersection of ter-
restrial boundaries with high-water
mark) normal to the general trend of
the shore line. These lines and all
other riparian lines on the lakes do
not extend theoretically nor supposed-
ly beyond access to navigable water.
There follows the burden of deter-
mining what is navigable water in the
sense here implied. Many claim, and
among them Professor Davis, that it
is impossible to determine that imag-
inary line.—the edge of navigable
water. At any rate it never has been
determined, although in this State, in
one isolated case, 18 feet was held to
be navigable water, and again 16 feet.
The Legislature seems to have made
the best of a bad situation by stipulat-
ing, in general, one mile from shore.
(See preceding quotation from stat-
ute.)
Regarding riparian boundaries on
curved shores, however, there have
been Supreme Court decisions for
precedent, and based thereon, some
more or less definite solutions of the
problem may be made and marked out
by the otherwise helpless Engineer,
although a solution of his is not by
any means final until it has stood the
test of a Supreme Court decision. The
rule applicable in this case was orig-
inally brought from Massachusetts
and is embodied under Act No. 122,
Pub. Acts 11)05, Michigan Statutes,
stating that in marking the bounda-
ries of the rights of the owners of
frontage upon coves, a base line
should be drawn between the head-
lands of the cove, to which all bound-
ary lines will converge; and in case
there is frontage from which straight
lines cannot be drawn intersecting the
base line, secondary base lines should
be drawn, between inner headlands,
if any, if not, to the center of the
cove: and the several base lines should
then be divided proportionately to the
shore frontage of the owners. •
This rule has been upheld by the
Michigan Supreme Court on two or
three appeals: the prist of the most in-
teresting decision is here given. The
case is that of John Stuart against
Toseph Greanvea et al. to enjoin the
latter (defendants) from fishing in
certain waters fronting Wigwam Bay
in Arenac County. The former Ccom-
plainant) contended that the riparian
boundary line between the interested
parties should have been ascertained
"by finding the center line of Sagi-
naw Hay, and running a line at right
angles therewith to the boundary line
between the parties' lands, or, if that
is not the rule, such line should be


173
run at right angles with the line of
navigable water, i. e., the line separat-
ing the blue and green water where
the depth is about 16 feet." (Note the
significance of the word "advocated"
in the opening paragraphs on Boun-
daries.)
The Supreme Court in its decision
reviewed the Michigan Statutes quot-
ed above, stipulating the riparian
owner's right to exclusive fishing in-
?ide the two-mile line fronting the
the reason that the opening of the
bay is not wide enough to accommo-
date all. Moreover, if "opposite" is
held strictly to mean "in front of,"
any attempt to extend straight lines
for two miles would make confusion
through the intersecting lines. If, on
the other hand, complainant's theory
is to be adopted, all riparian lands to
the east of the defendants' land will
be cut off from such right by Green's
Point.

shores of this county. By referring
to the cut showing an outline map of
Wigwam Bay, the complainant's
frontage is marked "C," and the De-
fendant's. "D." the nets placed by "D"
were on the line "F K," which "C"
claimed to be across his front and,
therefore, trespassing on his rights.
The Court's arguments were brief-
ly that if the defendants' claim of the
exclusive right to tish the entire widtli
of his land for two miles out is sus-
tained, it is obvious that every other
owner cannot have a simlar right, for
To adopt the defendants' theory
would give every shore owner the
right to a strip as wide as his lot ex-
tending two miles out. P.ut the right
of all riparian owners to access to
navigable water cannot be denied.
This at once makes the application of
the theory impossible because the
length of shore line is much greater
than the distance between headlands
over open water. As the lines of all
must pass between the headlands in
order to reach the two-mile limit, one
of two things must necessarilv fol-


THE MICHIGAN TECHN1C
low:—either lands whose frontage
collectively equals the distance be-
tween headlands only can have such
rights under the statute, or such lines
must all converge. If the former,
then which of the several parcels shall
be denied the right? If the latter,
should any of the shore line between
headlines be omitted, and if so, to
what extent? Any arbitrary selection
of favored lands would be a palpable
injustice and the theory is, therefore,
discarded.
and emphasized the propriety of
modifying the rule, to that end, where
circumstances seem to require it.
The court, therefore, upholds the
principle of the statute for the deter-
mination of riparian boundaries on
curved shores quoted above and ap-
plies the principle in this case. In
summing up the case, the court states,
"the nets represented by the dotted
line appear to be wholly within the
defendant's allotment, but we cannot
be sure that our measurements are
TAWAS BAY
It follows, then, that each and every
owner must have equal right of access
to navigable water and, therefore, all
boundaries must converge to the dis-
tance between headlands; and to avoid
injustice, the fractional parts of this
distance must be proportionate to
shore frontage. Decisions in other
cases have recognized the difficulty of
an inflexible rule for giving riparian
owners equal access to navigable wat-
ers, and have, therefore, given prom-
inence rather to the fact that a fair
apportionment is the object in view
accurate.'' The full lines on the map
marked "H K" and "F G" are given
by the court as the boundaries, but
the writer is unable to check these lo-
cations from the data given by strict
application of the law. The dash lines
represent more nearly the correct po-
sitions by plotting according to the
statute, in which case the net would
fall outside the defendants' allotment
for the greater part of its length.
However, the court closes its decision,
because of the lack of accurate data,
by remanding the case to the lower


175
trial court for the necessary proof and
changes to make it comply with the
Supreme Court opinion.
It fell to the writer's lot to settle a
dispute "out of court" under similar
circumstances; this time in Iosco
County in Tawas Bay. Circumstances
were similar so far as the curved
shore was concerned, but different in
that there was but one promontory to
serve as a base line terminal. To find
the other terminal for the base line,
the writer resorted to the law that in
this county riparian owners are entit-
led to access to the two-mile limit.
The two-mile line was, therefore,
plotted on the chart of this bay (see
cut of outline map of Tawas Bay)
parallel to the straight portion of the
shore in the general direction of E D.
At D the two-mile line made a sharp
turn to preserve the proper distance
from the bay shore and took the gen-
eral direction of D F. It was assumed
that a line from D to shore, normal
to D E would mark the end of straight
shore line and the beginning of the
bay. E was, therefore, taken as the
other terminal of the base line A B.
In order to accommodate owners on
the east side of the bay, secondary
base lines were drawn to C, the mid-
dle point on the shore between A and
B. A marked departure from the pre-
ceding case was here made, however,
in that the base line A B was not used
to determine the direction of the ri-
parian boundaries, but only for the
determination of the sub-base lines
A C and B C.
Because of the fact that all riparian
boundaries must reach the two-mile
limit, those on the bay must reach
D F. It was, therefore, asumed that
B I) is the last boundary of the
straight-shore proprietors and that all
other lines to the eastward must reach
D F. The line D F then becomes the
terminal base. D F was taken instead
of DA A because F lies at the edge
of navigable water (here on the 12-
foot contour, which is traced on the
map) and had DA been taken, the
easternmost proprietors would have
had no access to navigable water.
The line K L marks the boundary
between the contending parties and
K, the meander post, is the beginning
of the riparian boundary desired. The
sub-base line A C and the terminal
base D F were divided so that the dis-
tances
AK/AKC = AH/AC = FG/FD
where A K and A K C were measured
along the shore line. K H G then be-
comes the riparian boundary sought.
This broken line was then tied into
the land survey of the properties con-
cerned. In this case considerable ac-
cretion to the north and west of K was
thrown into the land to the east of the
terrestrial boundary instead of that to
the west, which might otherwise have
been supposed. The line M N O is an
imaginary riparian boundary begin-
ning on the western half of the bay
shore indicating the course of such
boundaries.
The fishing privileges in these wat-
ers are valuable and command good
rentals, so the positions of riparian
boundaries become important. The
above location has been satisfactory
to the adjoining proprietors and so
long as it remains so there will be no
reason to change it, but should one
party or a future owner become dis-
satisfied, the only recourse will be the
courts, with whom rests the ultimate
location of this riparian boundary.


TRANSMISSION LINE
BY R. D. PARKER. '05E
The general question of interference with telephone and telegraph ser-
vice by induction from neighboring electric light and power circuits is a
very old one when considered from the standpoint of the electrical engineer,
dating back to the earliest days of the electric companies 25 and 30 years
ago. In spite of this fairly long period in which many experiments have
been conducted and a considerable amount of information collected many
interesting problems still remain unsolved and new questions arise nearly
every day. These new questions, notwithstanding the great advance in the
technical side of electrical engineering, are answered in many cases by em-
pirical rules or by pure guesses. This very unsatisfactory state of affairs
is due to, first, the difficulty of the subject; second, to the very rapid growth
of the industries involved, with their constantly changing apparatus and
methods of operation introducing new limits and new features with every
change, and, third, to the lack of appreciation of the engineer of the im-
portance of the problem.
It is hoped that this paper though relating to a particular case of induc-
tive interference and though descriptive in nature may help its readers to
understand the various phases of the question and be of especial assistance
should they chance to work along similar lines.
GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE CASE.
The interference trouble referred to, which was one of the worst on
record as regards the magnitude of the induced voltages, was that caused
by the 140,000 volt 3-phase transmission line of the Au Sable Electric Com-
pany which parallels the telegraph circuits of the Western Union Telegraph
Company and the Detroit &amp; Mackinaw R. R. between East Tawas and Pin-
conning, Michigan. In 1912 when the power line was opened the 140,000
volts here used was the highest operating voltage in the world. At the
same time the exposure was extremely severe; that is, the wires of the two
systems were parallel and very close to each other for a long distance, act-
ually about 32 miles. Fig. 1, a photograph taken during the tests, shows
both the power and the telegraph lines and brings out very clearly the se-
vere exposure to which the telegraph line was subjected.
The writer was fortunate in being asked to act as engineer for the power
company in conjunction with engineers representing the railroad and tele-
graph companies in the study that was made to determine the cause and the
remedy for the large electrical disturbances noted in the telegraph circuits
immediately after the power line was opened.
The electrical currents flowing in the telegraph circuits when the trans-
mission line was operating were so large that telegraph operation was abso-
lutely prevented, the electromotive forces so great that one or two of the


177
railroad offices were set on fire by electric arcs, the power of which is illus-
trated in Fig. 2, forming between the telegraph wires and several operators
received severe shocks. Luckily the fires were extinguished before anv seri-
Fic. 1. Power and Telegraph Lines
ous damage was done. Since telegraph operation was prevented it was im-
possible to properly despatch the trains, railroad service was interfered with,
and wrecks were liable. On the other hand, the power company had just

expended a large sum of money on its dam, power house and transmission
line, and extra heavy winter loads were then being experienced by the com-
pany in the cities of Bay City, Saginaw, and Flint to which the power trans-
mission line ran. As a result of the interference to their service the railroad


people secured an injunction against the power company preventing the use
of the transmission line, but a compromise was made to allow its use during
the hours of the day of the heaviest load. It is apparent that the problem
before the engineers was to determine the cause of this severe and unex-
pected trouble, to apply a remedy which would allow each system to operate
independently of the other, and to secure this result as soon as possible.
GENERAL EXPLANATION OF CAUSE OF TROUBLE.
The causes of disturbances between two electrical systems of this char-
acter may be classified as follows:—
i. Electrostatic Induction.
2. Electromagnetic Induction,
3. Leakage Current.
Electrostatic induction is familiar to us from some of the earliest elec-
trical experiments in physics. It is due to the field of electric force which
surrounds any electrified body. In the case of a 3-phase transmission line
the wires are the electrified bodies. The numerical values of the electrifica-
tions for the three wires follow approximately the sine law but differ in
phase from each other by an angle of 120°. The effect of these three elec-
trified wires on neighboring wires depends, primarily, on the arrangement
of all of the wires with respect to each other and to the ground, and on the
voltage employed. Some of the other considerations of perhaps minor im-
portance are frequency, wave shape of the line voltage, insulation of the
lines, and the method of connecting the power transformers.
Electromagnetic induction between electrical systems of this character
is caused by changes in the magnetic field surrounding the wires due to the
alternating electric currents flowing in the wires. In a 3-phase transmission
line the current in each of the three wires alternates in accordance with the
sine law and the three currents differ in phase from each other by an angle
of 1200. The effect of these three currents upon neighboring circuits
through the medium of the magnetic field depends primarily on the arrange-
ment of the conductors with respect to each other and to the ground and
upon the magnitude of the currents. The other factors to be considered
are much the same as those mentioned in the case of electrostatic induction.
By leakage current is meant an electrical current which leaks or flows
directly between the two electrical systems. This current is not due to in-
duction. It might still exist though the systems were completely shielded
from each other for both electrostatic and electromagnetic induction. It is
usually assumed to be directly proportional and in phase with the disturbing
electromotive forces.
To sum up it may be said that the electrostatic and leakage effects are
directly prooprtional to the electromotie forces causing the disturbance, that
is, the greater the voltage the worse thev become. On the contrary electro-
magnetic effects are in a way independent of the voltage, but depend di-
rectly on the magnitude of the disturbing currents. In every case all three
of these factors do their share but usually one is very prominent and if it
can be neutralized the disturbance ceases to be of any consequence. In prac-


•79
tice the effects of electromagnetic induction are usually noticeable only near
moderately low voltage large current systems. Also, if the frequencies of
the alternating currents used in the disturbed and disturbing systems are
nearly alike, the worse the inductive effects. On the contrary should the
frequencies differ widely the practical consequences may be trifling though
the magnitude of the disturbances considered purely from an electrical point
of view may be considerable.
TRANSMISSION LINE.
The transmission line ran from the power house on the Au Sable River
to a substation at Zilwaukee between Bay City and Saginaw and from there
to Flint. It was designed to transmit about 20,000 K.W. at 140,000 volts,
60 cycles. The three wires of the line were placed with spacings of 12 feet,
17 feet and 17 feet to form an isosceles triangle with the shortest side a
vertical. Each conductor was a cable with an outside diameter of about
.38" and was formed of 7 strands of Xo. 8 copper wire. Transformers

were connected in delta on both the high and the low tension sides and the
ratio of transformation was about 50 to 1. Fig. 3 is a simplied diagram
of the transmission line circuit.
TELEGRAPH IJNE.
The telegraph line was located on the railroad company's right-of-way
and ran between Bay City and Cheboygan. It was provided with three
No. 8 or No. 9 iron wires which entered all of the intermediate railroad
offices where a switchboard was placed permitting each operator to change
the electrical conditions of the different circuits in several ways, e. g., open
any circuit, connect any circuit through the office with or without the inser-
tion of a telegraph key and relay, or ground any circuit. The telegraph
batteries each providing a normal working pressure of about 150 volts were
placed at Alpena, Bay City and Cheboygan. Fig. 4 is a simplified diagram
of the telegraph circuit.
The changes which can be made in any telegraph circuit at any office
mean that a telegraph system of this character must be considered as very
unstable and liable to change at any moment. A cure for some trouble for
one working condition may be a failure for some other condition. The sim-
ple act of inserting an ordinary neutral telegraph relav in series with a
telegraph line makes a radical change in the electrical properties of the cir-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
cuit as is apparent when it is realized that such a relay has resistance of 150
ohms and an inductance of 4 or 5 henrys.
The fundamental frequency of the electrical current required for Morse
telegraph operation varies from 10 to 15 cycles per second but other fre-
quencies three and five times the fundamental are always present in the
waves or pulses of current and are necessary if the telegraph relays are to
operate properly.

EXPOSURES.
Fig. 5 is a chart of the exposure between the power line and the tele-
graph line. Lateral distances were measured from the center lines of the
track and pole structures. It is evident that the worst exposure is the thirty-
mile section between Emery Junction and Pinconning as indicated. Fig. 6
is a typical section of this particular exposure. The average distance be-
tween the telegraph wires and the nearest wire of the power line is about
25 feet. The elevations indicated are averages taking the sag of the wires
into consideration. A telephone line on the opposite side of the railroad was
also affected by the operation of the transmission line and was used during
some of the tests.
PRELIMINARY TESTS.
The first measurements of the voltage between the telegraph wires and
the ground caused by the power line gave fairly high and very erratic val-
ues jumping at times from 300 to 400 volts to over 600 volts. Other tests
indicated that the insulation of all the lines was very good showing that leak-
age did not account for these high voltages unless it could be imagined that
a current was flowing from the power line to the telegraph w:ires through
the air. This explanation seemed very unreasonable and was quickly aban-
doned and yet the discharge from the power wires could be seen at night
and the noise produced by this discharge was plainly audible even at a con-
siderable distance from the line. This discharge must have had some effect
though probably it was very small compared with others.
It was quickly learned that the erratic voltage readings were due to the
arcing of the telegraph lightning arresters at the various railroad offices.

After these arresters were removed and the wiring at the offices put in shape
to stand high voltages, the voltage readings became nearly constant but at
the same time very much higher, between 2,000 and 3,000 volts. Fig. 7
shows the results of a test to determine the relations existing between the
current, voltage, load, and power factor of the power line and the voltage
from one of the telegraph wires to the ground. In this test the telegraph
wire was carefully insulated and the voltage readings obtained with an
electrostatic voltmeter connected between the wire and ground at one end
of the exposed section. The power line readings were obtained from in-
struments connected to the low tension side of the transformers at the pow-
er house. The voltage readings are to be multiplied and the current read-
ings divided by the ratio of transformation to give the actual line values.
The line voltage at the power house was therefore about 125,000 volts but
because of the capacity of the line wires the voltage at the distant end was
considerably higher than at the power house. The voltage between the
power wires at the point where the tests were made was probably between
130,000 and 140,000 volts.
The general conclusion drawn from this test was that the voltage be-
tween the telegraph wires and ground caused by the operation of the trans-
mission line is practically constant, independent of the variations of the line
current, and probably due almost entirely to electrostatic induction. Cer-
tain variations in the voltage readings may be noted which cannot be ex-
plained on the basis of electrostatic induction since the power line voltage
remained constant, but it must be remembered that the working conditions
in a field test of this character are very different from those existing in the
laboratory during the test of a single piece of apparatus. In the field test
the attempt is made to extend the laboratory over many miles of wire and
some of the conditions of the test are beyond all control. Thus, the acci-
dental grounding of the telegraph wires at any office along the 30-mile line
made a very noticeable difference in the voltage readings, sufficient to ac-
count for the variations actually noted in the test.
CALCULATED VALUE OF INDUCED VOLTAGES.
The conclusion that the trouble was due to electrostatic induction was
checked by calculations to determine the voltages to be expected from elec-
trostatic and from electromagnetic induction applying the conditions of this
particular case. The results are shown in the following table:

The method of calculating the induced voltages between the telegraph
wire and the ground may be explained rather briefly as follows:—
ELECTROSTATIC INDUCTION.
Let us assume that the earth or ground forms a perfectly conducting
sheet, or neutral plane. In this case the electric field produced by a single
charged wire supported parallel to and above the surface of the ground
is the same as would be produced by a pair of wires, charged equally but
of opposite sign, one placed above and the other below the neutral plane
or ground by an amount equal to the elevation of the actual wire. The
second wire, imagined below the surface of the ground, is called the elec-
trical image of the first wire. By using the actual wire and its image and
by scaling from an exposure diagram, see Fig. 6, or calculating the dis-
tances to any point, P, we may compute the potential difference between
that point and the ground due to these electrified wires by the formula:
E.-2Q log A/B
where
Ei = The potential difference between the point P and the ground.
Q = The quantity of electricity on a wire per unit length.
A — Distance from the point P to the image.
5 = Distance from the point P to the elevated wire.
Using this formula and calling H the elevation of the actual wire above
the ground and r the radius of this wire the potential difference between
the wire and ground is
E-2Q log 2 (H-r)/r
or if r is small as compared with H this reduces to
E = 20 log 2H/r
and the ratio
£, 2Q\ogA/B log/4/5
E 2Q log 2H/r log 2H/r
and
log A/B
E, = E
log 211/r
but E in the case of a three-phase transmission line equals the voltage be-
tween the wires divided by the V3&gt; or m 0l,r case 130,000 volts divided by
V3. say 75,000 volts.
Thus
log A/B
Ex = "s.oco
log 2hl/r
for each of the three wires of the transmission line. The total potential
difference between the |x&gt;int P, or the telegraph wire, and ground is the sum
of the three potential differences calculated for each of the three wires of
the transmission line. Since these voltages differ in phase by 120" it is
necessary to add them vectorially. This can easily be accomplished bv the
formula
Ex = vTT,2 + £~J + E7 — E,E, — E,F.i — Edi,
where E., E« and E:l are th.' calculated values for each of the three wires.


THE M1CH1GAX TECHNIC
ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION.
Assuming the ground to be a perfectly conducting surface as before,
the distribution of the magnetic flux due to an alternating current in any
one of the power wires is the same as if an equal return current existed in
the image of this wire. The telegraph wire is to be considered as having
an image placed beneath the surface of the ground equal to the elevation of
the actual wire above the ground and it is evident that the problem is one
of mutual induction between long parallel and symmetrically placed circuits.
The formula for the mutual induction of such circuits is
{H + hy+d&gt;
.1/= .00074 log henrys per mile
(H — hy+&lt;?
where
// = Elevation of the power wire.
li = Elevation of the telegraph wire.
rf = Horizontal distance between the wires.

Te/etjraph
Transposition Diagram
The electromotive force between the telegraph wire and ground due to elec-
tromagnetic induction can be calculated from the formula
£,= W M/2 I
where / is the frequency and / the current. M is divided by 2 because we
wish to know the voltage between the wire and ground, not between the
wire and its image.
This E.M.F. must be calculated for each of the power wires and the
vector sum obtained as in the case of electrostatic induction.
REMEDIES.
(1) Transposition of the Wires of the Power Line.
The principal remedy to be applied in a case of trouble of this kind, and
one which was quickly decided upon as soon as the magnitude and the cause
of the disturbance became evident is to properly transpose the wires of the
electrical systems. Since the telegraph circuits used the earth for a return
conductor it was impossible to transpose them and this burden, a cost esti-
mated at $100 per transposition, fell upon the power people.
Transposing means that the wires exchange positions so that each power
wire is at the same average distance from the tehgraph wires along the


185
exposed section of line. This is shown diagrammatically for a three-phase
line in Fig. 8. The length of line L is called the transposition distance and
it is evident that each of the three wires occupies each of the three possible
positions, 1, 2, or 3, for 1/3 of the transposition distance. Fig. 9 shows one
of a pair of transposition towers.
Theoretically it is impossible to entirely neutralize the electromotive
forces due to electrostatic induction by transpositions but it is possible to
greatly reduce the electrostatic effects provided enough transpositions are
made. This is evident when it is realized that the portion of the telegraph
wire between transpositions, as a to b, Fig. 8, is electrified as before and
that the next portion, b to c. is also electrified but with a value differing in
phase from that of a to b because of the change in the arrangement of the
power wires at the transposition. This means that electric currents are
flowing to and fro in the telegraph wires between the portions on each side
Fig. 9. Transposition Tower
of a transposition. We should expect this current to be a maximum at a
point opposite the transposition and a minimum at a point midway between
transpositions. The so-called neutralization of the electrostatic effect is
therefore actually due to these currents. The impedance of the telegraph
wire prevents a complete neutralization and if the transpositions are not
placed often enough the induced voltages to ground may still be fairly high.
The presence of the neutralizing currents flowing to and fro in the non-
grounded telegraph wire after the transpositions are inserted is another
cause for trouble since these currents now pass through the telegraph in-
struments and prevent their use for telegraph purposes. The transporta-
tions therefore cause electromotive forces between portions of the same tele-
graph wire in addition to that previously existing between the wire and
ground and an infinite number of transpositions in the power line are re-
uired to entirely neutralize the electrostatic effects.


THE MICHIGAN THCHN1C
Fig. 10 shows the results of tests that were made of the induced voltage
between the telegraph wire and the ground and the current flowing to the
ground while the transpositions were being placed in the power line. The
current and voltage readings were not taken simultaneously. It is very ap-
parent that the electrostatic effects were not neutralized even with 17 trans-

positions placed in the 32-mile section of line. Also that the number of
transpositions would be excessively large if the current to ground were to
be reduced below 6 milliamperes which was the limit towards which we
were working.
Fig. 11 shows the results of other tests that were made of the voltage
and current at a mid-point of the exposed section during the making of the


transpositions. Current and voltage readings were not obtained simulta-
neously and when the current reading was made the circuit to ground
through the voltmeter was open. The results given indicate that currents
were flowing to and fro in an insulated conductor, or in other words eddy
currents existed which were due, not to a magnetic, but to a changing elec-
trostatic field. No readings were taken of this current at this point of the
line before any transpositions were inserted but the relays placed in the line
were unaffected and since 5 to 10 milliamperes produced a noticeable chat-
ter it is evident that the current before the transpositions were made was
very close to the theoretical value of zero. The first two transpositions
caused this to jump to nearly 60 milliamperes which decreased to 11 milli-
amperes for seventeen transpositions. From the general trend of the curve
plotted between current and the number of the transpositions it is again
evident that an excessively large number would have been required to reduce
this current to 6 milliamperes.
(2) Resonant Shunts.
It was just pointed out that a very large number of transpositions in the
power line would have been needed to reduce the current in the telegraph
relays to 6 milliamperes which was considered to be the maximum that
could be allowed and still retain satisfactory telegraph service. Since each
transposition was estimated to cost about $100. it was suggested that a com-
bination of inductance and capacity so adjusted as to be resonant at 60 cycles
per second, could be used as a shunt to carry the troublesome current away
from the telegraph apparatus and save the expense for transportations.
These "resonant shunts" as they are called were connected between the tel-
egraph line and ground and around each telegraph key and relay at the
railroad offices. They reduced the current in the relays from 11 or 12 milli-
amperes to 3 or 4 milliamperes which was well within the prescribed limit.
Since the current required for the telegraph was an interrupted direct
current the resonant shunts did not prevent the working of the telegraph
relays. The only time any of the current required for the telegraph was
shunted from the relays was when this current was changing in value. The
fundamental rate of change for hand telegraphy is about the same as that
for a 10 or 15 cycle per second alternating current, but other frequencies
as high as 50 or 75 cycles per second are of some importance in causing a
quick action of the relays. It is evident that the resonant shunt, tuned
fairly sharply to 60 cycles per second would have little or no influence on
the telegraph currents at 10 cycles per second but the currents at higher
frequencies which we can imagine as forming part of the telegraph impulses
may be considerably affected. As a matter of fact it was found that tele-
graph operation with the resonant shunts was considerably better than with-
out them but with the induction, and that it was satisfactory enough for or-
dinary use.
Fig. 12 shows the results of a final test which was made after all of the
transpositions had been placed and the resonant shunts inserted at the dif-
ferent offices as indicated. All of the ammeter readings were obtained with


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
the voltmeter circuit open. The value of the resonant shunt is made very
clear by this test. The current through the telegraph relay when the switch
of the shunt circuit was closed was well within the maximum permissible
value while, when the shunt circuit was open, the current was much too
great at five of the offices.
(3) Increased Separation Between the' Two Systems.
Probably the most obvious remedy for induction troubles is to increase
the distance between the two electrical systems but at the same time this

usually involves the greatest expense. In this particular case the distance
between the telegraph wires and the power wires was so small that direct
contact was possible should one of the power wires break. This hazard
was so great that it was decided to move the telegraph line to the other side
of the railroad and this was done as soon as the frozen ground permitted,
but it was found that the transpositions and resonant shunts were still re-
quired to give proper telegraph service.
CONCLUSIONS.
vSome of the conclusions which may be drawn from a test of this kind
are as follows:—■
(1) A preliminary electrical survey should be made of the territory
through which it is planned to build a transmission line to determine the
characteristics of each of the electrical systems liable to be affected.
(2) That transportations be placed in the line at the proper points to
minimize inductive effects in other systems. This means that the transposi-
tions in the other systems must be known in order that the transpositions in
the new line be properly located.


(3) That long close parallel runs be avoided as much as possible.
(4) That the inductive effects of high tension lines arise in many cases
from the electrostatic field, and the higher the voltage and the greater the
spacing between the wires of the transmission lines the worse they become.
(5) That in the selection of the apparatus and of the electrical system
to be used for the operation of the line, proper emphasis be given to the
question of possible inductive interference with neighboring electrical sys-
tems as well as to the more common questions of first cost, reliabilty, etc.,
always considered in the selection of equipment.
(6) In general it may be said that all tests of this kind are too ex-
pensive and that means should be taken to prevent their necessity. It seems
to be entirely within the province of the designing engineer of the trans-
mission line to foresee such troubles and to prevent them by all means in
his power. It is just as much his job to stop the needless expenditure of
money in this way as it is to select the proper materials to lower the first
cost of the line.

BY EDWARD M. HOWELL, '13E
Superintendent of the Plant
The Municipal Asphalt Plant re-
cently installed at Flint, Michigan,
under the direction of Ezra C. Shoe-
craft, City Engineer, has practically
completed the first seasons' work. It
has operated in a highly satisfactory
manner and promises many years of
efficient service. The plant was de-
signed and erected by Hetherington &amp;
Berner, of Indianapolis, and is one of
the most complete in this section of
the country.
The plant is located on the Pere
Marquette main line on ground about
ten feet lower than the railroad grade,
which facilitates greatly the handling
of material and gives a large storage
capacity. The building is centrally lo-
cated in the city; this fact tends to
equalize the haul and does away with
any excessively long ones. Five 2}4-
yard dump wagons have been able to
handle the material from the plant to
the street without any trouble.
DESCRIPTION.
For descriptive purposes, the plant
may be separated into three units:
i. Dryers. 2. Mixing platform and
hot sand bin. 3. Kettles.
Dryers.
The sand-heating apparatus consists
of a double drum dryer which is rota-
tively mounted within a steel plate
housing lined with refractory material,
well fitted to withstand the heat from
the furnace. The capacity of this
dryer is from 16 to 18 tons of sand per
hour at a temperature of 350 degrees
F„ using sand under natural condi-
tions. The internal construction of
this drum is such that in case it is de-
sired to run a mixture of broken stone
screenings and sand for the purpose
of making bituminous macadam, bitu-
lithic, or other like pavement, the
mixture may be kept intact in its
proper proportions while passing
through the drums.
• Mixing Platform and Hot Sand
Bin.
On the mixing platform is set a
9-cubic-foot mixer containing two
shafts on which are set teeth. This
mixer is so constructed that the shafts
and blades may be easily removed, one
set being used for binder and another
for top. The material is let out
through slots in the bottom of the
mixer. Above the mixer is a box set
on scales in which the hot sand is
weighed. A bucket hung on a balance
is used for receiving hot asphaltic
cement. . The hot sand bin is situated
above the mixing platform. It is con-
structed of steel plates and divided
into two compartments. It is provided
with an internal rotary screen, made
of steel mining wire, for the purpose
of screening products of the sand
dryer previous to their being deposited
in the bin. The screen is 8-mesh for
part of its length and %" mesh on the
balance, so that the "Topeka" speci-
fications may be laid without requiring
alterations in the bin.
Kettles.
There are three kettles, one agitator,
and two open-top melting kettles. The
agitator is the kettle from which the


191
asphaltic cement is drawn to the mix-
er. It is provided with a central, hori-
zontal shaft carrying stirring arms and
sweeps for the purpose of keeping the
asphaltic cement in a homogeneous
state. This agitator kettle is made air-
tight; a pressure of 8 pounds is car-
ried in the kettle, and the asphaltic
cement discharged by pressure to the
mixer. When the agitator is empty
the material from the open-top kettles
engine and boiler. An auxiliary five-
horsepower motor is used for hoist-
ing barrels and limestone sacks and
running the agitator at night when the
main motor is shut down.
A horizontal belt-driven air com-
pressor is connected to the 40-horse-
power motor. A reducing valve fur-
nishes low-pressure air for the asphalt
kettle service, and the piping is so ar-
ranged that by shifting a lever the
Municipal Asphalt Plant, Flint, Mich.
is drawn over by creating a vacuum
in the air-tight agitator. The com-
bined capacity of these kettles is about
25 tons of Trinidad, estimating the
weight of the ordinary mixture of
Trinidad asphaltic cement at 70
pounds per cubic foot.
The plant is operated by a 40-horse-
power motor which has a speed of
about 680 revolutions per minute. It
has been found that the electric power
is much more economical than the
steam and just as reliable. The motor
also takes up less room than a steam
compressor may act as an exhaustor
for the agitator kettle.
A small vertical steam boiler is used
to keep steam in the hot asphalt pipe
line. This boiler also furnishes steam
for the oil pump and keeps the con-
tents of the oil tank warm.
OPERATION.
The operation of the plant is as fol-
lows: The sand (or binder stone) is
fed into elevator buckets at the rail-
road end of the plant and passes
through the double drum dryers,


THE MICHIGAN TBCHNIC
where all the moisture is removed and
the material brought to a temperature
of from 350 to 400 degrees F. The
hot sand is then elevated by the hot
sand buckets to the hot sand bin, pass-
ing over the revolving screen at the
top of this bin, which rejects all par-
ticles greater than 8-mesh and depos-
its them in a pile at the side of the
plant. This gravel is later used in the
binder. The hot sand is drawn from
the bin into a measuring box set on
scales, from which it is fed into the
mixer. The asphaltic cement, which
consists of commercial asphalt fluxed
to the proper consistency by the addi-
tion of asphaltic petroleum oil, is
forced into the pipe line by compressed
air. The temperature ranges from 300
to 350 degrees F. The proper amount
is weighed in a bucket hung on scales
before pouring into the mixer. In
addition to the sand and asphaltic
cement, a certain proportion of lime-
stone dust is added to bring up the
fine material which is deficient in the
sand alone. These ingredients are
mixed until all particles are thorough-
ly coated with asphalt, then dumped
into the wagon which stands below the
mixer. Six dumps of about 1,100
pounds each make a load. It requires
about 10 minutes to mix a load.
There is a small laboratory in con-
nection with the plant, where the phys-
ical tests are made. The mesh com-
position of the sand is determined by
screening through a nest of sieves
which contains 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 80,
100, and 200-mesh screens. The prop-
er consistency of samples of asphaltic
cement is obtained by a Dow penetra-
tion machine. Sample pats of the pav-
ing mixture are taken from each load.
The temperature of the loads is taken
at the plant and checked when the load
reaches the street. A considerable
variation of temperature is allowed,
but the temperature at which the mixer
may bz most.easily worked is about
300 degrees F. Chemical analysis, by
which the percentage of bitumen and
mesh composition of the aggregate is
determined, has been done this season
by the Detroit Municipal Laboratory
under the direction of Mr. C. A. Proc-
tor. This arrangement has not been
entirely satisfactory, and in another
year it is expected that the plant will
be equipped with a complete labora-
tory and all testing done on the job.
The following organization is re-
quired to operate the plant: Superin-
tendent, laboratory assistant, mixer
man and assistant, drum fireman, night
and day kettle men, engineer, and
about ten men to unload material and
feed same to elevator.
The sheet asphalt pavements laid in
this city consist of one inch of binder
and one and one-half inches of top
surface. The plant has turned out
2,900 square yards of binder per day,
running all day on this material, and
1,750 square yards of top surface
under the same conditions. The aver-
age amount of finished pavement
turned out during the season has been
about 1,000 square yards per day.
Complete figures giving the cost of
the 1915 asphalt pavements are not
yet available, but the estimates to date
show that the plant has been operated
with great saving to the city, more
than justifying the expenditure for its
erection.


BY RAY B. WHITMAN,'13E
Factory Inspector, The Fidelity &amp; Casualty Company, ok New York.
A decade ago the words "Safety
First" meant nothing to the employer
or employee in this country. In fact,
they had never been heard of except
by a few students of German indus-
trialism. Today they are the slogan
of one of the biggest movements in
America, a movement in which mil-
lions of dollars are being spent every
year.
With the coming of modern meth-
ods of manufacture, and the cry of
efficiency and low cost of production,
the number of deaths and serious in-
juries by accident began to assume
alarming proportions. The American
Museum of Safety determined from
carefully compiled statistics that some-
thing like 25,000 men were killed at
work each year in the United States,
and 300,000 suffered permanent or
serious temporary disability.
Then came the awakening. A few
employers came to realize that they
were the keepers of the men who
toiled for them, and they commenced
to study the problem of accident pre-
vention. The first effective steps in
this direction were taken by two men,
officials of two great concerns, who
from their official positions got very
clear and graphic views of this appall-
ing industrial slaughter. They were
Charles MacVeagh, general solicitor
of the United States Steel Corpora-
tion, and R. C. Richards, claim agent
of the Chicago &amp; Northwestern Rail-
way.
Mr. MacVeagh, in 1906, brought
the matter to the attention of the di-
rectors of his company, and a com-
mittee was appointed to investigate
the problem and take corrective meas-
ures.
A little later, Mr. Richards suc-
ceeded in getting the directors of the
C. &amp; N. W. to take up the movement
which has been successfully carried on
under his supervision ever since.
But these pioneers did not long
have the field to themselves. Other
railroads and other manufacturing
concerns caught the spirit. The
"Safety First" sign began to appear
everywhere. Progressive manufac-
turers, large and small, came to con-
sider the subject of accident preven-
tion, not as a burden, but as a dividend
payer, and so became more receptive
to suggestions by insurance and state
factory inspectors. And lastly, about
three years ago, state legislatures
awoke to the spirit of the times and
began passing Compensation Acts.
This last proved a great boost to the
movement, as, with the advent of this
law in a state, the merit rating system
of factory inspection went into effect
simultaneously: and by its very nature
of offering dollars and cents for ade-
quate safety protection appealed to
that large class of employers who re-
mained unmoved by humane consid-
erations. Today, almost half of the
states in the Union (twenty-four, to
be exact), have Compensation Acts,
and the subject is up before the legis-
latures of some of the other states at
the present time. These acts vary in
each state only in the details. Each
of them provides compensation for
accidental injuries or death suffered
in the course of employment in the
state, with provisions for the enforce-
ment and administration thereof and
with penalties for its violation. The
acts have been a ben fit to the great
majority of injured workmen, as they
provide a stated amount of damages
for a certain kind of injury, and the


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
workman is sure of getting this sum.
Formerly, under the old liability laws,
the employer was often able to evade
payment of damages by proving
(through superior counsel) the exist-
ence of negligence of a former em-
ployee, assumption of risk, or con-
tributory negligence—these being
known as the Common Law Defenses.
the Workmen's Compensation Service
Bureau, each subscribing a certain
share for its maintenance. The object
of this bureau is to maintain an in-
spection and rating force who will co-
operate in arriving at a classification
and merit rating of a given plant and
thus decide on the proper rate to
charge to insure that plant.
Punch Press Safety Device
However, with the passage of these
acts the insurance rates have had to
be increased, and in order not to make
them prohibitive it became necessary
to formulate a more refined method
of underwriting. And so the merit
rating system of inspection and classi-
fication was devised. All of the large
stock insurance companies—who write
the great bulk of the insurance of this
countrv—organized what is known as
"Merit Rating" is simply a means
of determining; first, what extent of
hazard a certain kind of plant is sub-
ject to; and, second, the extent of
hazard in the particular plant of that
class which is being rated. For in-
stance, a ''base" rate of $1.50 (say)
is decided on to properly cover the
insurance cost on the average planing
mill. Fast experience of the cost of


195
accidents in planing mills all over the
country determines what amount this
shall be. Then the particular planing
mill is inspected under this rating sys-
tem, and charges and credits are given
for various features which represent
hazards below or above the average.
Band Saw Guard
The final rate is thus arrived at by
adding charges to the base rate and
subtracting credits. This final rate
represents the dollars and cents which
the assured has to pay on every one
hundred dollars of his yearly pay roll.
This rate becomes standard for all the
companies operating under this sys-
tem.
In working out the merit rating sys-
tem, the underwriters recognized the
fact that while insurance is primarily
a system for the distribution of loss,
still, if the machinery of insurance can
be directed and set in motion to pre-
vent part of the loss itself, it will more
fully discharge its true functions. The
Universal Safety Standards, which
the Compensation Bureau finally
adopted, have proven the greatest sin-
gle impetus in this direction. For they
describe in detail an approved safe-

guard for every physical hazard com-
mon to all plants, and so give to the
employer the needed basis to work on
in safeguarding his plant so as to get
the minimum insurance cost. The
standards adopted are those recom-

mended by a committee of safety engi-
neers, later revised and approved by
the Rating and Classification Commit-
tee of the Compensation Bureau, and
known as ,'Universal Safety Stand-
ards." They are simple and easily in-
terpreted, and cover practically all the


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
danger points common to all indus-
tries. First attention is given to the
buildings in which employees are
housed. Standards are given in detail
for the height and construction of
buildings and their protection against
tire hazards. This includes automatic
sprinklers, extinguishers, exits and
fire escapes, fire walls, etc., etc. Thus
the fire prevention movement for the
purposes of saving life and limb as
well as property is to be brought home
to every manufacturing establishment
and the rate of insurance for work-
are described standard governors, fly-
wheel protection, etc., and—of special
importance on large engines—an inde-
pendent automatic speed limit engine
stop. Under "Power Transmission
Equipment" are standards for guard-
ing gears, chains, friction clutches,
belts and pulleys, shafting, etc. And
also there are carefully worked out
standards for safety under many other
headings, such as "Ladders," "Yards,"
Maintenance and Inspection," "Safety
Organization," "First Aid Equip-
ment." "Explosives," "Light, Order,

men's compensation will be appre-
ciably affected by the character of the

Elevators are considered next, and
standard equipment of speed govern-

Boilers must be regularly inspected by
a licensed steam boiler inspection and
insurance company, or by approved
city, county, or state boiler inspection
departments; and must conform to
various standards for proper safety

valves, etc., in order to get a maximum
of credit. Under "Steam Engines"
and Sanitation," etc. But perhaps the
most complete set of standards is
under "Machine Hazard." A long list
of approved safeguards for nearly
every machine is recommended. All
of them, however, conform to the fol-
lowing principles:
i. All power-working machines to
have gears, sprockets, chains, belts,
bands, pulleys, clutches, wheels, shaft-
ing, spindles, couplings, counter-
weights, revolving or reciprocating
parts, and all other dangerous points,
parts, or projections, guarded in ap-
proved manner.
2. All roller-fed machines on which


197
operator's hands come within danger
zone to be guarded at the point of op-
eration in approved manner.
3. All machines having a shearing,
pressing, squeezing, or cutting action
on which operator's hands come with-
in the danger zone to be guarded at
the point of operation in approved
manner.
These standards, briefly outlined
above, are being rapidly adopted by
the many plants throughout the coun-
organization and education, without
which even the best mechanical pro-
tection is futile to prevent most acci-
dents. The United States Steel Cor-
poration, in its outline of a safety
campaign, divides the problem into
three heads, as follows: Organization
(45%), Education (30%), Safe-
guards (25%). Their relative value
is indicated by the percentage follow-
ing each division. These percentages,
however, would differ somewhat for
Oi.n ami Xew Typks of Planers
try. They are being used not only to
bring existing plants and machines up
to the insurance requirements, but by
architects and draftsmen in the orig-
inal designs. The noticeable reduction
of accidents recently is due in no small
measure to this work. And yet it has
been said that scarcely a third of in-
dustrial accidents are the result of
improper safeguarding. What is fre-
quently overlooked is the great value
in this movement of property safety
ordinary factory conditions, the third
item probably being a little greater in
the majority of industries.
Instilling the proper attitude toward
safety throughout an organization is
perhaps the most important as it is the
most difficult part of safety work. For
very largely it is a problem in educa-
tion whose solution is only reached
when a nice sense of co-operation for
safety has been built up between the
workers and the management.


SIGNALS
BY H. D. W. RILEY
Operating trains by train order and
telegraph has been eliminated to a
great extent while the adoption of the
fixed signal as a safeguard in con-
ducting traffic has rapidly taken its
place. To the ordinary layman the
movement of trains by signals is rath-
er a vague subject of discussion and
an insight into the development of
signaling on railroads, as a branch of
science, becomes as interesting as the
subject of power transmission, elec-
trical traction, illumination, or tele-
phony. The methods employed by the
various roads differ only in the style
of apparatus. The same result is ac-
complished with all appurtenances,
namely: the conveying of trains over
the steel at maximum speed with least
delavs and with the one end in view,
—SAFETY FIRST.
The value of signals as a means of
promoting safety is generally recog-
nized and their installation is usually
advocated by railroad men and rec-
ommended or required by public au-
thorities. From the earliest days of
signaling down to the present time,
the tendency of signal development
has been in one direction only and
that is in the direction of safer and
more reliable control of train move-
ments with economical features as a
subsidiary relation. In general, the
art of signaling has followed, step by
step, the field of electrical engineer-
ing and as new applications and dis-
coveries in that field were advanced,
signaling likewise took successive ad-
vancing steps. Ry comparison of the
installations, their operation and eco-
nomic advantages one over the other,
the superseding of the manual lock
and block control with automatic sig-
nals was inevitable.
LOCK AND BLOCK SIGNALING.
Until the opening of the twentieth
century but few automatic signals
were in operation in this country.
Previous to this time the manual lock
and block method of control was used
most extensively. The manual lock
and block method necessitated man-
ually operated signals, safeguarded in
towers by mechanically controlled in-
terlocking. Towers were built along
the railroad right of way at intervals
of one-half to two miles in which con-
trolling devices were installed, taken
care of by towermen. The manual
operation of the signals by means of
levers in the towers required the co-
operation of the towerman at each
end of the block. The section of the
track between the towers was known
as a block and its use by trains was
controlled by block signals. The in-
terlocking was such that two trains
could not occupy the same block at
one time. That is, a train must clear
the block before the towerman at the
signal station in the rear could give
the other towerman an unlock to al-
lowi him to clear his signals and allow
a train to proceed into the unoccupied
block. The blocks at this time were
short.
At first two blades were placed on
one signal pole. One of the blades
was painted red and was called the
home, the other yellow and was


199
known as the distant. The blade in
a horizontal position indicated stop,
or danger; in a 45 degree below hor-
izontal it indicated that the block
ahead was clear and the train could
proceed at full speed. If the distant
signal was at danger, it indicated that
the block just ahead was clear but that
the block in advance was occupied, or
that the block signal controlling that
section of track was at danger. It
was the purpose of the distant signal
to forewarn the engineer of the con-
dition ahead as it repeated the posi-
tion of the next block signal and it
was so interlocked with the block sig-
nal that it could not assume a 45 de-
gree position unless the block signal
was clear. When the engineer found
a block signal at danger he could not
proceed without orders from the tow-
erman, who had previously received
his orders from the dispatcher. Where
blocks were long, the distant signal
was placed far enough in the rear of
the block signal on a separate pole,
so that in case it was necessary to
stop at the block signal a service ap-
plication of the brakes could be made
and bring the train to a full stop be-
fore reaching the signal. By divid-
ing the blocks and making them long-
er, and by placing the distant signal
on a separate pole midway between
the towers, it was possible to elimin-
ate some of the towers. This reduced
the operating expense somewhat, as
well as the maintenance.
To overcome the difficulty of oper-
ating the signals mechanically by
means of wires run over carriers, for
a distance at times of 3,000 feet, the
necessity for a change to electrically
operated signals was at once self-evi-
dent. As a means of electrical con-
trol, track circuits were added. Each
circuit was insulated from the other
by block joints and each rail in a par-
ticular circuit was bonded one to the
other, in order to make it a continuous
circuit within a block. A battery sunk
in an iron well at one end of the track
circuit supplied the electrical energy
to the rail which operated a relay con-
nected to the track at the opposite end
of the circuit. Circuits have various
purposes: i. e., to operate the inter-
locking in the tower on the signal
levers; to give indication of the ap-
proach of a train; or to operate the
relay which prevents any change be-
ing made in the switches at the tower
while the train remains on that par-
ticular circuit. Such arrangement
thus prevents the throwing of switch-
es under trains, the changing of a
route directly in front of an approach-
ing train, or a train leaving a siding
with another train in the same block.
The installation of the electrical track
circuit opened the field for broad de-
velopment in signaling. It dispensed
with the use of mechanical connec-
tions to signals in operating the blades,
for by the addition of sets of batteries
and small signal motors at the signal,
the signal blade was cleared through
electrical connections, controlled from
the tower through the signal levers.
The instruments in the towers used
under the manual lock and block did
not allow the running of trains closer
than the distance between the towers.
Such apparatus was displaced by
newer inventions and these inventions
brought decided changes in signaling.
Longer blocks were established, tow-
ers were eliminated and finally the au-
tomatic signal was put into service.
Practice has now proven that towers
are only necessary where switching
facilities are required.
AUTOMATIC SIGNALING.
Railroads differ somewhat in their
operation and method of control, de-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
pending upon whether the road is
single or double track, whether oper-
and by steam or electricity, and
whether the pulsating current is D. C.
or A. C. if the road is electrified. If
we consider the three position upper
quadrant automatic signal we will be
dealing with the latest type of instal-
lation.
The protection of all switches is
taken care of by positive stop signals.
These signals are called home signals.
The rear home signals are known as
permissive signals. The former takes
the place of the block signals, and the
latter the distant signals, in the old
system of lock and block control. As
the home signal is a positive stop sig-
nal it cannot be passed in the posi-
tion of danger without authority from
the train dispatcher. At the permis-
sive signals ,if found at danger the en-
gineer is allowed to proceed after he
has brought his train to a full stop.
Either signal found at 45 degrees
above horizontal means shut ofif steam
on passing and prepare to stop at the
next signal. Before a towerman can
make a move to change his switches
on any one track, either to allow a
train to come from a siding or to di-
rect the route of a train to another
track, he must reverse his lever con-
trolling the home signal. If no train
occupies the circuit in which the
switch he wishes to change is located,
he may change the switch for the
proper move. After he has made such
a change he then gives the train the
right to proceed past the home signal
over this route set up by a second sig-
nal arm on the same home signal pole.
After a train has passed the rear
home signal the towerman cannot
change the route, even though he re-
verses his home signal lever. This,
however, is an improper move to make
as he has given to the train a full
speed indication at the rear home and
a positive stop indication at the home
and it would be almost impossible to
bring a train to a stop when the engi-
neer discovers the home signal is at
danger. Such arrangement, to pre-
vent change of route after a train
has come on to the approach, is made
through approach locking. Indication
of the approach of a train is given to
the towerman at the second signal in
the rear of his tower. The engineer
Train Entering Block
receives at the rear home a 45 degree
indication which tells him that he will
either find the home signal at danger
or that he will receive a diverging
route signal, as the case may be,
should the towerman wish to execute
such a move. Again if a train is do-
ing switching in front of the home
signal, it is impossible to give the
main line clear signals until the
switches are all set normal, and these
cannot be set properly until the train
in question is clear of all switches and
the home signal lever is again normal.

Devices to show whether or not a
track circuit is occupied, to repeat the
indication of the home and rear home
signals, and to advise of a train on the
approach are all requisites in an up-
to-date tower. They assist materially
in the rapidity of making route
changes and in handling switch en-
gines. Besides the electrically con-
nected apparatus in handling such
moves in and around a tower, all the
switch and signal levers are mechan-
192 working levers, controlling 42
high signals, 40 dwarf signals, 93
switches and 23 controlling traffic,
section and crossing locks. Figure 2
shows the exterior of another tower
with a view of a 4-track signal bridge
and signals. These signals are work-
ed on a normal danger system.
It was mentioned in the first part
of the article that under the lock and
1 lock system trains could not be han-
dled closer than the block between

ically interlocked. It makes a double
protection for all levers.
The passage of each train past a
tower is reported by phone and tele-
graph to the dispatcher so that he
may keep in touch with the move-
ments of all trains on the division.
Each tower is equipped with phone
connections for local service and there
is also bell service between towers, a
code being used for the notification
of trains wishing to take sidings or
to execute change in route. Figure 1
shows the interior of an up-to-date
electric interlocking plant. There are
towers, when this distance was very
short. But now that a number of the
towers are eliminated and the blocks
increased in length, intermediate sig-
nals have been placed in service be-
tween the home signal and the rear
home of the tower in advance. To
show how the automatic signal facil-
itates rapid and close movement of
trains, it would be well for one to fol-
low a train over its course and note
the operation of a number of signals
as it proceeds. (Sec diagram). A

ROUND DUCTS
BY PROFESSOR J. E. EMSWILER
Distriuution op Velocity Across the Section of Pipe.
When air flows through a pipe or duct, the velocity is not uniform. It
is generally considered that the air is moving fastest near the center and
slowest at the perimeter. This assumption is true if we are considering
a section of the pipe located at a considerable distance from the fan or from
an elbow, or any source of disturbance of the stream line flow. In other
words, the condition of high center velocity prevails when the flow is rela-
tively quiet. But if the velocity be investigated at a section very near the
fan, quite different relations between center and perimeter velocities will be
observed. Tests of this kind show a velocity at tlic center but little, if any,
greater than along the walls. The maximum velocity occurs between the
center and walls. As observations are taken farther and farther from the
fan along the test pipe, it is found that the velocity at the enter increases,
while the velocity near the walls grows less. Tests made in the Mechanical
Laboratory with a very long pipe, (100 ft. long) showed that the maximum
divergence between the center and wall velocity occurred at the greatest dis-
tance from the fan.
The retarding effect of wall friction undoubtedly accounts for the veloc-
ity distribution in the pipe, at a distance from the fan. The outer annular
layer of air moves very slowly, because of pipe friction. The next layer and
each successive one towards the center, moves more rapidly, first because its
next layer adjoining (on the outside) is moving also, and second, because
the friction between layers of air is a smaller friction than that between
metal and air.
Near the fan, there is but little uniformity in direction of flow. Some
particles are pursuing a course parallel with the pipe: others are shooting
off at a considerable angle from the axis. Such as these last must ultimate-
ly come in contact with the pipe, and moving rapidly, they wipe off and carry
along the particles in the outer annular layer which tends to slip along the
pipe. The general effect of such action is to make the velocity across the
pipe much more nearly uniform.
Influence of Velocity Distriuution on Friction.
Another point of interest connected with this difference in velocity dis-
tribution across the pipe at different distances from the fan is the effect on
the frictional resistance. Our tests in the Laboratory have shown that, if
observations arc made at three points on the length of a long straight pipe,
—one near the fan; one near the end of the pipe, and tlv: third midway
between the first two, the frictional resistance of the first section is appre-
ciably higher than it is in the second section.
No doubt the reason for this difference is to be sought, as before, in the
manner in which the velocity distribution differs in the two sections. The


205
friction resistance of air moving in a pipe is due to two causes. First the
friction of the air against th: walls of the passageway, and second the fric-
tion of the particles of air sliding or rolling upon each other, which must
take place, since all the particles do not move at one speed. Of the two
causes of loss, the first is undoubtedly the greater. The average velocity of
the air must, of course, be the same at all points along the pipe. But the
average velocity of the air which comes in contact with the perimeter of the
pipe is greater near the fan, because of cross current. Consequently the
pipe friction proper is greater in that part of the pipe near the fan.
Unsymmetricat, Fr.ow of Air in a Duct.
It has already been made clear that the point of maximum velocity of
air flowing in a pipe, is not necessarily at the center. It was stated that tests
on pipes, near the point of attachment to the fan, showed a maximum veloc-
ity between the center and circumference. The maximum velocity may be
markedly greater on one side of the pipe than on the other. If the pipe be
traversed in two planes, to investigate the velocity, it might be found that
the maximum occurred in a certain quadrant of the pipe. Similar traverses
in two planes, at points farther along the pipe, would probably show that
this maximum movement is not confined to the one quadrant, but seems to
rotate around the pipe. That is, the place of maximum velocity in a pipe
may travel in a screw path along its length. From what has been stated
before, it is clear that this corkscrew motion would ultimately die down.
Hut within the limits of the length of the customary test pipe (which is
about 20 diameters) such a movement of the air is nearly always present.
The thing of importance to be derived from this knowledge is that in order
to obtaic accurate data for the calculation of average velocity it is necessary
to traverse the pipe on two diameters at right angles. Furthermore, it de-
monstrates the danger of using velocity determinations made by taking ob-
servations with a Pitot Tube placed at the center of a pipe, and multiplying
by some factor to obtain the average velocity. Such a factor could be de-
termined. Its value may be different for every size of fan, for every size of
test pipe, and for each different distance of the Pitot Tube from the fan.
Influence of End Irregularities on Frtction.
When a fan is tested by means of a Pitot Tube placed in a test pipe,
such as has been previously referred to, the Pitot Tube should be located
about ^s of the distance from the fan to the end of the test pipe. If obser-
vations be made with the end of the pipe free, a certain velocity pressure,
and a certain static pressure, will be found. The static pressure of course
indicates that the air inside the pipe is compressed to a pressure slightly
higher than the atmosphreic air outside the pipe. This static pressure is
necessary to overcome the friction of the air flowing through the remainder
of the pipe, which lies between the Pitot Tube and the end. If measure-
ment of static pressure could be made at successive points along this length
of pipe, it would be found that its value would grow less toward the end,
becoming practically zero at the end.
The value of the static pressure at the Pitot Tube is therefore a measure


THE MICHIGAN TBCHNIC
of the friction in the test pipe lying beyond, and it might be thought that
this would furnish a comparatively easy means of determining the friction
coefficient of pipes. But there is a serious objection to this simple method.
The total friction effect of a section of pipe discharging freely into the
air is made up of two parts. First, the normal friction of flow within the
pipe; and second, the exit loss at the point of escape. The latter may be
small for a pipe whose discharge end is perfectly smooth. But the least
little obstruction around the edge seems to cause an abnormal increase in
loss. A similar, or much larger obstruction placed farther back in the pipe
has far less influence on the friction loss.
To illustrate the foregoing statements, some simple experiments were
made in the Mechanical Laboratory. Air was delivered through a 7" test
pipe by the small Buffalo Blower. The Pitot Tube was located about §4.
the length of the pipe from the fan. The blower was operated at a constant
speed throughout the experiment.
With no obstruction at the end of the pipe, a certain static pressure was
observed. Then a screwdriver, with a wooden handle about ij4" ln diam-
eter, was laid in the pipe 18" from the end. This obstruction increased the
static pressure at the Titot Tube 15%.
Then a ruler Y&amp;" wide was placed diametrically across the pipe, first
entirely across, and then extending partially across by varying amounts,
with the following effect:

The screwdriver offered an obstruction of about 3J4% oi the area of
the pipe, and, placed as described, caused an increase in the static pressure
of 15%.
These figures bring out very clearly the fact that an obstruction at the
end is the cause of a vastly greater loss than is one placed in the pipe some
distance from the end. For example, the ruler projecting across yi" from
the edge, forms an obstruction less than one-tenth the- area of the screw-
driver handle, but is productive of 30% more loss in friction.
It is evident, therefore, that even the slightest roughness, or denting at
the end of the pipe would have an influence on the friction and consequently
on the reading of static pressure at the Bitot Tube. Such irregularities
should be scrupulously avoided in the construction of any duct system, where
a pipe opens up into a large chamber.
It is to be noted however, that the influence of end irregularities such
as have been described, produces no error in the testing of a fan, since, if
there is any augmentation of static pressure caused by them, the fan is cred-
ited with the increase.


PLANTS

C. F. HIRSHFELD
Steam driven auxiliaries have long
been the commonly accepted practice
in the great majority of plants, their
use being justified by the fact that the
steam exhausted from auxiliary en-
gines could be used for heating the
feed water before it entered economiz-
ers or boilers. The only alternative
method, in the minds of many, is the
driving of auxiliary machinery by
means of electric motors operated with
electrical energy drawn from the main
generators or station bus.'
Assuming, for the time being, that
practically all of the heat contained in
the steam exhausted by auxiliary en-
gines can be returned to the system
in the feed water, it is a very simple
matter to prove steam driven auxil-
iaries to be far superior to motor
driven auxiliaries using power taken
from the main generator. It is prob-
ably safe to assume that a kilowatt
hour generated in the main units of a
station costs from 20,000 to 35,000 B.
t. u. in coal, the lower figure holding
for the most economical large plants
and the higher for less economical
large plants or fairly economical small
plants. It will therefore be allowable
to assume one kilowatt hour of energy
produced by a motor operated from
the main unit to cost at least 25,000
B. t. u. at the coal pile in a well de-
signed and well operated plant. This
is generously low for most cases. This
figure must then be compared with
the cost of a similar quantity of energy
obtained from a small steam unit of
the variety used for driving auxiliary
machinery.
It is convenient to imagine such a
unit to be a device through which
steam flows and in which this steam
is robbed of some of its heat to pro-
duce useful power at the shaft and
some to supply radiation and friction
losses. All of the heat entering with
the steam must either appear as useful
energy, as radiation and friction loss,
or as heat in the exhaust steam. By
assumption, all the heat exhausted can
be used in heating the feed water. The
useful energy will be equal to about
3,412 B. t. u. per k. w. hour and, as
the friction and radiation losses of the
engine are not apt to be over 20%,
the total of useful energy and losses
will probably be of the order of 4,000
to 4,100 B. t. u. per k. w. hour at
the engine shaft. At the coal pile this
would be equivalent to about 5,800 B.
t. u. or less, generally less.
The cost of auxiliary power by what
might be called the straight steam
method therefore appears to be of the
order of 5,800 B. t. u. per k. w. hour
as against about 25,000 B. t. u. in the
case of what might be called the
straight electrical method of driving
auxiliaries.
Such a comparison, however, must
not be taken as final in any case be-
cause it does not hold unless practi-
cally all of the heat above 320 F.
which is exhausted by auxiliary en-
gines can be absorbed by the feed
water. It very often happens that this
is impossible at certain or at all loads.
As an indication of the difference
which may result it may be well to
consider the B. t. u. cost of auxiliary


TfiR MICHIGAN TECHNIC
power if generated by steam units ex-
hausting to atmosphere or to the main
condensers. This would probably be
between 50,000 and 70,000 B. t. u. per
k. w. hour at the auxiliary shaft. From
these figures it is evident that the elec-
trical method above described is prac-
tically intermediate in heat cost be-
tween the steam method with utiliza-
tion of exhaust and the steam method
without utilization of exhaust.
Ability to absorb in the feed water
all of the heat liberated by steam
driven auxiliaries depends upon the
water rates of the main units, the wa-
ter rates of the auxiliary units, and the
load factor at which the plant oper-
ates. In most plants, the auxiliary
power required does not decrease in
direct proportion with decrease of load
on the main units, often being almost
as great at half load as at full load.
In a plant of this character there will
therefore be an excess of exhaust
steam at fractional loads if the amount
available at full speed is just sufficient
to heat the feed water to the highest
possible temperature. As few plants
operate at load factors higher than 40
to 45% throughout the year, this mat-
ter is one well worth considering.
During the past ten or fifteen years,
the water rates of turbines suitable for
driving the main generators have been
very materially reduced while, as a
general proposition, the water rates of
small units suitable for driving auxil-
iaries have not been reduced at a pro-
portional rate. Moreover, the auxil-
iary power required per k. w. of main
generator capacity has, in many cases,
increased because of the introduction
of new forms of stokers, coal handling
equipment and other apparatus, and
because of the fact that higher
vacuums are now customary and these
involve larger auxiliaries consuming
more power than was previously the
case. As a result of such trends, it
often happens that in modern plants it
would be impossible to absorb in the
feed water all of the heat exhausted
by auxiliary engines if all of the auxil-
iaries were steam driven.
There is also another matter which
is tending to modify the conditions
which determine the method of driving
auxiliaries. In the older plants it was
customary to operate the auxiliary en-
gines exhausting at atmospheric pres-
sure and to attempt to heat the feed
water to a temperature approximately
equal to that of the steam, that is about
2120 F. The heated feed water was
then often pumped through economiz-
ers and heated up to a much higher
temperature before entering the boil-
ers. As economizers return to the
system part of the heat which would
otherwise be lost up the chimney, their
use is considered very desirable, but
their first cost and the increased cost
of draft apparatus which they necessi-
tate by reducing the temperature of
the chimney gases, add capital charges
of such magnitude that it is often un-
economical to use them because the
annual load factor is not high enough.
Various authorities have estimated the
load factor which must prevail in order
value will, of course, vary with the
to justify the use of economizers. This
assumed cost of coal but it is gener-
ally estimated to be between about 30
and 50%.
The cost of economizers is practi-
cally directly proportional to the heat-
ing surface required and the heating
surface required to transmit a given
amount of heat from the flue gases to
the feed water is practically directly
proportional to the mean temperature,
difference between gas and water. As-
sume an economizer receiving water


209
at 2100 F. and raising the temperature
to 3100 F. the mean temperature of
the water may be taken roughly at
(3io+2io)/2=26o° F.
If, however, an economizer could be
supplied with water at a temperature
of about 1300 and heat it to 2300 the
mean temperature of the water would
be roughly (130-f 230)72=180° F.
or 8o° lower than in the previous case.
The mean temperature of the flue
gases passing through the economizer
may be roughly taken as 4500 F. for
an average case. With 2100 feed wa-
ter the mean temperature difference
would therefore be about 450—260=
1900 F. while with 1300 water the
mean temperature difference would be
about 450—180=270° F. The econ-
omizer surface required in the second
case would therefore lie about (190)/
270= 0.70 of that required with 2100
water. The cost would be proportion-
ately smaller and the load factor re-
quired to warrant the installation of
economizers would (herefore be re-
duced.
But feed water heated from, say 70°
F. to 1300, absorbs only about 60 B.
t. u. per pound as against 140 B. t. u.
if heated to 2100 F. The amount of
exhaust steam heat which can be ab-
sorbed in case advantage is to be taken
of a low economizer inlet temperature
is therefore much lower than when a
high inlet temperature is to be used.
In many of the older plants a com-
promise method of operating the auxil-
iaries was chosen in order to balance
the exhaust steam heat available and
the heat which could be absorbed there-
from by the feed water. Some of the
auxiliaries were steam driven, some
electrically driven, and some arranged
in duplicate or with alternative drives.
Correct operation then consisted in
using only sufficient steam driven aux-
iliaries to give the exhaust heat re-
quired by the feed water and in oper-
ating all other auxiliaries electrically.
In this way auxiliary power was made
at a cost approximating 5,000 to 6,000
B. t. u. per k. w. hour to the greatest
extent possible, and all the rest was
purchased at a cost of about 25,000 to
35,000 B. t. u. instead of being ob-
tained at about twice such figures by
exhausting steam driven auxiliaries to
the atmosphere or to the main con-
densers.
Recently, however, many engineers
have questioned these methods and
several better arrangements have been
devised. One of the simplest yet pro-
duced depends upon the fact that the
modern turbine operating against low
back pressure can produce almost as
much power by expanding steam from
atmospheric pressure to condenser
pressure as it can by expanding that
same steam from boiler pressure to
atmospheric. When this principle is
made use of, all of the auxiliaries may,
if desired, be steam driven. Those
which are farthest from the main units
exhaust to feed water heaters, and
those which are nearest to the main
units can either exhaust to the feed
water heaters or to the lower stages of
the main unit as necessary. The choice
of path, so to speak, is determined by
the demand of the feed water for ex-
haust heat; this is supplied first and all
excess steam passes to the main tur-
bine at a pressure near that of the
atmosphere.
In this way, what may be called ex-
cess auxiliary power is obtained by the
use of steam which later produces
some of the power supplied by the
main unit and the cost of auxiliary
power on a B. t. u. basis should be
credited with the main power gener-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
ated from the exhausted auxiliary
steam.
If it be assumed that the main unit
is capable of producing a k. w. hour
at a cost of about 25,000 B. t. u. in
coal, the steam made with 25,000 B. t.
u. contained in coal and then passed
through an auxiliary engine on its way
to the low pressure stages of the main
unit, can produce something less than
l/z k. w. hour of energy in the main
unit. This figure may be taken at
about 0.4 k. w. hour for the average
case. A quantity of heat equal to 0.4
x25,ooo, or 10,000 B. t. u. should
therefore be credited to the auxiliary
engine for every 25,000 B. t. u. used
in coal for producing the steam enter-
ing the auxiliary engine for the gener-
ation of what has been called excess
auxiliary power.
If the auxiliary engine happens to
be one which can produce a k. w.
hour of energy at its shaft for about
45,000 B. t. u. in coal fired, the credit
due it on the assumptions previously
made will be (45,000)/25,ooo x 10,000
=1,800 B. t. u. making the net cost
of excess auxiliary power 4,500—1,800
=27,000 B. t. u. per k. w. hour, or
practically the same as though it had
been obtained electrically from the
main unit. With more economical
auxiliary engines the thermal result
would be more in favor of this meth-
od; with less economical auxiliary en-
gines, it would be less favorable. In
pose of arriving at a decision in a real
making such a comparison for the pur-
case, it is, however, necessary to take
account of other considerations be-
sides those of a purely thermal char-
acter, and in this connection it should
be noted that this method may be
made to give exactly the required
amount of exhaust steam at all times,
and moreover, that the control may be
made entirely automatic if desired.
It should also be noted that the
lower the temperature to which the
feed water is heated the greater will
be the amount of exhaust steam turned
into the main unit, and therefore, the
greater will be the amount of power
purchased at a cost approximately
equal to or greater than that pertaining
when the auxiliaries are electrically
driven from the main unit.
Another method which is practically
the reverse of that just described may
now be considered. All of the auxil-
iaries may be electrically driven with
power derived from the main unit and
steam for feed water heating may be
bled from the turbine at approximately
atmospheric pressure for heating the
feed water. At first sight this seems
very uneconomical and as though all
auxiliary power would be produced at
a cost of the order of 25,000 B. t. u.
in coal, but this is really not the case.
All of the steam exhausted is really
used in just the same way as in the
case of steam driven auxiliaries. It is
robbed of part of its heat to supply
radiation and friction losses and part
of it is converted into electrical
energy; the rest is exhausted to the
feed water heater. Practically, there-
fore, auxiliary power is generated at
a cost approximately 5,000 B. t. u. per
k. w. hour up to the capacity of the
feed water to absorb heat. Above
that point, the cost is in the neighbor-
hood of 25,000 1!. t. u. per k. w. hour.
This method then is thermally prac-
tically equal to that last described if
very economical auxiliary engines are
used with the latter method.
A third method which is just coming
into use may be described as a further
development of the scheme of bleed-
ing the heating steam from the main


211
unit. In this case all of the auxiliaries
are also electrically driven, but the
power is not derived from the main
generator. Instead, a small auxiliary
generator is installed for supplying
auxiliary power. In large stations this
unit may be of such capacity that its
water rate compares very favorably
with that of the main unit under sim-
ilar conditions being, say, 40% to 60%
greater instead of several times greater
as in the case of small steam units as
used for driving auxiliaries. The steam
from the turbine driving the auxiliary
generator is all exhausted to an open
feed water heater in which it heats the
feed water. The steam supply is made
to fit the demand of the feed water
by making the feed water heater in the
form of a jet condenser and varying
the pressure carried therein, thus vary-
ing the quantity of steam exhausted by
the auxiliary unit at any load which it
happens to be carrying.
Under all conditions under which
the auxiliary generator can supply
power and not make more exhaust
steam than can be utilized by the feed
water, the auxiliary power will cost
the same as in the case of steam driven
auxiliaries with exhaust used for feed
water heating. If very light loads on
the main unit produce so little feed
water that the auxiliary generator
would give too much exhaust if sup-
plying all of the auxiliary power, some
of the auxiliaries can be thrown over
on the main unit and operated at costs
similar to thos; previously considered.
It is characteristic of this method
that the feed water temperature will
be low at low loads on the main unit
and high at high loads because of the
necessity of varying the vacuum to
suit the quantity of exhaust required
by the feed water being supplied.
Various combinations of all of these
methods and of others of similar char-
acter may be used in any one plant
for the purpose of getting the most
desirabh operating conditions. In
making a choice it is necessary to con-
sider not only the thermal advantages
of any one method or combination, but
also the first and maintenance costs,
the reliability and the operating con-
venience.


DUSTRY IN GERMANY AND THE
UNITED STATES*
FRITZ G. MARSTELLER,'16E
The end of the Franco-Prussian
war in the year 1871 saw a united
Germany. No event in the history of
Europe has been of greater signifi-
cance or more far-reaching conse-
quences, than the union of the Ger-
man people toward one national policy.
One of the most important factors
in the scientific and industrial growth
of Germany has been the systematic
development of scientific research and
application of the results achieved to
the practical problems with which the
various industries of the nation, were
confronted. Research work, which so
far had only the character of theoreti-
cal speculations, became an efficient
means and assistance in the solution
of industrial problems. Constant de-
velopments along mechanical, chemi-
cal and electrical lines, became the
objects of concentrated activity.
The theoretical results determined,
as well as the exact and painstaking
methods of arriving at them, formed
from this time on, the financial back-
bone of the fatherland. The habit of
carefully investigating materials and
phenomena,—long cultivated in Ger-
man universities,—had raised an army
of men fit for the purpose. Now, when
these problems of industrial develop-
ment commenced to exert a strong and
dominating influence upon the national
spirit, the nation had at its command
an efficient and competent staff of men

in the "Welt der Technik,"' Berlin. Trans-
lated from the German by the author.
who devoted themselves with enthusi-
asm to the problems in question. Here
may be mentioned, first of all the
"Koeniglich Preussisches Material-
pruefungsamt", which existed with
modest beginnings next to the Engi-
neering School of Berlin and was later
housed in the impressive buildings at
Gross-Lichterfeld, near Berlin. The
history of the growth and the exten-
sion of these buildings represents to
a great extent the history of the devel-
opment of the German industries.
At the beginning of the year 1870,
efforts were made to fit out labora-
tories for the exclusive purpose of ex-
amining and testing all kinds of ma-
terials that enter into construction
work or play a part in the various man-
ufacturing processes. Experiments
along these lines were begun in differ-
ent institutions, as for example, in the
Engineering Schools and in a few of
the greater manufacturing concerns
that were chiefly concerned with the
turning out of building materials. En-
deavors of this sort extended especial-
ly in two directions: the chemical and
mechanical. Experiments were made
which dealt with the stiffness of
beams, the resistance of materials, as
iron, building stones, cement, brick,
etc. Investigations of the chemical
and metallurgical properties of iron
and steel, examinations of all kinds of
goods, and determinations of the
chemical constitution of the soil were
made. In a few years these independ-
ent and separately situated labora-


213
tories were organized through a com-
mission appointed for this purpose and
were known under the name of "Me-
chanic-technical experimental labora-
tories" (Mechanisch-technische Ver-
suchsanstalt).
In the year 1884, this institution was
moved to a modest building adjoining
the famous Engineering School at
Charlottenburg, near Berlin, and it
was from this period on that its great
national meaning commenced to es-
tablish a reputation that today reaches
far beyond the boundaries of the Ger-
man empire. The institution pursues
two very definite objects: first, it gives
efficient and extensive instruction to
the student; and secondly, it aims to
be of permanent value to the industries
of the country. The beginning formed
an exhaustive study of the mechanical
properties of the metals. As time went
on, new departments were added such
as those for the study of paper, oil,
cement, textiles, etc. In the same man-
ner the chemical department of the in-
stitution was enlarged and became
more and more specialized in propor-
tion to the steady growth of this in-
dustry.
In view of the preceding discussion
it might prove of interest to compare
our American institutions and labora-
tories with those of Germany. There
hardly passes a day in these United
States when some inventor or manu-
facturer does not knock at the door of
a scientific school or one of the great
laboratories in order to find there the
needed advice or assistance in the so-
lution of his problem. What may he
expect? He is told in a kindly but
nevertheless determined sort of a way
that this or that laboratory was not
erected to help persons not immedi-
ately connected with the institution.
When he then asks where he can find
the assistance of a specialist, he is
given to understand that he must seek
for one in vain unless he is in a posi-
tion to pay the "'adequate" fees in-
volved. If he is a man of means, all
that is left for him to do is to engage
a competent person in his plant, train
him to the run of things, and even
then he may expect only meager re-
sults. To my mind, it seems absolute-
ly essential that we,—the greatest of
all industrial nations,—should have
state or government laboratories that
are erected with the special aim of giv-
ing the farmer, the building contractor,
the mechanic, and, most important of
all, the intelligent inventor, all the as-
sistance that it is possible to give. The
most practical, the most important, as
well as the most useful inventions that
the world has ever seen have been due
to American ingenuity. One may
think, for example, only of the tele-
graph, the phonograph, the incandes-
cent lamp, the sewing machine, the
typewriter and the linotype machine
Undoubtedly, had those inventors had
the necessary assistance, the realiza-
tion of their ideas would have been ac-
celerated, others would have been en-
couraged and considerable more could
perhaps have been accomplished. We
must have these laboratories to tell the
unknowing that his invention is entire-
ly impracticable, to tell another that his
idea has been tried out long ago, and
to assist the man with promising plans
in every way. It is just exactly this
that has been offered to the German in-
ventor, farmer, manufacturer and bus-
iness man for decades.
The system of the German govern-
ment places the unlimited service of
science at the disposal of the indus-
tries. The United States of America
has in the German method a fine illus-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
trative example which deserves full
recognition and imitation on a still
more extensive scale. Of course, we
have here already established by the
government in each state, a "Station of
Experimental Research", which how-
ever, serves chiefly the purpose of giv-
ing instructions in sericulture, me-
chanical lines and certain classes of
experimentation. A conception of
such an institution fails to convey the
impression of the kind that I have
sought to expound above, since it is
almost entirely in the form of a school
and is open to the general public only
in a negligible way.
In a not too distant future there will
be wars waged, but these will be of a
different kind from those we are fa-
miliar with at the present time. Each
nation in the game will try to beat the
other with the same passionate efforts
that characterize our present strug-
gles; and yet, they will not be decided
by the might of arms nor by the
strategy and cunning wit of great gen-
erals. It will be a relentless war of
competition between the industrial na-
tions of the world, each one seeking
to establish a commercial supremacy
of the globe. The nation having the
best chance to win will not be the one
having the heaviest artillery; it will be
the one that placed its national asset
in the greatest number of well-trained
and far-sighted engineers.


A. C. SIMONS, '16 E
If the engineer in charge of a grow-
ing office has any appreciation of
the unpleasantness accompanying a
change from an old outgrown filing
system, he will take care that one
which will not soon need revision is
instituted at the outset. It is believed
that the following method can be so
arranged that it will take care of any
amount of expansion and perform the
function which any satisfactory sys-
tem must, at small expense and labor.
It is based on the decimal system and
is, with modification, suited to the par-
ticular requirements of many large of-
fices.
It may best be illustrated by de-
scribing how the system was adapted
to the requirements of a certain office
where many tracings were made.
Drawings, if kept, were filed with the
tracing. Only blueprints showing in-
formation not on tracings were filed.
There was considerable correspond-
ence, computations, sketches, survey-
ing notes, etc., to be filed and made
readily accessible.
Two styles of filing cases, vertical
and horizontal, of 10 drawers each,
were used. The former to take letter
size, 8V2" x n", the latter with draw-
ers 36" x 54" inside and 4" deep.
These drawers were subdivided into
compartments one inch larger than
the size of the drawings to be placed
therein. One hundred tracings were
filed in a compartment with the high-
est number on top.
In the lower right hand corner of
every tracing, outside the border line,
three items were printed, the drawing
number and the words "copy num-
ber" and "date." These were each
followed by an inked-in rectangle giv-
ing a white space on the blueprints in
which the data indicated could be en-
tered in ink at the time of printing.
This in conjunction with the numeri-
cal index cards gives a means of keep-
ing a record of blueprints leaving the
office.
The following ten sizes were de-
cided upon as standard:
No.o 854" xii".
No. 1 8/2"xn".
No. 2 n"x 17".
No. 3 17" x 22".
No. 4 22" x 30".
No. 5 27" x 40".
No. 6 3i"x53".
No. 7 as found advisable later.
No. 8 rolled in paper tubes 24" long.
No. 9 rolled in paper tubes 36" long.
Miscellaneous blueprints, computa-
tions, notebooks, correspondence, etc.,
may be folded and placed between
separators in the vertical files. Fold-
ers or envelopes may be used to ad-
vantage here.
Numbers 1 to 7 inclusive had a
border one-half inch from the edge
and were used to designate tracings
filed flat. Numbers 8 and 9 took care
of profiles and odd sizes which came
into the office.
The decimal system, consists essen-
tially of figures in a definite relation
to the decimal point having some pre-
determined significance. In the in-
stance cited it was desired to have the
number show four classes of informa-
tion, viz: the numerical drawing
number, the kind of work the drawing
or data contained, the location of the
drawing in the filing cases, and its


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
size. Thus 314.5413 would indicate
drawing number 314 which would be
found in case five, drawer four, and
would be size 1 (8]/"xii") and
would belong to whatever class of
drawings indicated by number three.
After locating the proper drawer the
tracing would be the 14th from the
bottom in compartment marked 301
to 400, these being the numbers of the
drawings, all of size one, filed or to be
filed in this compartment. It can then
be easily located by turning up the
lower right hand corner containing
the number.
Alphabetical and numerical cards,
suitably ruled, are kept, the former
3" x 5" and the latter 6" x 7".
The alphabetical cards gave the
main subject at the top with subdivis-
ions underneath, each followed by its
corresponding number. Care was tak-
en to list each drawing under every
heading that might occur to one look-
ing for it.
The numerical cards showed the
number in the upper right hand cor-
ner. The subject was entered across
the top of the card followed by a de-
scription of the drawing filed, togeth-
er with any other data in regard to re-
lated drawings, computations, corre-
spondence, etc. The remainder of the
card contained columns where copy
number, date printed, description,
date, and any remarks in regard to
blueprint copies of the tracing might
be entered. It is important that these
cards be properly made out hence it is
necessary that someone thoroughly
conversant with the office work have
charge of them.
With this system anyone conversant
with the system and knowing the
number of a drawing may locate it
immediately, or knowing its title may
speedily find its number or the other
information on the numerical card.
Material removed from the file is not
returned but placed in a convenient
receptacle. As only one person is
charged with the duty of returning
material to place after being removed,
the files are kept in order and the
time of the higher paid men is not oc-
cupied in so doing. Two cases, one of
each kind, occupying about 30 sq. ft.
of floor space, will take care of about
3,000 items. As the quantity of ma-
terial increases, it is only necessary to
add more filing cases.

Will the Michigan Union Fund
Reach the Million Mark?
At the time that The Technic goes
to press, one of the greatest campaigns
in the history of the University is in
progress.
During the past month over 2000
loyal supporters of Michigan's democ-
racy went before 35,000 Alumni and
asked a million dollars to build, equip
and endow a 650,000 dollar building
as a new home for the University of
Michigan Union. At the present time,
but $500,000 of this amount has been
raised.
The fact that this sum is no larger
is not because the Union lacks the
support of the student body, since out
of five thousand men students, over
three thousand have contributed to the
fund through their memberships. It
is not with the cause itself. This is
only too well signified in the words of
President Emeritus James B. Angell,
when he says, "The Union is needed
at Ann Arbor to carry on the work of
preparing our young men in a practi-
cal manner for useful careers in busi-
ness and society."
It has been decided to extend the
time of closing the campaign thirty
days longer to give the committee men
who are working throughout the civil-
ized world, an opportunity to cover
their territory more thoroughly, and
it is hoped that this extension of time
will greatly increase the Union budget.
Let's go, Michigan Alumni.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
HOW ABOUT SPANISH?
The increasing value of Spanish to
the engineer is a subject that is de-
serving of considerable attention by
our undergraduates. Since the Euro-
pean war commenced, European com-
merce with South America has been
practically at a standstill. The United
States should have the inside track on
this business and would have if we
were better prepared to go after it.
One of our Alumni in a letter to Sec-
retary Bird told of a trip he made a
short time ago to one of the South
American countries. On the boat
there were several representatives of
European business houses not one of
whom had the slightest knowledge of
the Spanish language; yet they were
going after the business and were, no
doubt, getting it.
It is obvious that, with South Amer-
ica so close, our trade relations with
the Latin countries should be of im-
mense importance. American busi-
ness houses have awakened to this
since the war broke out and trade has
increased wonderfully. However, it
remains for us to prepare ourselves so
that we will be in a position to help
and to share after we graduate.
During the past ten years there
have been an average of 39 men en-
rolled in Spanish 1 and 30 in Spanish
2 per semester. This is such a small
percentage that it seems ridiculous.
This year for both semesters 100 were
enrolled in course 1 and 75 in course
2. It is said that Spanish is the easiest
language to learn. Why hasn't that
fact become generally known in these
"Halls of Learning?"
Dean C. H. Benjamin of Purdue
said, in a recent article, that Spanish
is as important to the engineer as Ger-
man and French. There is practically
no technical literature in Spanish but
its value lies in its usefulness for
South American trade. He also said
that Europe controls the Eastern trade
so well that South America is really
the only field left open for us. We
should think this over a little before
making our elections hereafter.
REGISTER OF ALUMNI.
At the April meeting of the board
of regents the following resolution
was adopted:
Resolved, That after 1915 the An-
nouncement of the Colleges of Engi-
neering and Architecture shall con-
tain the history of only those alumni
who have graduated since the last pub-
lication of the announcement, togeth-
er with such changes among other
alumni of the Colleges of Engineering
and Architecture as have occurred
since the last Announcement.
It has been the custom in past years
for the Secretary to send a circular
letter to all of the alumni of the Col-
leges of Engineering and Architecture
asking for any changes in their work
or address. In the letters sent out for
compiling this year's Register of
Alumni appeared the following: "The
regents are thinking of cutting out the
Register of Alumni. What do you
think about it?"
In their replies the alumni indicated
a strong interest in the Register and
were unanimous in demanding its con-
tinuance, either in its present or in a
modified form.
The register as it stands is the only
directory of our alumni available. It
is directly valuable to employers of
engineers in looking up a man's ex-
perience. It enables the alumni to
keep closer in touch with each other.
It is so valuable in this respect that
one alumnus in his letter says, "I do
not believe that even the Michigan


219
Union offers a stronger 'tie that binds'
than this annual register."
The Regents object to the cost of
printing the present Register and in
the future intend to print only "the
history of * * * those alumni that
have graduated since the last * * *
Announcement, together with the
changes." This means simply this,
that, in four or five years, the busy
engineer must look through four or
five Announcements to get the infor-
mation which under the present sys-
tem he could get from the last one.
A better plan than the present one
is suggested in the letters of several of
the alumni. Their idea is to print
separately the Announcement and the
Register because, it is pointed out, the
alumnus cares little for the Announce-
ment and the student little for the
Register. This plan ought to be con-
sidered by the Regents before their
present resolution can take effect.
Dean Cooley says he will ask the
Regents to reconsider. We think that
he voices the sentiment of the whole
body of our alumni and urge that their
resolution he speedily remedied.
SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY.
The tendency toward a greater co-
operation between scientific institu-
tions and manufacturing industries is
becoming more apparent each year.
The belief is now generally prevalent
that the facilities and knowledge of
the staff of these institutions should
be utilized by commercial interests
wherever possible. In accordance
with this policy the University of
Michigan places at the disposal of the
people of the state the facilities of its
various departments. With very little
cost, the various research departments
are able to render an invaluable ser-
vice to the industries and general pub-
lic, who are, after all, its main sup-
port. This policy, however, has been
in practice but a short time as com-
pared with systems in operation in the
Old World countries. There the need
of co-operation between scientific re-
search and industry has been longer
realized. An interesting comparison
of these relationships is discussed by
Mr. Fritz G. Marsteller, '16E, in this
issue.
Mr. Tinkham's notes on "Riparian
Rights," published elsewhere in this
issue, are the subject of a discussion
by Professor C. T. Johnston which
will be published in the December
Technic. In a letter to the Editor,
Mr. Tinkham said of this discussion:
"I am pleased that Professor Johns-
ton has taken an interest in the paper
to the extent of preparing a discussion
and I shall appreciate the publication
of his discussion in connection with
my notes. I agree with Professor
Johnston that engineers generally
should interest themselves more in
this subject which is a vital one to the
commonwealth. My own keen inter-
est in the matter dates from my stu-
dent days and was inspired by Profes-
sor Davis whose appreciative refer-
ences at that time to Professor Johns-
ton's work confirmed the singleness
of thought of these two men."
The subject of Riparian Rights is
one that every engineer, not alone
civils. should be conversant with.
Read Mr. Tinkham's article and then
read Professor Johnston's discussion
in the December Technic.
The Technic staff wishes to ex-
plain the delay in the publication of
this issue. Besides the handicap of a
changed personnel of staff, we were
delayed at the printer's due to the un-
usually heavy volume of work incident
to the opening of the college year.


THE TWO-SEMESTER COURSE IN
DESCRIPTIVE GEOMETRY
In the fall of 1914 the Department of
Descriptive Geometry and Drawing in the
College of Engineering put into practice
a plan which had been devised during the
preceding year and Which, it was thought,
would improve the teaching of the course
in descriptive geometry.
Previous to this time the work had been
given as a four-hour course in one semes-
ter, but under the new scheme it was di-
vided into two two-hour courses to extend
over both semesters. The results have
justified the change.
It can hardly be denied that descriptive
geometry is one of the most important
freshman courses in the College of Engi-
neering. No other course presents such
fine opportunities for developing in the im-
mature student the qualities of accuracy,
industry and ingenuity which are of so
great importance for the successful pur-
suit of engineering study and practice.
The work of this course calls for consid-
erable time in the drawing room, where
the student is under the direct observation
of the instructor and can be given first-
hand aid in overcoming the evil habits of
carelessness and indolence. The problems
assigned for solution at home and in the
drawing room are such as to call forth the
ingenuity and logical reasoning of the stu-
dent, and it is possible to introduce an ele-
ment of practical engineering which stim-
ulates the interest of the majority.
One who has not had the experience can
scarcely realize the difficulties involved in
teaching the young student to "take pains,"
when, in his early training, this feature has
been neglected. To successfully train the
student to be careful and accurate, it is
necessary to be very strict about giving a
mark of approval. Work must be rejected
time after time until it is satisfactory in
every detail. The result has been that a
great many required a full semester to ac-
quire the ability to execute the more fun-
damental operations of thought and ex-
pression in a satisfactory manner, and, of
course, had not mastered the more intricate
and puzzling exercises. Under the one-
semester scheme these students lost four
hours' credit, which was always very dis-
couraging to them, and while they were
able to repeat the course with less difficulty,
it was not considered the most economical
use possible of their time.
By dividing the course between two se-
mesters, the first can be devoted to acquir-
ing accuracy, thoroughness and speed and
mastering the fundamental principles of the
theory of the subject, and the second to
the application of these principles to the
more intricate point, line and plane prob-
lems and to surfaces, intersections, devel-
opments, etc. A failure to reach the re-
quired standard in the first semester's work
means the loss of only two hours' credit,
and the student has no difficulty in seeing
just what his shortcomings were.
On the whole, the new system seems to
be working in a very satisfactory manner
both for students and instructors, and it is
believed that it will make it possible to
train the freshmen a little better for their
later work.
CHANGES IN THE MECHANICAL
LABORATORY
Owing to crowded conditions in the Me-
chanical Laboratory, some of the least used
machinery has been moved out into the
court between the Mechanical and Elec-
trical Laboratories, where it will be stored
until more space can be secured. It is
hoped that the old power-house can soon
be utilized as an extension to the Labora-
tory.
The machines that have been moved out
are the Armington &amp; Simms steam engine,
the vertical compound marine engine,
formerly used to drive the large centrifugal


221
pump, and the large water-wheel governor,
presented to the Laboratory some years ago
by one of the Niagara power companies.
In addition to these, there is a Laidlaw-
Dunn-Gordon compound steam flywheel
pump, presented by the Detroit Edison Co.
last year. This unit will make an excellent
piece of apparatus when room can be found
for its installation.
When the Engineering Shops changed
over to electric power last summer, the old
Corliss engine, which provided their power
for so many years, was given to the Me-
chanical Engineering Department. This
engine is about to b; temporarily installed
in the Laboratory, and will serve to illus-
trate the Corliss principle to the students
taking the regular laboratory courses.
The Laboratory has recently acquired a
new steam flow meter of the General Elec-
tric type. This meter has been installed
in the steam lines of the DeLaval and Cur-
tis turbines.
THE FRESHMAN.
BY F. K. HIRTH, 'l6E.
"After the shower comes the sun." At
least so goes the old war-cry of the opti-
mist. But the Freshman was in no mood
to appreciate this valuable bit of cheering
philosophy. The soggy days of a dismal,
rainy, week in a strange town had crowded
out the last grain of stiffening from his
usually perky backbone.
So he sat, a mournful bundle of mel-
ancholy, upon the scarcely dry end of the
bench which some well meaning blunderer
had set along the diagonal walk for the
tantalization of the tired, but ignorant
stranger. His back tormented by a grimly
uncompromising iron rail, he fumbled dole-
fully at his watch fob. With this talisman
he had hoped to impress upon these strang-
ers the value of his athletic powers. Truly,
a wonderful slab of jewelry was this; al-
most as large as the ridiculous gray cap
which joggled about on his carefully cut
pompadour. Across its gilded face scur-
ried the hopelessly perfect form of a naked
athlete, running constantly without the
slightest apparent fatigue. On the back his
favored friends could be proudly shown
that it had been awarded for winning place
in some meeting of "prep" school valiants.
At home it had been his most cherished
possession, to be removed from its chamois
case only on state occasions for the edifi-
cation of hair-ribboned girls and knicker-
bockered imitators. But now it had been
dangled in the public gaze for one whole
week without the slightest comment,—if
one expects the insulting remarks of the
low-bred Sophomores met at mealtime.
So, as the sun crept from its dingy cloud
blanket, he felt an increasing sense of
strangeness, wishing vacantly for some-
thing, anything, to make him feel his ac-
customed cocky self. In this mood it was
with a mixed feeling of relief and timidity
that he noticed the arrival of a most ordi-
nary appearing chap who seemed inclined
to share with him the doubtful comfort of
the well-hacked bench. At first sight he
seemed to be another suffering newcomer,
but the skimpy cap which gave the impres-
sion was blue, not gray. Another look con-
firmed the doubt, for spread across the
blue were the numerals of an upper class.
Strange, that one of supposedly superior
wisdom should consent to wear such a
badge of indignity! Still, on a second look,
it wasn't quite so bad. In fact, the Fresh-
man secretly resolved to buy one imme-
diately. The gaudy numbers were fully as
distinct as the shocking shade of his own
headgear, and he felt that the companion-
ship of these older sages in the wearing
would quite remove the sting of his hum-
ble distinction.
Besides,—but his strange seatmate was
speaking, and wonder of wonders, he
chose to mention athletics.—Yes, surely the
younger was interested.—And did he in-
tend to try for an M?—Certainly! and how
were the chances this year —What, not
this year, why, back in , Oh, yes, it
might be different here, and it was a good
thing to keep in training.—Yes he would.
A few more words and his pleasant
friend was gone. No, not quite, for, turn-
ing he threw back one last remark.
"Fresh," he called, "I might suggest that
even on an athlete a plain brass M makes
a very good watch fob. So long."


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Professor James P. Bird, for many years
secretary of the Colleges of Engineering
and Architecture and professor of romance
languages, has left the university and is
now holding the position of professor of
romance languages at Carleton College,
Northlield, Minn. He assumed his duties,
which are entirely in the academic field, at
the beginning of the 1915-16 college year.
Carleton College is a non-sectarian insti-
tution with an enrollment of about 500.
Louis Allen Hopkins, instructor in math-
ematics, has been appointed secretary of
the Colleges of Engineering and Archi-
tecture to succeed Mr. Bird.
The rank of Mrs. C. B. Green has been
raised to that of assistant secretary.
At the end of the last school year, Mr.
H. R. Lloyd resigned his position as in-
structor in the Mechanical Engineering De-
partment, to return to England to accept
the post of employment manager with the
Hans Reynolds Co. of Manchester, now
engaged in the manufacture of war mate-
rials.
Professor J. A. Bursley comes back to
the University of Michigan this year after
a two years' absence in the East, where he
has been devoting his time to a study of
factory management and efficiency.
Professor H. C. Anderson has secured a
further leave of absence from the Uni-
versity for this year, to continue his work
011 the appraisal of large corporation prop-
erties. He is at present engaged on elec-
tric railway work in New Jersey, and on
the Beil telephone system of Washington,
D. C. His headquarters are in Newark,
N.J.
Probably no summer has seen as many
Professors and University men engaged in
active engineering practice. The Edison
Appraisal being made by Dean Cooley no
doubt was the largest of these.
The following men, besides about one
hundred undergraduates and graduates
were responsible for the work accom-
plished: Prof. Riggs, Prof. Gram, Com-
mander Rowan, Prof. Verner, Prof. Fes-
senden, Prof. Lovell, Mr. Bringhurst, Prof.
Merrick, Mr. McKavanaugh, Mr. Wisler,
Mr. Wines, Mr. Harmon, Prof. Patterson,
Mr. Cissel.
There was a meeting of the Board of
Directors of the Michigan Engineering So-
ciety in the Engineering Society's Rooms,
212-214 New Engineering Building, Satur-
day, October 23, 1915, at 10 o'clock. The
meeting was called to maka preparation for
the convention to be held at Grand Rapids.
January 18, 19 and 20, 1916.
The directors are D. E. Teed, '05E, pres-
ident; G. W. Bissell, vice-president; S. J.
Hoexter, secretary and treasurer; E. D.
Rich, T. O. Williams, and L. C. Smith.
The Michigan Band has been again or-
ganized under the supervision of Mr. S. J.
Hoexter. Fifty men were chosen at the
first tryout and this season promises to be
even more successful than the last.
Engineers are taking a lively interest in
the band and. at present, they outnumber
the members from the Literary College.
This is due. in a measure, to the Fresh-
man orchestra, organized last year under
the leadership of Hoyne Howe, '18E. The
orchestra afforded excellent training to
those musically inclined and has furnished
the Band with some good material. It is
hoped that a Freshman orchestra may be
again organized this year.
A 1912 model "B" Wright hydroplane
was presented to the University Aero Club
by Russell Alger of Detroit, president of
the Michigan Aero Club, and Frederick W.
Alger, '18E, of Clarkston. The machine was
shortly after destroyed in a trial flight on
Barton Pond, when it turned turtle while
F. Earl Loudy, '15E, of Hancock, who was
acting as pilot, was sailing 15 feet above
the surface of the pond. It was planned,
however, to repair the machine so that it
would be ready for use this fall.


223
Henry Hess, vice-president of the Amer-
ican Society of Mechanical Engineers, has
established two funds of $1,000 each, to be
known as the Hess Prize Funds. The in-
come from the funds is to be rewarded an-
nually for the best paper by a junior mem-
ber of the Society and by the two enrolled
members of student branches of the So-
ciety who contribute papers on technical
subjects in the field of mechanical engi-
neering. All members of the local student
branch will be eligible to compete for the
prizes.
A wireless chess match, the first ever
played, so far as known, was held between
Michigan and Ohio State last spring. The
play lasted for a period of several days,
with the final result of a draw when the
match was called.
"Rosey" Rowe pulled one of his intra-
mural stunts in Detroit during the sum-
mer in the form of a baseball game. The
Michigan Boys working on Dean Cooley's
appraisal of the Edison Company's assets
gave the Edison team such a decisive beat-
ing that they did not even ask for a return
game. "Rosey," himself, played center
and make some great shoestring catches.
On Friday, August 27, the Detroit Y. M.
C. A. held a "Michigan Night for Michi-
gan grads and undergrads." Among
the notables who sang "Varsity" and the
"Bum Army" were "Tommy" Hughitt,
"Lou" Reiman, "Red" Donnolly, and
"Chuck" Webber. The Edison appraisers
were present in good numbers. This is a
good stunt and ought to be held more
often.
E. M. Brady, who was one of the men
on Dean Cooley's appraisal of the Detroit
Edison Company's assets, was badly in-
jured while doing field work in Royal Oak,
Mich. Brady had climbed a high tension
line pole and accidentally touched a 4,600
volt line. He fell to the ground, eighteen
feet below, and sustained deep contact
burns on the left side and shoulder. At
present he is about recovered and will soon
be back at work. Brady seems to have a
charmed life. Two years ago he and two
friends were walking down the M. C. R. R.
and were struck by an engine. The other
two were killed and Brady escaped with se-
vere injuries.
MECHANICAL
Orifice Measurement
The special work carried on for the last
year in the Mechanical Laboratory on the
use of sharp-edged orifices for the meas-
urement of steam and air has been produc-
tive of some valuable results. This work
was done with sharp-edged orifices placed
between the flanges and flange unions in
pipes. The underlying idea was to obtain
information that would enable an engineer
to measure quantity of steam or air, with
a realtively inexpensive apparatus and the
least amount of trouble in preparation.
Such an apparatus would consist of the
orifice plate and water or mercury U-tube,
or accurate gauge, connected above and
below the orifice for measuring pressure
drop.
A coefficient of discharge was determined
for different sizes of orifices in a given
size of pipe. The equation to be used is
Q=CVA where C is the coefficient of dis-
charge.
The value of C appears to be about .60
for all orifices up to .25 the diameter of
the pipe. Then C becomes larger with rel-
atively larger orifices, but increasing less
rapidly for steam than for air. For ex-
ample, with an orifice .4 the diameter of the
pipe, the value of C for steam is .615, and
for air .68; for an orifice .6 the diameter
of the pipe, C for steam is .69, and for
air .76.
The values of K for Napier's rule for
steam flow, (W = K X ap -H 70,) were also
found for a wide range of pressure differ-
ence.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Furnace Tests
The results from the extensive tests
made on a "Round Oak" hot air furnace
brought out sonic very valuable facts.
The efficiency of these furnaces is quite
high. It was found that of all the heat
supplied in the coal, as much as 75% to
80% is effective in supplying warmth to a
house.
The amount of air pumped by this fur-
nace is surprising, especially when thought
of in weight instead of volume. It was
found that, when running at a moderate
rate, the furnace delivered about 2}i tons
of air per hour, and when forced it easily
delivered 4 tons per hour.
ELECTRICAL
Professor Benjamin F. Bailey spent the
summer vacation at Portland, Ore., with
his family. His new book on continuous
and alternating current theory is expected
off the press this fall.

ENGINEERING NOTES
SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A
SAFETY-FIRST IDEAL.
When Bryson D. Horton, '05E. President
of the Detroit Fuse &amp; Mfg. Company, com-
pleted his studies at the University of
Michigan, he took away with him high
ideals and thoughts for the advancement
of electrical safeguarding. Step by step,
success has met his untiring efforts until
now he is about to place in operation a
$60,000 additon to the present plant, to be
devoted exclusively to the manufacture of
"Square D" Steel Enclosed Switches,—
Safety-First devices patented by him and
approved, for their fire and accident pre-
vention features, by the Underwriters Lab-
oratories.
Mr. Horton's first attempts at bringing
out electrical safety devices were devoted
to enclosed fuses to be used with the old


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
style set screw cutout in place of the dan-
gerous current carrying piece of zinc then
in use. Later when enclosed fuses were
made standard equipment by the Under-
writers Laboratories, a complete line of
positive mechanical indicating fuses was
brought out by Mr. Horton. When placed
on the market they received a remarkably
favorable reception from the users of elec-
trical apparatus.
His next step was directed toward per-
fecting an enclosed switch. He saw that
while motors and like apparatus in the
electrical field were being rapidly improved
and safeguarded, auxiliary electrical equip-
ment was being distanced so far as safety
for the operator was concerned.
ALUMNI NOTES
W. W. Taylor, '93, vice-president and
general manager of the Oriskany Ore &amp;
Iron Corporation of Lynchburg, has come
forward with a line of material we are
glad to get. Read it over for yourself
and see if you cannot send as interesting a
letter to The Technic once in a while.
Here it is:—
The United States is developing in a
manufacturing way faster than in local
consumption. The trend of the times is to
acquire more territory for placing our pro-
ducts. During a recent trip through Ja-
maica, Cuba, Costa Rica and the Canal
Zone, I was brought into contact with a
large number of English and German En-
gineers en route to various South Ameri-
can ports. These young fellows were sent
out by their houses as permanent agents
in those southern countries. Those on the
steamer going south spent most of their
time droning Spanish verbs and phrases;
none of them seemed to be equipped with
the Spanish language. An American En-
gineer, with an American's initiative armed
with a good fundamental knowledge of
Spanish, ought to be able to cut a wide
swath. He would have the advantage over
an engineer of any other nationality.
Some day this "watchful waiting" game
The first enclosed switch was built into
a cast iron box and could be operated with
positive safety from the outside by a han-
dle. The device was at once approved by
the Underwriters' Laboratories. In 1912
the first addition to the building erected
in 1009 was made to satisfy the demands
for these safety devices. Now the second
addition, with 35,000 sqoare feet of floor
space, is about completed.
President Horton's college ideal for the
safeguarding of humanity was based on
sound reasoning. The results of his abil-
ity to foresee and provide for the preven-
tion of fire and accidents from electrical
installations prove that his work has not
been in vain.
will get tired of waiting, and Mexico is
going to drop into our lap in the same way
the Philippines did. Haiti, another Span-
ish negro republic, will be cleaned up and
developed by American engineers.
Before long we are going to have a big
merchant marine. The countries reached
will have to be civilized and developed;
American Engineers will play the big part.
In the past most of the engineers graduat-
ing from Michigan have remained in De-
troit or Chicago; they have overdeveloped
that country. Very few locate in the
south, practically none in the tropics. Be-
fore I went to Panama, I called up Earl
Babst in New York, and asked him to give
me some of the names of our fellows in
the Canal Zone, his clerk looked up in the
files and couldn't find a single one.
Therefore: I suggest that all Michigan
Men become proficient in Spanish while in
school and let those of adventurous spirit
get a good round sanitary course under
Dr. Vaughan, and the University of Mich-
igan will stay in the lead with other Amer-
ican Universities.
Otto Klotz, '72, Astronomer for the Do-
minion of Canada, is one of The Tech-
nic's most ardent supporters. Our com-


227
munications from him are very encourag-
ing and find ready space in the Alumni
Notes. As you read this think hard wheth-
er you cannot help The Technic by send-
ing us an occasional bit of news about
yourself or some other Michigan Engineer.
Here are extracts from two of Mr.
Klotz's letters:—
"I am still young and don't comb my
hair with a towel yet." And,—"The Tech-
nic has greatly improved and is now a
credit to our Alma Mater and more par-
ticularly to the Engineering College. It
deserves the support of every Engineering
Alumnus."
The Chicago Alumni had another
"Whoops 'er Up" Dinner recently and
among their most brilliant entertainers
were Mr. E. C. De Wolfe of '94, who ex-
hibited an "intelligent" mechanical doll
and Mr. James R. Bibbins, '99, who sang
numerous compositions of old classmates
to the encores of the cheering grads.

BACK TO THE LAND
James N. Hatch, '92E.
Back to the land, is the hue and cry,
To the verdant fields 'neath the open sky,
Away from the toil and worry and strife
And the endless turmoil of city life,
From the ceaseless wrangle and fight for gain,
And the cry of want and the moan of pain,
To the broad, broad fields and the sparkling streams
That have formed the source of the poet's dreams.
I'll journey away from the city's mart
To a sheltered spot near Nature's heart,
Where the singing birds and droning bees
Will attune my heart to their melodies,
And the distant mountain with its snowy crest
Shall brood o'er all like a sainted guest;
And I'll think no more of the cruel world's pride
In my little home by the mountain side.
I have heard the call of the waiting soil,
And I chafed at the leash of indoor toil;
I sighed as I gazed out into the night
O'er the turbid cauldron of livid light,
Where the ebb and flow of the human tide
Leaves a wanton wreckage on every side,
For the Angel of Peace could never stay
In the blazon glamour of that nightless day.
Thus I heard the message and gave it heed,
I would follow on where the way should lead;
Why be confined to an oaken door.
To a few square feet of office floor?
Why turn away from the proffered hand
, And the sun-kissed smile of the virgin land,
And toil and worry and fret and fear
In a smoke-polluted atmosphere?
The prospect was fair that my fancy revealed,
Of the pure, open air and the bright, verdant field.
In my day-dream the country showed wondrously bright.
But the vision was changed in my real dreams that night:
I dreamed of the orchard and meadow and lea,
Of the mild browsing cattle and low humming hee,
But the action and grouping in my nocturnal view,
As a pastoral picture, was sadly askew.


I had chosen a home, as revealed in my dream,
In the great arid West near an unnatural stream;
1 had gone far away from the tall office towers
To the broad, open country with orchards and flowers;
But the peace and contentment my vision had seen
Was still farther beyond with a great gulf between,
For I was discouraged and worried and worn
With a new class of troubles to those 1 had borne.
•
The bees and the birds and the fragrant new hay
Seemed to gain in their charms with their distance away,
And even the sun grew remiss in its cheer
When it shown on eternal every day in the year.
I dreamed 'twas the Sabbath, the great day of rest,
When our hearts all transcendent catch gleams of the blest,
But high thoughts and holy seemed crowded away
By the groveling material things of the day.
My cattle, I found, had got out that morn, v
And been browsing all day on my next neighbor's corn,
And the language that neighbor had just used to mc
Would never sound well in refined poetry;
While the bees from Bill Piper's, just over the way,
Having tired of sweet clover and alfalfa hay,
Had come in by the million to my grape-drying floor
For a few tons of honey for their next winter's store.
In the orchard the birdies had long ceased to sing;
They were hanging head down as they had been since spring,
For I'd shot them and hung them and caused them to die
In a vain hope of saving just one cherry pie;
While the apples which proved on the market a drug
Spread over the ground like a great Turkish rug;
E'en the pigs seemed to know that apples were low,
For they ate just the finest and let the rest go.
The breeze from the desert was parching and dry,
With the sun beating down from a bottle-blue sky;
While the harsh voice of Nature, it seemed to me, said,
"By the sweat of his face shall man eat his bread."
All prospects discordant, hope seemed but a snare,
I was nearing the castle of Giant Despair
When, in nailing the fence which my cattle had broke,
I pounded my finger, and then I awoke.


1 saw in a moment 'twas only a dream,
For the street lights shown in with a bright, cheerful gleam.
Displacing the shadows of impending gloom
By the friendly old objects arranged round my room;
But an impress was made that for many a year
Will show in the course of my future career,
For I found that contentment and permanent ease
Do not bud on bushes nor ripen on trees.
So I have decided, as I think of it more,
That a good place to farm's on the seventeenth floor,
With a pen for a plow and a fancy inkstand
To furnish the ditches to -moisten the land,
With a soft, green rug for a grassy plat,
And a climate controlled by a thermostat.
Where, in summer or winter, with drought or with rain.
One can alwajs show figures that represent gain.
Back to the land you may go if you will.
With its flower-flecked meadow and low, wooded hill;
Where the little brook sings as it rushes by,
And the stars gleam bright from an untarnished sky.
But all of these things will ne'er make you glad
If your heart is discordant and your temper is bad;
While the smoke and the noise and the turmoil and tight
Will make little change in a heart that is light.

ING A REASONABLE RATE OF RETURN
FOR PUBLIC UTILITIES
BY DAVID FRIDAY
Professor of Political Economy, University of Michigan
From the standpoint of the investors
in a public utility company, reason-
able rates must cover:
(a) Cost of labor and material
currently consumed in oper-
ating and maintaining the
property;
(b) Taxes and insurance;
(c) Depreciation reserve to keep
the investment intact;
(d) A rate of return on the invest-
ment large enough (i) to
reimburse the investors for
the use of their capital and
for the risks undergone by
them, and (2) to furnish an
inducement to provide a high
degree of managerial effi-
ciency.
The part of this presentation which
calls for further and special discussion
is the proper rate of return on capital
as described in (d). It is universally
admitted that rates must cover Oper-
ating Expenses, including Taxes and
Depreciation. It is also recognized
that in a competitive industrial order
such as ours, in which every individual
is free to invest his capital in any
industry he chooses, the rates must be
sufficient to allow a return on the in-
vestor's capital.
In order to insure a proper supply
of capital for public utility industries
this return must be as high as the
investor could procure in other busi-
ness involving a like degree of risk.
If the return were lower, capital would
be invested in private enterprise to a
disproportionate degree and the less
important want for the services ren-
dered by the private industry would
be satisfied at the expense of the more
important want for services supplied
by public utilities, all of which would
be to the disadvantage of the public.
For capitalists will not forego the
profits of private industry to enter the
public utility field unless this field is
made equally attractive.
Just as labor and materials are
bought on a market, so the use of cap-
ital is bought on a security market and
the cost of procuring capital is deter-
mined by a company's credit, actual
and potential, as shown by the prices
at which its securities can be mar-
keted.
The rate of return necessary to
procure capital for the extension of
existing utilities and for the establish-
ment of new ones is usually deter-
mined therefore, by ascertaining the
cost of new capital by computing from


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
the market prices of a public utility's
securities the rate at which the public
capitalizes the company's income. It
is at this point that an important fact
of corporation finance is frequently
overlooked. It is a fact that the rate
at which the public capitalizes the in-
come of the company in buying its
securities,—and hence the cost of cap-
ital,—is lower when the rate of re-
turn is somewhat above the market
rate of capitalization than it will be
if the two rates coincide.
A public service company will, un-
der modern conditions, ordinarily se-
cure part of its capital from the sale
of bonds, part from the sale of pre-
ferred stock, part from the sale of
common stock and still another part by
reinvesting some of the profits which
belong to the stockholders. Those
who contribute capital under these
various conditions acquire in return
various rights against the income of
the corporation. These rights differ
from each other both in the degree of
priority of claims to income and in
the manner in which they may assert
that claim.
The rights that are peculiar to bond-
holders are intended to make their in-
come more certain and hence, more
valuable dollar for dollar than that
of stockholders. The extent to which
these prior rights are really effective
depends largely upon the percentage
of earnings that is needed to meet the
obligations for Reserves for Deprecia-
tion and for interests and other Fixed
Charges.
The following case of a certain
Electric Light &amp; Power Company will
serve to illustrate the effect of a re-
duction in the rate of return upon the
cost of capital. The situation with re-
spect to earnings at present is as
follows:
Total Net Revenue. .$2,522,976.79—100 %
Reserve for Deprecia-
tion 700,000.00— 27.74%
Total Net Earnings.. 1,822,976.79— 72.26%
Deductions a|c Bond
Int. and Discounts
and Rents 832,010.32— 35.35%
Corporate Surplus .. 930,966.47— 36.91%
Dividends @ 6% on
Pref. Stock 240,000.00— 9.12%
Surplus for Common
Stock 690,966.47— 27.79%
Dividends @ 6 %
Common Stock.... 624,000.00
Addition to Reinvest-
ed Surplus 66,966.47
This table shows that after making
provision for depreciation,—less than
50% of the remaining earnings of the
company in question are needed to
provide for rentals of property, bond
interest and amortization of bond dis-
count. This makes it possible to pay
dividends of 6% on the $14,400,000 of
Common and Preferred Stock and to
leave a surplus for additions to prop-
erty of $66,966.47. The per cent of
net earnings left after providing for
fixed charges is commonly termed the
"Margin of Safety," and the rate at
which the market capitalizes Net
Earnings is determined among other
things by this margin.
The rate of return on investment
may be either equal to, below, or above
the rate at which the market capital-
izes the income of the company when
buying its securities.
It is desirable that it should nor-
mally be above in an efficiently man-
aged and conservatively and honestly
financed company.
If a reduction of rates, leading to
a reduction in return on investment,
were made in such a company the rate


239
at which the investing public capital-
izes net income would at once rise.
This would be true of both bonds and
stocks because of the decrease in the
margin of safety on bonds and of the
decrease in dividends on stock.
If the rate of return on the invest-
ment in properties of the company
mentioned above should be reduced
by 10% through a reduction of rates
for electricity, the result would be as
follows:
Present Net Earnings $1,822,976.79
Less 1% on investment of
$24,663,592 246,635.92
Net Earnings after reduction
of Rates 1,576,340.87
Fixed Charges (same as at
present) 892,010.32
Corporate Surplus 684,3305s
Dividend of 5% on Preferred
Stock 200,000.00
484.330-5i
Dividend of 4% °n Common
Stock 416,000.00
Surplus 68,330.55
Here the Fixed Charges would ab-
sorb 56.6% of the Net Income instead
of 48.9% as at present. The dividend
on Preferred Stock would be reduced
to 5% and that on Common Stock to
4%. In the case of the Company un-
der consideration, this would be less
serious than in the case of a company
whose "Margin of Safety" was lower.
Yet the fall in value of bonds would
be material. The fall in the value of
stock would probably be more than
proportional to the fall in the divi-
dend. The preferred stock is entitled
to a preference dividend of 5% per
annum which shall be cumulative. In
addition it shall be entitled to partici-
pate ratably with the common stock in
any dividends declared in excess of
5% on the entire capital stock. The
reduction of its dividend would be
from 6% to 5%, or 16 2/3%. It is
reasonable to suppose that its value
would fall by 12 points. The common
stock would probably be reduced by
25 points. The bonds would be re-
duced in value by the reduction in
margin of safety.
The following table sets forth the
securities which the Company has at
present outstanding, together with
their market values:
Company 5% Bonds.$12,842,000
@ 95
Market Value $12,199,900
Underlying Bonds.. 3,630,000
@ 99
Market Value 3,593,700
Preferred Stock ... 4,000,000
@ 92
Market Value 3,680,000
Common Stock .... 10,400,400
@ 75
Market Value 7,800,000
Debentures 332,000 332,000
Notes Payable 2,050,500 2,050,500
Total Market Value of Equi-
ties in Property $29,656,100
This value amounts to a capitaliza-
tion of the Company's net income at
6.15%. If this income were reduced
by 1% of the investment, the situation
with respect to market value of se-
curities would be approximately as
follows:
Company 5% Bonds $12,842,000
@ 85
Market Value $10,915,700
Underlying Bonds 3,630,000
@ 95
Market Value 3,488,500
Preferred Stock .. 4,000,000
@ 75
Market Value 3,000,000
Common Stock ... 10,400,000
@ 50
Market Value 5,200,000
Debentures 332,000
Notes Payable 2,050,500
@ 90
Market Value 2,144,250
Total Market Value of Equi-
ties in Property $24,709450


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
This value would amount to a cap-
italization of the Company's net in-
come as it would exist after the re-
duction in rates, at 6.38%, and would
be less than the total investment in
tangible capital for all purposes, work-
ing capital and materials and supplies,
and would therefore amount to con-
fiscation of property.
The cost of obtaining additional
capital would be increased much more
than would the rate of capitalization of
income.
At present the Company can sell
its bonds at a price that will net the
Company about 92, which gives an ef-
fective rate of approximately S^&amp;fo.
Its common stock, which is the only
stock available under the articles of
incorporation, sells at 75. This price
for the stock is equal to the capitalized
value of the Corporate Surplus accru-
ing to each share at 8.86%- If it be
assumed that 75% of the additional
capital needed from time to time were
obtained from the sale of bonds at the
above rates and 25% from the sale of
stock, then its new capital would cost
the Company.
$75 x .05.54-$4,219
25 x .0886—$2-215
$60 x .05^—$3-375
40 x .0886—$3,544
$100 —$6,434
or 6.434%
It is interesting to note that the
capital raised by the recent issue and
sale of 6%, 5 year debentures to the
amount of $1,999,000, sold to yield
the Company $96.58, actually costs
the Company 6.8%. These were is-
sued because "the market for capital
stock was not opportune."
If, in order to keep the margin of
safety about the same as at present,
the additional capital were raised by
issuing bonds for 60% and stock for
40%, the cost would be:
$100 —$6,919
or 6.919%
If now the rate of return were re-
duced by 1% and if the 5% bonds
of the Company fell to 85 on the mar-
ket, the Company would probably not
realize more than 83 for its bonds,
which would give an effective rate of
interest of 6}i%. If the stock fell
to 50, this price would be equal to the
value produced by capitalizing the
Corporate Surplus available for divi-
dends on Common Stock, amounting
to $484,330.55 at 9.3%. Its additional
capital would then cost the Company
on the hypothesis of $75 raised by
bonds and $25 raised by stock:
$75 x .06^—$4.78
25 x .004 —$2,325
$100 —$7,105
or 7.105%
On the assumption of $60 raised by
bonds and $40 raised by stock, this
additional capital would cost:
$60 x .06^—$3,825
40 x .003 —$3-72
$100 —$7-545
or 7-545%
The change in the price of the Com-
pany's securities brought about by
this decrease in rates, amounting to
1% of the cost of electric properties,
would bring about a fall in the price of
securities that would amount to con-
fiscation. It would be clearly unsea-
sonable to reduce it still further to
the point at which it would coincide
with 6.15%, the present rate of mar-
ket capitalization.
It must not be assumed, therefore,
that a rate of return equal to rate of


241
market capitalization would be rea-
sonable in the case of a well managed
company whose rate of return is above
the market rate of capitalization. If
the two rates were made to coincide,
the rate would have to be fixed at
some point higher than the present
market rate. In other words, this
company, and companies in like sit-
uation, can get money at a cost of
6.434% only because the rate of re-
turn is as high as 8%.
The other point with respect to the
factors that determine a reasonable
return relates to the necessity of fur-
nishing an inducement to provide a
high degree of operating efficiency.
Whether the public pays a high rate or
a low rate for the service it receives
depends upon the operating expenses
per unit of output quite as much as
upon the rate of return on investment,
for it must be high enough to cover
both these elements.
Operating Expenses depend on the
efficiency with which methods of pro-
duction are chosen, and with which
materials and labor are utilized. In
other words, they depend upon the ef-
ficiency of the management. The whole
field of Cost Accounting has been de-
veloped in recent years to furnish the
statistics necessary to attain the high-
est efficiency in this respect.
Fixed Charges per unit of output
are also dependent on efficiency in
choosing the most economical methods
of production as regards capital equip-
ment. They are further dependent
upon the ratio of actual output to
total capacity of the equipment. This
is due to the fact that fixed charges are
a function of time and accumulate
uniformly through a period of time.
It may even be good economy to in-
crease the variable operating expenses
per unit of output if the amount of
output per unit of time can be suffi-
ciently increased thereby so that the
decrease in fixed charges per unit will
offset the increase in variable ex-
penses.
A given set of rates which are rea-
sonable to two or more companies
located within the jurisdiction of the
rate-making body may yield quite dif-
ferent net earnings and rates of re-
turn on investment for the property
of the different companies. This con-
clusion follows immediately and inev-
itably from the observations made
above concerning operating expenses
and return on investment. This proves
conclusively that a high rate of return
on investment does not necessarily
mean a high rate for the service which
the public receives.
A 10% increase in the Operating
Expenses of the Company mentioned
above would offset almost exactly a
1% decrease in the return on invest-
ment. In the case of that company
the Operating Expenses per K.W.H.
were 36% higher in 1909 than in 1914
and 23% higher in 1912 than in 1914,
it is at once clear that it is entirely
wihin the realm of possibility that had
there been no incentive to operating
efficiency the Operating Expenses in
1914 might have been 20% higher
than they were. In that case the earn-
ings would not have been high enough
to pay even a 6% return on the en-
tire property, after deducting 1.82%
for depreciation, and would have been
large enough to pay only $% on the
cost.
Rates should be such, therefore, as
to induce the stockholders to secure
men of superior managerial capacity.
This can best be done by rewarding
exceptional efficiency with a higher
rate than will be allowed for only or-
dinary efficiency and by allowing to in-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
efficient management a lower rate.
Under private ownership the incentive
and the responsibility for maintaining
managerial efficiency is placed upon
the stockholders of the company. For
the extent to which the stockholders
will enjoy a larger or smaller profit,
as the case may be, is determined by
the degree to which an efficient man-
agement can reduce operating ex-
penses and fixed charges per unit of
output.
Since low rates may be attained
through high operation efficiency, it
is just as much to the interest of the
public that utilities be efficiently man-
aged and operated as it is to the in-
terest of the stockholder and bond-
holder. But the stockholder and bond-
holder have no incentive to efficient
management unless it inures to their
benefit in some degree at least, and
therefore it is to the interest of the
public to allow an added return to the
public in consideration of efficiency
of operation.
In view of the importance of effi-
cient management, it is difficult to
explain the small consideration that
has been given to this subject in the
inquiries involving the reasonableness
of rates. Without doubt it is partly
explained by the fact that economic
writers, following the analysis made
by Adam Smith in the "Wealth of Na-
tions," (written 1776), have limited
the factors of production to land, la-
bor and capital. In our modern indus-
trial society with its extended division
of labor and industry and with its
complex mechanical equipment, the
wealth of the nation and the product
of an industry will not depend merely
on the skill and industry of the labor;
the fertility of the soil or the abun-
dance of natural resources; and the
amount of capital which the society
possesses. It will depend on another
factor. This factor is the skill with
which labor, machinery and resources
are co-ordinated into a productive
unit. The time has come when we
must add a fourth factor. This fac-
tor is management.
The other reason why the ratio of
fixed charges to the amount of capital
is subjected to so much more scrutiny
than the efficiency of management is
that the former is so easily done. If
the capital investment is known, it re-
quires only a simple process of arith-
metic to arrive at the rate of return.
The extent to which lack of good
management has resulted in an ex-
cessive investment or to which good
management has kept the investment
at a low figure per unit of capacicy is
seldom or never scrutinized. Likewise
the extent to which good management
has kept the operating expenses at a
low figure is rarely examined. A rough
test is sometimes made by examining
the ratio of operating expenses to
gross revenues. This test, while bet-
ter than nothing, is superficial, es-
pecially where the rates have been
regulated and where in consequence
the reduction in rates has brought
about a proportionate fall in gross
revenue, and thus an increase in the
operating ratio. A comparison of
operating expenses with units of out-
put such as K. W. H., in the case of
electric light and power companies
would be more satisfactory for com-
paring different periods and different
companies.
The following tabulation presents
in concise statistical form the Invest-
ment and Operating history of the
company above mentioned, and will
furnish some basis for an opinion con-
cerning the operating efficiency of the

Company and the manner in which
the same has affected the rates which
the public has paid. Similar statis-
tics for other companies covering the
same period would enable commis-
sions to establish standards which, al-
though rough, would give some index
of efficiency. As the cases were mul-
tiplied the standards would become
more accurate.
A further consequence would result
from the rise in cost of capital result-
ing from a decrease in rate of return.
Every increase in investment would
be made at a greater cost and would
occasion a greater increase in fixed
charges than at present. This would
lead to a less liberal policy in making
extensions of service and would thus
operate to the inconvenience of the
public. It would retard the replace-
ment of existing plant by new plant
and machinery which is more econom-
ical. This would tend to keep operat-
ing expenses higher than they would
otherwise be and would thus neces-
sitate higher rates. For the expe-
diency of replacing old machinery be-
fore it is worn out by new machinery
and thus taking advantage of im-
proved methods depends largely upon
the rate of interest.
The results which would follow a
decrease in the rate of return on the
investment of a well managed Com-
pany's property may be summarized
as follows:
A disadvantage would result to the
public from reducing the rates of an
efficiently managed company to the
point where the rate of return on in-
vestment would coincide with the rate
of capitalization for security purchases
and sales, for the following reasons:
(a) The Rate of Capitalization would
rise as a consequence of the fall
in the rate of return on Invest-
ment.
(b) This increase in Rate of Capital-
ization would lead to an increase
in the cost of new money needed
for extensions.
(c) The additional cost of capital
would tend to raise operating ex-
penses by retarding the replace-
ment of less economical plant by
newer and more economical
plant.
(d) The incentive for high manager-
ial efficiency would be removed
because there remains no guar-
antee that it shall be rewarded.
This would result in increased
operating expenses.
(e) New enterprises would not be
started as readily as before since
there would be less reward for
enterprise.


(EXTRACTS from an address delivered at the annual banquet oe tau
BETA PI, CHICAGO, BY JAMES R. BIBBINS.)
Most of us, every now and then,
are apt to form a desire to slip away
quietly from our drafting tables, our
slide rules and our inevitable weekly
technical journal and to experiment a
little with aeronautics. Curiously
enough, some of us have actually
grown wings. To our utter surprise
we find we are able to soar away into
undiscovered realms which were furth-
est from our thoughts during the hard
and trying days when we were en-
deavoring to measure up to the stan-
dards of character and activity de-
manded by the modern business world.
But these little trial flights are usually
conducted in the back yards of our
consciences and the world knows little
about them. Nevertheless they are
valuable experiences. And my par-
ticular object is to show that these
little trial flights are in reality very
important and much belated events in
the lives of an otherwise highly edu-
cated species known as Engineers.
The average layman has to think
twice in defining the lifework of an
Engineer and usually lands upon the
highly interesting and profound con-
clusion that he is a man who runs an
engine. I submit that the layman is
not directly responsible for his diffi-
culty in arriving at the proper defini-
tion. In fact we ourselves are respon-
sible for it. Therefore, I propose to
squarely place the issue before you:
Whether or not the tendency of
the technical mind is to develop suf-
ficiently towards that Idealism which
is slowly but surely permeating
every branch of modern commerce,
industry and all professional re-
lations.
Technics and Culture.
I recall being very much impressed
with the close of an exceedingly able
address on this subject to a visiting
body of distinguished American En-
gineers at Leipzig by a German Pro-
fessor with an unpronounceable name
plus a wonderful string of prefixes
and affixes (which honors seem to
mean so much in Europe and so little
here). It was this:
"It is in the development of tech-
nics and modern industry them-
selves that we must look for an ex-
pedient for removing the moral and
social evils which have been called
forth through a brilliant material
progress. No superficial suppres-
sion of these evils, no administra-
tion of charity, no theories, no po-
litical revolutions can have any last-
ing effect in attaining this end, but
only the moral self-purification of
industrial development in itself, and
that changed to idealism, which
must be accomplished in and from
the further development, particular-
ly of technics. * * * * It is upon
you gentlemen that an extremely im-
portant task of the present * * * *
will devolve.—the humanizing of
modern labor, that quantitative pro-
duction may be transformed into
qualitative production. * * * A recon-
ciliation and humanizing of the ad-
vancing social classes generally ; the


245
evolution of a nobler society and a
nobler state would then be a prin-
cipal result arising out of a move-
ment whose accomplishment rests
in your hands."
Now it is patent to every engineer
that by virtue of his training and
thought methods, he should possess
a potentiality in guiding aright the
material as well as the political des-
tinies of this republic, to as great or
greater an extent than any of the other
honored professions. But somehow
he does not achieve due recognition.
The world knows him yet as a bridge
builder, not as a nation builder. "What
is wrong—mind, training, opportun-
ity, lack of ethical perspective; or is
he afflicted with that unfortunate
disease—"Specificus gravitatus"? I
am not unmindful that a few technical
men, out of their own efforts, have
achieved national prominence. In fact
our country's first President was an
Engineer.
Idealism.—The German professor, it
seems to me, unconsciously puts his fin-
ger on the weak spot—Idealism. Since
August 1914, European history is be-
ing rewritten by the pens of its learned
men, especially in Germany. And
while many millions of our own people
look with abhorrence upon the nation-
al acceptance of the principles and
motives to which this colossal de-
bauchery of nations can be attributed,
nevertheless they cannot but admire
the devotional adherence to those
principles and the methodical exact-
ness with which they are being put
into execution. We need not stop to
quarrel with the question of Democ-
racy vs. Autocracy, but we can re-
flect with profit upon National Ideal-
ism as the mainspring of National
Force.
Why not Personal Idealism in the
same measure? Nations are composed
of persons. Therefore nations can-
not measure up to any higher stan-
dard than the individuals. Certainly
in our country, if we are to achieve
the nobler society and the nobler state,
the result must come from collective
effort. And upon these same individ-
uals falls directly the responsibility
for such a cause, in proportion to
their ability and the effort spent upon
them by the State in giving them free
rein for the highest possible devel-
opment.
II.
Ethics is closely related to aesthe-
tics, which latter finds its most vig-
orous expressions in the fine arts, in
music, in literature. In fact we might
call ethics the mathematical expres-
sion of idealism or spiritual uplift of
aesthetics, or of religion. But what
has prosaic engineering got to do
with all this? What has standard-
ized operation No. 126 at the factory
to do with uplift? I maintain that
it has a great deal to do with it.
The Reconnaisance.—By a curious
coincidence there comes in my mail
from a National Engineering Society
a pamphlet entitled "Code of Ethics."
It does not involve much more than an
honest interpretation of my own Bible
would give me—honor, honesty, fi-
delity, courage, modesty, dignity, char-
ity and a square deal to your fellow-
man. It is quite harmless. It defines
just what every honorable man should
and would do. But it is only the flask
for the casting, the canvas for the
picture. Something is missing; it is
this. Like Bushido, the wonderful
philosophy of the educated Japanese,
it lacks in true Idealism, the pulse of
humanity, the detonator of the pro-
jectile. But, of course, you would not


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
expect to find these things in the cold
type of engineering transactions.
The Foundation. — Upon what,
then, have we built our structure
-—our ethical structure? Presumably
upon a lineage of good American
stock, God-fearing, sturdy, simple.
And today the foundation is compact-
ed of materials—superior materials—
quite unknown to our forefathers.
Think of the difference in the oppor-
tunities, the tremendous advance in
tangible learning, the increased effi-
ciency and productiveness of modern
life, the wealth of libraries and col-
leges available to us, which is the open
sesame to unlimited advancement.
The Structure. — Upon this foun-
dation we have reared our struc-
ture^—a chaste monolith, reinforced
bulk replaced by highly developed
stresses and materials, proof against
heat, tornado, earthquake and tidal
wave. We are conscious of every
step in the rearing of the structure,
the processes involved, the internal re-
actions, and are able to control all of
these by figuring them out before-
hand. But what is missing still? It
is the color scheme, the atmosphere,
the heart-beat, which alone will adorn
our structure, arrest the eye, and mark
it as a creation more beautiful than
thousands of others lacking this spirit-
ual quality.
III.
Let us turn back the calendar for a
moment's introspection. We left col-
lege happy, ambitious and so full of
resolutions as to cheat job hunting of
all its terrors.
Education taught us how to work,
but there was not time to define suffi-
ciently the standards of our play time.
It lacked the necessary aesthetic touch
for our well-rounded development, al-
though we perhaps were fortunate
enough to catch the note of idealism
in the general hum of mental activity
before plunging into the maelstrom of
a business life. If we did, we were
lucky.
Idols and Ideals — In the hard
years at the beginning we plod-
ded along with eyes and ears open
and mouth shut. It was a shock to
find that some of our idols had feet
of clay; that some of the men who had
formerly loomed big on the horizon
turned out to be mere men, just like
ourselves, and some of them less than
real men. But what matter? Here
were valuable experiences and a chance
to improve on them. Then the bitter
warfare of competitions, how it hurt.
To what low level men sometimes
stooped to get the job or beat the
contract! Sometimes inhuman, posi-
tively, but what matter? They would
not last long and perhaps we would
be fortunate enough to be called upon
ultimately to straighten out the tangle.
Yes, already we saw signs of the old-
fashioned type of salesman disappear-
ing, out-generalled; his capacity for
questionable types of entertainment no
longer appearing as an asset to the
shrewd man of business who gets
what he pays for. So, the young fel-
low fresh from the shop didn't have
to lie about the other fellow's product
at all, because he knew all about his
own.
But what a trial to convince that
old fogy with the microscopic mind.
There he was at the head of things
and yet it did not seem possible to even
make a dent in his armor of self-sat-
isfied ignorance. But never mind,
after his road went in the hands of
a receiver, there might be a change
in the management and maybe there
would be a chance to rectify the dam-
age done. But worst of all, that two-


247
faced fellow, a veritable Janus. It
made you shiver to the bone to see
him fawn upon his employer, then
damn him behind his back. And the
worst of it is he got away with the
loot, at least with enough to buy an
automobile and take his family to
Europe. Ah, but wait—the promoter.
He looked plausible enough, but was
a simple downright crook. He twirled
his ringers passively in his nice mahog-
any chair, while the poor widow
looked trustingly into his eyes and
handed over her money. And he was
only working for Blinkety, Blank &amp;
Co. of Wall Street. By next year
there would be "an unfortunate court
decision" or the vein would run out
and profits would be "deferred" for a
time. Perhaps next month the axe
dropped and the grand jury took a
hand. When it was all over, nobody
seemed to be personally responsible.
The principals left in their automo-
biles and the suckers went home on
foot, filled w'th a determination, born
of bitter experience, to master cor-
poration law to the very bottom.
White Glass Windows. — It all
looked pretty blue, and just then
you ran across your friend Sorehead.
Everything was wrong with him. En-
gineering was no white man's business
anyhow. Somebody has skimmed all
the cream off and he could hardly
keep in shoe leather for his babies.
Instantly you saw that he had not the
tight viewpoint. He had been wear-
ing blue goggles all the time. He
should have turned the X-ray upon
his ethical processes the moment
symptoms of weakness appeared. That
was the trouble with all these fellows
who were hitting out in the dark and
were more liable to bump into the
nose of a policeman than to fall into
a gold mine.
Richard Wagner wrote a famous
seties of operas, beginning with Rbein-
gold. He had a message to deliver
to the world. He was a shrewd
enough engineer to know that his new
principle and method needed some
preparation. The house darkens. And
the strings begin to hum through
fifty or a hundred measures of one
insistent note—B flat. It gets into
your very blood. It drives everything
else out of your mind and finally
crystallizes into a beautiful scene be-
neath the Rhine as the curtain rises.
You unconsciously remember that you
have heard that same old peaceful
river for centuries and centuries, flow-
ing down to the sea, while the Rhein-
gold was there untouched, safe-guard-
ed from man's greed, so long as peace
and harmony reigned in Valhalla.
The Rhine motif stays with you to
the end of four nights of opera, while
the story is finished, for your point
of view was correct at the outset.
IV.
Hidden Springs. — What a plea-
sure it is to discover some secret
accomplishment in a person beneath
whose rough exterior you had never
dreamed such things existed. These
are the bright spots. I recall the. case
of a hard working, much abused pub-
lic utility manager, who had enough
responsibility to drive most men into
the mad-house. At luncheon, I caught
his little glance of familiar apprecia-
tion toward the leader of the cafe
orchestra. I found that this man was
a most accomplished organist, and
after a heart-breaking day's work,
would seek the solace of his music
room to restore his mental equilibrium.
A better balanced man rarely lived,
and his ideals permeated his whole
army of employes. His little excur-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
sions to the realm of Idealism served
to re-create his jaded senses and his
friends, wonder how he does it. A
well known Engineer on hydraulics
and sewerage proved, to my delight,
to be a very good painter and his
house is full of oils that any one
would be proud to possess. Another
man, a professor who has been quietly
writing for years past, has suddenly
jumped into fame with a new and
striking literary style that will bring
much of his former work to the front.
One of the largest transit companies
in the world is managed by a man
who was formerly a store-room clerk
in one of the railway shops of De-
troit. He was knighted, but that had
not the slightest effect upon his demo-
cartic simplicity, his fair treatment
of men and the high ideals character-
izing the entire history of his life.
This man got a view point early in
life and held to it through thick and
thin.
Where are the hidden springs of
power? Willian James of Harvard,
in a masterful little book entitled "The
Energies of Men," says: "We need
a topography of the field of hidden
power and to know where to sink the
shafts into the mine of energy be-
neath." That is the business of every
man. Perhaps we will discover the
flux needed to compact thought and
action; the stabilizer to control our
flights and render them safe and ef-
fective. Otherwise we are liable to
tumble, unconsciously, into that pecu-
liar classification of peculiar beings
called "freaks" or in scientific lan-
guage, "episodic syndromata of hered-
itary degeneration." Then it will be
necessary for some one else to find a
way to control and divert our energies
into useful channels.
Ailerons.—It is necessary that, at all
costs, we should go down the middle of
the road. A stable equilibrium is abso-
lutely essential. An aeronaut cannot
soar with one aileron out of order.
Likewise warped judgments will soon-
er or later fall to the ground. We will
not acquire the habit of setting up
straw men and knocking them down.
Witness the amusing display of politi-
cal buffoonery that is seen all too fre-
quently in our city councils. Can you
not hear our worthy orator from the
Nth ward getting red in the face over
nothing in order to befog the real
issue at stake? Likely as not this
embryonic Demosthenes actually be-
lieves that his effort will go down in
history as an oratorical classic. Let
us have straight thinking, even if it
be rough shod. The man who had to
clean out the drains leading to the
church in "The Servant in the House"
went at it with a will, even if he did
ruin his lingerie in the process, but
he got there and found the trouble—
that is the point.
Second Wind. — Professor James
also discourses convincingly about a
man's second wind. He finds that
there is a mental phenomenon similar
to the physical one. We all know that
after a certain number of laps in the
race there comes from somewhere a
mysterious force, strengthening and
sustaining us through far greater ef-
forts than we had anticipated. It is
so with the mental and moral charac-
ter, and we need every bit of it. "The
limits of human faculties have never
yet been sounded. Our fires are
damped and our draughts checked,"
says the sage. This is because we are
prone to continually lapse from the
higher level once attained. This is
not a good plan to follow in mountain
climbing. It is also suggestive of
mental hysteresis.


249
The Mountains. — There are many
summits to be climbed. Each one
will prepare better for the next.
But where shall we make the first
step? The mountain tops are all
about us with their snow-crowned
summits glistening in the sun. Yes,
there is much work to do right under
our hands, in the final examinations,
in personal business, in commerce and
industry, in community life, in local
and national government, in every as-
sociation of man with man. Econom-
ic waste is on every hand. We are
getting hold of the waste somewhat
in commerce and industry, but the
waste in government from partisan
politics is still frightful. The task
will require the highest efficiency, al-
most consecration.
Incidentally efficiency has nothing
to do with value received. Our effi-
ciency will be zero if we give no more
to the world than we receive there-
from in money or goods; that is, we
will not be a creative force in the
true sense. We must increase our
entropy. This thought underlies the
doctrine of service of man to man.
Frequently it is thankless and unre-
munerative. But that is the doctrine
of our beloved Democracy which we
have embraced from the teachings of
the Nazarene, perhaps unconsciously.
Every man ought to have a hobby,
providing that it is a source of diver-
sion from his work. It may be golf,
flowers, music, art or literature. The
field is broad. But it should be one
of moral and spiritual uplift, which
is needed to counteract the highly de-
generating influences of an active life.
Through these media, he should grad-
ually work out his moral philosophy;
otherwise he will be as a ship without
a rudder, as an engine without a gov-
ernor. And we should not stigmatize
him as a freak because he has a hobby.
No weapon is more destructive to
character development than contempt.
And intolerance is a rather common
fault, coming pretty close to bigotry.
We must all see our visions, we must
dream our dreams in our own way,
and build our beacon fires in different
places. Then we will know what
mountains to climb first.
And let me say that this little moral
philosophy, this personality of ours,
cannot be developed without deep re-
search. To a scientific mind, research
is the triumph of truth over error.
Our spiritual advisers would be hor-
rified to find a copy of Nietsche in our
pockets. But the whole field must be
searched from the zenith to the nadir.
Nietsche propounded the Superman,
a man of cold blood and steel. It made
no difference to him that he was erect-
ing a temple upon the tears, yes, and
ruthlessly tearing the heart strings
of millions of less fortunate human
beings. Today those millions are be-
ing laid away as a fearful sacrifice to
this Frankenstein; this inhuman crea-
ture of a vicious, disordered brain.
Cortez found the same appalling sac-
rifice in the temple of the Montezumas
at Mexico City, and whatever his other
vices, he did mankind one great serv-
ice. Like Hercules, he cleaned out
the Augean stables.
True vision is constructive, not de-
structive. It comes from the rugged
mountains, the great waters, the gold-
en sunset, the silent waste spaces, the
lily buds, the lips of a child, not from
the wicked roar of hidden artillery, the
blare of processions, the plaudits of
multitudes, the rattle of money bags.
Its true aim is not that of might over
right, of brute force over timidity, or
of expediency over Honor.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
And after all, honor and humanity
are the two last words, and humanity
is but the essence of aesthetics. With-
out these any propaganda is doomed
to ultimate failure. For the forces of
justice will triumph even if we all
have to fight for it to the end.
Read the "Rubaiyat of Omar Khay-
yam" and then Browning's "Rabbi Ben
Ezra." You will get the view point of
the Oriental and the Occidental mind.
Read Richard Jeffries "The Pageant of
Summer" for an appreciation of pure
nature. Ponder on the popular phil-
osophy of Kipling's "If" and then see
if there is not something wrong in
the social and industrial organism that
has produced this crime of the ages,
which is so ably typified in that brief
epic of the Balkan wars—"The Wine
Press" by Alfred Noyes.
You ask, is this all farce? Is the
learned Doctor right about the possi-
bility of humanizing industry by tech-
nical development as the important
goal of the technician. Personally I
think it is and must match up to
our jobs at all costs. The time has
come to build, not raze; to put the
shoulder to the wheel, not to put the
brake on; to catch the pulse of human-
ity and enshrine it so deeply in the
hearts of men that a repetition of the
colossal blunders of bigoted autocracy
will forever be prevented. The En-
gineer must have a hand in this turn.
Browning has caught the spirit:
"I was ever a fighter, so—one fight
more,
The best and the last.
One who never turned his back but
marched breast forward,
Never doubted clouds would break,
Never dreamed, though right were
worsted, wrong would triumph.
* * *
No, at noonday in the bustle of man's
work-time
Greet the unseen with a cheer!
Bid him forward, breast and back as
either should be,
"Strive and thrive! cry "Speed—fight
on,
Fare ever there as here!"


BY PROFESSOR W. J. HUSSEY
There are more than two hundred
public observatories in the northern
hemisphere and less than twenty in
the southern. A large number of the
northern observatories have been in
existence many years. In general
they have been well equipped for re-
search and have had sufficient funds
for the successful prosecution of their
investigations. In the south, on the
contrary, most of the observatories
are of comparatively recent founda-
tion and their funds have usually
been small, though in some cases suf-
ficient to enable them to make splendid
contributions to science. From these
circumstances it happens that astro-
nomical investigations have been car-
ried further in many directions on the
northern than on the southern stars.
In the development of astronomy
there is constant need of data from the
entire sky. The existing southern ob-
servatories have not been able to sup-
ply their portions fully and in their
need northern astronomers have at
various times gone on expeditions to
the southern hemisphere for the pur-
pose of securing what they required.
Thus, Lieutenant J. M. Gilliss, of the
United States Navy, from 1849 to
1852, conducted an expedition to
Chile to obtain meridian observations
of Mars and Venus for use in connec-
tion with similar ones made at Wash-
ington for the determination of the
solar parallax. Dr. 13. A. Gould of
Boston was in Argentina from 1870 to
1885, founding and directing the Ar-
gentine National Observatory at Cor-
doba, where he produced the Urano-
metria Argentina, the Cordoba Zone
Catalogue, and the Argentine General
Catalogue of stars, and where he es-
tablished conditions which have since
resulted in many important contribu-
tions to science. From 1908 to 1911
an expedition of the Carnegie Institu-
tion of Washington, consisting of ten
astronomers headed by Professor
Tucker of the Lick Observatory,
working under the direction of Pro-
fessor Boss of Albany, was in Ar-
gentina to determine anew the places
of about 25,000 stars for the improve-
ment of their positions and the deter-
mination of their proper motions. The
Harvard Observatory has maintained
a station at Arequipa, Peru, since
1889, for photometric and photograph-
ic work, the plates being sent to Cam-
bridge for study, forming with those
taken at the Harvard Observatory the
largest existing library of astronomi-
cal negatives. Similarly, the Lick Ob-
servatory, since 1903, has maintained
a station at Santiago, Chile, for stel-
lar spectrographic observations, the
plates being sent to Mount Hamilton
for measurement. These have all
been more or less American under-
takings, though the results have been
available to astronomers everywhere,
for pure science has no national boun-
daries.
British and British Colonial initia-
tive have given us the important
southern observatories at the Cape of
Good Hope, Melbourne, Sydney,
Windsor, Perth, Adelaide, and just
north of the equator the Indian ob-
servatories looking further into the


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
southern skies than is possible from
England. The observatory at the
Cape of Good Hope, founded and
maintained by the British Admiralty
for obtaining data respecting the
southern stars which can not be se-
cured at Greenwich, has had a long
and active career and a splendid record
of achievement. Similarly the Aus-
tralian and Indian observatories have
done splendid work. The Australian
observatories are at present largely
engaged upon their assignments of the
Astrographic Catalogue.
Notwithstanding all that has been
done in the south, much still remains
to be accomplished to bring our knowl-
edge of the southern sky to the level
of that of the northern. To aid in
supplying what is lacking in one de-
partment, the University of Michigan,
in 1910, through the generosity of Mr.
R. P. Lamont, began preparations for
southern work. To this end he pro-
vided the means for constructing a
24-inch refracting telescope, to be
taken to the southern hemisphere
when fiinished, for the discovery and
measurement of double stars and for
other observations. The completion
of this instrument has been delayed,
owing to failures of the glass makers
to produce the disks of glass required
for the objective. In the meantime an
arrangement has been made with the
University of La Plata which has en-
abled us to begin these observations
at the Observatory of La Plata. It is
a statement of this work that I have
been asked to prepare for The Tech-
nics It may not be amiss to give also
a brief account of the Observatory of
La Plata, which today has the largest
and best equipment of any observatory
in the southern hemisphere.
La Plata, with a population of some-
what more than a hundred thousand
inhabitants, is the capital of the Prov-
ince of Buenos Aires, the largest and
richest of the Argentine states. It
was founded in 1882, soon after the
nation had appropriated the city of
Buenos Aires and the region imme-
diately about it to be the seat of gov-
ernment of the republic. La Plata was
planned on a generous scale, with
broad streets and intersecting diag-
onals, after the fashion of Washing-
ton, and it was quickly built, with im-
posing public buildings, well-paved
streets, and ample parks. Among the
institutions established here at the
cost of the Province at the epoch of
the creation of the city are the Uni-
versity, the Museum, the Observatory,
and the College of Agriculture and
Veterinary Science. All of these have
since been transferred to the nation
and are now departments of the new
National University of La Plata.
The Observatory of La Plata was
founded in 1882. By successive de-
crees of the Executive Power of the
State, during the next six years, au-
thorization was made for the purchase
of a complete and varied collection of
astronomical instruments and for the
construction of the buildings which
would be necessary for their installa-
tion. Fifteen buildings were erected
and the instruments obtained during
that period were the following: Two
refracting telescopes, one of 8.4 and
the other of 17 inches aperture; two
meridian circles, one moderately small
and the other one of the largest and
most complete in the world ; two astro-
nomical transit instruments for time
and latitude observations; a large and
very complete altazimuth instrument;
a reflecting telescope of 31.6 inches
aperture; a photographic refractor of
the astrographic type of 13.5 inches
aperture; and many smaller instru-

merits, including clocks, chronometers,
chronographs, etc. All of the original
equipment was purchased in France
and the instruments were the best ob-
tainable at that time.
It was several years after the large
instruments were ordered before they
were completed and delivered. And
more years passed before the build-
ings were finished and the instruments
installed and made ready for use. In
maintained by the Province were trans-
ferred to the nation as Departments
of the new National University of La
Plata. Soon after the Observatory
of La Plata passed under the control
of the University, in 1906, its staff
was reorganized and a considerable
number of additional instruments
were purchased. Among these were
two zenith telescopes and a large me-
ridian circle of the latest pattern from
Gautikr Meridian Circle
the meantime a period of great finan-
cial depression had come to the coun-
try and the Province was seriously af-
fected. There were years of waiting
in which no one knew whether the
next would be better or worse. It was
a time when constructive statesman-
ship was needed. In the emergency,
through the efforts of Dr. Joaquin V.
Gonzalez, then a member of the fed-
eral cabinet as Minister of Justice and
Education, various institutions at La
Plata* which had been founded and
the celebrated house of A. Repsold &amp;
Son; a zenith telescope from Rani-
berg ; a large comet seeker from Zeiss;
an international latitude instrument
from Wanschaff, and a number of
smaller instruments, such as seismo-
graphs, computing machines, compara-
tors, etc.
After a time further administrative
changes became necessary and in 1910
I was asked to reorganize the staff and
assume the direction of the scientific
work. On taking charge of the Ob-


255
servatory in the following year I
found a large collection of excellent
instruments, more than we could ex-
pect to use constantly. Definite lines
of work had therefore to be selected,
appropriate to the instruments and to
the men. Some time was spent in
studying the situation, in making ar-
rangements for increase of staff, in
securing appointments, in improving
sanitary conditions, and in making
those indispensable adjustments and
escope, the small equatorial, and one
of the Repsold transit instruments.
In 1913, Astronomers Felix Aguilar
and Paul T. Delavan, after some pre-
liminary practice to familiarize them-
selves with the instrument, began an
extensive series of observations with
the large Gautier meridian circle.
Their object is to determine the exact
places of about 15,000 southern stars,
or all of those to the ninth magnitude
inclusive, which are situated in a zone
Meridian Circle Building
alterations which invariably have to
be made in putting instruments into
commission and rendering them effi-
cient. Observations have now been in
progress a sufficient time to furnish re-
sults and these are in every way sat-
isfactory. The larger pieces of work
are being done with the large Gautier
meridian circle, with the large equa-
torial, and with the comet seeker, and
of what has been done with these I
shall speak particularly. In passing
it may be remarked that occasional use
has also been made of the Astrograph-
ic refractor, the Wanschaff zenith tel-
ten degrees wide, comprised between
the declinations —520 and —620. They
have already secured about twenty-five
thousand observations on this pro-
gram, or somewhat more than half
the number that will be required. If
the work be continued at the present
rate the observations needed to com-
plete the program will be nearly or
quite obtained by the end of 1916. The
positions of many of these stars have
never before been accurately mea-
sured. They are needed for various
astronomical investigations. The ob-
servations will also furnish data for


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
improving the positions of the bright-
er stars of the zone. They are situat-
ed not far from the zenith of the
southern countries, and will be useful
for geodetical operations, such as de-
terminations of time, azimuth, and lat-
itude.
In this connection it may be stated
that the meridian work at La Plata
is an extension of that begun about
1870 by the co-operation of northern
observatories, which has resulted in
the production of a most valuable se-
results from all of these observatories
except Algiers have been printed, and
those from Algiers are nearly ready.
In general each observatory took a
zone five degrees in width, and in no
case were the observations of a zone
completed in less than four years, and
generally the time taken was consid-
erably more. After the completion
of its first zone, Harvard took a sec-
ond, and the zones for Berlin, Bonn,
and Leipzig were each ten degrees
in width. In the south the Argentine

ries of star catalogues, viz., the so-
called Astronomische Gesellschaft Cat-
alogues. Nineteen volumes of these
catalogues have been printed, giving
the exact places of all stars to the 9.0
magnitude inclusive from 8o° north
declination to 180 south declination.
The co-operating observatories in the
United States were those at Albany,
Cambridge (Harvard), and Washing-
ton, and in Europe those at Berlin,
Bonn, Cambridge (England), Chris-
tiania, Helsingfors-Gotha, Kasan, Lei-
den, Leipzig, Lund, Nicolajew, and
Vienna, and in Africa, Algiers. The
National Observatory at Cordoba has
completed the observations for three
five-degree zones, and La Plata is
making the observations for two such
zones. The observations already se-
cured at La Plata are more than would
have been required for a single zone.
The calculations giving the final
places of the stars from the La Plata
measurements are following the ob-
servations closely. The probable er-
rors of the results are in general small-
er than those ordinarily obtained in
differential work, which speaks well
for the La Plata meridian circle and


257
for the skill of those who are using it;
viz., the observers, Messrs. Aguilar
and Delavan, and their assistants,
Messrs. Chaves, Crump, Boero, and
Manganiello.
On taking charge of the Observa-
tory of La Plata, toward the end of
1911, I began to use the large refrac-
tor for the discovery of double stars.
In the following year when a microm-
eter had been fitted to it so that
surement of pairs already known and
to the verification of their positions
in the sky. Much must be done in
this way before we shall be able to
draw definite conclusions respecting
the number, distribution, and charac-
ter of the southern double stars.
Since 1912 nearly four hundred ob-
servations of comets and of the minor
planet I titer omnia have been made
with the large equatorial. Twelve dif-
Principal Building and Reflector Building
measurements could be made, the in-
strument began to be used for the ob-
servation of double stars, comets and
minor planets. More than three hun-
dred double stars have been discov-
ered with it, including some fine pairs,
with small distances, which are likely
to prove interesting binaries. More
than three thousand observations of
double stars have been made, about
a thousand by myself, and the rest by
Astronomer B. H. Dawson, during his
two years of residence at La Plata.
He devoted his attention to the mea-
ferent comets have been observed.
Three of these were discovered at La
Plata by Mr. Delavan, who regularly
devotes a portion of his time to search-
ing for them with the Zeiss comet-
seeker. The first comet found by him
was a return of Westphal's comet of
1852, whose period was so imper-
fectly determined that it was not
known when or where it would reap-
pear. The observations made subse-
quent to its rediscovery have removed
the uncertainties respecting its orbit
and its path is now accurately known.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
The second comet found by him was
new and has now been under observa-
tion nearly two years, an apparition
of longer duration than for any other
comet. It was found ten months be-
fore it reached perihelion, when at a
distance of about 400,000,000 miles
from the sun. Very few comets are
visible at such a distance. For sev-
eral weeks in the latter part of 1914 it
was a conspicuous object to the naked
eye in the northern sky. At that time
it was photographed at Ann Arbor
by Mr. Mellor and some excellent
spectograms of it were obtained with
the large reflector by Dr. Curtiss. The
comet is now in the southern sky, a
telescopic object. It is not possible
to say how long it will remain visible,
for comets are subject to sudden and
unexpected changes in brightness and
physical appearance. If it follows an
orderly course, however, it will be
observable with large telescopes sev-
eral months longer, making its appari-
tion notable by reason of its great du-
ration.
I will mention only a few of the
miscellaneous undertakings at La
Plata, in many of which Mr. H. J.
Colliau took an active part. These re-
late to the betterment of living condi-
tions, the maintenance of buildings
and grounds, the care and improve-
ment of instruments, and to the rou-
tine operations which are inseparable
to the conduct of an Observatory. An
excellent instrument shop was built
and equipped, a sewer constructed,
buildings and domes repaired and
painted, alterations made in the me-
ridian circle and other instruments, a
Riefler clock and seismographs in-
stalled, and the Latitude Observatory
moved from Oncativo. The usual
meteorological observations have been
made continuously, and time signals
nave been sent regularly to the ships
at Ensenada, the port of La Plata,
and to the Argentine navy at Bahia
Blanca.
Enough has been done at La Plata
during the past four years to make a
good record and to secure for the in-
stitution a creditable place among the
working observatories of the world.


BY JAMES H. MARKS, '08 E
SUPERINTENDENT OF BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
In this age when all things are done
by large groups of men working to-
gether on one thing as contrasted to
even so short a time as fifty years ago
when the work of the world was large-
ly done by individual effort, there is
constant demand for men to head the
large groups. Men who are success-
ful in getting results from the thought
and labor of others are called execu-
tives and are looked upon in the busi-
ness world as a class by themselves to
be anxiously sought and well paid.
The question naturally arises whether
a man not naturally possessed of those
talents can acquire them.
As a concrete illustration of the
large demand of the present day for
executives, consider the case of the
manufacture of barrels. As late as
1870 barrels were made by hand.
Wherever there was demand for them,
there was a cooper shop operated by
a man who worked with his own hands
assisted by a few helpers. The mater-
rials were personally selected by the
master workman in a neighboring
forest. The trees were cut into stave
length blocks and split by hand into
rough staves. After air seasoning,
the staves were shaped by hand with
a two handled knife and a curved
plane. The barrels were assembled in
the shop and found their market close
at hand so that the problem of econom-
ically shipping so bulky a thing as a
barrel did not exist. There were no
labor problems such as are met with
in large groups of employees in the
present day. There were no large
plants to maintain, power to supply,
or capital and credit to secure.
Contrast the foregoing with con-
ditions existing today. Logs have to
be shipped by rail or water to a mill
where they are cut to length and into
triangular prisms. These blocks are
cut into staves by a large knife mak-
ing 40 to 50 strokes a minute. The
staves are piled to season and then
jointed by a machine with a knife
curved to the proper radius. The
hoops are of steel or sawed wood
bands. The heads, staves and hoops
are shipped in bundles and are as-
sembled by unskilled labor where the
barrels are used. The problem of mak-
ing barrels today and forty years ago
is as different as one in calculus is
from one in elementary arithmetic.
The former required a painstaking
mechanic with a few helpers who
usually secured their board as a large
part of their pay. The modern meth-
od requires extensive purchasing of
timber, its shipment to the stave, head-
ing and hoop mills, its preparation and
shipment to the market for barrels and
finally its assembly and sale. The old-
time mechanic could not have success-
fully managed a business like the mod-
ern one, though he knew every detail
of making a barrel; while today a man
who never made a stave will direct a
business that will make more barrels
in one day than the cooper of the past
generation could make in his whole
life. A similar concrete illustration of


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
chnnge in conditions of business could
be taken from almost any industry.
The demand for executives is the
result of similar evolution in every line
of manufacture. The modern director
of enterprise, the executive, must or-
ganize men, machinery and materials
into one great harmonious unit work-
ing for just one end, delegating the
details of purchase, shipping, selecting
of lieutenants and men, manufactur-
ing and sale, but still keeping in close
touch with the results attained by his
organization. There are certain prin-
ciples which govern administration of
business affairs and lead to the proper
co-relation of those things which make
for success in an organization. It is
the object of this discussion to set
forth these principles especially in the
light of the possibility of their study
and adaptation.
Most anything that is successful
these days is called "efficient." Let
us turn to a consideration of this term
and especially as applied to organiza-
tion. To the engineer, efficiency is
the ratio of output to input. We may
speak of the efficiency of a steam en-
gine—the ratio of mechanical horse-
power output to thermal horsepower
input reduced to B. T. U.'s or any
other common unit of energy; the ef-
fuiency of an electric motor is the
ratio of horsepower output expressed
in watts to the watts input,—and so
on, every machine has its ratio of ef-
ficiency. Some machines art more
efficient than others, and some ma-
c* ines not as efficient as similar ones
in the ratio of output to input are
better adapted for some uses than the
latter.
The efficiency of a steam engine is
dependent on a great many things:
the jacketing of cylinder walls to pre-
vent condensation, the ratio of bore
to stroke, whether simple or compound
and if the latter, whether cross or tan-
dem, style of valve gear, whether bal-
anced slide or Corliss, whether con-
densing or non-condensing, and if the
former on the degree of vacuum, the
weight of fly wheel and style of gov-
ernor,—and so on; we might name
many other things affecting or deter-
mining the efficiency of a steam
engine.
In the same way the efficiency of
any machine is determined by its de-
sign and details and their co-relation.
We can, therefore, determine the best
design and details for a machine to
accomplish a given result by a study
of its efficiency under different condi-
tions in their different relations.
In fact every way we turn now-a-
days, particularly in the business
world, we hear or see this term "effi-
ciency". It is applied to machines,
methods, systems, and men. In all
but the last named it can easily mean
ratio of output to input, but hardly in
the case of men. The ultimate mea-
sure of efficiency is the ratio of value
of result to cost, whether the latter
be in B. T. U.'s, dollars, or effort. The
activities of men can be measured
in effort as related to result. Every
man can get results in some way and
to a certain extent. The getting of
desired results with the least expen-
diture of effort is the most efficient
condition. If one man can gain a
certain end with less expenditure of
effort than can another, the former is
the more efficient. An efficient man,
then, is one who gets results in the
easiest, quickest, and best way, no
matter what his line of endeavor.
If this—the getting of results in the
easiest, quickest, and best way—is to
be our definition of an efficient man,
we can easily see that a man can be


261
an efficient student if he acquires
knowledge in this way, granting of
course that he has the mental caliber
to learn. A man can be an efficient
engineer, lawyer, carpenter, clerk, or
laborer by simply teaching and train-
ing himself to get the results he is
after in the easiest, quickest and best
way. It should be possible, therefore,
for a man to be taught and trained to
be an efficient executive by study of
and training in the easiest, quickest
and best ways to get results from an
organization.
The primary results to be attained
by an executive from his organization
are invariably: large output, good
quality of product, low cost and speed.
Granting that a man is of average
mental ability, has reasonably good
health, and is naturally honest, with
natural endowment or acquirement of
a few principles, he can get these re-
sults in the easiest, quickest, and best
way. Just as it is possible to analyze
the things which make a machine ef-
ficient for a given purpose, it is feasi-
ble to analyze the qualities that make
a man efficient as an executive.
In the first place, an executive must
surround himself with adequate per-
manent records of accomplishment
both past and present in the line of
work in which he is in charge. He
must first know his results, and then
he must know what is being done by
others so as to measure his results
alongside of theirs. Records of meth-
ods and their result in quantity, qual-
ity, and cost must be classified and
kept easily accessible and always ac-
curately to date. An executive can-
not guess that this or that is so or not
so,—he must know, if he is to be
properly guided. In the first place,
then, an executive must devise, keep,
consult, and be guided by adequate
records.
In the second place, with the facts
before him he must make definite ac-
curate decisions, which once made
must be followed. A successful exec-
utive cannot falter and grope about
for his guidance and in issuing in-
structions. The president of one of
the largest corporations in Detroit
once said, "A good executive is one
who makes decisions quickly and is
sometimes right." This is perhaps
carrying it a little too far but it is
highly important that the members of
an organization get action promptly
on matters of policy from their chief.
But once an order is issued or a policy
laid down, it must be followed. This
principle borders closely on the third
one, the necessity for discipline.
Every precaution must be taken to
insure fair decisions but once made
they must be carried out. If an execu-
tive heads an organization of such a
nature that he has lieutenants direct-
ing portions of the work, he must look
to these men for results and not inter-
fere in any particular with their or-
ders to their men. If the results are
not satisfactory he must call his lieu-
tenant to account and not the individ-
ual members of the subdivisions of
the organization. The rules and stan-
dards that are set for the guidance of
the organization must be rigidly en-
forced. If rules cannot be enforced
they should be withdrawn, but as
long as they stand they must be ob-
served. In the fourth place then, the
executive must establish and main-
tain discipline.
The delegation of details in the
larger organizations must be done in
such a manner that a close watch is
still kept on them without the expen-
diture of so much time that the atten-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
tion of the head of the organization is
taken from the large problems. This
is not a case of "look after the pen-
nies and the dollars will look after
themselves." That saying may apply
to misers but not to executives. One
executive makes it a point to look
over one branch of detail one week
by having the papers pass over his
desk and the next week some other
branch. In that way in the course of
several months he keeps in close touch
with every minute detail of his organ-
ization without devoting his time to
it to the exclusion of the larger
things. In other words the executive
must guard his assignment of time.
For the sixth principle, the execu-
tive must keep always before him the
fact that anything is always worth its
price, the law of supply and demand
takes care of that. If he pays for
cheap labor, he gets it in quality and
quantity of product. He must judge
the value of the result by its cost.
Despite the permanent adequate
records he keeps, occasions will arise
requiring decisions for which data is
not at hand. At these times the con-
sultation of competent advice is neces-
sary. A man to be an executive must
realize when it is time for him to con-
fess his lack of knowledge and go to
some authority in that line for counsel.
As he is working for results as his
reward, every man in his organiza-
tion is working for and expecting his
reward. And the placing of these re-
wards must be where they belong or
woe to the would-be executive. A
misplaced commendation or increase
in pay will lower an executive's power
sooner than any other mistake. No
one can possibly know where the best
results in an organization are being
attained and who is gaining them as
well as the men in the organization
themselves.
No great result was ever accom-
plished in a haphazard way. The big
things in the world are the results of
careful study and planning. The ac-
tivities of an organization must be
planned in advance and the whole
problem set forth before its solution,
the same as the building of a bridge
must be carefully studied, computed,
designed, and detailed before a suc-
cessful result can be attained. It
would be the height of folly to attempt
to build any large structure to carry
a heavy load over a large span with-
out having every detail determined
before the work is started. In the
same way the executive must plan his
organization, the selection of lieuten-
ants, delegation of authority, and
otherwise know definitely not only the
result to be accomplished but how it
is to be done.
The average person's idea of an
executive is a driving, exacting mas-
ter. It is true that the successful one
must see his plans through, not nec-
essarily by force of might but rather
by method. A checking up and tak-
ing stock of progress is necessary. To
get results promptly the plans must
be scheduled for carrying out the
work as rapidly as consistent, and then
the schedule carefully observed and
followed. Everyone has seen two
buildings being built, both of about the
same size and started at about the
same time, and has seen one completed
months ahead of the other. The man
in charge of the slow one could un-
doubtedly give many excuses why his
building was not completed as rapidly
as the other, but the reasons could all
be gathered in one,—that he did not
schedule his work and live up to the
schedule.


263
For the next principle we can para-
phrase to good advantage, "To him
that works shall be given, and to him
that works not shall be taken from
even unto his job." If a man works
well he should be rewarded; if not,
he should be removed from the or-
gai ization. There is not a human en-
dcavor or activity to which the prin-
ciple of the square deal does not apply,
so this principle must be mentioned
with the qualities necessary to the
successful executive. Honesty is in-
cluded under our assumptions, but it
should be emphasized again as a very
necessary requirement. A man may
have the greatest mental and physical
ability and still not be entirely honest.
The next and last principle is the
one that is perhaps hardest of all to
acquire and that is good judgment or
common sense. A man cannot select
his records or lieutenants, assign his
time, administer discipline, or even
decide on his reward—the results of
his efforts—without this qualification
always at hand. By it the executive
is enabled to properly place the weight
of responsibility, or to exert the neces-
sary pressure to bolster up a weak link
in the organization, or to delegate the
proper man to an important duty.
Early in the discussion it was point-
ed out that the efficiency of a steam
engine or other mechanical apparatus
is dependent on a great many things,
which must be so arranged and co-or-
dinated as to make the machine most
efficient for a certain purpose. It was
also remarked that some men possess
certain qualifications that fit them for
various walks of life. In the dis-
cussion it has been pointed out that
certain qualifications fit a man to be
an executive. It is possible to sum up
these qualifications in this brief state-
ment: A successful executive must be
efficient in maintaining and consulting
adequate records; in making quick, ac-
curate, definite decisions; in maintain-
ing discipline; in assigning his time;
in apportioning value of result; in
consulting competent counsel; in exer-
cising the square deal; and in using
common sense.
The application and co-ordination of
the principles set forth seems like a
simple thing, and it should not be a
difficult matter for an educated man
to apply them. There are many quali-
fications which would be classified
more correctly under the heading of
personality that would add to and am-
plify those herein mentioned. There
is a large amount of literature being
published on these subjects that will
aid anyone undertaking to train him-
self to be an executive.
It is not a difficult thing to devise
and keep accurate records of any pro-
cedure. It is usually a work that can
be done by a good clerk, or at the
most, an inexpensive man who is get-
ting his experience. It is certainly
no difficult thing to consult the rec-
ords. It is only necessary for a man
to realize their necessity and value
to be efficient in this regard.
The ability to make accurate deci-
sions depends largely on knowledge
and records both of which are now
prsumed. The necessity for speed in
making them is the difficult thing, and
quickness is necessary under most con-
ditions to keep the organization active
and alert. Imagine a boy pushing a
cart along by a series of shoves as its
momentum and speed decrease and
then imagine him holding back in-
stead of shoving. He takes all the
momentum away from the cart, does-
n't he? And that is what happens to
an organization with a slow deciding
head.

The maintaining of discipline is a
question of study of men and human
nature. It is not necessary to be curt
and arbitrary. It is only necessary to
act in such a way as to demand and
expect obedience and courtesy, but
when it is not forthcoming under
these circumstances to act, and act
quickly, in only one way.
The proper assignment of time can
be accomplished by a continual self-
analysis, a constant self-questioning to
find out if too much time is spent on
the little things. When the big things
begin to be neglected then a reassign-
ment of time is necessary.
The apportioning of value of result
is much the same as the assignment
of time. The records help because
they show what a given result costs
and give the data for deciding whether
it is worth the effort. There is an old
saying, "Every man to his trade." If
the executive guards against his or-
ganization attempting to do that for
which it is not fitted, he will go a
long way in eliminating the worry
from improper apportionment of value
of result.
It is unnecessary to argue the point
of consulting competent counsel. Ev-
ery intelligent man knows where he
can find it—in the libraries, current
literature, from employes, fellow men,
and even by watching a business com-
petitor. The status of good roads in
Michigan is an illustration of viola-
tion of this principle in management.
The eastern states and even those bor-
dering on the south have gone through
the expensive experimental stage that
our state is now going through, and
yet many of our road commissioners
do not see the advisability of consult-
ing competent counsel, and profiting
by others' experience.
The man who does not have an ideal
towards which he is working as a re-
ward will never advance. He will
drift. The determination of the end
to be gained by an organization must
be definite to give it stimulus for im-
provement. Often times the goal to
be reached is arbitrarily set by nat-
ural conditions, such as responsibility
to stockholders, competition, and so
on. Many times it is necessary to
adopt a standard of reward to be
reached that is somewhat imaginary
and hence subject to revision from
time to time, but there is always a
definite aim in a successful organiza-
tion.
The developing of plans and their
scheduling are things relatively simple
when the goal to be reached has been
fixed. It is largely a matter of rou-
tine based on records and experience
in the particular line of work in which
the executive is in charge. On com-
pletion of detailed plans which may
take the form of tabulations, descrip-
tions, specifications, or drawings, the
preparation of the schedule becomes
a question of facilities in relation to
time.
The last two attributes, the square
deal and common sense or good judg-
ment, do not require discussion or
argument. They must be there and
are included or implied in our assump-
tions. A dishonest man cannot be a
success at anything unless it is in be-
ing a crook, and the rattle-brained
person cannot be anything successful
but possibly an actor or an artist with
a very sensitive temperament and us-
ually not then.
Assuming then that a man is hon-
est and mentally competent, as we did
in the first premise, there is no reason
why he cannot, with these principles


265
before him, study and train himself
in their use and observation. Prob-
ably nine times out of ten such a
trained, disciplined executive will be
better balanced and hence more suc-
cessful than the one who is naturally
more efficient in one or two of the
principles and either wholly or par-
tially lacking in some of the others.
Some of the great executives of his-
tory owed their success to a single one
of the principles determining a suc-
cessful executive. One has only to
read the life history of Napoleon and
General Grant to have this fact firmly
established. Modern times set forth
perhaps stronger than does history the
fact that many of our great executives
owe their success to the possession of
a few natural qualifications, rather
than to balanced executive ability.
There is no question bat that the man
with the natural talents is and always
will be successful, but he cannot fill
all the great demand for executives,
and he can be a much more successful
and balanced one by a study of his
talents and perhaps those he lacks.
The opportunity is here for young
men to fit themselves for the best po-
sitions and the best service to the
world in training themselves to fill
this great demand. As previously
pointed out, it is occasioned by the
modern centralization of industry,
which will grow rather than decrease.
The demand for executives will con-
tinuously become more insistent, and
those who take advantage of the op-
portunity offered to train themselves
for this work will profit themselves
and those seeking their services.


BY PROFESSOR JOHN C. PARKER, '01 E
The power generating system of the
Rochester Railway and Light Com-
1 any consists of ^ main steam gener-
ating system and a group of hydraulic
plants, each having a comparatively
snic!l storage of water and supplemen-
tary Niagara energy purchased on a
schedule requiring that power be
paid for on the basis of the maximum
use in any two minutes of each day.
It is therefore desirable that all load
fluctuations be taken off the Niagara
purchase and imposed on the local
steam and hydraulic plants. As the
energy output from the hydraulic
plants can be utilized under varying
load at somewhat better efficiency than
can the generation by steam, it is
important that the hydraulic storage
be kept quite full up to the time of
the sharp evening load peak and then
utilised to spare the steam station. On
the other hand, since any water wist^d
over the dam would be the equiva-
lent of so much coal thrown away, it
is essential that water should at no
time spill over the power house dams.
These two conditions have imposed
on the operations two corollary re-
quirements: namely, that the steam
station operator have at all times an
accurate knowledge of the amount of
power being received at the Niagara
transformer station, some three miles
distant, and that the hydraulic opera-
tors be instantaneously and accurately
informed, to the fraction of an inch,
just what is the level of water in the
furebay.
At first thought it might seem that
this latter condition would be met by
consulting the pressure gage on the
penstock in the power house, but since
rack losses and friction in the pen-
stock, which vary with the load, may
be a matter of many inches or even
feet, and since the scale of the pres-
sure gage may register a couple of
hundred feet, it is evident that such
a gage would not read so closely as
is desired and that, though it did, the
readings would be deceptive, since
they would show the forebay level
minus the variable losses in head.
It was desired that the apparatus
used should be simple and free from
all calibration coefficients of complex
nature, and, if possible, be autograph-
ic; i.e., make a chart from hour to
hour showing how well the operator
has performed his duty.
The method used was the familiar
Wheatstone's bridge principle. A pair
of leads was conducted from a source
of D. C. voltage to a resistor at the
forebay where the voltage was im-
pressed across the ends of a coil of
wire wound on a fibre tube about four
inches in diameter and four feet long.
A light contact finger actuated by a
float made contact with the resistor at
a point determined by the height of
the water level in the forebay, and
from this finger a lead returned to the
power house. At the power house this
third lead was attached to a second
contact finger making a light connec-
tion on the surface of a second coil
bridged across the above pair of po-
tential leads.
If, now, the two fingers were at
corresponding points on the two re-


267
sistors, no current would flow in the
third wire, while current would flow
in one direction or the other if either
contact were displaced from a posi-
tion similar to that occupied by the
other. If then a polarized relay, that
is, one which moves toward one or
the other of two contacts, depending
upon the direction of current flow,
were interposed in the contact lead it
might in either of its contact-making
positions actuate a magnet or a small
motor in such a way as to move the
power house contact. The latter would
then take a position similar to the po-
sition of the float contact at the fore-
bay, at which time no current would
flow in the contact lead. The relay
would go dead, maintain its neutral
position and kill either the magnets or
the small motor until the forebay
level is again changed.
Such a combination is offered by
the Westinghouse curve-drawing D.C.
millammeter, provided the loading
spring is removed from the meter ele-
ment allowing it to act as a polarized
relay. The dash-pots of the meter
and motor elements have the advan-
tage of making the relay non-hunting
and causing the Wheatstone bridge
contact to stop dead in its position
when the relay becomes neutral. In
this apparatus the meter also carried
the clock, pen and paper equipment to
give the desired autographic feature.
This device might have been made
to give automatic control of the power
output from the hydraulic station, re-
spectively opening or closing the
wicket gates of the turbine when the
water in the forebay becomes too high
or too low. Such an automatic control
will now be described in connection
with the long distance metering con-
nections of the Niagara receiving
station and the main steam generating
station. It may be noted that the
same methods are adaptable to the
automatic control of the generator
load since it is a function of the quan-
tities metered by an instrument of the
Westinghouse curve-drawing type.
It should be understood in the first
place that the load taken by an alter-
nating current generator operated in
parallel with other alternators is de-
termined not by the voltage at which
the machine is set to generate but by
its phase relation to other machines
on the same bus. In other words, if
the throttle or wicket gates of the
prime mover be set to take a given
amount of steam or water power,
change in field excitation cannot
change the load on the alternator so
long as its speed is fixed by the neces-
sity that it operate synchronously with
the bus voltage.
On the other hand, if the governor
of the prime mover be so adjusted
that the machine tries to operate at a
speed higher than synchronism, then
the machine must load up electrically
to such a point that the load torque
will bring the speed down to that dic-
tated by the bus frequency. It so
happens that modern steam and hy-
draulic turbines usually have a small
motor on the governor to stiffen or
weaken the loading spring for pur-
poses of speed control. If this motor
be actuated by a suitable relay the
generator can thus be loaded or un-
loaded with either at the operator's
volition or automatically accomplish
any designed purpose.
As an example, take the Rochester
case where it was desired to keep the
Niagara load constant. The watt-
meter needle at the Niagara receiving
station might have been set between
two contacts, one just below, the other
just above, the desired constant load


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Fie. I.
and the circuits so arranged that when
the needle made either contact, cur-
rent would flow from the needle
through that contact, thence through a
long lead to the steam station where
it would energize one of two relays
starting the governor control motor
on one of-the steam turbines. This
would cause the turbo-alternator to
load up or to drop load onto the paral-
lel Niagara system, as the require-
ments of the case might dictate, until
the Niagara load came back to the
desired amount, when the relay would
open, bringing the governor control
motor to a standstill until some change
in the load on the entire system again
disturbed the Niagara load.
The chief difficulty with such an
arrangement is that the steam turbine
would be kept in a state of constant
unrest, imposing huge loads suddenly
and as suddenly unloading the boilers
with distinctly detrimental effects on
the life and operation of the equip-
ment.
The ideal arrangement would be to
have slight load changes at the Niag-
ara receiving station set the governor
control in the steam station in motion
after a sensible lapse of time, and to
have the steam station respond very
quickly to large load variations on
the Niagara system, at the same time
insuring that the governor control
motor stop the instant the Niagara
wattmeter indicates that load has
come back to normal.
The method of approximating this
ideal was to have the Westinghouse
curve-drawing wattmeter at the Niag-
ara receiving station, through its
motor mechanism which is capable of
carrying load without impairing meter
accuracy, compress or extend a spring
as the load increases or decreases.
This spring at its outer end is coupled

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
to a dash-pot whose plunger s moved
rapidly if the spring distortion is
great, and slowly, if slight. This gives
the inverse time element in the opera-
tion of the plunger which carries the
governor control motor contacts.
As a matter of fact the weight of
the dash-pot parts imposes on the de-
vice one unhappy condition, namely,
that the spring must develop some
force, that is, there must be some load
variation, and quite an appreciable
one, before the dash-pot plunger be-
gins to feel the force of the spring.
It might be possible to design the
dash-pot with very light moving parts
but this would give a slow return
when the load came back to normal.
Therefore two springs were resorted
to, each under an initial tension suf-
ficient to overcome the dead weight
of the plunger, yet leaving this weight
available to cause quick return.
The detail follows: mlt m.,, (Fig.
2) are the motor magnets of the
wattmeter charged with the duty of
moving the pen at the dictation of the
light meter element, the normal con-
struction of this type of curve-draw-
ing meter. Since these magnets have
no metering function, but merely
perform the manual labor of moving
the pen, it is evident that the extra
load imposed on them by the devices
shown at the right will not affect the
accuracy of the meter as such. From
the T or double bell crank a rod leads
off to the right carrying, on an in-
sulated block, a contact which slides
on resistor R fed from the distant
steam station over lead -\-L and -L.
These leads with the relay LR com-,
municate with a curve-drawing ele-
ment in the steam station, giving there
at all times a chart of the Niagara
loads measured three miles away. This
arrangement, then, is quite similar to
the one described above for water
level recording and shown diagramat-
ically in Fig. 1.
The rod from the wattmeter pen P
extends further to the right and ter-
minates within a sleeve S which with
cap C keeps it in alignment with bar-
rel B. To the rod is soldered a pierced
disc d which just clears a ring r
which is soldered midlength of the
barrel. The disc and the ring are of
the same thickness and have pressed
against either side by springs s', s"
the washers isf, «/" the spring tension
being adjusted by screwing in or out
the cap C and the capped end of
sleeve S. Sleeve S terminates in a
T-head carrying two outstanding pins
so interconnecting with the T-lever T
that motion of barrel D in either di-
rection will raise the plunger of the
dash-pot D.
If we designate as neutral the po-
sition of each part of the mechanism
when the pen is at rest at the load for
which the control device is set, it is
evident that an increase in the Niag-
ara load will actuate the magnet w2
moving the pen and rod at P to the
right until the pen indicates the new
load. This motion carries the disc d
and washer w" with it, to the right,
increasing the tension in s" by an


271
amount proportional to the power va-
riation and leaving the tension of s'
reacted on by the cap C and ring r.
If the initial tension of s" was just
equal to the weight of the dash-pot
parts at D it is clear that nothing
more than an infinitesmal movement
of L would be required to give some
extra tension to s" to be used in grad-
ually overcoming the dash-pot effect
and that the greater such motion the
greater will be the speed with which
the barrel will given a given distance.
Assuming suitable contacts to be
connected to the governor control mo-
tor actuated by a contact point prop-
erly attached to the barrel, it is seen
that we have secured our inverse time
element. By the initial tension in j'
and s" we have nullified the effect of
the weight of the parts of D, which
would otherwise have required some
movement of P before they were bal-
anced. Such movement would ob-
viously interfere with the accuracy of
a load control.
When the load control relays have
brought load to normal, P, B, and S
will return to neutral instantaneously,
leaving the dash-pot to take its lowest
position as rapidly as it may. This
is facilitated by the costruction of the
knife-edged ring valve V on the very
loose piston U, the V-edge being used
to prevent binding.
The electrical contacts to the gov-
ernor control motor might have been
made directly from a contact spring
carried on the barrel and touching at
C or C" according to the barrel posi-
tion, thereby operating relay coil / or
r" in the distant steam station. In such
a design r" would load the steam sta-
tion and relieve Niagara, r" doing the
opposite. But the distance between
contacts C and C" would operate to
give inaccuracy in load control since
it requires some movement of the
barrel to set the relays in operation.
This difficulty would be minimized by
the introduction of a motion multiply-
ing lever between the barrel and the
contact points.
It is seen that a certain range of
non-operation can be secured by sep-
arating these points; normal load may
be fixed by carying them bodily to the
right or left thereby fixing the neutral
position of L, and hence of P.
The inverse time element may be
adjusted by the use of heavier or
lighter fluid in the dash-pot and also
by moving it in or out on lever T.
As a slight excess of load for over
two minutes penalizes the Niagara
customer for the whole 24 hours,
while a deficiency of power demand
costs only the coal burned during its
duration, it is clear that loading relay
r" requires a shorter time element than
does r\ This is secured by making
the pins /&gt;' and p" adjustable on the
T-head of sleeve S and placing p" so
that it has a longer radius, measured
from the pivot of T, than /&gt;'.
The combination of spring car-
tridges, T levers and dash-pot might
evidently be used on such an automatic
control function as water-level in a
forebay, the position of control gates
or any other quantity capable of being
translated into a line motion of such a
point as P and where the inverse time
element is of value to prevent hunting.


1866-1915
Born in Hanover in 1866; getting
his earlier education in the Hanover
Gymnasium and Technical School;
later attending the Universities of
Strassburg, Berlin and Marburg; by
the last in 1892 appointed to the Doc-
torate; and in the same year coming
to America, Karl Eugen Guthe be-
came a teacher of Physics in the Uni-
versitiy of Michigan in 1893 and
from that time, except for an absence
of six years, faithfully served the Uni-
versity until his death last September.
For the last six years he had been
Professor of Physics and for the last
three Dean of the Graduate School.
In 1903 he went to Washington as
Associate Physicist in the Bureau of
Standards and in 1905 to the Univer-
sity of Iowa as Professor of Physics.
His service was not only through his
profession and his administrative of-
fice but also through his character and
personality.
As a teacher of Physics he was
faithful and inspiring, sympathetic
with his students and loyal to the best
ideals, adding to his teacher's unusual
equipment and ability an enthusiasm
for original investigation. His pub-
lications, including many technical ar-
ticles and several books, of course
show the productivity of his mind, but
the influence he had on his students
was and must long remain a very sig-
nificant part of his contribution to
science and the values of science.
As Dean of the Graduate School he
rendered his most notable service. For
many years the School was only a bu-
reau within the College of Literature,
Science and the Arts, -but in 1912 it
was made a distinct department, in its
organization related on terms of equal-
ity to all the colleges and schools of
the University. This change stands
out as one of the most important
events in the University's whole his-
tory, setting up as it did an open and
permanent challenge to all parts of
the University in general for a living
interest in something beyond mere
technical requirements and in partic-
ular for advanced studies and for ac-
tive research and speculation inde-
pendently of professional demands
and rewards; and so important a
change, affecting such vital interests,
made selection of the first dean as
difficult as it was critical. Dr. Guthe
was chosen and the testimony is gen-
eral that he filled the important office
well, applying his fine idealism and his
skill as an administrator effectively
and so doing his leader's part in giv-
ing the School its excellent founda-
tion.
But with the teacher and the ad-
ministrator there was always the man.
Generous, genial, of positive integrity,
with control and fairness in judgment,
independent but incapable of offensive
partisanship, he was certainly superior
to most men in what makes strong
character and lovable personality.
Those who knew him found in him,
not only the true scholar and the faith-
ful and efficient officer, but also the
most genial friend. It is indeed the
lot of few to serve time and place well
in the three ways of profession, office,
and personal character.


Karl Eugen Guthe


BY PROFESSOR C. T. JOHNSTON.'95
Mr. Tinkham has submitted a dis-
cussion of some phases of the doctrine
of riparian rights as this Common
Law rule is construed by the courts.
It is gratifying to find engineers be-
coming more interested in this sub-
ject. The longer they study it, the
more firmly convinced they will be
that there is something fundamentally
wrong with the doctrine. The courts
have called on the engineer for tech-
nical advice quite generally. On such
occasions the engineer has always been
reminded as to his limitations. He
should not assume to know much
about the law or the principles on
which it is supposed to be based. The
court does not realize that even in
this country the engineer has settled
more controversies over water than
has the judiciary. It does not know
that this has been accomplished with-
out cost to water users and that all
concerned have been greatly pleased.
When men like Mr. Tinkham and
Professor J. B. Davis begin to study
the doctrine of riparian rights, it
means that the foundation has begun
for a different kind of administrative
structure, under which water re-
sources will ultimately be governed
here. It may seem to us now that a
change for the better appears almost
hopeless, but we should remember
that in States like California and Ore-
gon, where the Common Law doctrine
seemed impregnable, it is gradually
being broken clown. It has but little
recognition now in a single Western
State. Professor Davis and Mr.
Tinkham have clone something toward
making the existing rules of the court
a little more clear. The brief com-
ments I submit at this time relate to
the future rather than to the present
or the past.
Public lands have been administered
for many years by the National Gov-
ernment. They are surveyed by pub-
lic authority. Public officers assist the
settler to locate and then advise him
as to the procedure which must be
followed to secure patent to the land
occupied. The State then provides a
place of record and prescribes rules
governing conveyancing. Land titles
are protected in a fairly satisfactory
way. We might imagine a govern-
ment which ignores this responsibil-
ity. The courts would then be obliged
to perform this service under some
ancient and possibly negative rule bor-
rowed from a past civilization. Our
highways have administrative super-
vision. This is growing with each
year. National forests are adminis-
tered by men who understand the sci-
ence of forestry. The list may be
extended almost indefinitely. We can.
with some reason, ask why it is that
water resources remain under the con-
trol of the courts? Streams and lakes
stand almost alone in this particular.
An able administration of streams
and lakes demands first, a knowledge
of surveying. It is necessary to know
their location and something of their
dimensions. The specialist in hy-
draulics then determines the discharge
of streams and by careful surveys he
ascertains the capacity of storage ba-
sins and the available head for power


275
development. The engineer lays out
irrigation and drainage systems. He
understands their relation. Cities and
towns spring up and the engineer pro-
vides supplies of pure water for them
and then installs sewer systems. The
Army Engineer makes river and har-
bor improvements and the United
States Coast and Geodetic Survey lo-
cates our coast lines. Every use of
water demands the services of an en-
gineer. This being the case, it seems
strange that streams should be admin-
istered under a doctrine which gives
to every person owning lands along a
stream the right to demand the waters
of such stream to pass his lands un-
diminished in quantity and undefiled
in quality. This is the doctrine of rip-
arian rights, as defined by the English
House of Lords over 80 years ago.
The rules of the court, in effect today,
are presumed to be built upon this
doctrine. They are so numerous and
so conflicting that even a brief list
of them cannot be given at this time.
Wherever the doctrine of riparian
rights is upheld, the courts control the
situation. The legal profession can-
not appreciate the natural laws which
must be respected before a just and
equitable administration of water re-
sources is possible. Only the engineer
understands these laws. The principles
underlying a technical administration
of streams are simple. They can be
understood and appreciated by the
public. They can all be enumerated
and described in a few words. They
cannot be miscontrued. This alone
should promise relief and reform. To
replace hundreds of complex and con-
flicting rules with a few essential prin-
ciples never leads to confusion. It
does not bring a revolution. It leads
to order, confidence, and respect for
government. When these principles
are substituted for the rules of the
court, the administration of water re-
sources passes into the hands of en-
gineers. Past experience demon-
strates that they are capable of per-
forming this important service.
In all countries which have made
progress in the administration of
water resources, the engineer has led
the way. He has discovered the prin-
ciples that should apply, framed the
laws incorporating these principles,
then taken an active part in their ad-
ministration. Italy,/Spain, Egypt, In-
dia and Australia afford profitable
examples for study. Many of our
Western States have abrogated the
Common Law doctrine and substituted
something better in its place. The best
technical administrations perform their
work so well that litigation over water
is practically unknown. Under such
administrations the rich and the poor,
the powerful and the weak are all
treated alike. Public interests are rec-
ognized and preferred rights and uses
are defined and protected. The prob-
lems which bother us in Michigan con-
cerning riparian boundaries are un-
known. Those who own land bor-
dering on lakes and streams know that
their possessions terminate at the
meander survey or the mean high
water mark. Beyond this boundary
is public property. When this rule
applies, general satisfaction prevails.
Individuals do not have the opportun-
ity to impose upon their neighbors or
to lay claim to resources which were
not included in their patent from the
General Government.
Engineers cannot study the history
of technical administrations here or
abroad without some feeling of pride.
They should unite in a demand for
something better for Michigan and


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
other States. We may rest assured
that no change will take place until
the engineer realizes the situation and
then becomes active in advocating bet-
ter things. The engineer seldom real-
izes that he owes a debt to the State
and to the public, his neighbors. The
lawyer and the physician sacrifice
much in time and labor in the way of
public service. The engineer is always
surprised, when he enters this field
with plans which promise good for all,
that he has the support of the best and
wisest men of all other professions.
The courts will gladly give up this
kind of work when they find that a
better administration may be had un-
der statute law. The American judi-
ciary has been imposed upon because
the engineer has not followed the trail
so plainly blazed by men of his own
profession in older countries. We
should feel thankful to those who are
studying the situation as it exists.
We should follow this by a careful
investigation of technical administra-
tions at home and abroad. When the
engineer is qualified to advise, he
will have a respectful hearing, and
progress thereafter will be rapid.
ALFRED NOBLE
BY GARDNER S. WILLIAMS. '89
The portrait of Alfred Noble,
which appears in this issue of
The Technic, was taken upon the
occasion of what was probably Mr.
Noble's last trip into the field. The
site was at the Cloquet Dam of the
Great Northern Power Company,
about twenty miles northeast of Du-
luth, and the photograph was taken
March 2, 1914. Mr. Noble died at
New York, on April 19, following.
The memorial of Mr. Noble pre-
pared for the American Society of
Civil Engineers, begins:
"Our America, America of the Twenti-
eth Century, enlightened, progressive, pros-
perous beyond any other country of the
world, would not be what it is today if it
had not brought forth an army of engin-
eers, an army small in numbers but mighty
in accomplishment, always in the van of
progress, making plain the highways of
development in which the multitude
marches on to attainments ever higher and
higher."
Among the American Engineers
none occupied a higher rank than Al-
fred Noble, and many have placed him
foremost. By achievement and char-
acter he is in every sense entitled to
the admiration of the graduates of
the University of Michigan, from
which he received his degree as Civil
Engineer in the famous class of '70,
which included in its roster Justice
William R. Day of the United States
Supreme Court, and Robert S. Wood-
ward, President of the Carnegie In-
stitution.
Alfred Noble was born upon a
farm in the Town of Livonia, Wayne
County, just across the Washtenaw
County Line on August 7, 1844, the
son of Charles and Lovina D. Noble.
His early education was obtained in
the district school and at the Union
High School at Plymouth, and his
life until the age of eighteen was
spent upon the farm.

Two days after his eighteenth birth-
day he enlisted in Company C, 24th
Michigan Volunteers, which regi-
ment became a part of the famous
Iron Brigade. Before enlisting he
obtained the consent of his mother,
who had previously opposed his going
to war. To her he gave a promise to
abstain from playing cards while in
the army, a promise to which he ad-
hered strictly.
Attached to the Army of the Poto-
mac, he followed its vicissitudes from
Fredericksburg through Chancellors-
ville, Gettysburg and the battles be-
fore Richmond, and was mustered out
in June, 1865. He then obtained a
clerical position in the War Depart-
ment at Washington, which he, held
until September, 1867, saving his
earnings and preparing himself with
the aid of private tutors to enter col-
lege, and matriculated in the Univer-
sity of Michigan as a sophomore in
the Class of 1870. He became a mem-
ber of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity
and was elected Vice-President of his
class in his Junior year. He was also
connected with the Alpha Nu and
Philozetian Societies. During his col-
lege course he was absent about half
of the time, being employed as a re-
corder on the United States Lake Sur-
vey, but kept up with his classmates
and was graduated with them.
Upon graduation Mr. Noble en-
tered the service of the government on
the lakes, being employed in the sur-
vey of harbors around the Lower Pen-
insula of Michigan, and in October,
1870, was put in charge of the work
at Sault Ste. Marie, where in 1873 it
was found necessary to begin a new
lock. This structure, known as the
"Weitzel Lock," was designed and
constructed under his direction as U.
S. Assistant Engineer to General God-
frey Weitzel of the U. S. Engineer
Corps. The Weitzel lock was the
largest in the world at that time and
introduced the novel feature of filling
and emptying by means of culverts
underneath instead of through ports in
the head and foot gates, for which Mr.
Noble was responsible.
Alfred Noble
As the work at the lock neared com-
pletion in 1882, believing that he had
attained all the advancement possible
in the Government Service, he re-
signed his position and became Resi-
dent Engineer on the bridge then
building across the Red River at
Shreveport, Louisiana, with about
one-half the salary he had been for-
merly receiving. Then followed en-
gagements on the Northern Pacific
Railroad in connection with bridges,


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
track and bridge foundations at the
Snake River in Washington, Clark's
Fork of the Columbia and the Marent
Gulch in Montana and St. Louis Bay
at Duluth, Minnesota. After a period
of bridge shop inspection and office
design, in 1886 he became Resident
Engineer on the Washington Bridge
across the Hudson River at New
York City. Following this Mr. Noble
was successively Resident Engineer of
the bridge across the Ohio at Cairo,
Illinois, and of that across the Mis-
sissippi at Memphis, Tennessee, which
latter engagement was followed by a
partnership with the late George S.
Morison, lasting till 1894. During
this partnership he was Assistant
Chief Engineer on the bridges across
the Mississippi at Alton, Illinois, and
across the Missouri at Bellefontaine,
Missouri, and Leavenworth, Kansas.
In 1894 he entered private practice
with offices in Chicago and was en-
gaged upon numerous works involv-
ing questions of hydraulics and foun-
dations.
Upon the creation by Congress in
1895 °f tne Commission to investi-
gate the proposed Nicaragua Canal
he was appointed by President Cleve-
land as the civilian member and visit-
ed both Nicaragua and Panama. In
1887 he was appointed by President
McKinley a member of the Board of
Engineers on Deep Waterways, fre-
quently incorrectly referred to as the
United States Deep Water Ways Com-
mission, and in 1899 the same execu-
tive again called for his services and
appointed him a member of the Isth-
mian Canal Commission. Prior to
this he had been appointed by the
State Department as arbitrator in a
dispute between a citizen of this coun-
try and the Government of San Do-
mingo.
In 1900 he was appointed by the
Governor of New York, a member
of the Engineer Board to advise the
State Engineer relative to the New
York State Barge Canal, and in 1901
served on the Commisison which re-
ported upon the protection of the City
of Galveston, Texas, from damage by
inundation following the great Gal-
veston flood, which works have proved
the effectiveness of their design dur-
ing the past season.
In 1901, in partnership with Mr.
Ralph Modjeski, he had charge of the
design and construction of the bridge
across the Mississippi at Thebes, Il-
linois, with which he retained connec-
tion until 1905.
From 1902 to 1909 Mr. Noble was
Chief Engineer of the East River Di-
vision of the New York extension of
the Pennsylvania Railroad, having
charge of the new Pennsylvania Sta-
tion and the tunnels under the East
River, a work which in intricacy of
design, difficulty of achievement and
commercial importance considerably
exceeds that on the Isthmus of Pan-
'ama. During this period, in 1905, he
was again called to the service of the
Government, this time by President
Roosevelt, as a member of the Inter-
national Board of Consulting Engin-
eers on the Panama Canal. Here Mr.
Noble did probably his most famous
work when he headed the minority
of five in the report favoring the lock
canal, which report, adopted by Con-
gress, has passed into history, and its
wisdom can not be tested by events.
One need only think of the effect of
the slides which have again and again
obstructed the present canal, if they
were to occur in a sea level canal,
with its bottom sixty feet deeper in
the earth, to realize the correctness of
the judgment of Mr. Noble and his as-


279
sociates. Before the completion of
the work he was once more called to
advise regarding it in connection with
the lock foundations and the Gatun
Dam.
Following 1910, Mr. Noble engaged
in private practice with headquarters
in New York, associating with him-
self Mr. Silas H. Woodard of the class
of 1896, and was employed on vari-
ous occasions by the United States
and Canadian Governments and by the
City of New York, as well as by many
private corporations. During this pe-
riod he was initiated into the Michi-
gan Chapter of Tau Beta Pi.
Mr. Noble was a past president of
the American Society of Civil Engin-
eers, of the American Institute of
Consulting Engineers, and of the
Western Society of Engineers, and an
Honorary Member of the Institute of
Civil Engineers of Great Britain. He
received the degree of LL.D. from his
Alma Mater in 1895 and from the
University of Wisconsin in 1904, was
awarded the John Fritz Medal for
"Notable Achievements as a Civil En-
gineer" in 1910, and the Elliott Cres-
son Medal of the Franklin Institute
for "Distinguished Achievements in
the Field of Engineering" in 1912.
A very complete biography of Mr.
Noble has recently appeared in the
Proceedings of the American Society
of Civil Engineers for August, 1915,
from which liberal extracts have been
made in the preparation of the fore-
going, the indebtedness to which is
hereby acknowledged. So much for
history. Something of his personal
characteristics may be gathered from
the following experiences:
The writer's personal acquaintance
with Mr. Noble dates from 1897 when
the latter was frequently called to
Detroit in connection with his duties
as a member of the Board of Engin-
eers on Deep Water Ways, in which
he was associated with another dis-
tinguished alumnus of Michigan, the
late George Y. Wisner of the Class of
'65, by whom he and the writer were
introduced. Being told by Mr. Wis-
ner that experiments upon the flow of
water in the mains of the Detroit
Water System were to be made that
evening with the aid of a Pitot Tube,
Mr. Noble at once asked where the
work was to be done and if he might
look it over, an earnest invitation to
do so being the writer's response.
About 7130 that evening on riding up
to a gate well at the corner of Alex-
andrine Avenue and River Street, in
which the Pitot Tube was being oper-
ated, the massive form of Mr. Noble
was seen emerging coatless from a
sixteen by twenty-inch manhole after
an inspection of the apparatus at the
bottom of a twelve-foot-deep gate well,
lighted only by a kerosene lantern.
This was my first view of Mr. Noble
in action, but the experience was char-
acteristic. In such a case a less in-
terested visitor might well have con-
tented himself with an examination of
such apparatus as was above ground,
but Mr. Noble was no superficial ob-
server, nor did he ever do things by
halves.
Some years later while waiting for
a train at a way-station near Quebec,
the subject of the relations between
an Engineer and his employer came
up and Mr. Noble said: "As long as
I worked for a man I would of course
carry out his instructions, but if I did
not agree with them I would try not
to work for him very long."
Mr. Noble was very fond of out-
door life and for many years spent
a vacation on the north shore of Lake


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Superior where the rainbow trout
woos the fisherman. On the occasion
of my last trip with him he showed
me a small blueprint which he carried
in his note book, on which were plot-
ted to weight and length as co-ordin-
ates the data of some two hundred
more or less of rainbow trout, with
a mean curve drawn and its equation
computed for reducing length to
weight. The same thoroughness
which characterized his work was
here exemplified in his play.
Mr. Noble rarely referred to his
army experience, but while riding on
a train with him one day, I having
observed that he did not use tobacco,
asked him if he ever had used it and
he replied that he had not. I said
that it seemed remarkable that in the
life he had led, particularly having
been in the army through the Civil
War, he had not become a devotee of
the weed in some form. His reply was
that it was his army experience which
confirmed him against it, as he then
saw so much discomfort and misery
endured by those accustomed to its
use when they were where they could
not get it.
Another reference to his army ex-
perience is related by Mr. Eugene W.
Stern, who was the Secretary of the
American Institute of Consulting En-
gineers while Mr. Noble was its
President, to the effect that on being
asked to name the requisites of a
good soldier, Mr. Noble replied that
"Ability to withstand hunger, fatigue
and hard marching were very essential
qualities, but to be a good runner was
also a very useful attribute."
Mr. Noble had a multitude of
friends, and to all, young and old, re-
nowned and inexperienced, he was
equally friendly, and very many there
were who availed themselves of his
counsel in their personal affairs, and
few indeed who did not adopt his ad-
vice, always freely given at the call
of friendship.
Sterling intergrity, thoroughness,
unselfishness and modesty, coupled
with a dry humor characterized Alfred
Noble.
In 1871 he married Miss Georgia
Speechly of Ann Arbor, and is sur-
vived by one son, Frederick C. Noble
of the Class of '94.
The writers of the Memoir to which
reference has already been made, after
considering his college relations, pre-
sent this eulogy:
"***** We have no thought of
derogating from the honor of any
other graduate of that great seat of
learning when we say that the proud-
est name upon its roster is that of
Alfred Noble; and that Ann Arbor
can set before its students no higher
professional inspiration than the story
of Alfred Noble's life and work."


The Barton plant of the Eastern
Michigan Edison Co. is located on the
Huron River about one and one-half
miles northwest of the City of Ann
Arbor, Michigan. The plant was
placed in operation in July, 1913, but
there was no opportunity for testing
until July, 1915, because of the re-
quirements of operation.

Plant.
At the time the Barton plant was
constructed provisions were made for
sured behind the racks. Accordingly
the inlet to these pipes was placed
four feet back of the racks and a
foot above the penstock floor and flush
with the penstock wall. Also two inch
pipes were placed at several points
leading into the draft tube so that
measurements could be made of the
velocity by use of a Pitot tube.
In the tail race a wall was construct-


283
ed separating the river from the dis-
charge of the turbines, the wall ter-
minating with foundations for a weir
68 feet long. The contract required
that the water during the test was to
be measured at the weir according to
Bazin's formula. Therefore, the in-
let to the gauge wells was placed about
16 feet upstream from the face of the
weir. In Bazin's experiments the in-
let to the gauge wells was at the bottom
and flush with the channel, but in the
Barton test because of the length of
the weir, a concrete box was con-
structed joining the gauge wells on
opposite sides of the channel. The in-
lets to this box were 2-inch holes
spaced 4 feet apart and flush with
bottom of the channel.
The foundation for the weir proper
was constructed with pockets for ver-
tical posts spaced 6 feet center to
center.
The weir was constructed by plac-
ing 4x6 vertical posts braced with
4x4 timbers. Four by six stringers
were attached to these posts to serve
as a support to the face of the weir,
which consisted of 2-inch matched
sheathing placed vertically so that the
swelling of the lumber would not
change the elevation of the crest of
the weir. This gave the weir a
smooth upstream face. The crest was
formed of 34 x 5-inch milled plate with
straight edges and sharp corners.
Slots were cut in the plate so that it
could be adjusted and the plate was
very carefully levelled before the test.
Hook gauges which read to .001 of a
foot were used in the gauge wells at
the ends of the weir.
Prior to the test cross sections were
taken upstream of the weir in order
that the discharges over various sec-
tions of the weir having different
depths of approach channel could be
computed separately to allow for ve-
locity of approach. Care was taken
during the test to allow free access of
the air to the underside of the sheet
of water over the weir.
The method used to ascertain the
"zero" reading of the hook gauges in
the wells with respect to the elevation
of the crest of the weir was as follows:
A hook gauge was secured to a ver-
tical post about the center of the weir
and close to the weir plate, and an
entirely separate platform was con-
structed for the observer. The head
over the weir at the time of making
the determination was about % of an
inch. A temporary well was therefore
constructed about 6 inches high and
without ends. This was placed so
the hook of the gauge came at about
the center of it, and effectively pre-
vented disturbances to the surface at
the hook by wind or the discharge over
the weir. A series of from 10 to 20
readings was then taken on each of
the three hook gauges simultaneously
to establish the relation between the
two gauges in the wells and the gauge
on the weir. Then the hook of the
gauge on the weir was carefully
brought to the same elevation as the
crest of the weir by means of a small
hand level placed on the top of the
crest plate and on the point of the
hook of the hook gauge. Five read-
ings were taken with the level in one
position and five readings with the
level turned end for end. From the
readings thus obtained the "zero" or
equivalent crest readings of the gauges
in the wells was determined. The
points of the hook of the gauge
formed an angle of 900. With this
the observers had no difficulty in set-
ting the point of the hook to the blunt
point elevation of the surface of the
water.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Head.
The elevation of the head water was
observed directly from the surface of
the water in a glass tube attached to
a scale connected by a hose to the pipe
in the walls which opened to the pen-
stock just inside the trash racks. Care
was taken to see that all the air was
removed from the hose.
The tail water was measured by
bottle floats, a float being placed in
a box in the stop log groove located
about 2 feet downstream from the
end of the draft tube. The opening of
the gauge box was flush with the build-
ing wall. Because of the disturbance
at the discharge end of the draft tube
it was found necessary to use the
readings of the gauge of Unit No. 1
while testing Unit No. 2 and vice
versa.
Power.
The power output was measured by
a calibrated watthour meter and an
indicating watt meter. The speed of
the machine was determined by a
mechanical speed counter giving total
revolutions. Most of the power was
absorbed by a water rheostat, the re-
mainder was connected directly to the
outgoing transmission lines of the
power house. The electrical measur-
ing instruments were connected on the
2300 volt bus bar system so that the
power output was the actual output
at the switchboard of the station, as
required by the contract.
Conduct of Test.
Before starting the test the water
was removed from the wheel pit of
the unit to be tested and the water
wheel carefully inspected. The gates
were closed tightly and opened to the
full width and observations made of
the gate position indicated on the gate
indicator at the extreme positions,
the measurement of the gate opening
in inches for each tenth indicated on
the dial having been previously made.
While the water was out of one wheel
pit the leakage test was run on the
other wheel. In this way the leakage
through the turbine gate when closed
was determined, for each unit. After
the inspection was completed the wheel
pit was refilled and another leakage
test run of two simultaneous units for
a check.
The first test was run by opening
the gates of the wheel until the dial
on the governor registered an open-
ing of .4. At this gate opening three
runs were made. One at normal speed,
one 10% below normal speed and one
10% above normal speed. Each run
was for an interval of five minutes
during which time the weir gauges, the
head and tail gauges and indicating
wattmeter were read as rapidly as
possible so as to obtain the greatest
number of readings on each instru-
ment for the fixed condition of the
water wheel. The speed counter and
the watthour meter readings were tak-
en at the end of five minutes. After
each run the load was changed for
run to follow and an interval of from
8 to 10 minutes during which time the
gauges were not read was allowed to
obtain a period of uniform condition.
It took about five minutes after a
change in load for the discharge at
the weir to reach steady conditions.
The extra three to five minutes was
an extra surety for uniform con-
ditions.
It was necessary to pay particular
attention to the sheet of water pass-
ing over the weir to see that it was
sufficiently aerated. Air was intro-
duced under the sheet at the ends of
the weir and by placing "roofs"


285
formed by two boards nailed together
in the form of a sharp V at intervals
along the weir. These were supported
by fastening to the weir and to a plat-
form about three feet downstream
from the weir.
Having these, the efficiency of the
turbine may he computed.
The first is the difference in eleva-
tion between the water surfaces in
the penstock and at the end of the
draft tube. The head and tail gauge

records were averaged over the period
of the run, reduced to a common
datum and subtracted.
Their second item is equal to the
discharge over the weir less the leak-
age through the other turbine. The
readings of each hook gauge during
one test were averaged and the mean
of the two averages gave the elevation
of the water surfaces above the weir.

greater accuracy was necessary here
than in determining the head on the
wheels. An error of o.ooi ft. in
measuring the head on the weir meant
an error of about one-tenth of one
per cent in the efficiency of the tur-
bines, an error having a considerable
monetary value under the terms of
the contract.
The horsepower at the turbine shaft
was computed from the output of the
generator as measured by the instru-
ments on the switchboard. At the time
the generator was built a shop test
was made of its efficiency under vary-
ing load and power factors, and at
the time of working up the test these
data were plotted in the form of a
kilowatt-efficiency curve. The K.W.
output of the generator multiplied by
1.34 and divided by its efficiency as
shown on the curve gave the horse
power of the turbine. The efficiency
of the turbine was computed trom
S50H.P.
62.4 Qh
The efficiencies and horsepower as
found are not all at the same head,
as the elevation of the tail water in-
creases with the discharge. The con-
tract guaranteed a certain perform-
ance at 25 ft. head and individual runs
fell as much as 9 or 10 inches above
and below this figure. To get the per-
formance at 25 ft. head the discharges
were multiplied by V25/Vh and the
horsepowers by 251-B/h1-B. The results
are shown on the accompanying dia-
grams in which the efficiency and
horsepower are given in terms of the
discharge.
On these diagrams are the curves
showing the efficiencies guaranteed by
the manufacturer and also dotted
curves marked "Holyoke Test." The
latter deserves a brief description.
When a turbine manufacturer de-
signs a new series of turbines he has
one of them (usually not over 30
inches in diameter), tested in the test-
ing flume at Holyoke, Mass. There
it is mounted in an open wheel pit in
which there is available a head of 16
to 18 feet. The power output is mea-
sured by a Prony brake and the quan-
tity of water used is measured over a
weir.
Runs are made with the turbine
gates set at various openings and, by
changing the load, the runner is made
to revolve at different speeds for each
gate setting. The result of the tests
is a table giving the revolutions per
minute, the discharge, the brake horse-
power, and the efficiency of every run.
A copy of the Holyoke table for the
type model of each of the Barton
wheels was furnished by the manufac-
turer, and from these the dotted
curves of the diagrams were plotted
by the method to be described.
The following relationships exist
between the nominal size D, the speed
in R.P.M., the power in H.P., and the
discharge Q, of two wheels of the
same type, that is, of wheels which
are geometrically similar figures:

The efficiency of two wheels of the

the discharge and the speed by yH
and the horsepower by H\/H.
There result sets of four variables
RPM1; Q1( HP,, Efficiency,
of which only three are independent.
To study the turbine performance
it is most convenient to plot the effi-
ciency in terms of RPM, and Q,. As
there are three variables, the efficiency
is represented by a surface which can
be plotted as a series of contours.
RPM, and Qxare laid off as rectangu-
lar co-ordinates ; the points are spotted
and the efficiency at each point written
on the sheet as if it were an elevation.
When all the runs are spotted, con-
tours at intervals of one or two per
cent can be drawn. The surface rep-
resented is a hill whose shape and
slopes depend on the type of the run-
ner. Another surface similarly rep-
resented, is made for HP,. A num-
ber of diagrams of this kind may be
seen in an article by Professor Zowski
in the Engineering Record, Novem-
ber 28, and December 26, 1914.
The type model of the 68" Barton
turbine was 40" in diameter, and its
speed at one foot head corresponding
to a speed of 100 R.P.M. and to a
25 ft. head for the turbine in the
power house was
68 .1 .100 = 34 R.P.M.
40 5
Then on ordinate 34 of the plotting
of the Holyoke test the efficiency and
HP, for various values of Ql were
read. HP, and Q1 were put on the
basis of a 25 ft. head by using the
formulas above. In this way the dotted
curves on Plates I and II were ob-
tained.
The efficiencies obtained for the
wheels installed in the Barton plant are
unusual. The practice of the manu-
facturers in guaranteeing an efficiency
about three per cent below that of the
type runner is indicative of the fact
that they do not expect the turbine in
the power house to have as good a
setting as the test setting at Holyoke.
The hydraulic efficiency of a plant is
not simply that of the turbines but
it involves the design of the penstock
and of the draft tubes as well, and it is
here shown that it is possible to de-
sign a turbine setting in an open
wheel pit which will show better effi-
ciencies than the type model.
The plant was designed by and
constructed under the supervision of
Gardner S. Williams, Consulting En-
gineer; the hydraulic equipment was
manufactured and installed by the
Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Com-
pany and the electrical equipment was
furnished by the General Electric
Company.

THE NECESSITY FOR MILITARY PREPARATION
"Preparation against war, and not
'for war'." The concluding words of
the platform of the National Security
League express, in a few syllables, one
of the most pressing needs this United
States of America has ever felt. With
the nations of Europe busily hacking
at each other's throats, we have gone
blithely on, melting down their louis
and sovereigns, with all the blind faith
in human nature of a bank that stores
its funds in an unoccupied back yard.
Militarism—the adoption of univer-
sal training, to the end of raising our-
selves, by pure fighting strength, to
a dominant position among the na-
tions of the world—has been, and is,
justly unpopular with the people of
the United States. On the other
hand, we are realizing, to a greater
extent than ever before, the necessity
of placing ourselves in a position to
protect our country—and all that that
implies—against outside enemies; and
we are feeling, more and more, the
need for an adequate national defense.
It is an historical fact that a nation
is never so strong from a military
standpoint as at the close of a success-
ful war; and we have no reason to
believe that the present conflict will
prove an exception. Whatever its out-
come, we may expect to see the major
part of Europe under occupation by
the largest and most completely trained
and organized army the world has
ever seen.
Not very far away, as distances go
nowadays, will be a nation that has ac-
cumulated—largely, mind you, at the
expense of the government these same
men stand for—a great portion of the
wealth of all the world. If that na-
tion lies open and unprotected, and
that wealth is to be had for the pluck-
ing, will the morals of those men,
hardened by months of the most ter-
rible warfare of history, serve to pre-
vent them from stepping in and help-
ing themselves? The pacifists will
have it that they will. Past expe-
rience—
The Fallacy of "A Million Men
in Arms".
We have been told all our lives
wonderful things about the deeds of
our volunteer armies, and many Amer-
icans—the majority of them, it seems
—are just awakening to the fact that
all the marvellous victories related in
their school histories didn't happen
just so.
The War of the Revolution has al-
ways been cited as an example of the
prowess of American citizen-soldiers,
called from their firesides to the field
of battle ; yet nowhere do we find more
bitter criticisms of that inefficiency
which so invariably accompanies the
untrained body of irregulars than
those from the pen of Washington
himself. Many and bitter were the
letters he wrote to the President of
Congress, to Governor Trumbull, and
to Joseph Reed of Philadelphia, during
those heartbreaking months when, aft-
er taking command of the Continental
Army, he was endeavoring to weld a
mass of selfish, scheming, and openly


289
disloyal men and officers into some
semblance of an organized and disci-
plined fighting machine.
Perhaps the most significant of his
expressions, however, is that contain-
ed in his letter to Congress, dated Au-
gust 20, 1780, when, after four years
of gruelling experiences in the effort
to meet well-trained, well-equipped
regular troops with a body of half-
organized, poorly equipped militiamen,
he says:
"Had we formed a permanent army in
the beginning which, by the continuance
of the same men in service, had been cap-
able of discipline, we should not have had
to retire with a handful of men across
the Delaware in 1776, trembling for the
fate of America, which nothing but the in-
fatuation of the enemy could have saved;
we should not have remained all the suc-
ceeding winter at their mercy, with some-
times scarcely a sufficient body of men to
mount the ordinary guards, liable at every
moment to be dissipated, if they had only
thought proper to march against us; we
should not have been under the necessity
of fighting Brandywine, with an unequal
number of raw troops, and afterwards of
seeing Philadelphia fail a prey to the vic-
torious armp; we should not have been at
Valley Forge, with less than half the force
of the enemy, destitute of everything, in
a situation neither to resist nor to retire;
we should not have seen New York left
with a handful of men, yet an overmatch
for the main army of these States, while
the principal part of their force was de-
tached for the reduction of two of them;
we should not have been, the greater part
of the war, enduring frequently the mor-
tification of seeing the country ravaged,
our towns burned, the inhabitants plunder-
ed, abused, murdered, with impunity from
the same cause."
So much for what the Revolution
might have taught us. A few years
later came a second war with Eng-
land, which found us in possession
of a few trained troops. These men
proved a credit to their country —
notably at Lundy's Lane, where, after
five hours of constant fighting, they
tired slowly and in good order, carry-
ing their wounded with them. Inger-
soll says of Lundy's Lane: "No battle
in America, before or since, was ever
so severely contested, or attended with
such casualties in proportion to num-
bers."
In striking contrast, we have the
glorious deeds of the American mili-
tia, particularly in the defense of
Washington. A British fleet, with
some 3,000 men on board, had been
hovering off the Chesapeake coast for
nearly a year when, in June, 1814,
President Madison conceived the idea
that it might be well to make some pro-
vision for the protection of the na-
tion's capital. Accordingly, he re-
quested the governors of the neigh-
boring states to place certain quotas
of militia at the disposal of the Fed-
eral authorities for the defense of
Washington.
Inasmuch as these troops were at
his very door, he was enabled, on Au-
gust twenty-second, to review an army
which, as General Upton, in his "Mili-
tary Policy of the United States,"
says:
had been, as described
by their commander, 'suddenly as-
sembled without organization,' or dis-
cipline, or officers of the least knowl-
edge of service." Only two days later,
on August 24th, this army of 5,401
men, of which 400 were regulars, 600
marines, 20 sailors, and the remainder
militiamen and volunteers, was hastily
formed in order of battle at Bladens-
burg, where it met some 1500 British
troops.
The casualties were appalling.
Eight—eight, mind you—Americans
were killed and eleven wounded. The


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
number that perished in the rush to
get away is not on record, but the un-
comfortable fact remains that the Brit-
ish marched into Washington, burned
the Capitol, and withdrew the same
night. For some reason or other,
most of our hisferies have little to
say about the battle of Bladensburg.
Then came the long, useless years
of the Civil War. It is the opinion of
military authorities that, had the
Union been able to throw trained
troops against the Confederate posi-
tion at Bull Run, the Civil War, as we
know it today, would never have taken
place. It is not strange that those
untrained volunteers, forced by the
criticism of that same public which
had denied its country adequate pro-
tection into a battle for which they
were utterly unprepared, were driven
from the field in disorder. The con-
duct of the handful of regulars that
covered that retreat is eloquent of
what we might have accomplished.
In the end our volunteer troops,
trained and hardened during four
long years of massacre and disgrace
and humiliation; during which troops
were even sent into action without
knowing how to load the guns that
had been issued to them ; during which
millions of dollars were spent, and
hundreds of thousands of American
lives were lost, proved triumphant. No
army in the world could have stood be-
fore them then; but it was a terrible
price when, for a fraction of what has
since been paid in pension-money, we
could have had a military establish-
ment more than adequate to preserve
the integrity and honor of the United
States in the face of any enemy that
could have been sent against us.
In mustering out the victorious
troops which marched down Pennsyl-
vania Avenue in 1865, the Union cre-
ated a trained reserve, the like of
which it has never had before or
since. These men remained available
for one or two decades, but the war
with Spain, in the last years of the
century, found our plight as bad as
ever.
Once again the concentration camps
were filled with masses of untrained
men—many of them armed with a rifle
that had been entirely outclassed by
the development in small-arms, many
of them with none; many without
equipment, without uniforms, without
officers to train or care for them.
Chickamauga once more became a vast
abattoir, with men falling by the hun-
dreds from typhoid, and the terrible
diseases that invade the unclean camp,
—victims, not of the attack of an en-
emy, but of the short-sightedness of
the country in whose name they gave
their lives. Troops were sent to the
tropics in winter uniforms—unloaded
upon the helpless government by un-
scrupulous contractors,—and lacking
in discipline, organization, and trained
officers. Again we were saved by the
weakness of an enemy.
Hard as was our task then, the
changing conditions of warfare, keep-
ing pace with the constant develop-
ment in armament and tactics, would
render it far harder today. With the
advent of the high-power rifle, and the
perfection of the machine gun and of
artillery fire, came a revolution in the
methods of handling troops in action.
The old firing-line, with its two or
three ranks of densely-packed men,
gave way to the extended skirmish-
line. The men, though no longer in
close contact with the officer, must, if
they are to be successful, render un-
hesitatingly an instant and implicit
obedience to his every command and
signal. This demands a perfection of


291
training, discipline, and organization
to a degree never necessary under the
old tactics,—a training impossible of
attainment without officers who know
their work as a science.
Physical condition, the ability to
keep well under campaign conditions,
and to cover long distances in the least
possible time, are more important than
ever, because of the immense exten-
sion of battle-lines resulting from the
new tactics. The men of the Platts-
burg camp this summer, at the close of
a month of the most strenuous train-
ing, were able to march from twelve
to fifteen miles under equipment.
Trained regulars are expected to do
thirty if need be—and they do.
There is only on2 way in which the
raw volunteer or recruit can gain this
essential training. He must go into
the field, under conditions which ap-
proximate, as nearly as possible, those
of actual service, and receive his in-
struction at the hands of competent
officers—of technical experts; for
modern warfare demands no less of
the man who leads. The company
officer—the lieutenant—the captain—
of today must know, almost to the
last man, what his command is capable
of; he must be able to care for them
on the march; to establish camp under
the best available conditions; and to
keep his men in such shape that no
exigency may find them unprepared.
A certain knowledge of the principles
of musketry is necessary for the di-
rection and control of fire in action,
while for the officer in command of a
unit on detached duty a considerable
knowledge of minor tactics, as well
as of map-reading and, often, of map-
sketching, is indispensable.
Moreover, the successful officer
must be, as always, an executive and
a leader—a man who is capable of
efficient supervision of supplies and
equipment; one who can carry out,
promptly and correctly, the orders
transmitted to him, and, above all,
one who can lead.
The army as a whole—the central-
ized, highly-organized mechanism of
smaller units of men and officers, —
has many needs, and these, in their
turn, can be supplied only through
an efficient organization. The most
important of them all is that of sup-
plies, the fulfillment of which entails
the bringing up of an unending
stream of food, ammunition, forage,
medical supplies and many other
things. This has been rendered far
more complicated by the increase in
size of armies, and by the adoption of
new methods of transportation; yet a
line of communication with base or
railhead must be kept constantly open,
whatever the cost or the difficulties.
No matter how efficient his fighting
organization—no matter how well
trained and equipped his men,—a com-
manding officer sent into the field
without adequate means of obtaining
information of the enemy's move-
ments is like a boxer placed in the
ring blindfolded. The past few years
have seen the cavalry of former wars
give way to the aeroplane and field
wireless. Each of these units calls
for its own organization of technical
men.
The presence of an adequately or-
ganized and equipped sanitary service
would have rendered impossible the
terrible conditions which prevailed at
Chickamauga in '98. Military men are
realizing more than ever that a sani-
tary service is indispensable to troops
in the field at any time, and especially
when, in the event of conflict, care
and transportation must be provided
for numbers of wounded.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
These are a few.of the greater gen-
eral needs of an efficient fighting body,
and no troops lacking them to any
extent can take the field, with any hope
of success, against a properly equipped
army. These are the needs that we
would have to supply in the event of
war.
Could we do it?
We have, to begin with, a small—a
very small, standing army, which
maintains, according to War Depart-
ment figures, about 30,000 mobile ef-
fectives in the United States. Our
infantry, in armament and training,
is probably second to none. Our cav-
alry, as now armed, is the equal of
any, and our artillery is good. All
these troops are well-trained, and pos-
sess a certain quota of efficient auxil-
iary organizations; they are terribly
handicapped by being, for the most
part, scattered about the country in
small posts, many of which are relics
of Indian War days, and which are as
far from any present frontier as they
could well be. Few of these posts
benefit anyone, save the congression-
al representatives of the district. They
do, however, double or treble the time
required for a mobilization of our
regular troops at any point.
We have, as a so-called second line
of defense, the National Guard, or
militia. A few well-'trained units
could probably be put into the field
on very short notice, with practically
the efficiency of regulars. The re-
mainder, in the event of hostilities,
would be worth little more than so
many raw volunteers, as was the case
in '98.
It is probable that a call for volun-
teers at the opening of hostilities
would be sufficient to supply us with
the men for an army of considerable
size. The only difficulty lies in the
fact that, under present conditions, we
would have neither officers nor time
to train these men after the opening of
hostilities, nor have we the necessary
supplies for equipping any consider-
able number of men.
Such an army would be, for want
of artillery alone, helpless in the face
of any enemy of today, for we have
not, at present, enough guns to equip
our diminutive regular army.
As for reserves—men in civil life
who have setn actual military service,
—we have very few, and a majority
of these would find themselves almost
totally unacquainted with the military
organization and methods of today.
What are ive going to do about it?


BY F. H. SWEET
The application of an honor system
in examinations is not a new, untried
thing at Michigan. The College of
Medicine and Surgery has had ten
years of successful student control in
examinations. On only two occasions,
during that whole time, has faculty
intervention been necessary. Even then
the cases were extreme, and a recur-
rence of the difficulty has been ren-
dered practically impossible by later
rules made by the students for the
conduct of examinations.
The faculty and students of the
Medical School are almost unanimous
in their support of the system. The
fact that students are, by this system,
placed on their honor during the
years of their preparations, tends
to strengthen the sense of profes-
sional ethics which becomes essential
after they leave school. Medical
ethics, thus fostered, have had an im-
portant place in the development of
the practice of medicine. Since, in
the practice of engineering also, there
has of late years begun to evolve a
code of ethics, it would seem that, in
the College of Engineering, some sys-
tem might have a logical place, which
should develop in the students a sense
of professional ethics. Ethics in en-
gineering practice are slowly but sure-
ly coming to take a prominent place.
What better preparation can we have
to help make ours an ethical profes-
sion than to be ourselves under the
honor system while in school?
The honor system in the Medical
School has become traditional. It has
the dignity of age. Classes seldom
break well established traditions, and
every year of successful operation of
the system adds to its prestige. In
the College of Engineering such a
system would at first have no such
body of tradition to give it a sub-
stantial footing. But when the honor
system was started in the Medical
School, it had no traditions. There
was only the sincere desire on the
part of the students to work together
under a system that would insure a
square deal to all. The class average
determined the passing mark as in
many of our own courses. For every
man who cheated, and thereby raised
his mark, some student who was me-
diocre but honest failed or was
"conned". Fraternity, always strong
among medical students, was sufficient
to demand some plan that should pre-
vent such injustice. The honor sys-
tem, which aims to give every student
the full credit his work deserves, was
the remedy. The fact that both stu-
dents and faculty are well satisfied
with the honor system is shown by the
way in which they cling to it and also
by their mutual enthusiasm for its
extension. We feel sure that in
the Engineering College, it would not
be difficult to establish such a tradi-
tion, for the same sense of profession-
al fraternity is here found.
It is obvious that the honor system
of conducting examinations could be
imposed as a faculty measure or even
instituted by a majority of students.
But this means of adoption does not
seem to present itself as even a pos-
sible plan. The complete unanimity of


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
the whole college is unnecessary for
its adoption. Since it is highly desir-
able, therefore, not to force any such
measure, a tentative plan might be
made to provide the honor system for
those who wish to see it tried, while
those who for any reason lack faith
in it, might be allowed to take their
examinations as at present. By prop-
er arrangement of rooms, honor ex-
aminations can be given to all those
who want them and the present system
shall be used for all others. This is
intended to minimize still further
cheating in honor examinations be-
cause a man who intends to cheat will
not take such an examination but will
stay under the present system where
he knows he is reasonably safe.
It is essential, however, that abso-
lutely no discrimination be made by
the instructor in marking the papers of
men under either system. All of the
papers of a course would be corrected
in alphabetical order by the instructor,
and, since no pledge is to be appended
to the papers, he would have no means
of telling who had taken an honor
examination and who had not. Just
because a man refuses to take an honor
examination does not imply dishon-
esty nor even grounds for suspicion.
Many men think they cannot honor-
ably tell on another man for cheating.
Under the present system most of us
think the same; but when a man shall
have voluntarily pledged his word
we ought to hold him to the perform-
ance of that pledge. Any honor sys-
tem that fails to do this is weak and
cannot produce a spirit of honor
among students.
If the honor system in the Medical
School has been successfully used for
ten years, and they are today more
than satisfied with the result, then cer-
tainly we ought to try what it will do
for our College of Engineering.
HONOR PLEDGE
I, the undersigned, do hereby give my
word of honor (i) that I will neither give
nor receive any help whatsoever in any
examination held under the honor system;
and (2) that if in any such examination I
see anyone who is either giving or receiv-
ing any help in any way, I will at the close
of the examination give his name and the
evidence against him to the honor commit-
tee; PROVIDED (1) that my name shall
not be known except to the honor com-
mittee and that the accusation shall be
made in the name of Jone Doe; (2) that
the committee shall carefully weigh the
evidence on both sides and render a just
verdict; (3) that if the accused is found
guilty he shall be asked to withdraw from
school; (4) that if after a reasonable time
he shall, by his continued presence, refuse
to abide by the verdict of the committee,
the committee shall refer the case, to-
gether with the evidence against the ac-
cused, to the faculty; (5) that members
of the honor committee shall be sworn to
keep secret all proceedings except where
they are compelled to refer a case to the
faculty, and, even in such reference, the
accuser is to remain as John Doe.
RULES SUGGESTED TO GOVERN STUDENT CONTROL OF EXAMINATIONS
These rules are made for the purpose
of facilitating the working of the honor
system and to avoid as far as possible
all manner of unjust suspicion.
No person shall take an honor examin-
ation unless he has voluntarily signed the
honor pledge.
No one shall leave the examination room
during the first fifteen minutes, in which
time the instructor shall thoroughly ex-


295
plain all questions, after which the in-
structor shall leave the room.
Seating shall be alphabetical and vacant
seats shall intervene between each student
and his neighbor. Alternate sets of ques-
tions shall be given where this is impossible.
All necessary communications shall be
spoken aloud and not whispered.
Each of the four classes shall choose
two men to represent them on the honor
committee. The committee shall choose
a Senior who has been prominent on the
honor committee to act as chairman. Fresh-
men shall not be allowed to vote until they
have twelve hours' credit (not advanced).
What the Faculty Think About the
Honor System.
Dean Cooley: I have always favored
such a system but I do not believe in its
adoption as a faculty measure. It must
come from the students.
Prof. Ziwet: Am I in favor of the
honor system? Of course I am; every-
body is. It is the ideal system.
Prof. Riggs: The engineer who makes a
success of his profession must be a man
of honor, a man whose word is as good
as his bond, a man who can be depended
upon in every emergency not only to do
the right thing himself but to perform his
duty to society by compelling others to
do so or get out of the profession.
Prof. Johnston: Any plan which prom-
ises success will have my personal support.
Prof. A. H. White: A successful honor
system requires an overwhelming senti-
ment in its favor among students and
faculty.
Prof. Goulding: I have confidence in our
students and believe them capable of es-
tablishing and maintaining a system that
would be desirable.
Prof. Stneaton • I believe the honor sys-
tem represents Michigan spirit.
Prof. Miggett: I believe in the principle
of self-government involved in the honor
system.
Prof. Hopkins: An honor system which
encourages honesty on the part of the
student, but which does not subject him
to unnecessary temptation would be a good
thing.

Cultural Subjects and the En-
gineering Student.
Not long ago, at a public meeting
of a large engineering society, this
remark among several outsiders re-
garding a certain engineer was over-
heard: "He is an engineer with a
personality and they are not often
met with."
An engineer with a personality!
Are they indeed so seldom met with
that such a remark was justified? Is
this the general impression of the
many or the mistaken idea of a few?
Ask yourself the questions.
Professor Swain of Harvard Uni-
versity, in an article in the May
Technic claimed that lack cf person-
ality was the millstone around the
neck of the engineer which kept from
him that recognition as a professional
han which his training and qualities
of mind should justify. The remark
has been made that the profession of
law recruits its rEnks from the cream
of the country's young men. This re-
mark may have foundation on the
fact that lawyer.1; of prominence are
continually spreading the influence of
their .personality through the public
expression of their ideas. An engin-
eer of equal prominence in his pro-
fession is seldom heard from. Public
speaking is the greatest medium for
transmitting the influence of a per-
sonality. Xot only is it a medium but
it is a developer as well.
This brings us to the point of this
article. What is the reason for this
condition? Why do not engineers ex-
press themselves more publicly? They
are the constructive geniuses of the
country and men with valuable and
progressive ideas, and a more public
expression of tluir id as would bring
to them that recognition, which Pro-
fessor Swain claims they do not get.
The answer lies in their early train-
ing. The engineer is not as capable
of expressing himself as the lawyer
for his early training lias not fitted
him to do so. In short the cultural
side of his education has been neg-
lected. His education for the pro-
fession until recent years has been
along lines which tended to develop
a methodical, precise, and more or less
narrow7 trend of mind and neglected
the development of that broadness of
mind and perspective which is brought
about through the study of cultural
subjects. The lawyer during his course
of study for the profession must de-
vote a great deal of time to the study
of cultural subjects. This also applies
to the embryo doctor. This has not
been the case until recent years with
the engineer. In fact it is only a few
years back when the engineering stu-
dents at this university were known
as "the roughnecks" of the campus.
In the last few years, things have
changed and such a remark is seldom
if ever heard any more. Cultural
courses have been open: d to the engin-
eer. Xot only have these courses been
opened to him but he has been urged
and urged strongly to take advantage
of the opportunity afforded him, and
he has taken this advantage. More
engineers are enrolling in th? cultural
courses than ever before. Engineering
students have a larger rf presentation
in the oratorical sections at Cornell
University than any other department
of the university. This is merely cited
as an instance. It is not the only cultur-
al subject, by any means, that engineers
are turning to, but it is an important
one, and the early training of the en-
gine: r of the future will not justify


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
any such remark that he is a man lack-
ing in personality, a man without in-
terest to his fellow man except in a
professional way.
THE ENGINEER AND THE
PUBLIC.
An editorial campaign at present
conducted by the Engineering Record,
which aims to point out, analyze and
suggest a remedy for certain condi-
tions which have arisen from the rela-
tion of the engineer to the public, has
in the opinion of The Technic over-
looked one aspect of the question
which is vital to Michigan. The ed-
itorials referred to are those which
deal with the lack of cooperation and
coordination between the engineer and
the public he serves.
It is a recognized fact that this lack
of coordination of ideas between the
technical man and the layman does
exist. It applies particularly to the
civil engineer, whose work affects di-
rectly a class of people who are unable
to understand or appreciate it. Irri-
gation work and the intrinsically in-
volved relation of the farmer is a good
example of this. A lack of coopera-
tit-ii and a lack of coordination of ideas
between the engineer and the farmer
he serves has resulted to a great ex-
tent in the present poor standing of
the Irrigation Service with the agri-
culturist. Municipal water supply and
sanitation are instances where the
problem applies to a less extent, but
where cooperation between the server
and the served is vitally necessary for
the good design of the system and for
the best service rendered. The me-
chanical, chemical and marine engin-
eers, because of the fact that their
work is confined to a great extent to
those that understand it, are affected
to a less extent.
The Record in its analysis of the
causes of this condition has spoken of
the attitude of the engineer as result-
ing from his practical experience. This
journal wishes to suggest the point
that the engineer may have actually
been trained toward this attitude while
still an undergraduate in college;
trained, unknown to himself perhaps,
but actually given a start in this di-
rection, due to the influence of the in-
structors of his senior years. A few
words will make the idea clear.
Instructors of the seniors are to a
large extent men of considerable prac-
tical experience. This is true partic-
ularly of Michigan and perhaps less so
of other technical schools. But it is
in Michigan that we are interested.
Civil instructors, especially, have a
fund of experience to draw upon to
illustrate classroom theory. The con-
dition where the theory governing a
design is borne out by illustrations on
the board of actual cases in which the
instructor is interested, and therefore
the class, is ideal instruction. But
where the instructor holds up to sar-
casm and ridicule the ideas of the
town officials with whom and for
whom he has worked, this is less com-
mendable. From the standpoint of the
class, with its recently gained knowl-
edge on the subject, the erroneous
ideas of the townspeople as presented
by the instructor, are, of course, ap-
parent. If, while in this receptive
frame of mind, the idea of sarcasm
and ridicule is suggested by the in-
structor, either by word or by voice
inflection, an impressionistic class is
given a start in the attitude of mind
which the Record so justly decries.
THE HONOR SYSTEM
The Technic under the staff of
last year started a movement for a
trial of the honor system of examina-


299
tions in the Engineering College. A
committee was selected by the four
classes to investigate the operation of
such systems elsewhere and to deter-
mine whether an honor system could
be applied to advantage in the Engin-
eering College. The report of the
committee was essentially as follows:
An honor system would improve
the morale, standing and efficiency of
the College, a workable plan could be
made and instituted, but the student
body was not then ready for the adop-
tion of such a system.
We believe that the student is now
ready to consider such a plan and
have, in this issue, offered a tentative
plan for his approval. From a can-
vass of the faculty made by The
Technic, we feel certain that we will
have their hearty co-operation in in-
augurating and maintaining an honor
system. A few of their opinions may
be found on a following page. The
question is now ready for the consid-
eration of the students.
The position of The Technic in
this campaign for the trial of the
honor system is to help the committee
in their work by printing their pro-
ceedings, together with such informa-
tion concerning the honor system as
may be thought of value to the stu-
dent.
A GIFT.
Once again has The Michigan
Technic been made the beneficiary of
the generosity of an alumnus. Early
in the fall, Dean Cooley received a
check for one hundred dollars from
Mr. R. C. Gemmell, '84E, with instruc-
tions to "use it as you see fit." As
performing a work worthy of support,
The Technic was presented with the
gift. The money is to be used in the
campaign among Michigan engineer-
ing alumni for subscriptions.
We can but take this gift as the
substantial expression, by the donor,
of his appreciation of the work being
done by the University in general
and the Engineering College in par-
ticular, in the building of men. Hav-
ing himself reached an enviable posi-
tion in his profession, he has not for-
gotten the school which fitted him for
his work. It is such an instance as
attachment which grows out of the
few years spent at college. Love for
Alma Mater lives as long as the man.
We, the Engineering College of the
University of Michigan, extend our
most hearty thanks to Robert C. Gem-
mell, class of '84.
GET OUT FOR SOMETHING.
One has but to glance at the com-
mittees of any important all-campus
affair, the staff of any publication or
the roster of any athletic team to learn
that Engineers are active, they are do-
ing something in campus affairs.
These things the older men are doing
with a will, but where are the under-
classmen, particularly the sophomores?
They are the men who should be
working as assistants, preparing them-
selves to manage the work next year
and the year after.
We cannot too strongly urge that
every underclassman, whether he is a
sophomore or a freshman, take an ac-
tive interest in some extra-curriculum
activity to which he can profitably de-
vote some of his spare time. Our re-
vered President Emeritus has said
that one-half a man's education comes
from his books and the other half
from his associates. There is no bet-
ter way to get acquainted with men
whose acquaintance is really worth
while than to work with them in some
of our many activities.
Get out, you sophomores, and work,
nominally for your school but really
for yourselves.


English Electives.
One of the most striking facts in the de-
velopment of the English work in the Col-
leges of Engineering and Architecture in
the past three years has been the growth of
interest in the elective courses.
In the first semester of 1912-13, only thir-
ty-two students were taking electives in
English; the present semester 376 students
elected courses in English not required for
graduation. This is an increase of over
1,000%. During the same three years the
increase in the number of students enrolled
in the required courses was only 52. It is
evident, therefore, that the increased en-
rollment is due not to the normal growth
of the department but to a new and striking
interest in the particular work done in these
courses.
This phenomenal growth has been due, in
the first place, to the types of elective
courses offered . These have proved es-
pecially attractive to our students because
they have provided for their particular
needs. Appreciating the fact that the en-
gineering student is naturally interested in
his contemporaries and that in so far as he
has any literary attractions, it is for the
short story, the current novel and the latest
play, the English faculty has formulated
courses in the Short Story, the Modern
N'ovel, the Modern Drama, and in various
aspects of current literature. These courses
aim to take advantage of the student's nat-
ural interest in these literary forms, to stim-
ulate him to read with spontaneity and en-
thusiasm what he feels real pleasure in
reading, but by judicious direction and tact-
ful discussion to develop in him some con-
scious standards of taste by which to judge
the things he does read. He is inspired to
read more discriminatingly and critically.
It should be noted that the aim and pur-
pose of these courses differentiates them
absolutely from anything offered in the Col-
lege of Literature. Science, and the Arts.
They are made for our own students, and
as such they do the work.
But while on the one side there has been
developed a group of reading courses ap-
pealing to the student's special predilections
and aiming to develop a more critical taste,
there have been worked out in the other
direction, a large number of elective courses
which are frankly practical, and which aim
definitely to equip the student for his tech-
nical work. These include courses in Bus-
iness English, Technical Journalism, Tech-
nical Papers. Engineering Reports. Public
Speaking for Engineers, etc. In all this
work, every effort is made to correlate the
English with the work the student is doing
in his technical courses. He is urged to
use material that is of real value to him
as an engineering student, and is especially
encouraged to present the results of any
original research or of his own personal
experience in any of the industries. The
correlation of the English courses with tlje
student's engineering work and the con-
stant stimulus given him to express him-
self and the things he is interested in, has
done much to niLike the English courses
appeal to the practical sense of the students
themselves.
The fact that courses appealing either to
the student's natural love for contemporary
literature or his practical sense of his own
neods have been developed, docs not, how-
ever, wholly account for the increase of
over i.ooo^f in the enrollment in our elec-
tive courses. The very generous encourage-
ment given our work by the Dean and the
head of the various departments has gone
far toward creating throughout the student
body an impression that the English courses
are profitable for them to take. There has
gradually developed a tradition that a man
needs as much English training as possible
if he is to get far in his profession as an
engineer. This feeling has been deepened
also bv the utterances of alumni and of


301
jiracticing engineers writing for the tech-
nical magazine until we have at times hardly
been able as a department to meet rapidly
enough the increasing demand for English
on the part of both students and faculty.
The reorganization of our English work
made possible for next year by recent fac-
ulty action provides for 22 courses in Eng-
lish. 14 of these being writing courses and
8 of them being reading courses. They are
grouped as follows:
A. Writing Courses.
1 and 2: General courses in oral and
written exposition.
3 and 4: Courses in oral English.
5 and b: Courses in technical English.
7 and 8: Technical Journalism.
9 and 10: Business English.
16, I", 18, 19: Courses for foreign stu-
dents.
B. Reading Courses
21: A general reading course.
22: The Short Story.
23 and 24: The Novel.
25 and 26: The Drama.
27 and 28: Scientific Literature.
Every one of these courses has been for-
mulated to meet an evident demand, and
every one fits into a well unified scheme.
They are thus correlated, by a definite uni-
ty of purpose, to each other and to the life
interests of the students for whom they
arc planned.
While only six hours of English, (Eng-
lish 1 and 5, 6. 9. or 10) is at present re-
quired for graduation, the growth of inter-
est in the elective courses seems to warrant
the hope that an increasing number of our
students will take advantage of the other
courses offered, and that Michigan men
may go out as well equipped in English
training as those from any engineering
school in this country.
CIVIL
Fellowship kor Highway Engineers.
R. D. Chapin. president of the Hudson
Motor Car Company, offers a fellowship
to students in Highway Engineering. The
amount which Mr. Chapin offers is $750
per year for two years, to be used in the
investigation of highway problems relating
especially to conditions in Michigan.
New Highway Laboratory.
With the beginning of next semester the
highway laboratory will be in its new quar-
ters in the old power plant.
The building has been entirely remodelled
within and the highway department will
have about 6,000 square feet for the use
of their testing machinery.
When the equipment which has been or-
dered is all set up, the University will have
the most modern and complete laboratory
of this kind in the country.
MECHNICAL
Auto Laboratory
In spite of the efforts of numerous auto-
mobile companies, the problem of deter-
mining the exact distribution of the en-
ergy consumed in a gasoline car has never
been successfully worked out. This diffi-
cult piece of work is now being undertaken
in the Auto Laboratory here.
The motors to be used for the experi-
ment are a Hudson 6-54. a Franklin six, a
Reo four, and a Ford. They are en-
cased in the hoods and aprons which are
furnished with them. To further dupli-
cate road conditions, a wind blast of defin-
ite velocity is forced into the hood by a
blower. In order to determine the proper
velocity, it was necessary to obtain the
velocity of the wind rushing through the
hood of a car on the road when travelling
at various speeds. Prof. J. R. Allen's car,
a Hudson, was borrowed and run at dif-
ferent speeds while a velocity meter at-
tached to the engine recorded the wind
velocities.
This experimental work is being done
by W. J. Case, J. G. Milliken. W. C.
Thompson and P. L. Ulrich, senior engin-
eers, under the direction of Prof. W. T.
Fishleigh.
ELECTRICAL.
Asst. Prof. Sheppard is arranging to add
to the equipment of the Telephone and
Telegraph Laboratories several instruments


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
for the measurement of small currents and
voltages, together with a Vreeland oscilla-
tor, which is an apparatus designed to pro-
duce an alternating current of pure sine
form at frequencies of from 250 to 2500
cycles per second and is used in measuring
the constants of telephone apparatus and
circuits. A 500-foot length of 100 pair
telephone cable has been presented to the
department by the Michigan State Tele-
phone Company and is being mounted so
that it can be used in making insulation
and capacity tests. The receiving range of
the wireless station has been increased
by the addition of a two-stage audion
amplifier.
Plans are being prepared by Asst. Prof.
Lovell for the construction of an artificial
transmission line and apparatus suitable for
research on long distance transmission prob-
lems. The line will be adjustable in length,
spacing and size of wire, so as to cover a
wide range of commercial conditions. The
maximum length will be about 200 miles,
maximum spacing about 120 inches and
wire size up to No. 40 B. &amp; S.
Professor McKavanagh is designing an
oscillating transformer to give one million
volts at a frequency of about one hundred
thousand cycles, and have a power output
of about fifteen kilowatts. The transform-
er will be built in the electrical laboratory
and when completed will be used in the
testing of high tension line insulators and
in research work on insulating materials
and transmission line phenomena.
AN IMPROVED SELF-STARTER.
Professor Bailey of the Electrical Engin-
eering Department, has announced the de-
tails of a new self-starter for automobiles
which he has designed for the Disco Com-
pany. The starter is of the two unit type
and is notable for its lightness. The real
feature of the design, however, is an auto-
matic devise for connecting the generator
to the storage battery when a speed suffi-
cient to produce charging potential is at-
tained. This consists in a short copper
cylinder in which is placed a little mercury.
The cylinder is directly connected to the
generator armature. When a certain speed
is attained, the mercury is spread out by
centrifugal force in a film over the inner
surface of the cylinder. Insulated con-
tact points are placed so as to dip in this
film and close the circuit to the battery.
The device can be adjusted so that the gen-
erator and battery are connected only when
the speed, and hence generated voltage,
exceed the proper value. Other arrange-
ments to accomplish the same object are
much more complicated and fragile.
CHEMICAL
Edison Illuminating Company Fellow-
ship
The Edison Illuminating Company of
Detroit has given to the Chemical Engin-
eering Department of the University of
Michigan the sum of six hundred dollars
to support a fellowship during the present
college ye:tr. The Detroit Edison Com-
pany maintains several very large power
plants which it operates in accordance with
the highest principles of scientific manage-
ment. In common with all other operators
of power plants it has occasionally been
subject to serious accidents and delays on
account of the failure of boiler tubes in
service. The company now plans to make
a careful study of the proper specifications
for boiler tubes and disseminate the in-
formation gained for the general public.
Realizing the superior facilities which the
University affords, the Edison Company
has asked the Chemical Engineering De-
partment of the University to make a care-
ful examination of a number of tubes,
some of which have failed and some of
which have done excellent service. The
metal will be subjected to careful chemical
and microscopic examination to determine
whether it has the proper chemical compo-
sition and has been properly manipulated
by the manufacturers. Its properties will
again be tested after a new heat treatment
to determine whether a different procedure
in manufacture might have improved it.
The work will be in charge of Professor
Albert E. White, who was notably success-


303
ful in a previous investigation for the same
company on b\-ass condenser tubes. At the
time when Professor White undertook this
work on brass condenser tubes the failures
at the Edison Company's plant averaged
five tubes a day for each condenser. New
specifications were recommended by Pro-
fessor White and as a result of their en-
forcement there have not been as many
broken condenser tubelfcin a year as there
were in a day formerly. The results of
the investigations were embodied in an
elaborately illustrated booklet written by
Professor A. E. White and entitled "An
Investigation of Condenser Tubes," which
was printed for private circulation by the
Edison Illuminating Company in 1914.
The fellowship will be held during the
coming year by Mr. Harold F. Wood, of
Manistee, Michigan. Mr. Wood graduated
from Ferris Institute in 1911 and from
the University of Michigan in February,
1915 with the A.B. degree. He completed
the Chemical Engineering course at the
University of Michigan at the close of the
1915 summer session, receiving the degree
of B.Ch.E. He had been appointed as a
graduate assistant in Chemical Engineering
at the University, but resigned this to ac-
cept this new fellowship.
This latest fellowship affords another il-
lustration of the changing attitude on the
part of progressive manufacturers. For-
merly all information was to be kept
closely guarded as a trade secret. Now it
is recognized that what is good for the
industry as a whole is also good for the
progressive individual and that the more
knowledge there is on problems of
general importance the better it is
for all concerned. It is in this spirit
that the Edison Company has instituted
this investigation on boiler tubes. There
are now five fellowships in the Chemical
Engineering Department supported by or-
ganizations which take this broadminded
and public-spirited attitude. The Univer-
sity on its part is glad to cooperate in the
solution of such problems of general in-
terest provided it has the requisite facil-
ities and provided that the results of the
investigation may be freely published by it.
Professor Badger has been installing a
water purification process for the Detroit
Edison Co. at their Park Place plant. There
will probably be a description of the pro-
cess in the next issue of The Technic.
Prof. A. H. White has on file 15 re-
quests for men to fill positions. There are
several in gas plants but the remainder are
scattered through a wide range of in-
dustries.
The Call of the War.
Much space in the technical press has
been devoted recently to the expansion of
American industries in response to the
demands of the European war. A typical
example of such expansion is that of the
Dow Chemical Co. of Midland, Mich. The
subject here acquires a more intimate in-
terest because of the close connection of
Dr. Cone, of the Chemistry Department,
with the most recent development of this
company.
Before the war, the chief products of the
Midland plant were bromine, chlorine, car-
bon disulphide, carbon tetrachloride, and
chloroform. The production of these chem-
icals has been doubled and trebled. The
requirements of the European surgeons
have caused a production of chloroform at
Midland in excess of the entire consumption
of the U. S. previous to the war. Chlorine
and probably bromine are used in trench
warfare, while carbon tetrachloride finds
extensive use as a fire extinguisher.
To these products have been added a
line of organic chemicals to help fill, in
pharmacy and industry, the place of the
formerly imported German chemicals.
Among the inorganic products added to
the output of the plant may be mentioned
magnesium sulphate and chloride. Mag-
nesium compounds were previously pro-
duced almost entirely in Germany. Be-
sides the domestic consumption for phar-
maceutical purposes, there is to be noted
the use in the production of metallic mag-
nesium from the chloride. The powdered
metal finds a wide and necessary use as a
flash powder in night warfare about the
European trenches.
During November Prof. A. H. White was
in Pittsburgh to attend a meeting of the


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
advisory committee of the Bureau of Stan-
dards. The result of the meeting was to
lay out a series of five-year tests on the
effects of hydrated lime additions to Port-
land cement and on the properties of the
concrete made from such cement.
Chem. Engineers Make Two-day Trip.
Tne class in Organic Technology, on No-
vember 26 and 27. visited several manufac-
turing plants in the vicinity of Saginaw and
Bay City. The party left Ann Arbor
Thanksgiving Day and spent the night in
Bay City. The following day five plants
were visited. At the E. I. Du Pont de Ne-
mours Powder Co. the class was shown
through the wood distillation plant. Here
the charcoal is made that is used in the
manufacture of gunpowder. In the pro-
cess of distillation all of the by-products,
wood alcohol, creosote, acetic acid, acetone,
calcium acetate, tar and gas are recovered
and used. The next plant visited was the
German American Sugar Co. where sugar
is extracted from sugar beets. In the
afternoon the party went through the fol-
lowing plants: The Michigan Chemical Co.,
where alcohol is made by the fermentation
of molasses, the World's Star Knitting Co.
and the North American Chemical Co.,
manufacturers of chlorates by electrolysis.
The following morning was spent at the
Dow Chemical Co. at Midland. It is im-
possible in this linjited space to completely
describe this plant, but a few features might
prove of interest. The rock salt below
Midland is rich in bromine and about go'/r
of the world's supply is extracted here.
Some of the other products are: bleaching
powder, chloroform, phenol, epsom salts,
and chloral hydrate. In the afternoon the
party visited the Michigan Sugar Co..
where the trip was concluded.
RESEARCH
The Michigan Gas Association fellow-
ships are held this year by Mr. J. T. Naylon
and Mr. B. A. Standerline. Under Prof.
A. H. White's direction tests on coal sam-
ples stored under various conditions to
determine the effect of such storage on the
gas yield are made annually, and the fifth
series will soon be started. Mr. Stander-
line is also working on the use of a neu-
tral atmosphere for heat-treating brass, a
continuation of work done last year by
Mr. H. T. Hood; and Mr. Naylon is
working on baking enamels for automobile
parts. Mr. J. W. Stone and Mr. H. O.
Andrew are also working under Prof.
White on the removal of sulphur com-
pounds from illuminating gas. Mr. Plankel
is continuing some work which Prof. White
has had under way for some time on the
relative value of different methods for wa-
terproofing concrete.
The Acme fellowship is held this year
by Mr. R. A. Christman, who is studying
the effect of storage on oil paints. Prof.
Ware is also directing the work of Mr.
J. P. Roberts on varnishes, Mr. D. T. Pang
on some Hawaiian seed oils, and of Mr.
T. F. Fead on Chinese rape oils, and of
Mr. Martens on the relation of viscosity to
specific gravity in drying oils.
The new fellowship provided by the De-
troit Edison Co. and mentioned elsewhere
in this issue is held by Mr. H. F. Wood,
who is working on specifications for boiler
tubes. This is a continuation of work
which was started by Prof. A. E. White last
summer. Along this same line is the work
of Mr. L. J. Douglas. Mr. E. K. Goettel
has the problem of the effect of vanadium
and titanium in steel, while Mr. T. K.
Hutson is trying to put a hard skin on
the outside of steel castings by altering the
composition of the surface layers.
Prof. Badger is directing the work of
Mr. G. B. Wells, who is studying the action
of gases containing nitrogen on metallic
calcium. This is a part of the problem of
finding uses for this little-known metal.
The Paper fellowship is this year held
by Mr. F. E. Ford. He is so far doing
only preliminary work. Prof. Rue has
working under him Mr. E. G. Milham and
Mr. J. W. Robinson; the former working
on the prevention of losses in working up
waste paper, and the latter on collodion
lacquers and baking enamels. Mr. R. D.
Smith is working with Prof. Willard on
the determination of cobalt in steels. Mr.
John H. Schmidt is studying the produc-


305
tion of artificial indigo with Dr. Cone, and
Mr. C. S. Schoepfle is continuing his work
under Dr. Gomhcrg in pure organic chem-
istry.
ENGINEERING MECHANICS.
Members of the Engineering Mechanics
staff are working on the revision of parts
of the several courses with the idea of im-
proving the presentation and subject matter.
The subject of Area Moments and Com-
pound Stresses in E.M.2 will hereafter be
taught from a pamphlet prepared by the
department instead of by amplifying from
a text that does not quite fulfil the needs
of the subsequent courses.
In like manner the subject of critical
speeds will be dealt with in E.M.3.
The E.M. Department is cooperating
with the American Society for Testing Ma-
terials in standardizing tests on building
tile and gypsum products. Absorption tests
and tests for resistance to crushing of tile
have already been run. Future tests in-
clude investigation as to the effect of
water and freezing on the strength.
The contemplated investigation of gyp-
sum includes consistency tests, time of set
tests, modulus of elasticity, tests for reduc-
tion of shearing resistance due to heat, and
tests of reinforced gypsum beams.
Investigations are being made in regard
to the determination of the critical speed
of a shaft with various rotating masses
mounted thereon. For this purpose a ma-
chine has been designed which takes ad-
vantage of a close mathematical analogy
between torsional vibrations of rotating
masses and longtitudinal vibrations of
masses and longitudinal vibrations of
springs. This apparatus has been made in
the Engineering Shops.
Some experiments were conducted dur-
ing the latter part of last semester (1914-
15) by Lieut. P. H. Hammond and D. R.
Cornell, '16E, under the supervision of
Prof. J. Airey, to establish the practicabil-
ity of the apparatus, and a few improve-
ments were subsequently made. The neces-
sity of knowing the rotative speed at which
danger of breaking or troublesome vibra-
tions are most liable is becoming more and
more urgent, and the success of investiga-
tions about to be carried out by Mr. Cor-
nell and F. C8. Riecks, '16E, would lead to
determinations of critical speeds, in cases
of torsional vibration, more easily and ac-
curately.
MARINE
During the summer tests were made to
determine the resistance of certain forms
of submarines.
Mr. Volden, a graduate student, is in-
vestigating the effect upon resistance of
variation in the above-water form of
models. Two other investigations are being
carried on, one to determine the wake of
certain under-water forms, and one to de-
termine the effect upon resistance of in-
creased beam in the type of model used
upon the Great Lakes.
ENGLISH
Assistant Professor Nelson is preparing
a book on Report Writing. The book is
the outgrowth of the course in Engineer-
ing Reports which Professor Nelson has
given during the past three years. The il-
lustrative material will be taken from the
library of reports, which "is now in the
possesion of the Department through the
generosity of a number of alumni and
other engineers of note. Professor Nel-
son's book is intended for use not only by
engineering students but by men in prac-
tice as well. It is therefore hoped that
practicing engineers who may have sug-
gestions which would render such a book
of greater service will communicate their
suggestions to Professor Nelson. Cop-
ies of reports of all sorts which may be
in any way typical are also solicited.
Dr. G. D. Bradley is just bringing to
completion his history of the Sante Fe
Railroad, a work of some one hundred fifty
thousand words, to which he has devoted
a number of years of research and study.
Dr. Bradley is also engaged upon a tech-
nical article describing the Santa Fe oil
fields in Southern California. He made a
special trip to California last summer to

gather materials and photographs for the
article. During the past year, a serial, "The
Builders of the Santa Fe," has been run-
ning in the Sante Fe Magazine,—a series
of biographical articles presenting the ca-
reers of some of the more noteworthy
civil engineers who built the Atchison, To-
peka and Santa Fe Railroad.
LANGUAGE
A very interesting catalog has recently
been issued by the Willys-Overland Co. of
Toledo. It is printed entirely in German,
the translation having been made by Mr.
Wild, of the Engineering faculty. The sub-
ject matter and illustrations are the same
as for the Company's English catalog.
ENGINEERING SOCIETY
On November 18 Mr. Muir of the Toledo
Electrical Welder Co., Cincinnati, Ohio,
gave an interesting talk on the practical
applications of the welder. The meeting
was under the auspices of the A. I. E. E.
and •••.as well attended.
Mr. A. Oaks of the American Heater Co..
iVroi: Mich., talked before the A. I. E. E.
en the subject of heating appliances. He
demonstrated in his lecture some samples
of the materials used in the apparatus put
oi't bv this company.
In the addition to the lectures to be
held in the future there will also be meet-
ings in which there will be discussions on
different subjects to be taken up by the
students. Any questions desired to be
taken up in these meetings should be
turned in to the presiding officer a day be-
fore the meeting is to be held.
MECHANICAL.
The first smoker of the Mechanical
branch was held on Friday evening, Decem-
ber 3. Professors Allen and Rowen in-
terested the crowd with their talks. The
cider and doughnuts seemed to take well.
The meeting was a decided success from
all standpoints and goes to predict a good
year for this branch.
The newly elected officers of the General
Society and the branches follow:
General
President, N. F. Brown '16; Vice Presi-
dent, H. R. Leach '16; Secretary, E. H.

ON THE CAMPUS
1917
H. S. Taylor, Reporter.
1917E has started the year in fine shape
and bids fair to make considerable showing
on the campus. The following officers were
elected for the year: President, M. W. Pat-
terson; Vice President, K. F. Walker; Sec-
retary, Warner Seabury; Treasurer, M. G.
Robinson.
At the October assembly the President
appointed the following committees:
Social: E. A. Bartelme, chairman; W. M.
Riach, Robert F. Kohr, L. B. Hadley, W.
Brodhead.
Finance: R. A. Rose, Otto Strachan.
Auditing: H. L. Carroll, J. A. Blecki,
Dan Dougherty.
Directory: G. Smith, A. E. Hecker, H.
A. Taylor.
Honor: Joe Meade, James Pollock.
Prof. C. T. Johnston addressed the class
giving an outline of events in store for
the year.
On Friday, November 26, the first smoker
of the year was held. Prof. E. E. Ware
and Director P. G. Barthelmc spoke. Ac-
cording to present plans last year's custom
of giving two dances will not be followed
this year. Instead one big affair is sched-
uled and the social committee hopes in this
way to have a record attendance.
In athletics, the '17 class is represented
by one man on Varsity this fall, "Jimmie"
Whalen. Jimmie is also treasurer of the
"J" Hop. Among the various interscho-
lastic and glee club assistant managerships
can be found a goodly sprinkling of 'l7E's.

Captain Carroll took his cross country
squad to Cambridge this fall. They were
unfamiliar with the very hilly country and
this handicap was more than they could
overcome.
Dean Cooley gave an interesting talk on
"Hobbies" at the assembly held November
18. He related some fine incidents of his
"Days Off," also giving some ideas that
would be well to follow.
Our class directory is progressing rapidly
and Chairman "Gord" Smith promises it on
deck before Christmas. This directory is
a continuation of the scheme of the '16
class. It contains a complete list of the
class with both Ann Arbor and home ad-
dresses. It also includes the class officers
and committees as well as the social pro-
gram as far as known.
At our December assembly President
Hutchins is to address the class. This is
certainly a treat not to be missed, as the
President has never before spoken before
a class assembly. Let every '17E be there.
1918
H. O. Trerice, Reporter.
President McKee of the sophomore class
has announced the following committee
appointments: Finance, A. Bouney, chair-
man; E. B. Breckenbridge, Ralph E. Page,
E. H. Loveland; Social, Fred Hough,
chairman; '. D. Hibbard, F. C. Dudley,
A. V. Livingstone, F. C. Van Brunt;
Honoh, C. E. Briggs, F. C. Kortick. A. J.
G-oldberg is in charge of the indoor base-
ball team.
FRESH
E. M. Miller, Reporter.
Yes, the freshmen are here. We are
well organized and intend to accomplish
great things before the year is over.
The officers elected were: D. P. Wood,
president; R. B. Stephens, vice president;
H. A. Barton, secretary; and A. D. Lewis,
treasurer. These men are all very com-
petent and will successfully guide the class.
Mr. Thompson was elected football man-
ager and he certainly showed some ability
in developing the fresh engineer squad into
a good team. Now that the football season
is over, attention has been turned to the
minor sports, bowling, basketball, track, in-
door baseball and hockey. Captains have
been elected for each of these sports and
promise to have winning teams with the
many recruits who are in the class.
The various committees have been ap-
pointed and are all busy. The financial
committee reports that the strong box is
filling its sides with dues, while the social
committee is working hard on some new
entertainments.
The fresh engineer smoker was held
December 7. It took the form of a get-
acquainted party and was very successful.
The men with the gray toques crowded
the Union till no more could find room.
There were plenty of smokes, eats, and a
jolly good time for everybody.
Other parties of this kind have been
planned for the future, and a class dance
will be held soon after vacation.
Although no definite date has as yet
been set for the annual J. Hop, several
committees have been appointed and every-
thing right now indicates that this year's
event is going to live up to all previous
records. E. B. Palmer and Louis F. Die-
terich are arranging for the music; E. B.
Palmer is general sacretary and James F.
Whalen is handling the money for the af-
fair. The cotillion which many thought wao
more or less of a failure last year will very
likely be abolished in favor of the lighter
steps.
The big Union fund is climbing up and up
to the high water mark; are you boosting
it or merely hanging on?
The probabilities are that the engineers
will not be greatly enthused over the new
poetry club, but if they make good in
bringing Kipling here to talk there will no
doubt be a royal turn out.

ARCHITECTURAL COLLEGE NOTES
The first meeting of the school year of
the Architectural Society was held Monday
evening, October 25, in the lecture room of
Alumni Memorial Hall. The gathering
takes the place of the annual smoker and
all of the freshmen were especially invited
as the main purpose of the meeting was to
introduce and welcome the new members of
the department. A general discussion of
the exhibit of drawings was followed with
short talks by Prof. Emil Lorch, Prof. H.
R. Cross, Prof. S. F. Kimball, and Mr.
L. A. Hopkins, secretary of the College
of Engineering and Architecture.
The plans for the future of the Society
include giving a year's subscription to The
Tkchxic at special rates to the members,
similar to the system in practice now in
the Engineering Society. Under this plan
The Technic will include articles of es-
Quarterdeck.

At the time of going to press no active
measures have been taken by the committee.
pecial interest to architects and beginning
with this issue a separate section is set
aside under the head '"College of Archi-
tecture."
We are promised a paper by a member
of the architectural faculty for the March
number.
The College of Architecture is one of
nine schools to whom the American Society
of Architects annually gives a medal to be
awarded for merit to the student doing the
best work throughout his undergraduate
course.
Mr. C. C. Cohagen. 15A. who was given
the medal last year, has been placed first
in the competition for the Montana State
Building at the Panama-Pacific Exoosition.
The College of Architecture has been in-
vited to send an exhibit of work to Wash-


309
ington early in December at the time of
the conventions of the Collegiate Archi-
tectural Association and of the American
Institute of Architects. The exhibit is
to be hung in the Corcoran Art Gallery.
Prof. Rmil Lorch, head of the College of
Architecture, who was largely responsible
for the organization of the Association a
number of years ago, will attend the con-
vention as usual.
An exhibit consisting of drawings which
have been awarded distinction in architec-
tural competitions during the past year and
representative work of the leading archi-
tectural schools and ateliers, was hung in
the main gallery of Alumni Memorial Hall
early in November. The work is of the
best done in the country and serves to
keep our students informed of what is
being done in fields of architectural instruc-
tion elsewhere. This exhibit was brought
here by the Architectural Society from the
American Federation of Art.
Of the designs for the Michigan Union
dance programs submitted by Alpha Rho
Chi, the architectural fraternity, three have
been selected, each to be used in turn. The
three chosen are drawn by G. L. Lind, '16A,
A. C. Irwin, '16A, and J. D. Henyon, '17A.
A new appointee in the College of Ar-
chitecture is J. J. Albert Rousseau. Mr.
Rousseau had considerable professional ex-
perience in this country before going to
Paris where he entered the Atelier ChifFlot;
subsequently he was admitted to the Ecole
ties Beaux-Arts as a member of the Atelier
Bcrnier.
The Kcolc des Reaux-Arts ranks as the
highest architectural school in Europe, ad-
mission to which can only be had through a
competitive examination; 15 non-French-
men only are admitted at the time of the
semi-annual examination, the number of
candidates often running as high as 600 or
700. Mr. Rousseau was admitted third in
his class.
While in France he also worked with
architects on a number of important public
competitions. In the school he received the
Prix Jay, which is an extended test in archi-
tectural construction and design. He is
the first non-FYenchman to receive this
award.
Mr. Rousseau comes to the University
as an assistant professor of architecture,
and is teaching some intermediate and some
advanced architectural design. He is a very
real acquisition.

BY BUNNY
"Get away from that
horse's head I"
No! This is not a race
track, gentle reader, but
simply "Mac" waking up
the camp during his morn-
ing plunge at 5 :3a
You don't know "Mac?"
Well, he is just one of the
civil engineers who went up
to "Camp Davis," the civil
engineering camp in the
northern part of the state, last summer.
"Did we have a good time?" Foolish,
foolish question; but let me tell you about it
Camp Capital
Construction H^ork
To begin with, the camp is situated on
the shore of Lake Douglas, about seven
miles east of Pellston. Maybe, though, I
ought to locate Pellston, which is about 20
miles north of Petosky. The sleeping and
office tents were arranged in two rows
on the shore of the lake; while the mess
tents were located on a high hill overlook-
ing the lake.
Each sleeping tent holds four fellows,
who form a party, every party having a
number. Each member of a party also has
a number, which he answers to at roll call
in the morning. The tents are gradually
being displaced by steel shacks.
Maybe you would be interested in know-
ing our daily routine. Well, first we had
a plunge. Next was roll call at 6:20, fol-
lowed by breakfast. At the latter Onie's
pancakes were the big feature.
The time from 7 :30 until 5 p. m. was ad-
vantageously spent in the pursuit of knowl-
edge. Of course we had an hour off for
dinner, sometimes eating out on line and
sometimes eating at the mess tents.
After work the fun began. Back from
the field at 5 o'clock struggled the weary
surveyors. They were covered with dust
and a goodly portion had sifted through
to the skin. The sun was going down in
the west and the water was warm and in-
viting. You can guess what next happened.
After the plunge came the evening meal
and no one ever enjoyed better appetites
than the "bunch"had.
After supper sports held full sway. There
were baseball games, pitching horseshoes,


3"
boating, and occasionally some of the fel-
lows went fussing over to Riggsville, Hill-
side or Ingleside. There were ten baseball
teams, divided into two leagues of five
teams each. Each team was composed of
the occupants of two tents, that is, eight
men.
This sort of stuff went on for five days
a week, but about Saturday and Sunday we
were due for a change. Saturday after-
noons were free from regular surveying
work. Many would as soon have been
out working for the eight hours credit,
though, as washing clothes behind the
cause the girls picked him up. It must be
great to be handsome.
Mackinac Island presented a good week
end trip. Very often the fellows walked
the 14 miles to Cheboyan Saturday evening,
and crossed to the island Sunday morning.
Lou's and Ben's record of two hours and
forty minutes for the fourteen miles is
still looked upon as "some speed." To have
seen "Big Ben" tramping through the
Grand Hotel at the Island with his big
shoes, felt hat, flannel shirt and six weeks'
growth of beard would have repaid anyone
for the trip. If stares had affected him
Visitor's Day
tents. Fortunately this latter occupation
didn't take up all the week end.
Saturday evening the fellows usually
went to Topinabee or Pellston, although
some of the bolder sort occasionally hied
themselves to Mackinac Island. At Topin-
abee the fellows were usually very much
in evidence at the dance hall. In fact once
90% of those at the dance were camp fel-
lows, the other two men on the floor rep-
resenting one-half the desirable male popu-
lation of the place. The girls were a fine,
jolly bunch, and altogether those Topinabee
trips were a huge success.
Then the trips to Pellston were always
more or less of an attraction because of
the "movies," anything like that being a
"reel" treat. Lou always liked to go be-
he would never have recovered. One
woman remarked, "Oh, mercy me, there
goes a regular backwoodsman, you know,"
at which Ben threw out his chest and
thanked the good lady for the compliment.
The biggest day of the camp was "Visi-
tors' Day." Talk about preparations. For
example, Dalzie washed his face and
"Horse Power" combed his hair. Besides
these few requisites there was much clean-
ing up to do around camp in the way of
raking up front lawns, clearing the brush
off the hillside back of camp, etc.
But we were repaid for our labors when
the visitors began to arrive. They came in
autos, boats, wagons, carriages and ve-
hicles of all kinds. We didn't often see
girls in that country (no slam on the Bugs)


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
and the sight of all those girls "togged up
fit to kill" pretty nearly overpowered us.
Even Whitie was affected.
We did our best to show them a good
time. There were foot races, shovel-char-
iot races, tobacco races, boat races, swim-
ming races, tug-of-war, a ball game and
Ragle's Nest
finally a sing. There was lemonade by
the barrel, sandwiches and fried cakes by
the wagon load, and a limitless supply of
potato salad. One fair one remarked, "Oh,
1 just can't believe that men made this
salad. Oh, mercy me, but it is good," which
all goes to show that Onie is some cook.
Anyhow everyone declared it was a huge
success.
Then came the last day. N'o one had
realized how much that camp had meant
unti' the tents were down and stored, the
boats housed, the diving tower dragged
aK re, old clothes discarded and everyone
waiting for the final roll call. It even
brings a lump to my throat now when I
Oed Stair's to Mess
think about it. The general sentiment was,
'dee. but I wish that I could stay a few
more weeks." It made the bunch feel
pretty bad to go.
Suddenly the cry was raised, "Wagon for
Tobinabee!'' "Wagon for Cheboygan!"
"Boat for Bryants!" and best camp ever
hi'd at Lake Douglas was over.

him enough responsibility, so he has taken
another big job on his hands in the shape
of a baby boy.
Lloyd B. Smith is coming rapidly to the
front as chief engineer of the Topeka

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
By Mile. Mameyclla de Taurusi.
There is a young man in my Creative
Listening class with whom I am deeply in
love. I believe that he loves me but we
have never been introduced. He is an en-
gineer. What shall I do?—Co-ed.
Answer: Pass him up by all means. No
self-respecting engineer would condescend
to take Creative Listening.
Yesterday morning in front of the Law
building I saw a squirrel bolting nuts. This
seems peculiar. Can you explain it?—Wor-
ried.
Answer: This case is not peculiar. The
squirrel was from the S. E. corner of the
campus where he has probably learned the
trick from the engineers.
I am engaged to a pretty school teacher.
Can you suggest a suitable Christmas pres-
ent?—J. Q. A.
Answer: You might give her something
useful. Say some furs or a piece of furni-
ture, a chair or a table, for instance. As
she is a school teacher she would probably
appreciate a multiplication table.
Some questions Mile, de Taususi cannot
answer:
I am very desirous of being introduced
to a young lady who is employed at the
gas works. Would it be proper to go down
the cellar to meter?
Is the Yale lock enployed by the New
Haven students when they go fussing?

THE ENGINEER.
By a Phunny Pharmic.
An engineer in college
Is considered very rough.
And even in his class rooms
He often has to bluff.
The engineer, he swears,
And oft, indeed, he cusses.
The engineer is even crude,
He rides in. jitney busses.
But an engineer has character
That's always white and clear;
He never visits Ypsi,
And he never drinks a beer.
AIN'T IT?
"You sing a little song or two,
You have a little chat;
You make a little candy fudge,
Then you take your hat.
"You hold her hand and say 'Good-bye'
As sweetly as you can,
Ain't that a hell of an evening
For a great big healthy man?"
THE "COLLICH DEFFIL"
Oh, he was a college man,
Was away four years to school,
But, all he ever learned
Was the art of shooting pool.
Oh, yes, he was a college chap
And when in his Freshman year,
He won the highest medal
For his ability to drink beer.
And when he was a Sophomore,
Just still a College imp,
He wore his yellow gloves
And was rated as a simp.
But 'twas in his Junior year
That he won his lofty fame;
He pitched for his Fraternity team
And never lost a game.
He soon became a Senior
And his grades were not so high,
But, for all of that, he spent his time,
A-downing "Rock and Rye."
But when he came to graduate
With the rest of his fellow men,
He looked forward to the day
That he'd be great.—But when?
Now, since he is getting 8 a week
On the strength of his wee, small knowl-
edge,
He wishes that he had studied, instead
Of fooling away his time at college.

ARCHITECTURE-THE ENGINEER'S FINE ART
BY BEVERLY ROBINSON
The average person, on seeing a
photograph of a Turkish mosque or
of a Scottish castle, is impressed only
by the beauty of the picture. By
some others, certain historical events
and circumstances relating to the pic-
ture are called to mind. Many regard
knowledge of architectural works of
the past as a subject entirely for the
aesthetic person, ignoring the fact
that most of the ancient monuments
are highly interesting for their engi-
neering considerations, and that vir-
tually all of them were erected to
meet the exacting demands of their
age.
This careless disregard of the
works of antiquity is a natural one,
considering the present period of fe-
verish haste in which we live, and the
pressing commercial conditions which
tend to bring about close specializa-
tion in education. Consequently, men
who are trained to close technicalities
feel perfectly sure that their friends,
whom they chance to find lost in
thought over the design of a build-
ing, are all very delightful and orna-
mental personalities, but on the whole
are not of a very vital turn of mind.
Now the purpose of the study of
architectural and engineering works
of the past is just the same as the
study of the history of events. We
study, not for the sake of becoming
jugglers of disconnected facts, but
because of what we may learn in con-
the individual of that time.
Analogously, with anything more
than a superficial consideration of the
monuments of the past, one can draw
a vast amount of knowledge which is
of immediate value to the engineer
and architect. Moreover, the whole
development of mankind may be fol-
lowed with striking certainty in the
changes of the architectural styles.
Considering that the mind of man has
been deeply imbued with religion, the
spiritual philosophy is perhaps the
most forceful expression to be ob-
served. For instance, the dark, col-
umned halls of ancient Egyptian tem-
ples, and the cold, massive pyramids,
declare the cruel mysticism of the re-
ligion and the utter insignificance of
the individual of that time.
One hears much today of the lack
of truthfulness of modern architec-
tural design. Architectural design has
always been truthful to the extent of
being expressive of its time and of the
circumstances of its production. Such
periods as that of the past generation
and of our own day, in which we see
the mixture of both veneers of his-
toric motifs and of newly-developed
structural units, clearly demonstrate
the transitional state of our architec-
tural development. And parallel with
this state of change in our architec-
ture, who has not felt that similar
changes are, by the same causes, be-
ing worked in our whole religious,
social, and economical fabric?


Fine arts are ever the field of hu-
man self-expression. For instance, a
photograph is usually a mechanical
process of producing an exact picture
of an object. On the other hand, a
painting of that same object will pre-
sent not the exact image of the object,
but the mental impression it has made
upon the artist. The result will be
quite different from a photograph, be-
cause the man who produced it can-
ot help expressing himself in his
work. This same self-expressiveness
is characteristic of architecture, sculp-
ture—in fact, of every art.
Through this inevitable self-
expression the forecast of all great
humanitarian changes, which have oc-
curred in history, has often first been
told. Thus, when the painters of the
Renaissance were so bold as to depict
a madonna in an unconventional pose,
they did not dream that the tendency
for freedom thus expressed would
culminate, as it did some centuries
Jater, in the doctrines of Martin Lu-
ther. Similarly, the cynical writings
of Voltaire in the eighteenth century
started a tendency in philosophy
which bore fruit a generation later
in the French Revolution. Upon an-
alysis it will be found that all the fine
arts likewise have a similar develop-
ment and mode of expression at
any given period. It is always easier,
though, to follow the changes in hu-
man expression in music, sculpture,
or painting than in architecture, be-
cause they are much simpler by nature
and more direct in their appeal. Ar-
chitecture as a medium of expression
is inseparably bound up with utilita-
rian and structural considerations,
consequently its expressiveness is
often much disguised. Should prece-
dence be given any one of the arts in
point of importance or priority, ar-
chitecture certainly deserves tha'
place. Because, as various author&gt;
have shown, houses had first to be
built iu order to shelter works of the
decorative arts.
Architecture is most inspiring in its
■two periods' of greatest perfection;
first during the Golden Age of An-
cient Athens, and some sixteen cen-
turies later during the supreme as-
cendancy of Christianity. From these
two phases can be drawn the most
illuminating inferences. In order to
avoid the tedium of analyzing innu-
merable other types, these two are
chosen as being most fruitful for a
brief consideration. The Greek and
Gothic architectures show in a more
intense way the fundamental qualities
necessary to all good architecture.
From them can be deduced most
readily those principles which are
necessary to every style of architec-
ture, both present and future, if it is
to have any qualities beyond that of
its momentary utility.
At first glance, Greek and Gothic
architecture appear to be diametric-
ally opposed in every respect. Note
how the general impression of the ex-
terior of the Theseum at Athens is
one of low, compact horizontality;
whereas the facade and nave exterior
of the Cathedral of Rheims gives a
markedly vertical effect. The results,
the effects and expressions of the two
buildings are undoubtedly different,
but the method of evolution is identi-
cal. The system of development has
been in both cases founded upon a
given structural idea. That idea has
been followed out logically, and good
results of different character have fol-
lowed naturally. The structural idea
of the Greek temple is simply the post
and lintel: that of the Gothic cathe-
dral has been the pointed arch. In


other words, the two methods of
spanning an opening in stone have
been employed; first, of making the
span in a single stone, and second, of
making the span in several pieces of
stone. And simply by the perfection
of motifs, both aesthetically and
structurally, have the final results
been achieved.
Suppose we analyze this temple at
Athens dedicated to the hero The-
seus. It strikes one at first glance
as a simple polyhedron in form, the
outer sides of which are bounded by
a succession of columns. Further-
more, each column is ornamented with
a succession of vertical lines, and
above each column is a rectangular
block. The triglyph is also ornament-
ed with a series of verticals. Even
the lesser ornamental details, indis-
cernible in the photograph, are com-
posed of primarily vertical lines. In
other words, the column, the vertical
support, the line of perpendicular ac-
tion, has been used as an ornamental
motif interwoven through the whole
design. In precisely the same way the
motif of the lintel is also interwoven
through the design. The lintel is the
plain band of stone which spans from
column to column, exerting a down-
ward action. A narrower strip of
stone, the taenia, defines its upper
edge. This taenia is in form but an-
other diminutive lintel. The cornice
counts simply as another horizontal
form, as do likewise the three steps
composing the foundation of the en-
tire building. Again, upon closer ex-
amination of many of the details the
motif of the horizontal lintel will be
found to be just as much involved in
the composition as is the motif of
verticals. Thus we find that type of
design, which is one of the most per-
fect ever produced, has for its theme
simply the acknowledgment of its
statical basis.
"But," will say the engineer, "see
what an extravagant waste of mate-
rial. That job could be executed with
but half the amount if intelligently
modified." To be sure, that is true,
but it is to be remembered that, for
the length of those lintels and the
mass above them to be supported,
those columns are entirely adequate.
More than that, they look as if they
were adequate. In other temples
there are different relations of column
diameter and entablature, both lighter
and heavier, showing how sensitive
were the Greeks to the relative
strength of their lintels and supports.
Mere statical equilibrium was insuf-
ficient. The architect's choice of this
or that size of column was not merely
a mechanical matter. There were, in
addition, the elements of expression
and the feeling for the design of pure
form. The rules of form design have
never been completely reduced to
formulas. Some day, no doubt, it will
be achieved. For the present, how-
ever, they must remain as they are,
merely matters of judgment, some-
thing quite inexplicable to the unin-
itiated.
Fortunately, expression in architec-
ture can readily be appreciated by an
observer of a period different from
that of the building under considera-
tion. Perhaps the most obvious as-
pect of a Greek temple is its concise,
frank simplicity. Very straightfor-
ward in its construction, not in the
least disguised, every line of it is di-
rect and self-explanatory. This ex-
pression bears an interesting resem-
blance to the direct, earnest character
of the mind of the ancient Greek. It
is not unnatural, after all, that the
inventors of logic should love a most


obvious and logical method of build-
ing. Throughout the temple, note the
highly abstract development given
every form, both structural and orna-
mental. The Greek was chiefly de-
voted to the study of form as pure
design, and but secondarily followed
any historical precedent. Indeed,
this profession of well-studied ab-
stract form describes exactly the ana-
lytical and scientific turn of mind of
the designer. Within the surround-
ing colonnade of the classic temple
was a dark sanctuary, lighted only by
the streak of daylight admitted
through the doorway. Such a sanc-
tuary formed a most suitable setting
for the "sacred mysteries" of their
religion. Thus has the Greek for all
time expressed himself as a highly de-
veloped artist, scientist and mystic,
which we know him to have been, ac-
cording to his written accounts.
The Golden Age of Greece marks
the high tide of the enlightenment of
the ancient or pre-Christian civiliza-
tions. At that time the whole of the
established social organization was
consciously united through the com-
mon taste for intellectual pursuits.
The next greatest period, when the
social organization was consciously
united in spirit, was during the as-
cendancy of Christianity at the be-
ginning of the thirteenth century.
Uppermost in the mind of the Greek
was felt a striving toward an intel-
lectual ideal. And this effort was
pronounced in his architecture. Dur-
ing the Middle Ages, however, the
goal of mental effort was a religious
ideal, and similarly, as in the case of
the architecture of ancient Greece,
this spirit of idealism produced an
equally high grade of mediaeval ar-
chitecture.
The same feeling of sublime fervor
which brought about the romantic yet
barbarous crusades produced archi-
tecture of high emotional quality. In
fact, Gothic architecture flourished
best in the very spot where was insti-
gated its war-like counterpart. At
Amiens, Peter the Hermit first
preached the crusades. Not only in
that same city, but in the same vicin-
ity from which the later crusaders
were largely mustered, are to be
found the biggest and finest of their
cathedrals. Remarkable it is, too,
that they, inspired as they were with
an emotional ideal, should have de-
veloped an architecture more scien-
tific, if anything, than that developed
by the Greeks.
For illustration, let us consider
these views of the Cathedrals of
Rheims. This model of a section
taken through the main body of the
church is especially interesting. This
cast was made from drawings by Pro-
fessor T,orch, to whom we are indebt-
ed for the accompanying photograph.
Now how has the cathedral in its
complete conception come into being?
First of all, a noble, dignified edifice
was required, one which would count
as a lasting inspiration to the wor-
shipers. For the monks and master
masons of the Middle Ages strongly
felt the close relation between the re-
ligious and aesthetic emotions. In or-
der to emphasize this expression of
emotion tall vertical lines were used.
A distinctly spirited design both inside
and out resulted. The design of the
interior of the cathedral was evolved
as a natural consequence.
The erection of the mediaeval ca-
thedral is most remarkable when one
takes into consideration the primitive
building methods and the limitations
of materials. Limestone was usually


used. The stones were of fairly the result of experiment, and their
small size, due to the small hand op- achievements were made after repeat-
erated hoisting devices employed, ed failures. The development of
Lime mortar was the only cement, church construction was a slow one in
Rheims Cathedral
Mathematics beyond arithmetic was
unknown to them. Arch diagrams
and handbooks were yet to be discov-
ered. Every master mason of those
days learned his art as an apprentice
on the job. Thus their successes were
measure of time, but remarkably quick
considering the difficulties to be over-
come. Gothic architects acquired much
the same degree of skill, compared
with modern engineers as did the
builders of fast yachts, who until the


recent generations worked entirely by
rule of thumb.
The keynote of the design of the
whole church is the pointed vault. Its
form, the difficulties of its construc-
tion, and the complications it entailed
formed the determining factor in ca-
thedral design. The main body of the
church consists of three parallel aisles,
the middle one being somewhat higher
forming a clerestory, and known as
the nave. The dimensions of cathedral
naves average 45 feet between walls,
and 125 feet in height measuring to
the crown of the vault. In order to
allow space for the largest possible
window the vaults over both nave and
aisles were made with penetrations.
Pointed vaults were chosen because
they exerted less outward thrust, than
do vaults of any other form. The con-
struction of these great vaults involved
considerable ingenuity. In the first
place a complete system of wood cen-
tering was prohibited because of its
expense. In order to meet this diffi-
culty stone arches or ribs were built
at the groins of the vaults. These ribs
could be constructed one set at a time
the same centering being made to serve
for all the other compartments. Then
the shell of the vault was constructed
on an adjustable hand center, which
could be shifted to each new course
of masonry. In order to shift the
weight of each vaulted compartment
more directly to a vertical line there
was added between them a transverse
rib whose crown was lower than that
of the diagonal ribs. The profile of
a section taken through a vault rib
shows it to be designed with due re-
gard to efficiency; and the compara-
tive size of the ribs was carefully
studied with reference to the weight
to be supported.
The immediate counterparts of the
vaults were their counterthrusts. They
are the half arches sprung from the
haunch and spring of each vault,
thence to a mass of masonry outside
the aisle wall. These half arches are
known, picturesquely enough, as fly-
ing buttresses in contrast to the ver-
tical masses on which they rest, which
are known as pier buttresses. These
flying-buttresses were designed very
lightly considering the task they had
to perform. The pier-buttresses were
also designed efficiently. In the first
place they are rectangular in plan
with their longer axis perpendicular to
the church. Then in order to be as
much reduced in size as possible some
of the mass, which was necessary to
resist the thrust of the flying-buttress,
was piled above high in the air in the
form of a great pinnacle. The size of
the pier in plan increases by means of
offsets to bear the greater weight at
the base.
Throughout the minor parts of the
edifice the same structural efficiency of
form is to be found. The columns of
the lowest nave arcade are as small as
possible. Their bases are spreading in
form so as to distribute the weight on
the ground. Capitals throughout the
church are so designed as to bring a
larger mass of masonry above to con-
form to a smaller shaft below. In
the windows some substantial device
was needed to reinforce the large areas
of stained glass. To meet this need
bars and little arches of stone were
added in the window area, tracery as
it is known. This tracery was cleverly
designed so as to resist wind pressure.
It must not be thought that when
the needed form of building was de-
termined that thereafter efficiency of
construction was the sole end and pur-
pose of the building. Just as the main


form of the cathedral was devised so
as to harmonize with religious feeling
so the lesser portions were designed
with reference to their aesthetic value.
ed. Above both aisle and nave vaults
were high pointed roofs, which were
supported by a forest of wooden
trusses. This timbering occasionally

The vaults themselves, the main struc-
tural achievement, were wholly un-

economy had been consistently follow-
caught fire, and caused the destruction
of portions or the whole of a vault.
These vaults were designed largely to
give a dignified and consistent charac-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
ter to the interior. The pitch of the
roof above them was steeper than nec-
essary to shed the rain and snow of
their vicinity. Indeed the climate of
northwestern France is milder than
our own. The pointed curve of the
vault was made graceful. All the
arches of the three tiers of arcades,
and the little arches of the tracery in
the clerestory windows are made about
the same curve of the vault, in order
to harmonize with it. The profiles
of the vault ribs, of the colonnetts ex-
tending to the floor, of the archivolts
of all the arches are made interesting,
and in good proportion to their adja-
cent members.
The foregoing will be inobscure to
those who have not attempted the
study of form from an architect's
point of view. However it suffices to
show that the aesthetic considerations
in Gothic architecture involved every
visible member and were not confined
to the purely ornamental features. Or-
namental features there were, and of
a very effective kind. They consisted
principally of bands of carved orna-
ment and stained glass. The fact that
the ornament cannot be seen in the
illustrations, and that the edifice re-
mains beautiful without the stained
glass, shows how sub-ordinated in the
architect's mind were decorative de-
tails to the main structural scheme.
Throughout the design the pointed
arch has been made the main orna-
mental feature as well as being the
basic structural idea. In this respect
the Goths follow precisely the same
system of designing as did the Greeks.
The difference in the results is largely
the result of the difference in types of
construction used.
At intervals during the past century
various architectural styles have be-
come fashionable. This tendency has
been due to the ever increasing volume
of publications on architecture. With
each new output has followed an en-
thusiasm for the particular style pre-
sented. The fashionable style was
usually applied as a veneer in a frank-
ly affected manner. Fortunately now
that all the books on all architectural
styles are available to everybody, and
a more liberal education is given to
architects, a broader point of view is
being taken.
Historical examples such as the
Greek temple or Gothic cathedral dem-
onstrate the inseparable relation of the
structural and artistic considerations
in an architectural design. But be-
yond that, the principles of architec-
tural expression can also be deducted
from historical examples. Architec-
tural design must be able now, as al-
ways, to meet the sympathy and point
of view of every man, and not of the
student trained in antiquity, alone.
Just as the Greeks and Goths inevit-
ably built so as to express their phil-
osophy so have we in the past and will
in the future. In order to give a
proper expression to our architecture
of the present it is only necessary to
analyze our point of view. Certain
features distinguish us from the peo-
ple of the past. In the first place,
science has cultivated more than ever
before in history, the attitude of rea-
son. Besides, there is the commercial
attitude of mind produced by the in-
tense struggle for existence. On the
other hand, the emotional attitude has
fallen into abeyance for the time be-
ing. Idealism and an appreciation of
the beautiful remains to us just
as it ever did. For even the
more cold-blooded bankers have been
forced to realize the demand for and
the commercial value of attractive
buildings.


In the newer sections of cities evi-
dence of this is to be found in well-
designed stores, office buildings, and
dwellings, which are replacing the
aberrations of a generation or two
ago. This rapid abandonment and
demolishment of ugly old buildings is
but a reiteration of the fact that good
architecture is desirable, whereas the
strictly utilitarian building barely out-
lasts the immediate need which caused
its erection. Beautiful edifices, on the
other hand, last longer than their im-
mediate use requires and are pre-
served for re-adaptations to later
times. Thus they are, in the long run,
more economical. Thoroughly useful
a building must be, but besides that
it must also be as attractive as pos-
sible. To refer to the historic exam-
ple again, the French cathedral could
never have come into existence had
it not been designed by men who
grasped the significance of beauty as
well as utility.
Mr. Frank Lloyd Wright, of Chi-
cago, has struck a new note in archi-
tectural design simply by acknowledg-
ing a modern constructive feature.
Familiar to many are his delightful
works in domestic architecture, in
which the concrete slab with its verti-
cal support is the structural note
forming the basic idea of the design.
That idea has been interwoven
through the whole composition to its
own logical conclusion; not with the
same skill, but with a similar system
of reasoning, which the Greks fol-
lowed in handling their column and
lintel motif. Mr. Cass Gilbert in the
justly famous Woolworth Building in
New York has designed not Gothic
architecture, but a re-adaptation of
Gothic, so as to properly express the
light vertical lines of steel construc-
tion. As it stands, the Woolworth
Building is expressive of the bound-
less commercial ambition, and of proud
individualism. To the broker's runner
in Wall Street it serves as quite a
Woolworth Building
buoyant inspiration as did ever a
cathedral to its penitent worshiper.
With the many recently invented
methods of construction the prospect
of the future in architecture is quite
unlimited. The development of our
opportunities, however, must rest
with men of broad training and wider
sympathies if the problems are to be
handled in a satisfactory manner.


PURIFICATION
BY W. L. BADGER
The water purification process de-
scribed in this article is in operation
at the Park Place plant of the Detroit
Edison Company, and is unusual in
that the water being purified would
be considered excellent in most cases.
The necessity for purification arises
'#

Ml

from the unusually heavy loads car'
ried and a desire to keep the plant at
the highest possible efficiency.
The Park Place plant consists of
•eight Stirling boilers of about 725
rated horsepower each, furnishing
steam at 125 pounds for heating pur-
poses in the downtown district of De-
troit. A view of one of the boilers
during construction is shown in Fig.
1. Owing to the rapid growth of the
business district and the lack of space
in which to make any additions to the
plant, the load is extremely heavy.
During the winter all the boilers are
run above their rating, loads of 150
to 200 per cen,t being common, and
occasionally as high as 250 to 300 per
cent is reached.
It has been shown by various in-
vestigators, among others the U. S.
Bureau of Mines, that the amount of
heat which could be passed through
a square foot of boiler surface may
be greatly increased by increasing the
velocity of the flames and products of
combustion. The reason is best ex-
pressed by saying that the high ve-
locity of the gases tends to remove
the stagnant film of gas always exist-
ing on the hot side of a boiler sur-
face. To accomplish this, in the Park
Place plant the ordinary Stirling baf-
fling has been modified as shown in
Fig. 2. It will be seen tha,t the gases
have to make four complete passes in
their travel through the boiler. At
the same time the cross section of the
path is decreased as much as possible,
and by these two alterations the path
is lengthened and the velocity in-
creased.
But this increase in the amount of
heat transmitted through a square
foot of metal means a rise in the
temperature of the metal, especially
on the flame side, and if there is any
resistance to the escape of heat from
the metal on the water side, this tem-
perature will be still further increased,


ii
perhaps up to the point where the
metal will be overheated and fail.
This seems to be what happened in
the Park Place plant; for the tubes,
especially in the front row, would
bulge on the side toward the fire and
necessitate frequent repairs. A side
view of such a bagged tube is shown
in Fig. 3. With the severe operating
conditions imposed upon this plant it
became essential to do something to
diminish these frequent repairs. Prof.

found in the tubes. Fig. 4 shows the
inside of the tube of Fig. 3, directly
over the bag, and the edge of the
layer of scale can be plainly seen. It
seemed probable that some relief
would be secured by removing this
scale: but the final solution will not
be found until the question of the re-
lation of the properties of the metal
to the failures has been answered.
Accordingly the author took up the
problem of keeping these boilers
clean.
The water used is Detroit city wa-
ter, which is taken from the Detroit
River and is ordinarily considered a
very soft water. It contains about 20
to 25 parts of calcium ions per mil-
lion, about 5 parts magnesium ions,
and 8 to 10 parts of S04 ions. This
represents a possible 14 parts per mil-
lion of calcium sulfate and 40 to 50
parts of calcium carbonate (held in
solution as CafHCO:,)2. The water
is handled as shown in Fig. 2. A
booster pump takes the city water and
forces a part through cast steel water-
remove the calcium carbonate. These
purifiers consist of a cylindrical shell
filled with trays over which the water
flows. The slides for these trays and
the nozzles for distributing the water
Fig. 4. Scale on Inside of Bagged Tube
are seen in Fig. 6. Live steam at
boiler pressure is put into these puri-
fiers and the water is heated to about
350° F. This decomposes the calcium
bicarbonates, and enough steam is


13
taken off from the purifiers to re-
move the carbon dioxide so liberated
and thus prevent the carbonates from
going back into solution. Most of the
carbonate so precipitated is deposited
on the trays and the rest passes to
the boilers in suspension.
Calcium carbonate has no tendency
to form closely-adhering scale, and in
view of this, and the additional fact
that no provision is made for remov-
tions of the water, the alkalinity being
held at about 200 parts sodium car-
bonate per million. After this run
the boiler was inspected and found to
be absolutely free from scale. All the
tubes were in good condition, though
during this run no excessive loads
were carried. There was a consider-
able amount of very fine, loose car-
bonate sludge in the mud drum, the
result of the reaction with the soda.
ing the calcium sulfate present, the
source of the trouble was sought in
this compound. A sample of scale
from a tube which had failed showed
95% calcium sulfate, and other sam-
ples from the inside of the boilers
varying amounts from 50% up.
Scale from the purifiers showed only
4% calcium sulfate, the remainder
being calcium carbonate. This was
as might be expected, and pointed to
sodium carbonate as the remedy.
One boiler was equipped with sep-
arate feed and a device for feeding
sodium carbonate solution in just suf-
ficient quantity to precipitate the cal-
cium sulfate as carbonate. During
this treatment (which was operated
from July 20 to October 5) the dose
of soda was regulated by daily titra-
Fic. 6. Interior of Purifier
Owing to the great dilution of the
feed water the precipitate was too fine
to settle in the purifiers. Not the
slightest tendency was observed for
this sludge to adhere to the surfaces.
Later this boiler was put in service
on untreated water, and then a num-
ber of tubes had to be replaced after
a few weeks. They were found to
have a layer of this loose, powdery
deposit next to the metal, and over
this a thin layer of hard sulfate scale.
Without this sulfate scale there could
have been no adherence, so far as ex-
perience with this water has gone.


THE MICHIGAN TECH NIC
The results on this boiler were so
satisfactory that the whole plant was
put on treated water. The system
shown in Fig. 7 was installed, and
sodium carbonate fed at the rate of
3^4 pounds per day per 100% of
rating for each boiler. This is equiv-
alent to a dose of abou,t one part to
170,000 of water. All the water pass-
ing to the heaters goes through a
Venturi meter. This Venturi tube is
connected to a mercury U-tube, on
been in service long enough to have
received a severe test, so far it has
worked with entire satisfaction.
It is, of course, out of the question
to base the control of such a process
on daily analyses of the water. The
calculation of the soda to be fed from
the results of such an analysis would
be questionable at best. At first the
feed was controlled by titrating the
blow-off water and keeping the alka-
linity at about 200 parts sodium car-

one arm of which floats a cast iron
weight controlling the siphon which
feeds the soda solution from the con-
stant level tank. As the difference in
pressure given by the Venturi tube is
proportional to the square of the flow
through it, and as the amount of solu-
tion delivered by the siphon is pro-
portional to the square of the head,
the control of the head on the siphon
by the Venturi tube results in a pro-
portional dosage. This system was
devised by the engineers of the Edi-
son Company, and though it has not
bonate per million. The result of the
reactions is to replace calcium sulfate
by sodium sulfate, and alkalinity de-
terminations did not take cognizance
of this. Consequently, very early in
the treatment foaming appeared as
the result of allowing the blow-off
water to become too concentrated. As
a system of control was desired which
could be carried out in the boiler
room, the total solids were followed
by the Dionic tester, and the blow-off,
and consequently the concentration of
soluble matter, was controlled by this.

ratus for rapid determinations of the
electrical conductivity of solutions. If
the solutions are sufficiently dilute for
ionization to be fairly complete, and
if the composition of the dissolved
solids does not vary too much, the
conductivity is a very fair measure of
the concentration. By keeping the
conductivity below 1800 to 2000 when
testing a mixture of equal parts of
blow-off and distilled water, foaming
has been completely avoided. This is
not known to be the upper limit for
this water, but it was taken when the
boilers were running without foam-
ing, and the plant is too closely pushed
to take any chances by experimenting
with higher figures.
If the water fed to the boilers had
a certain definite excess of sodium
carbonate after reactions were com-
pleted, and if all the boilers evap-
orated the same amount and the same
amount were blown off from each
boiler each time, then the alkalinity
of the water would be a sufficient
guide to the amount of soda to be
fed. Of course the above conditions
do not hold, and consequently the al-
kalinity varies from day to day even
with a constant alkalinity of the boiler
feed. Rut if the composition of the
raw water is fairly constant, then
whatever the ratio of excess soda to
total dissolved material, this ratio
should remain constant, no matter
how far the solids were concentrated
Cwithin limits practical in a boiler).
The amount blown off each day will
affect the absolute values of conduc-
tivity and alkalinity, but not their ra-
tio. It has been found for this water
that when the Dionic tester readings
(taken as described above and re-
duced to 200 C), divided by the alka-
linity expressed as parts sodium car-
bonate per million, is less than 8, the
concentration of carbonate ions is suf-
ficient to remove all calcium ions from
the solution ; in other words, the water
is free from scale-forming substances.
When this ratio is over 12, calcium is
found in solution. The dividing line
will be more accurately established as
soon as possible. It is plain that this
ratio would have to be re-determined
for waters of other composition.
It is interesting to follow fhe be-
havior of a boiler which is started on
the treated water while there is still
scale on the tubes. The treated water
contains no calcium sulfate, therefore
calcium sulfate dissolves off the tubes,
is precipitated by the excess soda in
solution until it is all used up, and
this cycle continues till the scale is all
removed. While the boiler still con-
tains scale there can be no excess soda
and consequently the alkalinity is low
and the ratio high and irregular. As
soon as the scale is all removed the
excess soda fed is concentrated the
same as the other dissolved materials,
and the ratio drops at once to a regu-
lar value corresponding to the rate of
feed. This has been confirmed by ac-
tual inspection of boilers which have
shown regular figures from the start,
boilers which have been irregular up
to the time of inspection, and boilers
which have been irregular for a time
but settled down to regular running
before inspection.
The main feature of this process is
then the method of control. Feeding
soda to remove calcium sulfate is as
old as boiler treatment in any form.
In this plant the blow-off water from
each boiler is tested each day, and if
any boiler shows over 1800 on the di-
luted sample it is at once given a sec-
ond blow. The composition of the
water is so constant that titrations to


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
determine the rate of feed are made
only once every three or four days—
perhaps once a week will be sufficient
when limiting values and running con-
ditions are better worked out. If the
ratio of conductivity to alkalinity is
above 10 the sample is sent to the
laboratory for a calcium determina-
tion, and if the ratio is high for more
than one boiler the rate of feed is in-
creased until it comes back to the de-
sired figure. In the same way, if the
ratio goes much below 6 the feed of
soda is decreased. Thus the control
is simple enough to be carried out in
the boiler room, and takes but a very
short time. At the same time the
boiler water is under supervision at all
times; the blow-off is on a rational
basis and there is no needless loss of
heat and water through too heavy
blows ; the water is completely cleaned
without carrying needlessly high alka-
linities and all danger of foaming is
avoided. It is merely another case of
comparatively simple operations as-
suming considerable importance in a
closely managed plant, and the substi-
tution of rational and definite stand-
ards in place of "judgment."
Unfortunately, the process has not
yet been in operation long enough to
allow of positive statements on the
most important point—the life of the
tubes. The primary result is not at
all in question. The boilers are abso-
lutely free from scale and remain so,
and there is no danger of foaming.
There has not yet been severe enough
weather to give the boilers a thorough
test over a long enough period to
make accurate statements about the
number of tube replacements neces-
sary. Results so far, however, are
encouraging.

GREAT LAKES
BY GORDON D. COOKE
"Three points to sta'board, Bill,"
the captain's voice boomed suddenly
down into the wheelhousc from the
"bridge above.
"Three points to sta'board, sir."
The wheel spun to the left in Bill's
powerful hands and was held there
while the big ship slowly began to
swing over. "Bill," peering intently
into the binnacle as the ship swung,
turned the wheel back a little farther
than he had spun it. The great ship
paused and was on the point of re-
tracing the arc.
"Steady 'er there, Bill," boomed the
voice from above.
"Steady she is, sir."
The wheelsman again turned the
wheel and the ship steadied on her
course.
"What's y'er course?"
"North b' east a quarter east, sir."
after another scrutiny of the binnacle
-card.
"North b' east a quarter east," re-
peated the voice from above. A scrape
and a bang and the cover to the
speaking box closed.
A wondering landsman, I stood
gazing into the open door of the pilot
house with my mouth agape and won-
der writ large on my face. I had been
arrested in my deck promenade by
the booming voice of the captain di-
recting "Bill" to 'Three points to sta'-
board." At the order I had looked
up and out over the blue expanse of
lake before us, expecting to see a
ship bearing down on us or a rock
rearing its head from the deep.
But so far as the eye could reach,
clear to the dim horizon, I could see
neither ship nor rock nor yellowing
shoal water. Why, I wondered, had
the captain changed course so sud-
denly and decisively? I walked to the
furthest tip of the prow and stood
there watching the blue water curl
back from the bow. In my imagina-
tion I saw visions of unknown and
unseen dangers, rocky reefs, derelicts
which cruised the sea and were a men-
ace to sailors; I even thought of float-
ing mines.
Next morning, when I met our cap-
tain on deck, I asked him why he had
so unaccountably altered his course
the day before. The silent old sea-
man led me into the pilot house and
selecting one big lake chart from a
pile of others, traced with his broad,
stubby forefinger a thin red line which
led, with a number of deviations,
from one end of the lake to the other.
I guessed that this was the ship's
course. But the captain's finger as it
moved along the line had paused at
a corner and then moving sideways
had stopped directly below a curious
little symbol.
"Wreck," he said laconically.
The symbol suggested to me, un-
mistakably, the water line with the
uptilted bow and mast of a wrecked
and sunken ship. What a gruesome
thing to put on a map, I thought. At
least there would be no mistaking that
mark. But the captain's finger was


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
moving on again to another kink in
the line. It paused here and moved
sideways a little until it stopped at a
small blue spot.
'"Shoal," he volunteered, and with
a sweep of the hand which invited
me to examine the chart further, he
walked out on deck and climbed to
the bridge.
I poured over that fascinating
chart for a good half hour. At the
end of that time, although my mind
was muddled and I had developed a
host of questions that I wanted to
U. S. S. Surveyor
ask, I had determined very definitely
on two things. I intended to find out
some time soon how they knew where
that wreck was and how they had lo-
cated that shoal.
Accordingly, when the following
spring I had the opportunity of taking
a trip with my good friend Brown
on the U. S. Str. Surveyor, engaged
in the United States Lake Survey-
Service, I accepted forthwith. On
that trip I answered for myself not
only the two questions that had been
troubling me but many others be-
sides.
Brown told me that a week before
one of the largest freighters on the
Great Lakes had reported striking an
obstruction in South Passage between
Kelly's and Catawba Islands, at the
west end of Lake Erie. The Survey-
or had been ordered to the place at
once with instructions to locate the
obstacle and to find out what it was.
It was during the location of this ob-
struction that I became acquainted not
only with the tension wire sweep but
also the field methods employed in
using it to locate either an abruptly
rising obstacle, such as the wreck, or
a gradually rising obstacle, such as
the shoal.
The only special apparatus used by
the U. S. Lake Survey in their task
of locating rocks, reefs and shoals is
the tension wire. This is an arrange-
ment of wires, floats and weights by
means of which a horizontal wire is
held suspended at a certain depth be-
low the water while it is "swept" over
the lake by a towing boat at each end.
The horizontal wire, o.i inch in di-
ameter, is fastened to a hundred-
pound weight at each end. Rising
vertically from each weight is a cable
of twisted iron wire fastened to the
lower part of a hemi-spherical float
that is of sufficient size to carry the
weight. Passing upward to the boats
from the weight at each end of the
wire is a j4-inch manila rope by
which the sweep is towed. Interme-
diate weights, verticals and floats are
spaced every ioo feet on the sweep
to insure a constant level to the sweep
for its whole length.
Details of the sweep are admirably
worked out tc insure its most efficient
operation. All of the verticals have
large iron rings fastened to them at
distances of a foot apart. By hook-
ing the intermediate floats into these
various rings, the operators can set
the sweep at any desired depth below
the water. This range of depth va-


19
ries from a few feet, eight or ten, to
a depth which rarely exceeds 35 or
40 feet. The can floats carry a red
signal flag which facilitates the ob-
later. The weights which ordinarily
hold the cans upright are so designed
as not to project below the sweeping
plane and are shaped with a sharp

servation of the action of the sweep
when it strikes an obstacle. They are
made with a dull spun-copper top and
a brightly tinned bottom. They are
cutting edge to minimize water fric-
tion.
A U. S. Lake Survey sweeping
party, as it is usually organized, is
also top-heavy and would turn turtle equipped with a steamer upon which

if it were not for the pull of the

top-heavy construction—will be shown

the entire party lives, a power launch,
two light cutters or rowboats for ten-
ders and a sweeping and sounding
outfit. The field methods of such a
party may perhaps best be made clear
by following through the operations
of sweeping.
The survey party on reaching the
area to be examined first anchors the
steamer and then pays out the sweep


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
to the launch which is to tow one end
of it. While the sweep is going out-
board from the special reel carried on
the after deck of the steamer, the in-
termediate floats, verticals and
weights, each carried in a special
compartment on deck, are attached to
the sweeping member by the closing
of a single catch. The fastening of
the intermediates to the sweep is pro-
vided for by placing in the line, at the
veyor the direction was due north and
the area that we were going to inves-
tigate lay to the east of this line.
On the steamer, which is equipped
with a sounding apparatus, sextant
locations are read frequently and
soundings are taken at the rate of
several a minute. The rate for the
sextant readings, every four or five
minutes, and the frequency of the

end of every hundred-foot length, a
double-ended, ball-bearing swivel
which serves the triple purpose of
eliminating kinks from the line or
sweep wire, providing attachment for
the intermediate weights and acting
as suspending points from the verti-
cals to the intermediate floats. The
sweep is thus paid out to the desired
length, which varies from iooo to
4000 feet.
When the sweep is in position the
boats proceed parallel with and
abreast of each other in a given direc-
tion. The day I sailed on the Sur-
onds, depends on the nature and im-
portance of the woric. The location
of the boat and soundings are plotted
as the sweep progresses. This is usu-
ally done by the first assistant engi-
neer, who has a table and chart on
the bridge. The second assistant en-
gineer is usually in charge of the
launch, which is at the far end of the
sweep and directly east of the steam-
er. From the launch marker buoys
are dropped at frequent intervals to
indicate the path of the outer end of
the sweep. Sharp lookout is kept
both from the launch and from the


21
bridge of the steamer for any indi-
cations of the sweep having encoun-
tered an obstacle.
When it becomes evident that the
sweep has caught, the chief-of-party.
on the bridge, signals to the launch
to stop, using either a flag or the
steamer's whistle as a signalling de-
vice. The steamer is also stopped and
is sometimes given a kick-back to re-
lieve the tension in the wire sweep.
By a peculiar and characteristic sing-
ing vibration which the sweep trans-
mits to the ship, it is clear whether the
tension is becoming greater or less.
This may be determined also by test-
ing the pull on the towing line. If the
tension is increasing, a condition which
may be occasioned by the failure of
the launch to observe the signal to
stop or by the continued headway of
the steamer, the sweep is cast loose to
save it from breaking.
The fact that the sweep is aground
is shown in one of two ways, depend-
ing on the nature of the catch. If the
bottom has shoaled gradually, a whole
length of the sweep has been pulled
up en the sand. In this case the catch,
due to the relieving of the tension in
the vertical, is indicated to the watch-
ers by the floats turning turtle and
displaying a bright shining bottom
which catches the sun's rays and thus
makes an easily discernible object
from the steamer or launch.
The second type of catch is that
where an abruptly rising obstacle,
such as a wreck or a pinnacle rock,
has held one point of the sweep sta-
tionary while the ends have been
pulled ahead. The catch in this case
is indicated to the engineers on watch
by the lining up of the sweep, ordi-
narily in a great semi-circle, to a point
directly over the catch. It was a catch
of this second type that we made that
day in South Passage. Brown located
a pinnacle rock close to the track of
vessels in water of a minimum depth
of 17 feet. It showed but 9^/2 feet
over it and the top of the rock was
6 feet in diameter and of such con-
formation that it surely would have
meant disaster to any vessel unfortu-
nate enough to strike it..
Either type of catch having been
made, the problem of locating the ob-
stacle next arises. Sextant readings
Land Triangulation Station
are immediately taken to locate the
ship. The location as well as the
depth are plotted. An angle is then
read between one of the signals in
use and the line of can buoys. The
distance to the catch is learned by
counting the number of cans out to
the catch and multiplying this num-
ber by 100. By scaling off this dis-
tance along the line last plotted the
catch is charted. In case it is a catch
of the second type—c. g., a wreck or
a rock—that one point will suffice. In
the other case the number of cans
aground arc counted and then marked
with the depth at which the sweep
was set below the water, and opera-
tions are resumed.


THE. MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Clearing the sweep from the shoal
catch is a great deal more difficult
than the same operation on the rock
catch. The tenders hurry to the spot
indicated by the shining can bottoms
and clear the sweep by shortening all
of the verticals. This raises the whole
sweep to such a depth as may have.
been indicated by the chief-of-party.
Each vertical must be shortened by
the same length, and when this is ac-
complished the sweep is towed over
the shoal until it strikes again. The
points are located and marked on the
chart with a depth corresponding to
the decreased length of the vertical.
This operation of decreasing the
length of the vertical and catching the
sweep is repeated until the whole
sweep clears the shoal, and not until
then is it assumed that the least depth
has been found. In nearly every case
in raising the sweep just mentioned
the nature of the obstruction can be
determined by the action of the sweep
wire in being freed or by particles
brought up by the wire or swivels and
weights. Rock catches are cleared by
merely raising one point of the sweep
over the obstruction and dropping it
on the other side. After a marker
buoy has been dropped at the spot
the party may proceed, leaving the
obstruction to be examined more
carefully at a later time by a special
sweep designed for that purpose.
In July, 1913. M. S. MacDiarmid,
in charge of the U. S. Str. Surveyor,
swept 100 square miles in 19 working
days, or an average of more than five
square miles per day. In four con-
secutive days over 28 miles were cov-
ered.
At the close of the day's work the
sweep may be pulled taut and each
end anchored down for the night, or
the floats may be removed and the
wires allowed to sink to the bottom,
leaving only the end attached to the
large float; but more generally the
entire sweep is taken on board the
steamer. In this case, the horizontal
member is reeled up on the special
hand reel and the vertical wires,
weights and cans are detached and
stored in their respective compart-
ments.
The sweep aboard, a "deckie" passes
a tow line to the launch, the launch-
men come aboard, the tenders are
pulled up on the davits, one gong and
then four sound in the engine room,
and the good ship Surveyor is headed
for her berth to the lee of Gillee Gal-
loo Tsland.
A tired longshoreman, with not a
question in the world about the lake
survey service, stood leaning on the
bow rail as the ship laid a course di-
rectly into the heart of the western
sun. He remembered his wonder
and questioning on that other trip
long ago, when the captain's finger
bad traced the thin red line and had
paused first at a wreck and then at a
shoal. He had seen both located and
charted today, and. after all, it wasn't
very complex, this business of lake
surveying. He almost wondered at
his wonder on that other trip.
"Hard to port, Bill," came a voice
from the bridge.
The man in the bow came to life
with a jerk, looking out over the star-
hoard bow and then to port. With
the same wonder on his face as of old
he turned to the captain, when the
anchor let go and the good ship Sur-
veyor swung at her night's berth.


LEONARD W. H. CHARNOCK
Fifty years ago little
was known of the in-
terior of South Africa
except from the stories
of hunters and mission-
aries. The sparse white
population living in
small villages and on
isolated farms was al-
most entirely devoted to
natural pursuits. Wool was the only
appreciable article of export. There
were no railways worth speaking of,
no docks at any of the ports; the
rivers were unbridged: the roads in-
describably bad; the bullock wagon
traveling twelve miles a day was the
chief means of communication. It was
a drowsy land, peopled by hordes of
idle natives and overrun by herds of
antelope and big game. So it had been
for generations, and so" it might have
continued indefinitely but for the ac-
cidental discovery of diamonds. In
the forty odd years since that discov-
ery occurred, more progress has been
made in the country than in the pre-
vious four hundred years since the
Portuguese discovered the Cape.
One summer's evening in the month
of March, 1867, a trader named John
O'Reilly, on his way to Colesberg
from the junction of the Vaal and
Orange Rivers, outspanned* at Schalk
van Niekerk's farm, De Kalk, in the
Hopetown district. Amongst a lot of
pebbles which a Bushman child had
collected as playthings O'Reilly picked
out a stone of uncommon lustre, and

readily received permission to take it
with him on resuming his journey.
After passing through several hands
and narrowing escaping being thrown
away as valueless, it finally reached
Dr. W. Guybon Atherstone at
Grahamstown, who wrote: "I con-
gratulate you on the stone you have
sent me. It is a veritable diamond,
weight 2\% carats, and is worth ap-
proximately $2,500. It has spoilt all
the jewelers' files in Grahamstown,
and where that came from there must
be lots more." Wise and prophetic
words! Rut the difficulty was to know
where it had come from, and the mys-
tery remains unsolved to this day. Two
years were spent, almost without re-
sult, in searching the neighborhood of
De Kalk, and then the famous "Star of
South Africa", weighing 83^ carats,
was obtained from a native witch-
doctor. Subsequently it was sold to
Lady Dudley for approximately
$125,000. Yet no diamond mine has
been discovered within fifty miles of
the locality of these first discoveries.
Conceivably enough, these first dia-
monds may have been carried about
by the natives for centuries before any
white man set eyes on them. It is
futile to conjecture where they came
from.
The Rivf.r and the Dry Diggings.
The searching parties prospecting
the vicinity of Hopetown and the
banks of the Orange River met with
little or no success; but after a couple
of years other prospectors, who had
gradually worked their way for a

hundred miles up the valley of the
Vaal, began to find considerable quan-
tities of diamonds in the alluvial
gravel on the banks of that river. By
the end of 1869 there was no longer
any doubt that Dr. Atherstone's pre-
diction was being verified, though
London merchants interested in the
Brazilian trade vainly tried to dis-
credit the reports of a new diamond
field discovered in the "wilds" of
South Africa. Early in the following
year, 1870, both banks of the Vaal
nationalities, worked side by side.
Racialism was not dreamed of. The
method of winning the diamonds con-
sisted in removing the heavy boulders
and washing the gravel in a hand cra-
dle containing coarse and fine sieves,
which were emptied onto a sorting ta-
ble. The proceeds were readily sold
to local diamond merchants, but not
many fortunes were made by the dig-
gers.
However, the river diggings did not
long remain the center of attraction.

were crowded with thousands of dig-
gers, and dozens of canvas mining
camps arose, extending for fifty or
sixty miles from Delport's Hope, at
the confluence of the Vaal and Harts,
to above Hebron Mission Station. The
center of these camps was the mis-
sion station at Pniel, on the south side
of the river, and Klip Drift (Rocky
Eord), on the opposite bank. Life
at the river diggings, though rough,
was healthy. Rowdyism was un-
known. Anyone found stealing a dia-
mond was dragged through the river
and expelled from the diggings.
Dutch and English, and many other
Before the end of 1870 news reached
the Vaal that diamonds had been dis-
covered twenty miles further south on
a farm called Dorstfontein. A few
solitary diamonds were actually no-
ticed sparkling in the mud walls of
the farm-house built near a large
'"pan" or natural depression in the
ground filled with water in the rainy
season. On a low hill or kopje ad-
joining other diamonds were un-
earthed, and the new digging was
called Du Toit's Pan, after the pre-
vious owner's name. About half a
mile to the southwest a similar kopje
was situated, where diamonds were


25
found on the surface early in 1871.
At first the proprietors refused to al-
low prospecting, but towards the end
of May, 1871, they threw open their
farms, Bultfontein, to the peggers at
the usual monthly license of ten shill-
ings per claim (approximately $2.50).
In the same month diamonds wert
discovered on a third kopje about two
miles north of Du Toit's Pan on Mr.
De Beer's farm, Vooruitzicht, which
is today one of the most famous
farms in the world, for two months
later, in July, 1871, on a fourth kopje,
within the same farm area and less
than a mile to the west of what is
now known as De Beers Mine, dia-
monds were found in much greater
quantities than on the sites of any of
the previous discoveries. To distin-
guish it from the sister digging it was
called De Beers New Rush, or Coles-
berg Kopje, after the town from
which the fortunate discoverers
hailed. It is known throughout the
world today as Kimberley Mine, thus
named in compliment to the Secretary
of State for the Colonies, who held
office at the time when on October
27, 1871, the Governor of the Cape,
Sir Henry Barkly, annexed the dia-
mond fields to the British crown. In
the Governor's honor Klip Drift was
rechristened Barkly West. As the
natives inhabiting the region were
mostly Griquas, the territory was
called Griqualand West. On October
18, 1880, it was formally incorporated
in the Cape Colony.
Physical Features.
Where the great plateau of South
Africa now extends, between about
latitudes 27 and 32, there was once
a great lake, some four hundred miles
wide and seven or eight hundred
miles long, in which huge lizards a
hundred feet in length disported
themselves. The mud and sand de-
posited on the floor of this lake buried
the remains of these primeval mon-
sters and built up the sedimentary
rocks now known as the Karoo for-
mation. In that far-off geological
period the crust of the earth was still'
in a state of violent disturbance.
Through thousands of vents and fis-
sures in the rocks, jets and streams
of lava seethed up and flowed over,
covering patches of the softer aque-
ous rocks that were still under water.
Owing to successive upheavals and'
subsidence in the mountain chains on
the southern and eastern shores of
the lake, great gaps were produced,
through which the pent-up waters
burst their way and drained off into
the Indian Ocean. To the forces of
this tremendous denudation the ex-
posed shales and sandstones offered
only slight resistance compared with
the patches covered or replaced by
the intrusive sheets and dykes of trap-
or melaphyre. Such was the origin
of the numerous ironstone kopjes and
table-topped mountains which now
stud the Karoo. The subsequent
weathering of these kopjes has pro-
duced the round boulders of the hill-
sides and the red sand which covers
the surface of the country.
Griqualand West is the northwest-
ern corner of the Great Karoo basin,
the characteristic rocks of which are
represented by thick beds of carbo-
naceous shales, thinning out toward
the Vaal. The beds and banks of
the river from Barkly West to near
Potchesfstroom consist of a broad
sheet of amygdaloidal melaphyre of
older date than the trap of the Karoo
formation. In the crevices of this
volcanic rock, and entirely covering it
over considerable areas on both sides

of the river, are the alluvial deposits
in which diamonds are still being
found after 40 years of desultory
working.
Climate and Scene.
The diggers of the early seventies
who joined in the rushes to Dutoit-
span and Bultfontein were the pio-
neers of a great industry. They ar-
rived in their thousands, full of en-
of men whose hopes of speedy for-
tune had been rudely shattered.
The locality of the diamond fields
would hardly be chosen as a desirable
residence by anyone not in search of
diamonds or unconnected with the in-
dustry. The region may almost be
described as a desert, destitute of trees
or foliage, a wide expanse of rolling
plains unrelieved by any eminence
worthy of the name of hill. Owing

•ergy and enthusiasm, but compara-
tively few lived to reap the due re-
ward of their enterprise. Neither the
river diggings nor the newly-opened
mines were sufficiently rich to prove
remunerative to so large an influx of

midsummer, are invariably cool and
pleasant, in spite of the mosquitoes,
which have only visited the fields since
the advent of the railway in 1885.
The winter climate is delicious—mild,
bright days and frosty nights, with
very rarely a fall of snow.
The Kimberley Mines.
The first workers at the dry dig-
gings naturally thought they had only
struck another kind of alluvial de-
posit, and that a few months would
suffice to exhaust it. Hence the claims
frequently changed hands. Many gave
up in despair at bad luck, others were
satisfied with handsome returns and
were glad to get away whilst their
health lasted and their claims had still
a market value. No one had any idea
of the entirely different nature of the
diamond-bearing ground in the four
mines of the Kimberley district to the
gravel diggings, and no provision was
made for eventually working down to
a considerable depth. The locally-
made laws of the Diggers' Commit-
tee provided that "no person should
be entitled to have more than two
claims at one time." The size of a
claim in the diamond mines is 30 feet
by 30 feet, or 100 square yards. The
first diggers merely scraped the sur-
face of their claims, which, in com-
mon with the surrounding country,
were covered with red sand, under
which a soft limestone was struck,
easily penetrated by a pickaxe. Be-
neath the limestone the true matrix of
the diamond was reached—a tough,
grey, yellow, or brown clayey rock,
requiring the use of explosives for
mining it, but readily pulverizing on
being exposed to the air. At a depth
of about 60 feet the diamond-bearing
rock changed from yellow to slatey
blue and became much harder and less
friable.
At each change in the nature of the
ground, from the red sand downward,
the diggers at first thought bedrock
had been struck, but they soon found
that each successive layer continued
to yield diamonds. They also found
that the claim area was encased in a
roughly circular wall of rock, formed
by perpendicular basalt in some
places, in others of shale sloping in-
wards, thereby cutting out claims and
gradually reducing the area of dia-
mond-bearing ground as the excava-
tion proceeded. These upper encas-
ing rocks of the diamond mines are
locally termed "reef" (used in the
same sense as the coral-reef, and not
to be confused with the term "reef"
in gold-mining, for instance, where it
means the rock carrying the gold).
No diamonds are ever found in the
reef. Gradually it became evident to
the diggers that they were mining in
"pipes" or funnels of unknown depth,
probably of volcanic origin. The gen-
erally received theory now is that
these pipes are extinct craters, which
have been filled from below by the
diamond-bearing rock at a time when
the country was still under water, and
that the diamonds are of older date
than the matrix.
Many were the devices adapted for
working the claims in the early days.
Commencing with the simple appli-
ances in use at the river diggings, the
ground dug out with pick and shovel
was dry-sorted on the edge of the ex-
cavations. When natives were ob-
tainable for digging, the owner and
his family, or partners, merely did the
sorting. Rough carts, drawn by a
couple of mules or oxen, were em-
ployed by the more prosperous for
removing the ground to convenient


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
sorting sites outside the mines. In
Kimberley Mine, owing to the dense
crowd of workers, numbering ten
thousand or more, special precautions
had to be taken to avoid intolerable
•confusion. This mine contained about
500 claims on the surface, but they
were so rich that by successive sales
they were often subdivided into halves
and quarters and even smaller frac-
tions. Fourteen or 15 narrow par-
allel roadways for carts crossed the
mine from north to south, temporarily
deducting from each owner one-
fourth of his claim area. On each
side of these roads the ground was
•dug out and thrown or hauled to the
surface to be carted away to the sort-
ing tables. In less than 12 months
this method of removal had to be dis-
carded, as serious accidents were of
daily occurrence, carts and drivers be-
ing frequently precipitated onto the
workers below. It was therefore re-
placed by the first system of wire
haulage, covering the mine with a per-
fect cobweb of inclined ropes con-
nected with serried ranks of three-
ilecked timber staging round the
whole circumference of the mine. At
first hand-windlasses were used for
pulling up the buckets, but after an-
other year had gone by. in 1874 horse-
whims were introduced, succeeded in
the following year by small steam
hoists.
The Rekf Troubles.
With the introduction of more
elaborate machinery, requiring con-
siderable capital expenditure, it be-
came necessary to relax the regula-
tions enforcing individual ownership
of claims, and as the mines became
deeper serious difficulties arose, which
called for joint action to cope with
them.
The first Kimberley Mining Board
was established in 1874, with powers
to levy rates for keeping the mine
clear of water and falling reef. By
that time the claims in the center of
the mine had reached a depth of over
a hundred feet. For the next ten
years the board struggled in vain to
enable the system of quarrying in the
open to continue. The sums spent in
hauling out reef would have ruined
almost any other mining property in
the world. Every year the cost of
reef hauling became greater, and yet
it could not keep pace with the recur-
ring falls of reef from the margin
of the mine. By the end of 1882 the
deepest open workings in the blue
ground of Kimberley Mine were over
400 feet beneath the surface; and they
never much exceeded that depth, since
it gradually became evident that the
task of keeping the claim ground clear
of reef was beyond the means of even
the wealthiest companies then own-
ing the richest portions of the mine.
Some four million cubic yards of reef
had been removed in all, at a cost of
something like ten million dollars, and
yet the Inspector of Mines had to re-
port that out of the 300 or 400 claims
in the mine "only about 50 claims
have been regularly worked during
1884." Though profitable mining was
being carried on from the shafts sunk
through the fallen reef, attempts were
still made to revert to open working,
which ruined both systems; the haul-
ing of the reef from the foot of the
slopes caused a further subsidence,
which carried away these shafts and
destroyed many thousand dollars'
worth of machinery and plant used
in connection therewith. In each of
the years 1884 and 1885 the quantity
of blue ground raised from Kimber-
ley Mine was little over 300.000 loads,


29
which practically demonstrated that
mining in the open could not be con-
ducted below a depth of 400 feet, and
that the only alternative was some
system of underground mining.
It should be stated that a load orig-
inally meant a Scotch cartload, which
contained 16 cubic feet of broken or
loose ground, and is the present unit
by which the daily or yearly quanti-
ties of rock handled is measured on
the diamond fields. The weight of a
load of blue ground is 1600 pounds,
so that a ton (2000 pounds) of blue
is equal to one and a quarter loads.
Ilefore being broken the rock is of
course less bulky. Nine cubic feet of
solid blue ground are equivalent to 16
cubic feet of broken ground. The
size of a claim is not auite the same
in all the mines. In Bultfontein and
Dutoitspan it is 30 feet by 30 feet, in
De Beers and Kimberley, 31 feet by
31 feet, the latter mine having been
surveyed in Dutch measure, and 30
feet Dutch being equal to 30 feet Eng-
lish. In the two former mines about
48^2 claims go to an acre, in the lat-
ter two, about 45 1-3 claims. For
every foot in depth a claim therefore
contained about 100 loads. The re-
spective areas on the surface were, in
Kimberley, 470 claims; in De Beers,
662 ; in Bultfontein, 1067 ; and in Du-
toitspan, 1441.
Kimberley being the smallest and
richest mine, was worked down more
rapidly than the three others. By the
time a depth of 400 feet had been
reached in the center of this mine,
successive reef falls had widened the
area of this great cavity till from its
original area of little over ten acres
it had increased to over 30 acres. By
that time it had been realized that
further working in the open was im-
possible. Subsequent experience in
the other mines led to a similar con-
clusion. De Beers and Dutoitspan
had both to suspend open quarrying
at a depth of about 400 feet. Bult-
fontein, being more circular in form
and having worked down the reef in
terraces, was enabled to be worked to
a depth of about 500 feet.
The sinking of these shafts has re-
vealed some highly interesting geo-
logical facts. At a depth of about
300 feet below the surface the bot-
tom of the shales was reached, and
then came about 400 feet of melaphye
(the same trap rock which outcrops
on the surface at the river diggings)
Underneath the melaphyre is a simi-
lar thickness of about 400 feet of
quartzite. In the Kimberley rock
shaft, at a depth of 1141 feet from the
surface, the quartzite changed to met-
amorphic slates, and at a depth of
2500 feet granite was struck and is
still being sunk through. Through
all these changes in the containing
rock of the pipe the character of the
blue ground has remained unaltered,
except that, with increasing depth, the
Kimberley blue has become harder, so
that it no longer pulverizes by ex-
posure, and is now being treated as
it comes from the mine.
Method of Extraction.
Space will not permit of a detailed
description of the method of treat-
ment for extracting the diamonds
from the blue. It must suffice to say
that the blue is tipped at the mouth
of the shaft into hoppers which de-
liver it into trucks each holding about
a ton of rock. These trucks are
pulled by wire-rope mechanical haul-
age to the washing gears, where the
blue is passed through crushing rolls
and then concentrated in annular pans
14 feet in diameter. Revolving radial


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
arms carrying steel blades or teeth set
in a spiral keep the puddle in a state
of agitation and cause the lighter por-
tion to flow over in the center of the
pan, while the heavy deposit, includ-
ing the diamonds, is thrown toward
the outer circumference. Once a day
this deposit is drawn off in special
locked trucks and taken to the central
pulsator for further concentration. By
an ingenious device of local invention
the larger diamonds are all caught on
In his annual report the general man-
ager states that "all the native labor
required by the company was more
than supplied by natives voluntarily
presenting themselves at the com-
pounds." It is interesting to compare
the working expenses of the De Beers
mines with what they were previous
to amalgamation. In the year ended
March 31, 1889, the cost of produc-
tion was $2.46 per load on 712,263
loads. In the year ended June 30,

"grease tables"; the finer gravel is de-
livered on to sorting tables, where
the smaller diamonds are readily dis-
tinguished by their luster from other
stones. The largest diamonds rarely
reach the washing machines. They
are generally discovered either in the
mine or on the floors, often by the na-
tives, who are paid a liberal commis-
sion for their finds. The present
writer saw a native hand over a dia-
mond worth $7,500 which he had
picked out of the ballast on one of
the Kimberley tram lines.
Some 12,000 natives and 2000 white
men are employed by De Beers mines.
1909, the Consolidated Mines washed
from Kimberly Mine 1,153.569 loads
at an average cost for winning and
washing of $1.71 per load, and from
De Beers Mine 249,325 loads, costing
$1.34 per load. The average yield of
diamonds from these two mines was
.42 carat per load, realizing $13.25
per carat, or $4.89 per load. From
Wesselton Mine i,7f)8,i6o loads were
treated at an average cost of $1.10,
yielding .34 carat per load, realizing
$8.60 per carat, or $3.00 per load.
From Bultfontein Mine 1,573,118
loads were treated at an average cost
of $1.60, yielding .38 carats per load.

and realizing $8.35 per carat, or $3.15
per load. Dutoitspan Mine was not
worked during that year, but has now
been restarted, as the demand for dia-
monds has since increased.
Orange River Province Mines.
There are several diamond mines
in the Orange River Province, some
of which have been known for 30 or
40 years and others discovered recent-
ly. The oldest and most important
is Jagersfontein, which was actually
the first to be worked in South Africa,
a diamond of 50 carats having been
found there in August, 1870, a few
weeks before the discovery of Detoit-
span. Owing to the size and shape
of the pipe and the almost perpendic-
ular walls of hard rock in which it
is enclosed, it has been possible to
continue the open workings for a
longer period than in the Kimberley
mines. These workings have at-
tained a depth of 650 feet, but a ver-
tical shaft has been sunk some 700
feet back from the margin and con-
nected with the mine at the 900-foot
level. Jagersfontein is noted for its
blue-white diamonds, which command
a high price. The whole mine of 1124
claims is the property of the New
Jagersfontein Mining and Explora-
tion Company (Limited), which was
formed in April, 1887, with a capital
of $660,750, since increased by amal-
gamation with neighboring claim-
holders to $5,000,000. In the year
ended March 31, 1910, the company
treated 3,236,590 loads at a cost of
approximately 60 cents per load,
yielding 13 carats per 100 loads, of
an average value of $15.25 per carat,
or a total value of $5,u5,935- leaving
a profit over working expenses of
more than $3,000,000. In the year
1893 a flawless stone of 969^ carats
was found in the Jagersfontein Mine.
Known as the "Excelsior,' it ranks
second in size among the historic dia-
monds of the world.
Jagersfontein lies 80 miles south-
east of Kimberley in the Fauresmith
district. In the same line 30 miles
farther north is the Koffyfontein
Mine, which has been worked for
more than 30 years. It is larger than
Jagersfontein, containing nearly 1500
claims. The Roberts Victor Mine, in
the Boshof district, was discovered
five years ago and proved extraordi-
narily rich, though so small in area
that it has already become necessary
to suspend work in the open and to
sink a main shaft, which has reached
a depth of 500 feet. In the first seven
months of the first working year 152,-
695 loads were washed, averaging
461,/ carats per 100 loads, at a total
cost of $4.52 per load. The diamonds
realized $8.00 per carat, equivalent to
$3-75 per load. Voorspoed Mine, in
the neighborhood of Kroonstad, dis-
covered about the same time as the
last named, contains over 800 claims.
During 1009 the Voorspoed Diamond
Mining Company (Limited) washed
I.835,i27 loads yielding 274,785 ca-
rats (equal to an average of 15 carats
per 100 loads), including a fine blue-
white diamond of 116% carats. The
working costs were 35 cents per load,
and as the diamonds realized $4.25
per carat, the yield was equal to 60
cents per load.
Transvaal Diamonds.
The Premier Mine, some 20 miles
east-northeast of Pretoria, was dis-
covered eight years ago. It is by far
the largest of all the diamond mines,
containing 3484 claims, and is there-
fore likely to be worked in the open
for many years to come. In Jri.iuary,


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
1905, the largest known diamond in
the world, called the Cullinan, after
the discoverer of the mine and the
chairman of the Premier (Transvaal)
Diamond Mining Company (Limit-
ed), was found in the open workings.
It weighed 3025^ carats, and yet was
probably only a portion, perhaps less
than one-half, of the original octage-
dral crystal. The other portion may
never be found. It may be thousands
of feet, or many miles, below the sur-
face. Sufficient is now known of the
formation of diamond-bearing pipes
to hazard the prediction that the bot-
tom of them will never be reached,
or, if that should ever happen, that
the laboratory will reveal where Na-
ture formed the diamonds under
enormous pressure, which involves a
depth of many miles below the sur-
face. For though we speak of the
blue ground as the matrix of the dia-
mond, it is certainly not the original
rock in which the diamonds were crys-
tallized.
The Premier Mine is not a kopje
in the Karoo formation. It lies in a
hollow of the hills, the pipe over half
a mile across its long diameter hav-
ing burst through the containing iz\-
sitic rocks. Forty-five million dollars'
worth of diamonds have been extract-
ed from the mine, which was floated
with a working capital of only $50,-
000. Over $7,500,000 has been spent
on equipment and over $5,000,000
paid to the Transvaal Government,
which by law takes 60 per cent of the
net profits. During the year ended
October 31, 1909, the company washed
7&amp;7,793 loads, yielding 1,872,136^
carats, or just a quarter of a carat
per load. The value per carat was
$3.10 and per load 76 cents. The cost
of production per load was 50 cents.
There are several other diamond-
bearing pipes in the same vicinity, but
none of them are being worked at
present.
It is difficult to form a correct esti-
mate of the total output of diamonds
in the last forty years, as no complete
official returns were made prior to
1883. By comparing all available
records, however, it is possible to
state with conviction that the total
value of rough diamonds exported
from South Africa to date of statis-
tics used by me exceeds 150 millions
sterling.


BY J. J. COX
Professor Cox's article is an abridgment of an unpublished report to the
State Highway Commissioner. Although Michigan has abundant resources of
road materials, the roads are notoriously poor. Since the advent of the automo-
bile, rapid progress has been made in improving roads. Much remains to be
done and Professor Cox's work is a step in the right direction. Editor.
This investigation had three objects
in view:
ist. To obtain the necessary data
to determine whether or not Michi-
gan's sand and clay were suitable for
sand-clay-road construction.
2nd. To compile some information
as to the distribution of this sand and
clay in the different communities and
throughout the state.
3rd. To determine whether or not
the sand-clay-roads already construct-
ed in Michigan were satisfactory or
whether construction methods could
be improved upon.
Economy of this Type of Con-
struction.
The economy of this type of con-
struction is evident when we consider
that in a great many cases the metalled
surface of a road can be made from a
mixture of materials found along the
road. Of course, as a general proposi-
tion this type of road is not suitable
for heavy traffic conditions, although
it has been found in other states, not-
ably Georgia, on account of its low
cost and ease of maintenance, to be
highly satisfactory under quite severe
traffic conditions.
With reference to traffic conditions
on the roads of Michigan, it is con-
cluded by persons in position to know
that out of a total of 70,000 miles of
wagon roads in the state, 20 per cent
of these roads carry 80 to 85 per cent
of the traffic of the state. This leaves
80 per cent of the roads which can
be considered as light traffic roads.
Probably in no case does the traffic
on these roads exceed an average of
fifty vehicles per day throughout the
year. It is these roads that are adapt-
ed to the use of sand-clay mixtures as
a wearing surface material.
This type of wearing surface is not
a cure-all for road ills and local condi-
tions must be carefully considered be-
fore it can be adopted in a road im-
provement scheme. It is subject to the
same rules of selection as any other
kind of road surface, and undoubted-
ly, in some localities it would be better
economy to build gravel roads. There
are, however, a great many communi-
ties in the State of Michigan that are
not fortunate enough to have good
gravel pits and stone quarries, and
can only obtain these road building
materials at a high cost. Many of these
same communities on the other hand,
have sand and clay in plenty, along
most of the highways, which only
needs mixing in proper proportions
to produce a road surface that would
sustain the traffic. Other communities
have gravel pits, containing a large
percentage of sand and to make a
suitable gravel road, it is necesary


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
to screen all of the surface materials.
Even with screening, the gravel of
some communities would not produce
enough of coarse material, without
great expense, to make a satisfactory
road. In most cases, these sandy grav-
els are ideal materials to combine with
clay in sand-clay road construction.
Considerable money can be saved by
these communities in the construction
of sand-clay roads.
Sand-Clay Roads—How Con-
structed.
Sand-clay roads are constructed
like any other type of road as far as
grading is concerned. Proper atten-
tion should be given to location, grad-
ing, etc., as is commensurable with
the importance of the road. After
this grading has been completed, the
central traveled portion of the road
is surfaced with sand and clay to a
depth of not less than 10 inches, con-
solidated, and a width of not less than
12 feet. This metalled surface is com-
posed of a uniform and intimate mix-
ture of sand and clay in proper pro-
portions. Sometimes such mixtures
are found already prepared by nature,
and it only needs the hauling of the
material onto the road, spreading it
evenly and consolidating it. In the
majority of instances, this is not the
case, and sand and clay have to be
mixed mechanically in place on the
road. This mixing is accomplished
artificially by plowing, harrowing, and
better still, where possible, by puddl-
ing in a soft mud state. The method
of mixing should be varied with dif-
ferent materials encountered. If the
clay is perfectly dry and pulverizes
easily, dry mixing is satisfactorily
done by harrowing. If the clay is hard
to break up dry. it should be reduced
to mud and the harrow and disc-plow
will do rapid work. For example,
buck-shot clay will pulverize readily
when dry, while blue gumbo will form
hard lumps that require crushing.
If it is desired to mix a buck-shot
clay with sand, it will be found that
this can be best done when the clay
is dry. The proper tools to use in
making this dry mixture are a turning
plow, a disc-harrow, a spring-tooth
or spike-tooth harrow. The plow is
used for the heavy preliminary mix-
ing and the harrows for breaking up
the clods turned up by the plow.
After the materials have been
mixed as thoroughly as possible while
dry, it is then advisable to wait until
after a heavy rain before completing
the mixture and shaping to the proper
surface. After a rain, when the ma-
terials have become thoroughly satur-
ated, it is a pretty good plan to drag
this mixture with a spike-tooth drag,
and the more nearly you are able to
produce a thin mortar, the better will
be the mix. After this dragging, when
the road has dried out enough to sus-
tain the weight of a split-log drag or
a road hone, it should be properly
shaped by the use of this tool. The
road is then ready for consolidation
which is accomplished by the regular
traffic, it only being necessary to drag
the road occasionally with a split-log
drag in order to avoid the formation
of ruts while the material is being
consolidated.
A period of wet weather is very
desirable after the road surface is
ready for consolidation. This permits
the traffic to cut dep into the mixture
and begin the consolidation at the bot-
tom. Gradually the material will be-
come so consolidated that the traffic
will roll on top. During this period
of consolidation, the road will be very
unsatisfactory to the users.


35
Sand-Clay Road Maintenance
Sand-clay roads are maintained af-
ter the same fashion as earth and
gravel roads, it being necessary to
see that the surface is dragged from
time to time to prevent the formation
of ruts which do not permit good sur-
face drainage; that all holes which
develop in the surface are properly
filled with the same material as used
in the surface; and that no defects in
the drainage system are allowed to
exist.
Counties Visited.
The Counties visited while making
the investigation are as follows:—
Gladwin, Iosco, Gratiot, Mason,
Osceola, Kalkaska, Allegan, Dickin-
son, Iron, Marquette, and Lenawee.
The general observations made in each
County are as follows:—
Gladwin County
The route of the meridan line road
through Gladwin County was the
most thoroughly investigated. We
found the soil conditions quite varied.
In the extreme southern part of the
County, we found sand and clay oc-
curring in tracts, which were small,
not being over one-quarter to one-
half mile in width. This region also
contained sand ridges. In the northern
part of the County almost all of the
soil consisted of sandy loam ex-
cept along the streams, where,
we found banks of clay and gravelly
sand. The marshes in general were
underlaid with sand. It would not be
difficult in the southern part of the
County to secure materials for sand-
clay mixtures, but in the northern
part of the County, particularly in
the east part of Butman Township,
clay could only be obtained by rather
a long haul—this haul would likely
not exceed 2 1-2 miles. At the ex-
treme northern end of the County
where the meridan line road was be-
ing constructed, a large pit of sandy
gravel was encountered.
Iosco County
In this County, we found soil con-
ditions very favorable for the con-
struction of sand-clay roads. In no
part of the County did we find a long
haul necessary to secure these ma-
terials. In fact, the County was very
spotted—one ridge would be sand
where the next ridge 40 to 80 rods
away would be of clay. Sometimes,
we found clay or sand-clay in the val-
leys with sand on the ridges. Along
the lake shore large quantities of
beach gravel is obtainable. This ma-
terial contains a large per cent of fine
sand, making it unsuitable for gravel
road construction. We were particu-
larly interested in the attempts made
in this County toward road improve-
ment with sand-clay mixtures. We
took samples of the mixtures from
State Reward Roads, A-2855 and
B-4457. See table on analysis. Sam-
ples No. E-17, E-188, E-23, and E-26.
We also took samples of sand-clay
roads constructed by Tawas and Bald-
win Townships.
Gratiot County
In Gratiot County, we visited Ar-
cadia and Saville Townships. This
County possesses both sand and clay
and natural sand-clay mixtures. There
is also a number of gravel pits con-
taining a sandy gravel. This sandy
gravel contains material larger than
that which will pass a No. 10 sieve
to the extent of 13.5 to 30 per cent.
See Samples E-27 and E-35. We
found that a number of roads had
been constructed in this County as
gravel roads, using a somewhat better


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
gravel than this mentioned, but still
the gravel contains so much fine ma-
terial that it did not consolidate prop-
erly and the roads were unsatisfactory
as gravel roads. We were informed
by the officials whom we met, that
good road gravel could only be ob-
tained in Arcadia and Saville Town-
ships at a high cost. We did not find
a single location that did not have
tory Township, we found both sand
and clay and sand-clay mixtures and
sandy gravel banks scattered promis-
cuously. The soil conditions were ex-
tremely variable. Along one road, be-
tween Sections 9 and 10 in Victory
Township, we found it so spotted and
so variable that in order to secure a
proper mixture, it would be necessary
to put an experienced man in charge of

both sand and clay alongside of the

Mason County
In Mason County, we visited Ham-

fic road and entirely suitable for
sand-clay construction. We were in-
formed by the County Road Commis-
sioner that even a poor road gravel
could not be secured for surfacing
this road at a cost less than $1.50 per
cubic yard delivered. In no place in
Victory Township, did we find sand
or clay lacking within a short haul.
In Hamlin Township, we found
larger areas of sand and only small

areas containing clay. In fact, most
of the clay found was along streams-
beds. The entire west side of the
township is composed of dune sand,
and we were informed by the Com-
missioner that occasionally a knoll of
clay was found in this dune sand
region. We inspected a road in Ham-
lin Township located One mile north
of a bridge near the Country Club in
Sections 33 and 34, where the County
Road Commissioners had attempted to
construct a sand-clay road on top of
dune sand. About 1,000 cu. yds. of
clay, the same as E-40, had been
spread 9 ft. wide on the sand, the
same as E-41. This clay had not been
mixed with the sand to any great ex-
tent. The result was that a clay road
existed where before there was a sand
road. Enough clay was in place on
this road if properly mixed with the
sand below to make a metalled track
12 ft. wide and 12 in. thick.
Osceola County
In Osceola County, we visited the
site of a road between Sections 15 and
22 in Richmond Township that was
soon to be constructed. We found
along this road both sand and clay.
These materials proved later, on test-
ing, (Samples E-42, E-43, E-44, and
E-45)to be excellent materials for this
kind of construction. We were in-
formed by the commissioner of Rich-
mond Township that sand and clay
were available in almost any part of
the township. There is also consid-
erable sandy gravel in this township.
Kalkaska County
Tn Kalkaska county, we visited Kal-
kaska and Wilson Townships.
While the majority of the soil is
composed of sand in these townships,
we were able to find several knobs of
clay, (Samples E-46 and E-48) and in
some cases we found quite a large area
of sandy clay mixtures. Other road
building materials were quite scarce
and could only be obtained at a high
cost.
Allegan County
In Allegan County, we visited Al-
legan and Valley Townships.
In Valley Township, we did not find
a location where sand and clay were
not present. The only sample of clay
taken in this township was a sample
of the clay (E-49), which the County
Commissioners were putting on top
of the screened washed gravel surface
of the State Reward Road No. E-3334-
Valley Township also contains large
deposits of gravel, and from our ob-
servation, we question whether there
are many locations in the township
adapted to sand-clay construction on
account of the low cost of gravel.
West of the City of Allegan, in Alle-
gan Township, almost the entire area
is composed of dune sand. We did not
find any deposite of clay. Our investi-
gation in this region was very limited.
Dickinson County
In Dickinson County, we visited
Breitung, Norway, Waucedah, and
Sagola Townships.
In none of these locations did we
find a great amount of clay. There is
plenty of sand throughout Dickinson
County and occasionally we found a
deposit of sandy gravel. The clay
found was very different in appear-
ance and physical properties from that
of the southern peninsula of Michigan.
It contained a large amount of fine
sand and silt. The clay was not very
plastic and lacked in adhesiveness. De-
spite these poor materials, several
miles of sand-clay roads have been
constructed and good results obtained.
The good results, we believe to be due


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
to careful maintenance. We took sev-
eral samples of sand, clay, sandy
gravel, and samples of sand-clay mix-
tures from the roads already con-
structed; Samples E-51 to E-62 in-
clusive. Samples E-53, E-54, and
E-56 are taken from sand-clay roads
that have been in service from three
to nine years.
We found a great variety of rock
in this County, some of it being a good
rock for road building purposes. The
macadam roads already constructed
were built largely from mine rock.
This mine rock consists of the waste
rock taken out of the mines, and low-
grade iron ore.
Iron County
In Iron County, we found an abun-
dance of material for road surfacing
in the form of rock. The predominat-
ing materials are mine rock, a slate,
and a diorite. Very little clay was
found. One deposit of sandy gravel
was located (Sample E-63), but this
material was entirely unsuited for
gravel road construction. It contained
only about 32 per cent of material
larger than that which would pass a
No. to sieve.
Marquette County
In Marquette County, we visited
Republic, Humbolt, Champion, Ely,
Richmond, Forsythe, Skandia, Choco-
lay, and Marquette Townships.
Some gravel, suitable for gravel
road building purposes, we found near
Champion. Abundance of rock of
various kinds was found throughout
the County, principally mine rock.
The predominating soil was of sand.
The clay found was widely scattered
and of the same characteristics as that
in Dickinson county; it was generally
found in the bluffs along streams.
None of this clay can be termed a good
material for sand-clay road construc-
tion. Several sand-clay roads have
been constructed in this County giving
fairly satisfactory results. The sam-
ples taken are numbered E-64 to E-76
inclusive.
Lenawee County
In Lewanwee County, we visited
the location of a road between Sec-
tions 22 and 23 in Dover Township
that the township wished to build with
a sand-clay surface. Nowhere in Dov-
er Township did we find a location
that did not have both sand and clay
as a mixture, and most parts of the
township had access, within a short
haul, to pits of sandy gravel. The
sand-clay mixtures found in all in-
stances were not properly pro-
portioned, but these materials were
suitable for sand-clay road construc-
tion. Along this road visited, we
found plenty of clay and sand-clay
mixtures (Samples E-77 and E-78),
but not of the right proportion, while
we found two sandy gravel banks
(Samples E-79 and E-80) within 40
rods of the northern end of the road.
Tests Made on Samples
We tested, all told, 80 samples of
sand, clay, and sand-clay mixtures.
The results of these tests are given
in the attached tabulations. These
tests were made along the same line,
and with the same apparatus as adopt-
ed for this work by the University of
Georgia. The tests consist essentially
of a physical analysis of the materials
and are chiefly a mechanical separa-
tion based on the size of the particle.
A sample of clay was divided into four
essential parts called gravel, sand,
silt, and clay. These various materials
differ from each other only in the size
of the particle contained in each. All
material retained on a No. 10 sieve
and retained by a No. 200 sieve is
called sand; all of that material pass-


41
ing a No. 200 sieve and settling out
of 8 cm of water in 11 minutes is
called silt; all of that material that
would not settle out of 8 cm of water
in 1 minutes is called clay. In all of
the sands, sand-clay mixtures, and
sandy gravels analyzed, the procedure
used was the same as used for clay.
In no case did we find a sand entirely
free from clay, even in the dune sands.
The results of these tests show con-
clusively the folly of trying to secure
Hai.l Co., Georgia Road, (Note Old Road)
proper sand-clay mixtures for sand-
clay roads from Michigan materials
without the use of laboratory tests.
Clays that are identical in appearance
and found not far apart, differ con-
siderably in the content of true clay,
silt, lime, etc. (See samples E-3 and
E-8). Material ordinarily spoken of
as clay varies from 25 per cent to 90
per cent in the true clay content. The
grading of the sand in most cases is
poor, but many times it can be im-
proved by proportioning. The excep-
tional silt content in some samples is
another matter that has to be con-
sidered in the proportioning and some-
times in the selection of the sand.
Conclusions
From the foregoing explanations of
this investigation and up to this point
in the work, we conclude as follows:
1st. The Michigan materials are
suitable for sand-clay mixtures and
sand-clay road construction. These
materials are not well graded in grairt
size, therefore, it would be impossible
to secure as dense a mixture as is se-
cured by Georgia materials. This less
dense mixture would have some in-
fluence upon the life and cost of main-
tenance of the road. Nevertheless, we
believe that a sand-clay road can be
constructed in Michigan, in a large
majority of the communities of the
state that will economically sustain
all of the traffic of the light traffic
roads.
2nd. Sand and clay are well dis-
tributed in the various communities
of the state, and throughout the state.
3rd. Tn a great many communities
like those visited in Gratiot County,
where good road building gravel and
road stone are lacking, sand-clay roads
should be constructed rather than to
atempt gravel roads. We believe that
in the use of sandy gravel with the
proper amount of clay, a better road
surface can be obtained than where
gravel road construction is attempted.
4th. The most discouraging sand-
clay materials found in the state are
those of the upper peninsula.
5th. Construction methods now
in use in building sand-clay roads can
be materially improved. The same-
might be said of maintenance.
6th. Sand-clay materials can only
be properly proportioned by careful
handling based upon laboratory ex-
aminations.


The great European war has focused the attention of people throughout
the civilized world on the wonderful showing which Germany has made in
an industrial as well as a military way. The United States and Great Britain
especially have awakened to the fact that they were dependent upon Germany
for many things which were of the utmost importance to them. The mate-
rials in which there has been the greatest shortage have been those of the
chemical industries. There has been a great deal of discussion in England
and this country as to the factors which have allowed Germany to obtain
supremacy in these lines. It has been felt in many quarters that the uni-
versities have not done all they should in preparing men trained to direct
these industries.
There are given below extracts from two symposiums held in New
York City recently and one symposium held at the annual meeting of the
Society of Chemical Industry in Great Britain last summer, as well as an
extract from the address of Dr. Perkin, as President of the Chemical
Society of London. It is interesting to note in connection with Dr. Perkin's
address that he was the discoverer of the first dye made from coal tar and
that fifty years ago he started in Great Britain the first plant in the world
for the manufacture of dyes. He has seen the industry which started in
England transferred almost entirely to Germany, and thus his comments are
especially noteworthy. Although the discussions refer specifically to the
chemical industries, they have a general application and are of interest to
all engineers.
A Digest of Recent Discussions
Richard C. MacLauren, President of Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Address before joint meeting of New York Chemical Societies, Decem-
ber, 1915:
"Can we expect, however, a very large number of men alive to
the possibilities of industry and capable of meeting its needs to make
the great financial sacrifices involved in accepting a teaching position
at a salary of a few thousand dollars? The success of the industries
demands that we should have a higher level of salaries in our schools
of applied science and that we should be in a position to pay a few
men at least a reasonable portion of what they could earn in business."
"It would be a great advantage for the professors were they in
closer contact with industry. Here it would surely be well to follow
the example of Germany and employ a larger number of professors
in attacking the special problems of business that require a thorough
knowledge of chemistry."


Nicholas Murray Butler, President of Columbia University.
Address before New York Section, American Chemical Society, No-
vember, 1915:
"Many of our professors and many men in other universities are,
as individuals, in close contact with industrial leaders and industrial
needs. We have always thought it wise at Columbia University to
encourage such a relationship. We have wanted the things that were
done for the students to be the things that needed to be done to meet
the requirements of the public. A university like ours could do infi-
nitely more than it is doing if two conditions were fulfilled. The first,
of course, is the possession of adequate resources for the purpose, and
the second is contact with and cooperation from the organized bodies
of practical men who are concerned with the management of the
industries of the country."
Henry P. Talbot, Professor of Inorganic Chemistry, Massachusetts Institute
of Technology:
"The instructor who is to be capable of equipping his pupils to
grapple with industrial problems in the broad sense must have ac-
quired the engineer's viewpoint, as I have called it, before he can
impart it. I believe we can obtain the best results only when every
instructor concerned with undergraduate courses has made such an
acquisition—not merely one or two members of a staff whose par-
ticular business it happens to be to give courses labelled 'Industrial
Chemistry' or 'Chemical Engineering.'
"I believe then that one of the greatest services which the uni-
versities could render to the chemical industries would be the placing
of a premium upon, or, when practicable, demanding of its instructing
staff real contact with, industrial processes.
"It seems very desirable to make an effort to devise some plan
of cooperation which will, in a considerable number of cases, permit
able men to serve the industries without severing their connection
with the educational institutions."
William Henry Perkin, President Chemical Society of London.
J. Chem. Soc., April, 1915:
"In Germany the majority of professors and privat-docenten are
in close touch with the large factories and spend part of their time
in solving technical problems which they either devise themselves or
which may be submitted to them by the manufacturers.
"Close association of the universities with the industries does not
exist to any extent in this country, and is one of the things we have
to aim at in the future, however distasteful this may appear to some
of our academic circles.
"We must, I think, agree that one of the main reasons for the
rise and development of the German Chemical Works is the recog-
nition of the great importance of a close alliance between the works
and the research laboratories of the universities.
"I look forward to the time when the scientific staffs of our uni-
versities and technical schools will not only be available for industrial
research, but will be encouraged to undertake it.


"After all, this kind of thing is quite common in the case of the
engineering department, and if the system works well in engineering
there is surely no reason why it should not be equally successful in
the case of chemistry."
Professor G. C. Henderson, President Society of Chemical Industry of Great
Britain.
J. Soc. Chem. Ind., July 31, 1915:
"The two main causes of our lack of progress are as follows:
Firstly, we have failed to realize... .that modern chemical industry
must be based upon research if it is to meet with success.
"In the second place, there has not been in the past a sufficiently
close and intimate interchange of information and opinions between
manufacturers and professors of chemistry."
Dr. M. 0. Forster, F.R.S.
J. Soc. Chem. Ind., July 31, 1915:
"In my belief this chasm between the college and the factory is
responsible for as much mischief as any other circumstance, for,
quite apart from the fact that it is bridged in Germany and the United
States (for France I cannot speak with first-hand knowledge), the
estrangement proceeds in a vicious circle. The factory ignores the
college. The demonstrator is not caught young; he therefore grows
into an academic professor who, having become deeply interested in
theoretical problems and shy of industrial ones, diverts each genera-
tion of students more and more away from the factory."
Professor William A. Bone.
J. Soc. Chem. Ind., July 31, 1915:
"....Indeed, he had sometimes heard complaints on the part of
short-sighted academic people that their colleagues in our faculties
of technology spend too much time in their consulting work. Of
course, a professor's prime duty was toward his students... .but it
was a great stimulus to be constantly in touch, through consultory
work, with all the latest industrial developments, and the connections
so formed were invaluable. Indeed, he was emboldened to say that
a professor chemical technology whose advisory services were not
sought after by manufacturers was incompetent to discharge the
prime duties of his chair."
Henry E. Armstrong, "The Development and Control of Industry by Public
Influences."
J. Soc. Chem. Ind., July 31, 1915:
"One main reason why we are so much behind in some of our
chemical industries is that the instruction given in our schools has
been far too academic in character, in no way in touch with practice.
"Academic chemists ought not merely to be allowed and encour-
aged, but almost required, to work for payment, as consultants, like
the engineers. The professor, pure and simple, should disappear....
the academic mind must be fertilized by contact with practice before
it can be of service to you... .One main reason why we are so much
behind in some of the chemical industries is that the instruction in
our schools has been far too academic in character, in no way in
touch with practice."

EDITORIAL
A HARD BLOW.
It was with true regret that the
Engineering College and the Campus
at large learned of the disastrous fire
which wiped out the buildings and
equipment of the Engineering Depart-
ment at the Michigan Agricultural
College. The loss is a serious one,
coming as it does in the middle of a
school year. With offices, laboratories,
equipment and records destroyed, the
immediate handicap is tremendous, not
to mention the loss of valuable data
representing the research work of the
college.
In this emergency the Engineering
College of the University cannot do
less than to give a practical turn to its
sympathy by offering to the stricken
school the use of its classrooms and
laboratories. It should be possible to
figure out some plan whereby a corps
of instructors from Lansing could con-
duct classes at Michigan, by an alter-
nation of laboratory and classroom
work with our regular schedule. As
a suggestion, the University labora-
tories might be used by M. A. C. in-
structors and students in the morn-
ing and the classrooms in the after-
noons. Any inconveniences arising
from such a plan would be most cheer-
fully met. Night classes might solve
some of the difficulties.
Michigan has always enjoyed very
intimate and friendly relations with M.
A. C. in athletics. Here is one way
in which we might strengthen these
ties in other fields of college activity.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
CIVIL ENGINEERING ENROLL-
MENT.
The Engineering Record during the
last three months has created nation-
wide interest in the alarming decrease
in the enrollment in civil engineering
at the principal colleges. Many sug-
gestions have been offered, in reply, by
the various colleges affected. It was
stated that business depression has
kept many students from attending
technical schools and colleges; that
the supply of engineers exceeds the
demand; that graduate schools are be-
coming more numerous; and that
more attractice and promising courses
are appearing in the college curri-
culums.
Michigan is the lone exception; en-
rollment here instead of showing a
decrease, has continued with a steady
gain. Just why Michigan should be
so favored while others are on the de-
cline is hard to explain. However,
some of the existing facts can be pre-
sented as the governing factors.
We might attribute the steady gain
to the fact that we already have the
largest engineering school in the coun-
try. The advantage of a splendid
equipment, of a faculty drawn largely
from the ranks of professional men,
and of the close relation existing here
between the large employers in the
outside world and the faculty are the
most important reasons. Surely we
are to be congratulated.
WELL DONE!
With this issue, the new Staff as-
sumes the responsibility of continuing
the praiseworthy work of the 1915
Staff. During their tenure of office
The Technic has come into its own
as a college technical publication. Due
to their effortsTHE Technic has been
accorded recognition as one of the rep-
resentative college publications of the
country—a high testimonial to their
ability as journalists.
SHORT COURSES.
Another successful short course in
Highway Engineering has been com-
pleted under the leadership of Prof.
J. J. Cox. The meetings and lectures,
were well attended and the apparent
interest and enthusiasm among the
men from all over this and other states
was a matter of frequent comment.
"Short courses" stand in strong con-
trast to the regular college courses.
The college courses from freshman to
senior year build up in a logical order
a more or less complete knowledge of
that branch of engineering pursued.
The full term of the short course is
a week at the most. Those whom it
attracts are men of years of practical
experience, men who may or may not
have enjoyed a technical education.
The short course serves to supple-
ment the practical knowledge with
sound and tried theory, and brings up
for discussion the thoughts and ideas
of the individual. It acts as the clear-
ing house for the collection and dis-
semination of the results of the varied
experiences of the men who attend it.
There is certainly no reason why
the benefits of such instruction should
be restricted to Highway Engineering
alone. Drainage, cement construction,
scientific shop management, and other
lines of engineering practice could
very profitably be treated in a course
of one week. There is opportunity for
advancement in this direction. Let us
hear more of the short course.

RESEARCH
M. E. 32—New Tests.
The laboratory work in M. E. 32 this
semester includes two new and important
tests:—the determination of the efficiency
of transmission gear boxes, and road tests
of gasoline consumption with complete au-
tomobiles. The efficiency tests of trans-
mission are made possible by the newly
erected testing rack at the south end of
the Diehl Electric Dynamometer. The
standard testing tank and methods of the
Society of Automobile Engineers will be
used in the gasoline consumption tests.
These additions are expected to create
much interest in view of the fact that Ann
Arbor automobile owners will have the op-
portunity of having valuable efficiency tests
made upon their cars, free of cost.
ELECTRICAL
Mr. I. N. Cuthbert, '15E, who is a can-
didate for the M.S. degree in Electrical
Engineering, is doing research work in
connection with the ignition, starting, and
lighting of automobiles.
ENGINEERING MECHANICS
Gypsum Tests
Mr. F. K. Hirth. '16E, is at present en-
gaged in standardizing tests on gypsum.
Up to this time very' little has been done
along this line.
MARINE
Draft Resistance
Tests have been made in the naval tank
recently to determine the resistance of
shallow-draft barges when towed in groups
of six. Two arrangements of the barges
were used, the boats being grouped two
abreast and three abreast.
Tests are now under way to determine
the resistance of certain tunnel-stern mod-
els of towboats for the Mississippi River.
The tests are made with the propeller re-
volving in the tunnel, and are the first in
which the new propeller dynamometer has
been used. The top of the tunnel in which
the screw works is made with a slope of
15° to 300 on both the approach and dis-
charge sides, and models with various com-
binations of slopes of 150 200, and 300
are being tested.
EXHIBIT
Plans are under way for the annual
engineering exhibit to be held near the
end of the college year. General Chairman
Clark has announced the following men
as members of the general committee with
the department that they will represent;
K. W. Heinrich, marine and aeronautical;
A. McColl. architectural; A. F. Grenell.
electrical; R. S. Archer, chemical; W. W.
Kurt, mechanical; E. C. Headman, civil,
and G. D. Cook, publicity man. These
men will in turn appoint various other


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
men in their departments to act on sub
committees in conjunction with representa-
tives of the freshman, sophomore, and
junior classes. General Chairman Clark
intends, by organizing this force of work-
ers, to make every phase of the exhibition
another Michigan success.
CIVIL
A New Text
William H. Sellew, A.S.M.E., Author of
"Steel Rails, Their History, Properties,
Strength and Manufacture" has recently
published another book entitled "Railway
Maintenance Engineering with Notes on
Construction." The book argues that Rail-
way development in this country has
reached a stage where it is intensive rather
than extensive. It deals with the idea that
the, improvement of existing railroad lines
is a problem more to be concerned with
than with the laying out of new roads.
It treats mainly with the subject of main-
tenance.
Mr. Sellew is a non-resident lecturer
on Railway Engineering here and we wish
his book the best of success.
Highway
At the short course in Highway En-
gineering held February 21 to 25, instruc-
tion was given in road building by mem-
bers of the faculty of the College of En-
gineering in co-operation with the Michigan
State Highway Department.
The following lectures were given:
"Economical Design of Highways with
Reference to Traffic," by Arthur H. Blan-
chard, Professor of Highway Engineering,
Columbia University.
"Bituminous Surface Treatment for Wa-
ter-Bound Macadam and Gravel Roads,"
by Chas. F. Reeve, Chief Chemist of the
Office of Public Roads. Washington, D. C.
"The Maintenance of Earth Roads," by
W. S. Gearhart, State Highway Engineer
of Kansas.
"Specifications and Contracts." by H. K.
Vedder. Professor of Civil Engineering,
Michigan Agricultural College.
"The Duty of the County Road Com-
missioners," by William Kelly, Chairman
of the Dickinson County Road Commis-
sion.
"The Highway Engineer as a Public Ser-
vant," by Ira O. Baker, Professor of Civil
Engineering, University of Illinois.
"Road Maintenance," by Frank F. Rog-
ers, Michigan State Highway Commis-
sioner.
'Experiences of Maine with Various
Types of Road Surfaces Under Various
Kinds and Intensities of Traffic," by Paul
D. Sargent. Chief Engineer Maine High-
way Commissioner.
MECHANICAL
Scientific Management
The Scientific Management Course,
started the second semester, will occupy
an important place on the curriculum of
the college henceforward. This Taylor
System of management aims to increase
manufacturing production, not by driving
or speeding up the workman, but by alter-
ing conditions to enable him to turn out
more work with the same energy. Aston-
ishing results are being accomplished
throughout the American manufacturing
world simply by eliminating waste of hu-
man energy and it has become necessary
for the engineer to attack the problem of
systematizing scientifically.
There are both lectures and laboratory
work. Non-resident. lecturers, who have
had experience with the system, will speak
at various times. Opportunity is given to
make a study of plants in Ann Arbor and
Detroit.
The Taylor Society, formed to pro-
mote the investigation along this line, will
hold a meeting in Ann Arbor in May last-
ing three days. Manufacturers from all
the western part of the country are ex-
pected to attend.
Additions
The Automobile Engineering Depart-
ment has been presented with a complete
6-30 power plant by the Chalmers Motor


49
Co. It is the first motor of the extremely
high speed type to be placed in the labora-
tory.
The S. A. E. rating gives this plant 25.3
horse-power and, on the dynamometer
test, the motor develops its maximum
horse-power at 2,600 r. p. m. The motor
will run evenly up as high as 3,400 r. p. m.
The remarkable co-operation of auto-
mobile manufacturers with the department
is indicated by the fact that equipment
has been presented by the following auto-
mobile companies:
Studebaker—complete show chassis and
engine section to show interior.
Cadillac—1916—8 cylinder motor block
in section.
Ford—complete power plant including
motor, clutch and transmission.
Krit—motor unit.
Franklin—two power plants and clutches,
and one transmission.
Hudson—complete six-54 motor unit
Reo—1915—complete chassis and motor.
Also a 1914 motor.
^ Chalmers—1916—power plant including
clutch and transmission.
Timkin Co.—complete exhibit of truck
and pleasure car axles.
Weston-Mott—model of full floating
rear axle.
This list is in addition to a score or
more small units such as differentials,
clutches, transmissions, carburetors, and
ignition sets.
A prominent horn manufacturer has in-
creased the efficiency of our mechanical
laboratory by installing a set of automo-
bile horns to be used in signalling where
readings and measurements art to be taken.
This is a convenience which will be appre-
ciated by every one connected with the
laboratory.
Re-decoration of Shops
The interior of the forge and machine
shops has recently received a new coat of
white and brown paint. This is the first
time in the last four years that the interior
has been painted and the present improve-
ment has made the illumination much
better.
Spark-plugs Presented.
The Automobile Department has just re-
ceived a gift of 50 Champion Spark Plugs
of all sizes and designs. While most of the
plugs are to be used in the laboratory tests,
a few have been cut so as to show the in-
terior construction. These, after having
been suitably mounted, will be displayed
in the laboratory, together with the ex-
hibits from other automobile specialty
manufacturers.
The Automobile Engineering Department
has lately received a complete set of blue
prints of the National 12 cylinder car from
Mr. W. G. Wall, their chief engineer.
Corliss Engine in M. E. Lab.
The Corliss Engine which furnished
power for the Engineering Shops for so
many years, has been overhauled, and
erected in the Mechanical Laboratory,
where it will be used in connection with the
regular laboratory instruction in M. E. 7
and M. E. 8.
Messrs. R. G. Urch, '12 M.E., and C. G.
Hoover, '13 Mar., assistants in the
Mechanical Laboratory, are about to begin
an investigation of a steam trap used as
a feed pump for a steam boiler. They ex-
pect to determine its capacity and efficiency.
The trap upon which the test is to be made
was built by the American Duplex Steam
Trap Company of Detroit.
The New Automobile Laboratory
The new automobile laboratory will be
entirely completed and in use by the be-
ginning of the next school year. It is
located in the old boiler house. It will have
about 5,000 square feet of floor space. The
main testing floor is 60 feet square. There
are seven testing racks with a complete
motor mounted on each.
The main floor of the laboratory will
consist of a gallery entirely surrounding
the testing room below. A complete chassis
assembly will be placed on each side of the
entrance to the gallery. Along the gallery
rail will be placed exhibits of transmissions
and clutch units.
The left end of the gallery will be de-
voted to a computing and designing room.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
A complete chassis as well as a large rack
of drawings for the use of the student de-
signers will be located here. A research
and dynamometer room will be at the right
end of the gallery. All the apparatus neces-
sary for completely testing a motor will
be set up here.
Provision will be made for measuring
the horsepower of any complete car.
Franklin "Six" Tests
Gasoline consumption and horsepower
tests on the Franklin 6-30 air-cooled motor
have just been completed by the M. E. 32
squad. Conditions introduced during the
test made the laboratory work conform in
every way possible to actual road tests.
During the tests the motor was equipped
with a standard dash and air-apron, and
attached to a water dynamometer. The
velocities of the air blast, which was forced
past the engine by a large blower operated
by a 15 h. p. electric motor, was regulated
in accordance with the engine, thus ap-
proximating service conditions. The set-up
used for this test will be in operation dur-
ing the coming exhibit and it is expected
that the unique construction necessary to
obtain the equivalent of actual road con-
ditions will prove highly interesting.
ELECTRICAL
Rates and Cost Analysis
Professor J. C. Parker is giving a new
course this semester in Rates and Cost
Analysis to seniors who have had at least
one fundamental course in Electrical En-
gineering. This course is unique in that,
as far as is known, it is offered at no
other institution. It deals with the funda-
mentals of business relations between pub-
lic utility companies and customers, rather
than confining itself to the subject of
Rates. The general principles have ap-
plication to cost analysis and formulation
of price lists in other classes of business,
although it is specifically directed toward
public service corporation work.
Professor T. J. MacKavanaugh has of-
fered a new course, this semester, on
Electric Meters, Relays, and Commercial
Measuring Instruments.
Mr. C. L. Boyce, who for a long time
has been Chief Engineer of the Michigan
State Telephone Co., and who has lately
worked on the appraisal of public utilities,
has been appointed lecturer in the Electrical
Engineering department. Mr. Boyce will
give a series of ten or twelve lectures to
students in course E.E.13. They will deal
mainly with the economic features in plant
design.
Trip to Detroit Edison Plants
The classes in "Electric Generating Sta-
tions" and "Steam Power Plants," accom-
panied by Professors Lovell and Rowenr
spent Saturday, January 22, in Detroit as
the guests of the Detroit Edison Com-
pany. We have used the word guests and
used it advisedly, for no guest ever re-
ceived more royal treatment than was
given by the Detroit Edison Company to
every member of the visiting classes.
In spite of the fact that seven o'clock
comes very early in the morning, especially
this time of year, it was a wide awake and
enthusiastic crowd which left Ann Arbor
at that hour. Upon arriving in Detroit,
the party proceeded at once to the Delray
plant where it was joined by reinforce-
ments, making the aggregation nearly one
hundred strong. This, however, did not
dismay the Edison engineers, who divided
the party into groups of ten or twelve,
each in charge of a guide. This arrange-
ment permitted each man to hear perfectly
the explanations given by the guides and
to ask questions concerning anything which
he did not understand.
The Delray plant contains a great variety
of equipment, especially in the line of
auxiliaries, so that the entire morning was
required to complete the circuit through
the plant. The noon hour found every one,
equipped with a regulation working man's
appetite for inspection of the culinary de-
partment. After partaking generously of
the days output, which was served gratis
by the Edison Company, every one pro-
nounced it a perfect product.


5i
After the noon repast the party was
transferred to the Conners Creek plant in
a special car furnished by the Edison Com-
pany. This plant, which is the last word
in power plant construction, surprised all
by its extreme simplicity, which was a de-
cided contrast to the Delray plant. The
great variety of steam and electric auxili-
aries of the latter plant are entirely miss-
ing at the Conners Creek station. This,
however, did not detract in any way from
its interest, but rather had the opposite
effect, since it seemed almost impossible
that a power plant could be operated at
high economy with so little auxiliary ma-
chinery. This delusion was soon dispelled
and before the trip through the plant was
completed every one was convinced that a
power plant could be simple and still be
economical.
New Book
Prof. John Fay Wilson has just pub-
lished a new textbook for colleges and
technical schools. His proposition is that'
the general belief that continuous and al-
ternating currents are not subject to the
same laws, is entirely erroneous. The prin-
ciples and laws governing the flow of con-
tinuous currents also govern alternating
currents. It is written for engineers spe-
cializing in lines other than specially elec-
trical.
MARINE
Eastland Investigation
In connection with the Eastland investi-
gation Professor Sadler head of the Ma-
rine Engineering department, was called as
an expert witness in support of the govern-
ments contentions as to the faulty con-
struction of the Eastland.
CHEMICAL
Fellowships
After the occurence of several accidents
and delays due to the failure of boiler
tubes, the Edison Illuminating Company of
Detroit has given six hundred dollars for
the support of a fellowship in the chemical
engineering department during the present
year. Mr. Harold F. Wood, 15E, who has
been graduate assistant in chemical engin-
eering, has been giveni the fellowship. It is
the desire of the department to co-operate
with different companies in this manner
as the practical experience affords ■ the
best education for the student and also
gains a very favorable recognition of the
University by the public.
An Addition
A three foot dry pan, for preparing clays
and grinding refractory materials, has been
purchased for the work in Ceramics.
Dr. J. S. Laird has received a shipment
of 400 tiles from the Beaver Falls Art Tile
Co., as material for an investigation' on
the causes of cracking of glazed wall tiles.
MECHANICS
Additions in Testing Laboratory
Two new machines were recently added
to the equipment of the material testing
laboratory. One is the Upton-Lewis
Toughness Testing machine for repeated
stress testing. The specimen is vibrated
under a known fibre stress and the number
of repetitions are automatically recorded on
a revolving drum. The machine is ar-
ranged so that the fibre stress can be re-
corded if applied statically or in the form
of an impact. This machine is being used
for testing heat treated steel, spring steel,
and other metals subjected to alternate
stress.
The other machine is an Olsen Impact
Testing machine. It is used to determine
the shock resisting quality of a material
in the form of a cantilever. The specimen
is clamped in a rigid vise with one end
protruding and the hammer is allowed to
strike the free end. This machine has a
capacity of one hundred foot pounds and
the scale is graduated so that the actual
energy absorbed in breaking the specimen
is noted directly by the pointer on the scale.
Change in E. M. 5.
E.M.S is slightly changed this semester.
It includes a test of the effects of carbon

content and different heat treatment on
the physical properties of steel. These tests
are being conducted in the chemical labora-
tory.
ENGINEERING SOCIETY
GENERAL
'History repeats itself.'' Undoubtedly
it does but not identically and absolutely.
Evolution and progress prevent it. Presi-
dent N. F. Brown has enlisted a committee
to co-operate with him in his efforts to
aid progress and thus prevent a repetition
of the past year's history of the Society.
The following men are members of this
committee, N. F. Brown, H. R. Leach, W.
Warren, E. H. Merritt, C. H. Cotter, A. C.
Simons, H. H. Fikert, R. L. McNamee.
At the beginning of the first semester, The
Tech nic Staff, boarded the disabled and de-
serted ship and endeavored to bring it into
port. The students responded nobly to the
call for support and established a record
breaking membership, thereby replenishing
the ship's bunkers with fuel for the boilers
with their "dollar per." However, the
power plant and operating machinery were
so disabled that the volunteer crew ex-
perienced great difficulty in getting up
steam. Upon reaching port, the vessel was
turned over to the underwriters who im-
mediately appointed the present officers as
receivers. Naturally the first step taken
by the receivers was to make an inventory
of the property. They found that there
was an accumulation of liabilities as well
as a dissipation of assets, but that on the
whole the physical valuation was good. On
the other hand, however, the "going value"
proved to be absolutely nil.
It is the purpose, therefore of President
Brown and the committee, to increase the
so-called "going value." As a step in this
direction the constitution is being revised
and will be presented to the members of
the Society, in the near future for ratifi-
cation. In this constitution it is the hope
of the committee to embody certain safety
to prevent the recurrence of numerous fail-
ures of the operating machinery.
In response to requests from members of
the Society for more frequent lectures, C.
H. Cotter has been appointed chairman of
a committee to take charge of all lectures
to be given under the auspices of the So-
ciety and to confer with the Faculty upon
the selection of the speakers.
It has been a very regretable feature of
past lectures, even those given by men
pre-eminent in the engineering profession,
that they have been very poorly supported
and attended by the students. At several,
the students were conspicuious, by their
absence. The officers of the Society believe
that if a determined and concentrated ef-
fort is made to arouse enthusiasm and to
properly advise the students of the vast
advantages to be derived from such lec-
tures, they will become popular and be a
success in every way. Whether or not this
belief is to be justified rests with the stu-
dent.
It may be rather paradoxical to appeat
to an engineer in any way which would
tend to disprove such a fundamental law
as the Law of the Conservation of Energy,,
but attend the next lecture given by the
Society and see if you do not get "some-
thing for nothing."
CIVIL
The Civil Engineering Society of the
University of Michigan annually passes
through changes and adjustments that
seem advisable to new officers and mem-
bers. This year the most important change
has been in organizing a body of officers
and devising a constitution for the Generat
Engineering Society. These officers are to
be the clearing house of the combined
branch societies. The organization has
been completed though the constitution is
not yet finished.
The roll now contains the names of
eighty men, about one-half of which are
seniors. Two lecturers of national reputa-
tion have been here so far, namely, Prof.
Mead of the University of California, and
Mr. Riggs, General Manager of the Ameri-
can Bridge Company. This semester a
larger list of speakers is being prepared;


53
its number will be determined largely by
the attendance. Provision is being made
for short, illustrated talks by society mem-
bers and university men. A lecture on
military engineering with direct reference
to the probable and desirable part the en-
gineering college will play in the pre-
paredness program, if it is instituted here,
is on the bill. A class in knots, lashings,
and splices covering some of the details
of the riggers profession will be announced
later. Nothing adds more to the respect
from the man accorded an engineer in
charge of a job than for ability to handle
a rope and rigging. Later in the spring
an outdoor party for members and their
lady friends will be held near the river
where an evening meal will be cooked over
camp fires. Dances, one of which will be
given soon, will be under the management
of the general society. .
Any advice or suggestions from mem-
bers is earnestly solicited. Any suggestions
concerning possible speakers should be
made to Carl Cotter, Secretary. Money
matters are in the hands of J. K. Norton.
A. C. Simons, 16E,
President.
ELECTRICAL
At the January meeting of the University
of Michigan Branch of the American In-
stitute of Electrical Engineers an interest-
ing lecture on the Mechanical Analogies
in Magnetism and Electricity was given
by Dr. W. S. Franklin, formerly of Johns
Hopkins University. His talk was illu-
strated by several lantern slides showing
various magnetic and electrical phenomena
each of which were taken up and explained
by a mechanical device illustrating identi-
cally the same thing.
MECHANICAL
One of the interesting lectures which
have been given before the Mechanical
Branch this year was by Mr. H. H. Essly-
styn of the Detroit Edison Co. His subject
was "Reminiscences in Engineering" in
which he told of some amusing and excit-
ing incidences which have confronted him
in his work as an engineer. After the lec-
ture proper, Mr. Esslystyn told of some
of the big things that the Detroit Edison
Company are engaged in, and answered
questions concerning the additions now
being made in the Conners Creek plants.
INTERNATIONAL ENGINEERING
CONGRESS, 1915.
The Committee of Management, Inter-
national Engineering Congress, 1915, an-
nounces that the volume on Mechanical
Engineering is ready for distribution and
the members who have subscribed to this
volume will soon receive it
The other volumes will be issued as
rapidly as possible. Owing to the large
amount of material to be reprinted, and
the thousands of copies to be bound, the
work cannot be carried on with greater
speed. However, it is hoped that within
two months the entire set will be completed.
Members who did not send in their final
selections may be disappointed in not se-
curing all the volumes they might have
had in mind, and at this date the Commit-
tee has decided to close the lists for cer-
tain volumes which have been sent to the
press. It may be possible to supply mem-
bers who would apply at this late hour
with copies of volumes which have not
gone to press.

ON THE CAMPUS
Pan American Scientific Congress
At the recent Pan American Scientific
Congress held in Washington for the pur-
pose of promoting relations with Latin
America, President Harry B. Hutchins,
Dean M. E. Cooley, Professors W. J.
Hussey, Wra. Hobbs, J. W. Glover, and J.
S. Reeves were delegates from Michigan.


THE MICHIGAN TECH NIC
Fossil Collections
A valuable collection of fossils of Mio-
cene taken from the vicinity of Yorktown,
Maryland, has been presented to the Uni-
versity by Mr. F. M. Ellers, instructor in
the department of geology.
Nkv Mall
A mall has been proposed between the
Natural Science and the Chemistry build-
ings and plans are now being made.
Forestry Department
The Forestry Department has recently
received a practically complete set of sec-
tions of wood from timber-producing trees
of the United States. Complete sets are
extremely rare, and are possessed by only
a few institutions in this country.
Beahan
Mr. Willard Beahan, a Cornell man and
associate of Dean Cooley, delivered two
lectures January 9, one before the Union
and the other before the Y. M. C. A. Mr.
Beahan has been engaged in railroad
building all his life, beginning in the south-
west for Jay Gould, later building the
Chilean National Railways, and at present
assistant chief engineer for the New York
Central. He remarked that he never takes
a vacation except to visit colleges and
speak to college men, never telling them
about engineering but rather about the
other side of their lives. He was one of
the first men to advocate a wider education
for engineers and has set an excellent ex-
ample by his own public activities. Mr.
Beahan's fund of experiences makes him
a most interesting speaker, one whom
Michigan is always glad to entertain.
Palmer
Frederick Palmer, war correspondent,
lectured recently at Hill Auditorium. In
his talk he emphasized strongly the neces-
sity of engineers in modern welfare.
Mead
Professor Edward Mead, D. E., of the
University of California, spoke to the stu-
dents of the Engineering College on De-
Ti
cember first. Professor Mead has for the
past seven or eight years been in charge
of the water resources of the state of
Victoria, Australia, and has studied exten-
sively in Europe. He is considered to be
at the head of his profession in this coun-
try.
Summer School Courses
The course in the College of Engineering
Summer Session will be practically identi-
cal to those of last summer according to
Dean Edward H. Krause.
Menorah Society
The Menorah Society has placed an
essay contest before the undergraduate
body; prizes offered are $100.00 for each
of the two best submitted on Jewish Liter-
ature, History, or Achievements. Essays
are to be handed in at the President's Office
not later than May IS, 1916.
Oxyacetylene Welding
The work of cutting up the large pieces
of iron and steel taken out of the old boil-
er house has been accomplished by the
ovyacetclyne process. The steel blue flame
They're Engineers
seems to be able to cut through the heavy
boiler plates with little difficulty and phen-
omonal speed. About 4 p. m. Jan. 19
a number of students were gathered around
the man with the blue glasses and watched
with interest the easy manner in which he
sent the flame through pieces 3-4 inch thick
as quickly as a knife would pierce a soft
piece of pine wood. The speed and clean-
ness of the operations were not to be over-
looked by a most casual observer, and in
the absence of heavy blows and din and
noise the work seemed anything but that of
breaking up old boilers.

CHEMICAL
Prof. A. E. White, assisted by H. F.
Wood, 'is, made investigations recently for
improving the methods of making brass
castings. As a result of the research work,
he has devised methods for obtaining 70
per cent of its metal to productive use in-
stead of 30 and 40 per cent as formerly.
CLASS NOTES.
1916.
At the January assembly Andrew H.
Green, general manager of the Solvay
Process Company, gave one of the most
interesting talks that has been heard by
'16 class.
A record breaking crowd enjoyed the
annual dance of the Civil Engineers which
was held on the evening of December sixth.
For once, Professor Johnston was induced
to defer roll-call for the tardy. The field
work for the evening, consisting of a tra-
verse, acted as do most of that sort. It
failed to close. The program of twenty
dances which followed was relieved by a
regular "Sing," with camp-fire accompani-
ment, and a true camp style feed.
On December sixth, 1915, the marriage
of L. H. ("Jack") Benton, ex '16, member
of the Varsity football and baseball teams,
to Miss Eleanor Coburn Reed, of Ann
Arbor, was announced. Their honeymoon
was spent at Valparaiso, Indiana, and later
they will reside in Gary, Indiana. The
groom will assist his father, who is dean
of the Commercial Department of Val-
paraiso University.
Linn M. Rakestraw has been elected a
junior member of the Society of Naval
Architects and Marine Engineers at a
meeting of that organization held recently
in New York City.
January twentieth was the date of an-
other of the ever successful '16E dinners.
The dining room of the Michigan Union
was filled to capacity. After enjoying one
of Denny's best productions, the crowd
was treated to short speeches by the Rev.
Lloyd C. Douglas, president, "Howdy"
Phillips, and Professor Rowen. They were
all good, even to the "Sky Pilot," who was
better.
Willard Girwin was recently confined to
the University Hospital with an acute dis-
ease of the ear.
1917.
Almost but not quite—the '17E indoor
baseball team finished their schedule, this
winter, in second place. Well, never mind
fellows. Yon will be at the top of the pile
next year, for sure.
Profesor Johnston, at our January as-
sembly, gave the class an interesting illu-
minated travellogue on "Egypt and the
Pyramids," showing by word and picture
the history and construction of the Pyra-
mids and Sphinx. At the business session
held at the first of the hour, the Honor
System, in its original form, was brought
up for discussion and when brought to a
vote had overwhelming opposition; the
pledge being the bone of contention. How-
ever, at a special meeting it was again
brought forth, this time in a very simple
form and with no mention of the objection*
able pledge. It was carried by a three-
quarters majority.
Just before the Christmas holidays,
"Duke" Riach, Ch, while working in Or-
ganic laboratory, painfully but not serious-
ly burned his hand with liquid bromine
while pouring it from a bottle.
Last November "Bob" Kohr was hustled
to the Homeopathic hospital in a serious
condition. He was suffering from a slight
attack of pneumonia, so the doctor says.
However my imformant states, on good
authority, that it was a case of Lovitis.
Manager Zwickey announces that the'17E
orchestra is now well organized with ten
members and with an assortment of new
music is practising regularly. We are
looking for a treat from them at our next
class dinner.
"Buck" Buxton poked his wrist through
a D. U. R. window while returning from
an Ypsi fussing trip, recently. Dr. W.
Davids, '16 Dent., rendered first aid to the
badly lacerated wrist.
Attendance at the State Grange meeting
prevented President Hutchins from ad-
dressing our assembly Dec. 16, 1915.


THE MICHIGAN THCHNIC
1918.
We agreed to accept the honor system
for better or for worse.
It was our privilege to listen to Prof.
Johnson for the second time when he ad-
dressed us at our special meeting, called
to consider the honor system. He repre-
sented the faculty, explaining their attitude
toward the question and how they would
back the students up in such a movement
Treasurer H. A. Knowlson threw a
bomb into that diminishing number of
tardy payers into the class treasury when
he announced at the last meeting that dues
outstanding after Easter would automati-
cally become one half larger in their face
value. As a business proposition it should
appeal to every member of the class.
As a class secretary she can't be beat.
With ice skating enjoying a popularity
this year greater than it has ever known
before, much interest centers around the
activities of our hockey team. Weston, the
man from Sault Ste Marie, was unanimous-
ly elected captain and is leading the boys
on the slippery surface in great style.
"Gord' Johnson is engineering the basket
ball end of our activities. He has a husky
bunch of fellows in good form and they
are doing splendid team work.
As an idle question some one might ask
if you ever go to the trouble of seeing a
game.
After Dean John Robert Effinger finished
with the sophomore engineers at their class
meeting on December 16, the class gave
the Literary College a much higher rating
than most engineers will concede it. He
had some excellent thoughts on "Breadth"
which he called the second dimension.
We do not hear anything more about the
class orchestra, but we hope some one gets
busy and starts something soon.
To those who are civils in the class of
'18, the talk given by Dr. Stouffer at their
smoker of Dec. 16 must have been a mighty
interesting one for they are the men who
are going to experience the joys of life
at Camp Davis that Dr. Stouffer described
, so vividly. The talk as a whole was a most
interesting description of this side of col-
lege life.
The smoker was a big success. There
was music, cider and tobacco in abundance
mixed with genuine '18 good spirit in ex-
cess. The principals were A. J. Gornetzky
at the piano, Dean DeButts, Halstead Cot-
tington, and H. Howe on the violin. Robert
Erley also showed us that he was right
there on the piano. In short the only thing-
wrong with the class smoker is that it only
comes but once a term.
Our assemblies have not always been illu-
minated with the best of speakers nor
have we escaped from being thoroughly
bored at times, but this was certainly- not
the case when Professor Bunker of the
law department addressed us last semester.
In his quaint and peculiar style he gave us
more to laugh over and think about in the
short time alloted him than many have
been able to do. We probably did not all
agree with him on the subject of entrance
examinations, but when he branched off
into a lengthy discussion of the student's
relation to private property and to the state
of Michigan, we could not help but see the
real good logic of his remarks.
We should like very much to hear you
again, Professor Bunker.
1919.
Prof. John R. Allen, gave another "Tur-
key Talk" at the assembly held on Dec. 8.
His subject was, "The Engineer Out of His
Own Country." Personal experiences cited*
added greatly to the interest of the talk.
At the assembly of January 7, the class
accepted the constitution as presented by
the student council. Mr. Wm. W. Bishop
gave an interesting talk on the Elizabethan
Club of Yale University.
Dean Bates of the law department ad-
dressed the assembly on January 19. His
subject was, "The Recall of Judicial Decis-
ions." In pointing out its advantages and
disadvantages he explained that it was at
one time one of the planks in the platform
of the Progressive party but has recently
been withdrawn.
On Wednesday, January 27, Dean Cooler
introduced Dean Vaughn of the medical
school who spoke on the benefits this gen-
eration is receiving due to the co-operation


57
of the engineer and the doctor. By citing
history he showed how the Greeks and
Romans were unable to succeed because of
the lack of the latter.
At a special assembly on Friday, January
28, the class voted to accept the proposed
honor system. Ninety per cent of those
present voted in favor of the resolutions.
The hockey team lost its initial game
Feb. 14, against the sophomore engineers,
the final score being 6-1.
On Friday evening, January 7, the class
of '19 held their first dance at Granger's
Academy. The feature of the evening was
an "Argentina Dance," given by "Majestic"
girls. The music, the dainty programs, and
the feature act bespeak the efforts of the
entertainment committee to make this
dance a success. The committee was com-
posed of the following men: Richard
Smith, Charles Horr, Lesley Page, William
Gubbins, and Henry Brand. Dr. and Mrs.
W. D. Moriarty and Dr. and O. C. Marck-
wardt chaperoned the party.

THE ENGINEERING LIBRARY
It has been said, that many of the students
in this college, do not derive all the benefit
they should from the library because they
do not know the regulations of the library.
The purpose of this article is to make
clear to the student the various kinds of
books to be had and the library regulations
for their use.
The subject matter of the books covers
all branches of engineering, such as Me-
chanical, Electrical, Civil, etc. Aeronautics
and Architecture. 'The bulletins and pro-
ceedings of all the engineering societies
such as the A. S. C. E. dating back many
years are there for student use. In addition
to those, there are many of the leading
technical magazines both domestic and
foreign and technical periodicals issued by
various American universities and colleges.
In the Rhetoric Library which is connected
with the Engineering Library, the student
may find many of the classics of American
and English literature. The library also has
a complete assortment of dictionaries of
all languages.
The Reserve Library is comprised of
books to which special reference has been
made by members of the faculty. There is


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
a certain ruling concerning these books,
namely, no student will be allowed to take
a book, which has been reserved, from the
library except after nine at night and the
book must be returned the following morn-
ing at eight o'clock.
The following regulations apply to the
release of all books in the Engineering
Library, except reserved books:
1. Any student enrolled in the University
is entitled to draw books from the library-)
the number of books not to exceed two.
2. The student on drawing out a book
must sign his name and address on the
slip given him by the librarian
3. The student may keep the book in his
possession for a period of not more than
one week unless he makes a special ar-
rangement with the librarian.
4. All books must be returned to the desk.
5. Dictionaries may not be taken from
the library-
6. All magazines, except the current is-
sues and Architectural, may be released
from the library.
It is the aim of the persons in charge of
the library to give the best of service to
the students. The librarian will help the
student to find any book and explain the
use of the card index and the Engineering
index, which is an index of magazine ar-
ticles, that the student may come to the
library and find material on the subject in
which he is interested.
AERONAUTICS AND.MARINE ENGI-
NEERING IN THE EXHIBIT.
Contribution of Aeronautical and Marine
Engineering Dept. to Engineering Exhibit.
This year the aeronautical department,
will exhibit in conjunction with the marine
department, both being in charge of K. N.
Heinrich. As the aeronautical department
has progressed rapidly since its debut in
the exhibit of 1914, a wider range of ob-
jects will be offered than at that time, and
an up-to-date exhibit has been planned on.
Negotiations are under way to show
a Wright hydroplane, and an attempt will
be made to innate the balloon now in pos-
session of the University, with air fur-
nished by the mechanical labratory. Aero-
plane motors and propellers have been of-
fered by various manufacturers, together
with models of their machines. An exhibi-
tion of the phenomenon of resistance has
also been planned, in which an experiment-
al tunnel will be used.
The marine department, through the
courtesy of Secretary Daniels of the Navy
department, will offer an interesting and
spectacular exhibit.
Among the features will be a gatling gun
used by the Spaniards, in defense of San
Juan Hill, and a completely assembled six
inch marine gun. Rapid fire guns, field
landing guns, rifles and small arms, together
with shrapnel and other shells, complete
the list of war materials loaned by the
Navy department.
The naval tank will be in operation,
showing the methods used in the making
and testing of models. Three distinct types
of submarine models made and experi-
mented on here will be shown, and an effort
will be made to secure models of torpedoes
and mines.
The marine drafting room will display
drawings of ship machinery and ships,
while models of different types of ships
will feature. Of especial interest will be the
model of the "Yosemite," which was used
to transport Michigan volunteers to Cuba
during the Spanish-American War, and on
which Dean Cooley was chief engineer.
CIVIL
On Thursday, March 2, a smoker was
given by he Civil Branch of the Engineer-
ing Society. Bleekman, Keeler, James and
Liddicoat entertained the members with
some of the most superb singing ever heard
at a gathering of engineers, leaving the
audience in a highly receptive mood for the
wierd selections on the mandolin, guitar
and violin, furnished by the Bolton com-
bination.
Professor Case of the Geology Depart-
ment gave a very interesting talk on the
pleasures and practical benefits to be de-
rived from hunting bones of ante-diluvian
fossils in Texas, illustrating his talk with
numerous lantern slides and leaving us with


59
the impression that the hottest place quoted
in the Bible isn't far from Texas.
The members there proceeded to enjoy
the supply of cookies, apples, corn cob pipes
and Prince Albert provided by the com-
mittee and actuated by the high success of
the Bleekman quartette, demonstrated that
the vocal ability of engineers compares
most favorably with that of other musical
organizations.
STUDENT BRANCH A. I. E. E.
Mr. H. H. Norton of Detroit, Mich.,
spoke before the local branch of the A.I.E.
E. on Jan. 27. Mr. Norton treated the sub-
ject of electrical layout work for buildings
and used as illustrative example a typical
office building in his city. The lecture was
illustrated with slides and drawings that
made it very comprehensible and interest-
ing, and gave those present an excellent
idea of some of the problems involved in
this line of work. Mr. Norton's lecture
was doubly interesting to those who were
taking Prof. Higbie's course in lighting.
In fact it is the aim of the society to en-
gage lecturers who will speak along the
lines of some of the more important
courses in the department.
At the last meeting of the society a dis-
cussion committee was appointed who will
lead the discussions at future meetings. It
is hoped that this committee will tend a
discussion after each lecture that will bring
out the most important points of the lec-
ture and make the meeting more spicy and
more valuable to all. The society has been
very fortunate in securing good speakers
throughout the year, but there has been a
marked lack of discussion at the meetings,
and it is the writer's opinion that as much
can be gained from a good discussion as
from the lecture itself.
Furthermore the gain from discussion is
not confined to the subject matter of the
lecture alone for the student in conducting
a discussion must be able to think and talk
before his fellow students. This is an asset
every engineer should make an effort to
acquire.
AUTOMOBILE SOCIETY
Last semester a number of students in-
terested in automobile work, organized a
society for the promotion of education
along this line. It was their intention to
finally affiliate with the S.A.E., forming a
branch similar to the already existing
branches of the other national engineering
societies.
The Detroit S.A.E. invited all interested
Michigan students to a meeting held in
the convention hall of the Ponchartrain
on Feb. 16. A special car was engaged and
about seventy of the boys went in. The
paper of the evening was a review of "The
1016 Trend in Automobile Design," by Mr.
Clayden. Mr. Clayden is technical editor
of "Automobile," and recently has become
chairman of the S.A.E. Standards commit-
tee, which is doing some very important
work on the standardization of automobile
design.
After the meeting a buffet lunch was
served, and the Ann Arbor boys were
gathered for a little talk by some of the
Detroit S. A. E. men. The latter expressed
their qualification at the size of the delega-
tion, and their willingness to help organize
out here. Such will soon be done.


ENROLLMENT
With the enrollment of the largest fresh-
men class in the history of the college,
the crowded condition of the drafting
rooms has become more critical than ever
before. The total increase over last year is
more than 12 per cent. There are seventy-
six students in the freshman design course.
Graduate Design Work
Graduate work in architectural design
has been started this fall in one of the
smaller rooms No. 226 in New Engineering
Building.
Architecture in Detroit
The Architects' Business Association of
Michigan held its second annual convention
in Detroit at the Statler Hotel, Feb. 3.
This association was organized May 24,
1914, and its first annual convention was
held in Ann Arbor in the spring of last year.
It is this organization which is responsible
for the enactment of the law requiring the
registration of architects in this state. Be-
sides the election of officers, revision of the
constitution and by-laws, and other busi-
ness matters, the program includes ad-
dresses by Mr. Emory Stanford Hall, of
Chicago, president of the Illinois Society
of Architects, and Donn Barber of New
York city, a very prominent architect and
winner of the recent competition for the
$3,000,000 Department of Justice building
at Washington.
The great number of apartment houses
which are being planned and erected attest
to the rapid growth of Detroit. Some
apartment buildings with as many as sixty-
five small apartments are being designed.
The addition to the Statler is well under
way and a traveling mens' hotel to be erect-
ed not far from Statler is being promoted
by local parties.
The Architectural Dance
The first semester dance of the 1918 and
1919 Architectural classes was held Satur-
day evening, Jan. 15, at the Packard Acad-
emy. All the architects were invited. Mr.
and Mrs. Kimball and Mr. and Mrs. Ben-
nett were chaperons. The committee hav-
ing charge of the affair was M. Brundidge,
chairman, '18A, Miss Yerex, '18A, Miss Hop-
kins. -i8A P. Maher, *i8A. W. Dixon, 'i8A,
and M. E. Hammond, '18A. The dance was
representative of the department as mem-
bers of all the classes were present. The
affair proved so successful, both financially
and socially, that it is planned to have
another dance before the Easter vacation.
Elections
Tau Sigma Delta honorary fraternity in
architecture held their semi-annual initia-
tion banquet, Jan. 22. The new members
initiated were Warren L. Rindge, '16A, and
Hubert Lamby, grad.
The Association of Collegiate Schools of
Architecture.
The above association held its third con-
vention in Washington on November 30
last. The meeting was held at the Shore-


61
ham Hotel and immediately preceded the
convention of the American Institute of
Architects thus permitting attendance upon
both meetings by members of the associa-
tion.
The organization consists of representa-
tives of the architectural faculty of the
following institutions: Columbia, Cornell,
Harvard, Syracuse and Washington Uni-
versities; Universities of Michigan, Cali-
fornia, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Massa-
chusetts and Carnegie Institutes of Techno-
logy.
Steps were taken at the meeting to bring
about a general survey of all the teaching
of architecture and also discussions were
conducted on the courses of study, teach-
ing methods and matters of administration,
the standard of judgment in design, and
traveling scholarships in the United States.
Professor Emil Lorch was re-elected vice-
president of the association.
An exhibit of student work was held
from each representative school, and also
some work from the American Academy
of Rome.
Architectural Society Dance
The annual Architectural Society dance
will he held early in the second semester
All architects are urged to join the society
and help boost the department. It needs
your support, architects, so lend a hand and
help make the society a success.
Architectural Society Notes
At a meeting of the Architectural Society
on Dec. 17, J. H. Pulemeier, '17A, was elect-
ed secretary to fill the vacancy left by W.
A. Bellores who has left school. At the
same meeting the plans of The Technic in
regard to developing a section of the
magazine devoted more especially to the
interests of the College of Architecture
were heartily commended, and the offer of
The Technic to give a year's subscription
to the members at the same rate as given
to the members of the Enginering society
was accepted. A motion was passed to give
the year's subscription for 25c with mem-
bership, the difference to be paid by the
society.
The addition of the Architectural sec-
tion in The Technic has made necessary
the following addition to the staff: Archi-
tectural Editor Alexander McColl, '16A,
Assistant Lynn Fry, '17A, and Artist J. D.
Kenyon, '17A. Due to difficulty in making
up the book, the new section cannot be
printed as a separate part, but articles,
news notes, etc. will be distributed under
the various headings of the book proper.
Alpha Rho Chi
Alpha Rho Ch, the National Architectur-
al fraternity held its annual convention at
Champagne, 111., Tan. 3. The charter for
a chapter at the University of Minnesota
was granted.
Spring Exhibit
Chairman John F. Clark has appointed
the committee to have charge of the bi-
annual Engineering Exhibit to be held
this spring. Plans for a larger and more
attractive Architectural exhibit are well
under way and announcement of sub com-
mittees to have charge of this part of the
exhibit will be made by Alexander McColl,
Architectural member of the committee,
fn the near future. A competition for the
cover design of the program will be held
and a substantial prize offered to the win-
ner. Those interested can see Gordon D.
Cooke, publicity manager, or the members
of the committee.
Thesis Published
The design for an observatory by Prof.
Robinson, as part of his work for his mas-
ter's degree, was published in the January
copy of the American Institute of Archi-
tects. The same journal has been publish-
ing the thesis of Prof. Kimball.
American Institute of Architects
The American Institute of Architects
has just announced the apointment of an
advisory committee on architectural edu-
cation and has appointed Prof. Lorch as a
member.
Ann Arbor Art Association
Mr. Makielski and Mr. Barnes, instruc-
tors in free hand drawing in the college of


7 HE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Architecture, have been elected as directors
of the Ann Arbor Art Association. These
two and Prof. Lorch are members of the
exhibit committee and are trying to secure
for exhibit here the collections of the Al-
bright Art Gallery of Buffalo. This is one

A Bit of News from Alaska.
November 16, 1915.
Dear Sir:
Your letter has just come to my notice
again and I am reminded of your request
for some Alaskan notes.
As opportunity for travel and observa-
tion is a natural coincidence with my work
here, I have been fortunate in this short
time to have seen much of 'outside" Alaska.
Of about eight thousand miles of travel
since last March, over half of it has been
within Alaskan boundaries, and, to be ac-
curate, none of it in the "interior." Inas-
much as the great interior of Alaska is
generally best known in the East because
most talked about, this season's travel has
been a revelation to me. I cannot begin,
of course, to relate within the limits of
a letter the almost endless items of inter-
est thus far encountered, but one or two
may not be amiss.
To begin with, the greater part of the
population and visible wealth of Alaska
is concentrated within the lower half of the
"panhandle", known as Southeastern Alas-
ka. It is sufficient, in fact, to make this
part of the Territory eligible for admission
to the Union as a state, and that possibility
has been discussed locally. The capital of
the Territory, Juneau, is situated in South-
eastern Alaska and is the center of popu-
lation and probably of wealth, too, for the
greatest gold mines in the world are lo-
cated within sight of Juneau. I speak of
the Treadwell, the Alaska-Juneau and the
Alaska-Gastineau mines.
The last-named, although its mill has
been in operation only since the spring of
this year, bids fair to eclipse anything else
in gold mining. I was fortunate enough
to be conducted through the entire mill end
of this mine, which is handling ten thou-
sand tons of ore daily, that being one-
quarter of its ultimate capacity. Ore is
already blocked out for one hundred years'
operation. Particularly interesting to the
civil engineer are the water power plants
of this company both constructed and pro-
jected. In the last Transactions (Vol.
LXXVIII) of the American Society of
icil Engineers you may read an illustrated
description of one of these, the Salmon
Creek dam, by its designer, L. R. Jorgensen,
in his paper on the Constant-Angle Arch
Dam. The crest of this dam is 168 feet
above the creek level.
But this is only one of a great many ac-
complishments in engineering construction
already completed in Alaska, omitting en-
tirely the achievements in mining engin-
eering. On page 47 of the above Trans-
actions, for example, is a photograph of
the well known switchback arch bridge
on the White Pass Railroad, which was
constructed one thousand miles from a


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
source of labor and with freight at $50 a
ton. Seven hundred miles west of that
is another great bridge, crossing the Copper"
River at the feet of the Miles and Childs
glaciers, the construction of which in-
spired Rex Beach's story of the Iron Trail.
In this connection, my visits this summer to
Katalla, a town near Controller Bay and
the nearest approach to Cape St. Elias,
were interesting among other reasons be-
cause the town is the terminal of the two
rival railroads about which the above story
was written. The fight at the crossing, an
per mine, known to produce the richest ore
mined. Don't be surprised at superlatives
—they are ordinary in this country.
I have not mentioned one of Alaska's
largest industries—that of fishing. With
the negligible exception of a few can-
neries in Cook Inlet and Prince William
Sound to the westward, this industry is
confined to Southeastern Alaska. There
are no less than twelve canneries (salmon)
operating out of Ketchikan alone, and there
are scores of them scattered through the
inlets of the southeastern islands from
Salmon Creek Dam
actual occurrence, was related to me by an
eye witness. These railroads were both
abandoned before completion when the Be-
ring coal fields were closed by the Govern-
ment.
Two hundred miles further west is the
terminal of the new Government railroad
at Seward, with which project you are of
course familiar. This will open the Ma-
tanuska coal fields and connect Fairbanks,
and, through her, the interior of Central
Alaska with the sea. A highway now con-
nects Fairbanks and Valdez with automo-
bile stage service, Valdez being a seaport
north of Cordova. On the Copper River &amp;
Northwestern Ry., to which belongs the
bridge above mentioned and which has
its terminal at Cordova, is the Bonanza cop-
Dixon's Entrance to Icy Straits and Sitka.
Add to these the cold storage plants which
pack the halibut as well as the salmon.
To give you an inkling of the size of this
industry, one cannery in Ketchikan this
season canned 160,000 cases of salmon,
four dozen cans to the case, and a cold
storage plant here had shipped one million
pounds of frozen halibut between April I
and August 1, at the time I was informed.
To can sixty thousand salmon in a single
day is an ordinary occurrence in the larger
canneries.
One of the first things noticeable to an
engineer coining into this territory is the
seemingly unlimited water power. There
is water power enough at Ketchikan to
operate the industries of a large city. Nat-


65
urally every town utilizes this power for
all its industrial and lighting requirements,
and as mentioned above, the great mines
use it exclusively. Power sites around
Juneau have become extremely valuable be-
cause of the great demand, and one site
to be opened by the Gastineau mine is
twenty-five miles air line from its mills.
and I could reach Ann Arbor from here
in half the time.
An impetus to the construction of aids to
navigation in these waters has been given
by the demands of shipping in the last
two years, and shipping in Alaska just now
is expanding at a remarkable rate. Much
has been done in that time but a great deal
v*#- rVJ

A word with reference to my own work
may be of interest. As Superintendent of
the Sixteenth Lighthouse District, my of-
fice is at Ketchikan, the first port of call
in Alaska and therefore nearest to the
markets of the States, and affording best
dockage facilities for the lighthouse ten-
ders. The latter operate the year around
as navigation never closes south of the Be-
ring Sea. The district comprises all the
coastal and river waters of Alaska, the en-
tire coast line according to the Coast and
Geodetic Survey being about 35,000 miles
in extent. The direct sailing courses, how-
ever, are extensive enough. The western-
most stations of the district are as far from
my office as is Ann Arbor from Seattle,
Cape St. Elias
remains to be accomplished. More can
hardly be said without going into detail
beyond the scope of a letter.
A great deal of sub-aqueous work is en-
countered, often complicated by the big
range of tides and swift tidal currents.
With the exception of the Bay of Fundy
the highest tides in the world are found
in Cook Inlet with a range as high as 52
feet.
One specific piece of work in the dis-
trict might be mentioned as typical of
modern practice. A light and fog signal
station for Cape St. Elias, for which Con-
gress appropriated $115,000 was designed


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
this season by the writer and the construc-
tion, which began June I, is well under way.
It is expected to have the station in opera-
tion by the fall of 1916. A number of un-
usual conditions had to be met. The sta-
tion is built on the face of a very steep
bluff, composed of loose shingle covered
with vegetable mold and spruce vegeta-
tion, at practically its angle of repose over
wet blue clay under which hardpan is
reached. Slides are contended with and
the design provides for holding this bluff.
A portion of the rear wall of the dwelling,
for instance, is a reinforced concrete re-
taining wall eighteen feet high and thirty-
four feet long. A similar wall backs the
storage building which provides storage
for some seven thousand gallons of oil
and distillate, fifteen thousand gallons of
water and thirty tons of coal. This struc-
ture and also the fog signal building and
the tower itself are of reinforced concrete
construction designed for their various re-
quirements and to resist earthquake shocks.
The auxiliary structures as the boathouse,
hoist houses (serving rail trams), and
shops are of cement brick, manufactured
at the site, on concrete foundations. No
wood enters into any of the construction
except the windows and doors of the dwell-
ing and auxiliary buildings. Steel sash
and doors and trusses are used in the other
structures, and all roofs are asbestos slates.
The superstructure of the tower is of iron
and bronze.
The mechanical equipment is the most
modern obtainable. A 55-mm. three-mantle
coal oil vapor lighting equipment will fur-
nish the illumination, showing from a re-
volving double flashing lens of the second
order. Oil will be pumped direct from
storage by a self-measuring pump. The
fog signal equipment consists of first class
air sirens in duplicate, emitting blasts from
double-mouthed trumpets automatically
controlled, operated by direct connected
gas engine driven air compressors, all
equipment in duplicate.
It might be added that not the least of
the difficulties encountered is the landing
of materials which has to be done on the
open beach from lighters, and understand
that this beach has nothing but the Pacific
ocean between it and Honolulu. Some 500
tons and nearly a thousand barrels of ce-
ment were handled this season.
In closing it may be of interest to
state that a Michigan man, H. L. Fuller,
1910E, made the surveys for this project
and acted as instrument man and time-
keeper on this season's construction. He
is now in my office. The foreman in charge
at the site was a practical engineer from
the west coast.
I hope I have not taxed your patience
with too long a "note", and trust it may
be of some slight interest.
With best wishes for your continued suc-
cess with The Technic, I remain
Very truly yours,
RALPH R. TINKHAM.

WELL KNOWN ENGINEER PASSES
AWAY
The field of Mechanical Engineering
sustained a great loss in the death of
Thomas F. McCrickett, long connected with
the Russel Wheel &amp; Foundry Company of
Detroit.
Mr. McCrickett spent his early days in
Bay City and was one of the first boy stu-
dents to graduate in 1888 from Father
Rafter's pioneer parochial high school, St.
James School in Bay City. After leaving
St. James School Mr. McCrickett taught
in a district school and spent some time at
Alma College. He entered the University ■
of Michigan and graduated in the engineer-
ing course in 1897.
After leaving the University he was as-
sociated with the Industrial Works at Bay
City; leaving there in 1898 and'becoming
associated with the Russel Wheel &amp; Foun-
dry Company as engineer, which position he
held until his death.
Mr. McCrickett's ability as an engineer
found expression in the structural line in
many of the large buildings in Detroit and
throughout the state; among them are
the Wayne Pavilion, the Port Huron Audi-
torium and many large office and factory
buildings. The designing and arrangement
of the new University of Detroit was one
of the last of Mr. McCrickett's works. He
also acted in an advisory capacity to the
school.

Frank W. Steere has been awarded the
"Beal Gold Model" by the American Gas
Institute, the national association of the
country's foremost gas engineers. As chief
engineer of the Steere Engineering Co. of
Detroit, he has developed a high voltage
electrical process for removing tar and
other objectionable substances from all
kinds of manufactured gas, with the re-
sult that the investment of large sums of
money, for cleaning apparatus, by gas com-
panies and factories using their own gas,
is greatly reduced. His paper describing
the process, was read before an annual
meeting of the Gas Institute about a year
ago and created profound interest among
American and foreign engineers and the
award of the "Beal Gold Medal" was based
on the merits of this paper. The early
development of the process was worked
out at the Detroit plant of the Semet-
Solvay Co. in co-operation with Mr. W. S.
Blativett. A plant, for de-tarring producer
gas, which has now been in continuous
and successful operation for over a year
at the Ford Motor Co., has demonstrated
the value of the process. Mr. Steere is a
member of the Detroit Engineering Society
and the American Gas Institute and was

The first reunion of the Class of '14E
will be held at Ann Arbor during com-
mencement week next June. Preparations
for a big celebration are already under
way and indications point to a real "pep"
session. The alumni secretary recently
mailed a letter to each of the class whose
address could be obtained. If there are any
who did not receive this letter, or if infor-

SOUP AND FISH.
There is subtlety sticking out all over it.
Oscar Sazezniewski.
How do you keep your hands so, soft?
I wear my gloves to bed.
Do you wear your hat too?
Oh! I love every corner of your head.
Our stenographer laughed at that. She
and I went to different schools together.
There was a young lady named Maud
She was quite a society fraud
She was haughty and cold in society I
am told,
But in the back parlor, Oh Gawd!!
Hold the door open I'm coming in a
hurry.
Did you see that good looking co-ed? She
smiled at me.
That's nothing, I nearly laughed my
head off when I first saw you.
THE FABLE OF THE BIRTHDAY
PARTY THAT FOOZLED.
After Geo. Adc—A Long Way After.
Once upon a time there was a wise
young Student in the Engineering College.
At the place where he dwelt while sojourn-
ing in our midst, there was a landlady
who had a Fairly good looking young
Thing for a Datter. The gay young Study-
ent was wont to Con-fer mushy glances
upon the aforesaid Datter and also Curry
favor with the Mater. It so happened in
the course of Human events that the land-
lady had a Birthday and in keeping with
his Usual good will he remarked to him-
self—"Ah, I have it. I shall give her a
birthday Gift." And he did beset himself
Unto the Task—and, lo and likewise Be-
hold—forth from the Imaginings of his
Fertile mind leaped the Idea to bestow
upon the Genial hostess of the Year a box
of choicest confections of the Far east.
And it so happened that when the Fair
young thing did cast her Wondrous and
beautiful lamps upon the choice jaw-
strengtheners, she did Cogitate deep in
the workings of her Thunk-box. And she
said—"Lo and behold—I am young and
Fair. Why not cast similar bait before the
Simple young student who is engaged in
working his way through this joint and


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
have one of my tri-yearly birthdays?" And
she did Pounce upon the Plan for it did
Seem good.
And it came to pass, that When the prop-
er gang was Gathered about, she Deftly
"hid a yawn behind her tapering Bread-
hooks, and announced to the Poor fish
whose duty it is to Bite that she was proud
to announce that the World had borne
with her to the Extent of Nineteen sum-
mers and a like Number of winters. At
this the Fish did titter a fishly Titter, and Bit!
He counted the Jingle in his jeans, and
found that he was among those on the
Earth that are blessed with the filthy Lucre,
and lo, his heart was light, gladly he
tripped the way to the Place where cigars
are Dispensed—for is it Not told in the
Law of the Medes and the Hessians that
cigars are one of the Necessary adjuncts
to a Successful celebration? But to his dis-
may, the Jingle did not cover the Matches
that are cunningly and Customarily placed
at the end of the cigars Aforesaid. So, not
wishing to Crab the Celebration, he did the
Best that his Lovable heart could produce,
and a cigar Box enhanced the proceedings.
And he did Bethunk himself of former
like and Similar occasions, and Remem-
bered the time that he used to Lick the
cake from his fingers and vest for the
Week following a birthday Flop. So he
pushed his Unwilling limbs (slang for 'legs')
to the Baker's shop—and though the Spirit
was willing the Kale was weak. But the
Smell of the shop was goodly—and his
Nostrils quavered at the Pleasure of the
whiff. And in the Process of licking his
Chops, he requested the Portly frau be-
hind the walnut to present to him a cer-
tain amount of the Frosting that formerly
clung so Sweetly and tenaciously to his
Upper nibbles. She, having a heart for all
Mankind and a true Love for the inhabi-
tants of this sad and silly Earth, daubed
a generous amount of the sticky Stuff on
our hero's segar Box. And he, by placing
his Last shirt at the mercy of the Pawn-
broked, finally procured enough of the
Customary glims, and the pleasing and
open-hearted surprise was Complete. For
had he not a consummate birthday Cake?
And it was the Evening of the Sixth
day. The heroine of the grasping and ten-
acious Disposition had spent the day Lick-
ing her pearly chops, and Con-gratulating
herself on the Cleverness of the Female
of the Species. She sharpened the Knife
and her Molars, and the Wondering Gang
had gathered around to Cast their envious
eyes on it, and their Eye-teeth in it. She
smiled Broadly, gave a ghastly Slash with
the Knife—and Pandemonium reigned. Our
heroine turned Blue at the gills—she
Frothed at the mouth, and her tongue
hung Out. For she seemed to Lack pene-
tration. And the bells rang, and the Crowd
huzahed, and the Acclaim of the Populace
was wonderful to Behold. At which the
fair creature Retreated to her lair in deep
and Dismal dismay.
Moral: Don't think that all fish are Suck-
ers. Some are swordfish. and that is where
some people get stuck.

THE MYSTIC ISLAND
James N. Hatch.
The Mystic Island, strange to say.
Is an island in the air;
Beyond the clouds, beyond the smoke,
Away off over there.
I took a transmigration trip
The other day to see
This wondrous place where everything
Is a strange anomaly.
But what I saw was far more strange
Than dreamt in wildest dreams;
Where science grows like vegetables,
And genius runs in streams.
Where sines and tangents and mean squares
Grow on the leaves of trees;
And Engineering formulae
Are sung in every breeze.
I found such birds and animals,
And toads and fishes too,
As Father Noah's enclosed ark
Ne'er harbored in its zoo.
And all the vegetation was
As queer as queer could be,
A weird and strange example
Of Unnatural History.
I found the fields all series wound,
And all the rows of maize
Were run in parallel upon
A grounded single phase.
I also found the railway plant
On which spring switches grow,
And standard frogs croaked in the marsh
Where flags were all in blow.
And in the swamps lived traveling cranes,
And fish with platform scales;

While from the rushes started forth,
Whole flocks of ten pound rails.
And there were currents in the brush,
And bulbs beside the walks;

And clinch-ears grew on stalks.
And bonds were floated in the streams,
And watered stock stood near,
And bulls in calculation there
r All ready to appear.
And in the fertile meadow land,
In dazzling splendor grew
A host of large electric plants,
Ablaze with sparkling dew.
Upon these plants the flowers and fruits
Were varied and unique;
A galaxy of new ideas,
Such as inventors seek.
The newest things that we now use
In power and light device,
Lay on the ground beneath these plants
Like antique artifice.

In varied embrvo.
I wish that I could tell you
Of the people of this place;
But language fails in all attempt
To picture such a race.

Or hear a human sound;
Nor did I find a dwelling place
In all my journey round.
But evidence on every hand,
Made it quite plain to me
That mental power of mighty force
Was working constantly.
Results displayed left not a doubt
Of the action of this force,
But human sense perception
Revealed no primal source.
Whate'er these people's form or shape.
Or how or where they dwell,
I could not see or even guess;

Grew thick on every hand.

Why Fatimas are a
Sensible Cigarette
What makes
rette sensible?
a ciga-
It must be delicious to
your taste, of course.
But the fact that Fatimas
please the taste of most
men—they outsell any
other cigarette costing
over 5c—doesn't.by itself,
make Fatimas sensible.
Fatimas are a sensible
cigarette because they
also give you cigarette
comfort.
They are coo7. That
means comfort to the
throat and tongue. And
better yet, they never
make you "feel mean."
The mild Turkish blend
of all pure tobaccos in
Fatimas takes care of
that.
Stick to Fatimas and
you'll discover at the end
of every long-smoking
day just what cigarette
comfort means.
And you'll realize that
you've found the one
cigarette you'll want to
stand by — a sensible
cigarette.

ING ACTIVITY
BY H. E. RIGGS
During the past six or seven years
we have heard a great deal about val-
uation. Many of the older engineers
cf the country now appear in various
directories as "Valuation Engineers."
Nearly every railroad in the United
States has an official bearing that title.
It is almost impossible to pick up an
engineering paper, or a publication of
any of the engineering societies, with-
out finding extended articles upon
some phase of the subject. The writer
has been requested to prepare in a
few pages a brief outline of the sub-
ject: a rather difficult commission by
reason of the fact that, within the past
few years, volumes have been written
and volumes are now being written,
not only treating the subject as a
whole, but volumes bearing upon the
special problems involved.
The history of valuation practice is
comparatively easy to write. Prior to
the year 1900 there had been a few
engineering estimates of the value of
water works and other municipal util-
ities, made in connection with the pur-
chase of such properties by municipal-
ities and a few of the railroads of
Texas had been appraised under the
provisions of the law of 1893 giving
the railroad commission of that state
authority to pass upon and approve
stock and bond issues.
The 1900 valuation
In 1000 the Legislature of the State
of Michigan requested the tax com-
mission of this state to secure infor-
mation as to the properties of railroad
and other specific tax paying utilities
with a view to determining whether or
not it was advisable to go from the
specific to the ad valorem basis. In
compliance with this request Profes-
sor Mortimer E. Cooley was directed
to report on the physical value of all
specific tax paying properties in the
State of Michigan. This valuation,
which has been known as "the 1900
valuation," and the "Cooley appraisal''
of railroads, was completed, reported
to the Governor and legislature, and
resulted in the adoption of the ad val-
orem basis of taxation.
The 1900 valuation is notable as
having been the first valuation in
which the theory of cost of reproduc-
tion was adopted. It was the first val-
uation in which extended studies were
made on the subject of depreciation
and was the first large valuation in
which depreciation was deducted in
order to arrive at present value or
what might more properly be termed
remaining investment in physical prop-
erty. It was also notable as being the
first valuation in which a study was
made of land purchases and the rela-
tion of such purchases to general val-
ues for other uses, and it was the first
valuation to give full expression to
what has come to he known as the
subject of overhead charges. In oth-
er words, this pioneer state-wide val-
uation was along lines of the most
modern practice today and established
a large number of principles which
have since been approved by the vari-
ous courts including the Supreme
Court of the United States and by


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
various Commissions. Following the
1900 Michigan valuation in rapid suc-
cession, came similar state-wide valua-
tions in Wisconsin, Minnesota, South
Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, California,
Xew Jersey and then the federal val-
uation of railroads.
Public Service Properties
Valuation of property has come as a
natural step in the process of regula-
tion of public service properties.
Without going into any discussion of
the court decisions bearing upon the
subject of regulation, it may be said
that there has been recognized for
many hundreds of years a distinction
between public callings and private
callings. Occupations which are of
a public nature and which render a
public service have been subject to
regulation by the state from mediaeval
times. During the early years of the
history of railroads and other utilities
in the United States, there was little
or no regulation, but between 1870
and 1900 some of the states passed
laws for the regulation of utility prop-
erties and created railroad commis-
sions. By the latter part of the cen-
tury, there were many such commis-
sions and, in 1887, the Interstate Com-
merce Commission was created. The
powers of this Commission have been
increased from time to time until now
it is by far the most powerful regula-
tory body in the United States.
The regulation of utilities involves
not only the control of the operation
of the properties but it also involves
the authorization of issues of stock
and bonds, the regulation of rates, and
many other functions beyond the mere
control of the manner of operation.
In connection with regulation, it will
readily be seen that a knowledge of
the amount of monev actuallv invest-
ed in the property is very important,
and it is the determination of that
amount that has come to be known as
valuation.
\ aluation is demanded in connec-
tion with capitalization in order to as-
certain the present worth of property
owned, and its value as a security for
the proposed issue of stock or bonds.
It is also necessary in connection with
taxation to determine the amount of
property which should be put upon the
tax rolls and it is, finally, of major im-
portance whenever a question of regu-
lation of rates is involved.
Allowable Earnings
It has been held by the Supreme
Court that all public utility property is
private property used in a public ser-
vice, that the rates which a public util-
ity may charge for its services must be
reasonable and not in excess of the
value of the service rendered, but that
the company is entitled to earn a fair
return upon the value of the property
which it uses in the public service. Be-
fore considering this fair return, how-
ever, the company is entitled to earn
all of its operating expenses, its taxes,
and a sufficient sum of money to
maintain the integrity of its invest-
ment, or as the court has expressed
it in one case, "to keep the investment
as it was in the beginning." All of
the public valuations, which have been
made, have been made in response to
one of these three demands.
Value
In starting to read any discussion
of the subject the student will find
himself very much confused by the
numerous uses of the word "value."'
Primarily this word means the worth
in money of a given article at a given
time. The word value has been ap-


79
plied to the physical property of rail-
road and other corporations, for ex-
ample, the term "reproduction value"
or "present value" have been used
where as a matter of fact these things
are not value at all. The reproduction
estimate is an engineer's estimate of
what it would cost to build a new
property identically like the existing
property, and the term present value
has been applied to this reproduction
estimate less the depreciation that has
occurred in the property. It will be
readily seen that a property may have
a value far in excess of the amount of
money that has been invested in build-
ing the physical plant, or far below
that investment, depending upon
whether the property is earning a very
large return or very small one. It is
therefore necessary in any discussion
of the subject to get thoroughly in
mind the various distinctions of the
word value, and it is far preferable
to avoid the use of the word so far as
practicable in any sense except that of
either market or sale value, or value
'based on earning power.
Present Worth
The problem of valuation is to de-
termine the present worth of the phys-
ical property of a company. That at
least is the province of the work of
the engineer. Some years ago in the
decision of the Nebraska Rate Case
(Smyth vs. Ames) the Supreme Court
indicated a number of measures of
value which might be considered,
among them were the original cost of
the property, the original cost plus all
additions to the property, and cost of
a new property as compared with the
original, the market value of the
stocks and bonds, and various other
considerations.
It may properly be asked why, in
determining the amount of investment
in a property, does one not go direct
to the books? The answer is that no
such determination can be had in the
case of old properties. In case of new
properties, built within five or ten
years, it may be perfectly possible to
determine from the books the actual
amount of investment in property and,
where this amount can be determined,
it is doubtless the most reliable meas-
ure of present investment. In the case
of the old properties, however, this is
impossible because uniform methods
of accounting are of very recent intro-
duction and the old methods were not
such as to furnish the desired infor-
mation. Prior to 1907, the railroads
of the United States had no uniform
system of accounts. Between 1895
and 1907 much valuable work was
done in the way of a study of account-
ing methods, and a large number of
the carriers adopted methods that
were more or less standard. But such
methods were not in general use
among the railroads, and among oth-
er utilities uniform systems of ac-
counting are of very recent develop-
ment. During the first sixty-five or
seventy years of railroad building in
the United States, but little attention
was paid to detailed records of costs.
The accounts dealt with general fig-
ures, not detailed figures. The item-
ized records of costs of individual
structures were esteemed of but little
value to the owners of the properties,
and further, most of the large prop-
erties have been formed by a consol-
idation of many different companies.
For example, the Pere Marquette
Railroad in Michigan, as it now exists,
was built by forty-two different com-
panies, some of the properties chang-
ed hands a number of times, some of


THE MICHIGAN TBCHNIC
them were bought at one time or an-
other under foreclosure sale, records
were either not kept or were lost and,
when the recent valuation was made,
it was found to be absolutely impossi-
ble to determine the original cost of
over twenty per cent of the total mile-
age of the road. What is true of rail-
roads is equally true of old water
works, gas, electric light and other
utilities, so that, in the case of a large
majority of properties in the country,
it is necessary to use some other yard
stick than that of original cost, or of
original cost brought down to date.
Hence the necessity for the theory of
reproduction developed by Frofessor
Cooley.
Theory of Reproduction
In brief that theory may be stated
as follows. If a careful inventory is
made of all the property owned by a
utility, a careful examination made of
every piece of that property and an
estimate made of what it would cost
to reproduce an exactly similar prop-
erty at the present time under present
day conditions as to cost of material,
cost of labor and methods of doing
work, will we not have a figure that
may be fairly representative of the
worth of a new exactly similar invest-
ment? If we then determine how
much that property has deteriorated,
what value has been lost by reason of
the failure to maintain all of the parts
to the highest standard of condition,
have we not secured a figure that may
be accepted as the present worth of
the property?
Engineers, commissions and courts
have recognized that this is a fair and
reasonable measure and have accepted
it as the best measure in many cases.
Of course, much depends upon the
theory of reproduction that is adopt-
ed, and in some instances theories have
been formulated for the express pur-
pose of securing a high value, or a low
value, which are not capable of stand-
ing the tests of common sense. With-
out going into a discussion of any of
these theories, the writer would state
it as his opinion that, upon the adop-
tion of a rational theory of reproduc-
tion, this does constitute a proper and
accurate measure of the present worth
of the physical plant.
In some of the valuations that have
been made in the past five years in
Michigan, and in other states, using
the cost of reproduction in the case of
properties where it was found possible
to determine original cost, it has been
found that the two figures agreed
within one or two per cent. In 1900
two entirely independent estimates
were made of the cost of reproduction
of the Chicago and Northwestern
Railway: one under the direction of
Professor Cooley, the other under the
direction of the chief engineer of the
railroad; both entirely independent.
The results were within i}4 per cent.
These figures go to show that when a
reproduction estimate is carefully
made by experienced men, accurate
results can be had.
Problems op Valuation
Unit Prices
Among the difficult problems of
valuation may be mentioned the de-
termination of unit prices, the deter-
mination of proper overhead charges,
depreciation, and the determination of
going value or the cost of develop-
ment. Very briefly these problems
may be stated thus: . No matter how
accurate the inventory and field in-
spection may be, if a wrong unit price
is applied the result will be in error.
Engineers have often taken the price


Sr
paid a contractor for some particular
piece of work as a reasonable unit
price, and have lost sight entirely of
the fact that the company has expend-
ed money in advance of the arrival of
the contractor on the work, has paid
for transportation of materials, tools
and men of the contractor, and has
often done much work after the con-
tractor has completed his work and
left the job, all of which costs are part
of the cost of the unit under consider-
ation, and which costs when added to
the contract price may increase the
contract price from ten to twenty-five
per cent. In the same way unit prices
may be fixed too high by the applica-
tion of a price which would be per-
fectly correct in one locality but al-
together wrong in another. As stated
before, the old accounts fail to disclose
all the information that ought to be
had on the suhject of unit costs, and
many of the old appraisals were more
seriously in error in this regard than
in any other respect.
Overhead Cii.vrges
Overhead charges represent the cost
of doing necessary' work, which is in-
separable from the construction of any
property, but which, on the completion
of the property, is not represented by
any physical thing that can be weigh-
ed and measured. No large utility
was ever built without incurring large
expenditures for engineering services,
general administrative and clerical ex-
penses, interest during construction or
the loss of interest on money which is
idle during the period that the utility
is being built, insurance, loss and dam-
age, and other like expenditures, many
of which are of a contingent nature,
which are not capable of being esti-
mated on the same basis that one
would estimate the investment in a
mile of rail or in the piers and abut-
ments and superstructure of a large
bridge. The usual method that has
been adopted, has been to determine
the actual costs of such work on as
many properties as possible, and de-
termine a reasonable percentage of the
cost of chargeable physical property.
Much is yet to be done before all of
these charges can be finally and fully
supported in every case, but it is clear
that every property has some such ex-
pense: an expense that varies greatly,
depending upon the. nature of the
property, the territory in which it is
located and the special difficulties
which have to be overcome in its con-
struction.'
Depreciation
Depreciation in its primary sense is-
loss of value. This word, like the
word value, has come to have several
different meanings or different appli-
cations and is a very elusive term. In
connection with valuation work depre-
ciation may be defined as that loss of
value which takes place in a property
over and beyond what can be put back
into the projjerty by means of main-
tenance, repairs and renewals of parts.
To illustrate: A modern office build-
ing is built in a large city. It may be
maintained in the best of condition,
its plumbing and wood work and tile
floors renewed whenever they are
worn, and so far as its efficiency when
compared with its efficiency when new
is concerned, it may be said to be of
nearly full value. Experience tells us.
however, that the type of such build-
ings changes every few years, that
business centers in a large city move,
and almost inevitably it will be found
that, at the end of 25 or 30 years, the
class of tenants in our building has
undergone a complete change: they
are less desirable, the building itself


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
is out of date or not in the center of
business, and ultimately it has to be
devoted to other uses or torn down
and replaced by something else. Ev-
ery year, therefore, during the life of
that building, it lost part of its value,
.and that part could not possibly be
replaced by any amount of repairs or
renewals. In the same way a full-
man car or a locomotive may be kept
in the highest operating condition but
ultimately the change of style of the
car, or the change in the quality of
service that has to be rendered by the
locomotive compels its abandonment.
The Supreme Court of the United
States in the Knoxville Waterworks
Case holds that such depreciation as
amounts to loss of value must be de-
ducted. It also holds in the same case
that the owner of the property is not
bound to see his property waste but
must set aside annually enough money
to make good the loss in value. This
case decided in January, 1909, and
others subsequently decided, have giv-
en increased consideration to depre-
ciation, and it is generally recognized
today that it is the duty of a utility
to provide annually for the deprecia-
tion that occurs during that year. This
provision is made by expending on the
property, in the form of renewals, a
sum of money equivalent to the total
depreciation of the year, as is done by
the railroads in the case of railroad
track, or by a charge to operating ex-
pense of a sum of money which is
placed in reserve to take care of de-
preciation and to replace the various
long lived parts of the property when
they come to the end of their lives.
Among the most complicated prob-
lems of the valuation engineer are
those connected with the determina-
tion of depreciation. Economists, ac-
countants and engineers are discuss-
ing the subject from all angles and
there are wide differences of opinion
as to proper methods. It would be im-
possible in the scope of any such arti-
cle as this one to fully discuss the sub-
ject. Suffice it to say that deprecia-
tion does take place in everything,
that it is the duty of the owner of a
utility to provide against it by secur-
ing a sum of money each year, in some
proper form or other, to offset the de-
preciation of that year and it is the
duty of the engineer in valuation to
determine how much, if any, deprecia-
tion has actually occurred in the prop-
erty under investigation which should
be deducted to give present worth of
the investment.
Intangible Values
There are other elements of value
than those pertaining to the physical
property. These have been termed
variously, "intangible value," "going
value," "development charges," and
numerous other names. These refer
to two classes of value as follows:
First, those costs which are not con-
nected with the creation of the physi-
cal property itself but which are in-
curred in connection with the building
up of the business. It would seem
clear that every successful property
not only has to create its plant but it
also has to create its business. Both
involve the investment of capital. The
determination of the amount of cap-
ital invested in creating the business
is more difficult than the estimate of
the amount invested in the physical
plant. The second class of values are
those which come by reason of the
earning capacity of the property it-
self. In other words, it is the figure
which should be determined and add-
ed to or deducted from the investment
in physical property to determine the


»3
real or market value of the property.
Such determinations o|f value have
been made in this state quite exten-
sively by Professors Henry C. Adams
and David Friday of the department
of Economics.
The Federal Valuation
The extent of the valuation work
that has been going on during the
past few years is very great, and it
has caused a great change in the re-
lations of engineers to the manage-
ments of utilities, bringing them into
much closer touch with the law and
accounting organizations and giving
them a major part in the solution of
economic questions affecting all the
utilities. The federal valuation is by
far the largest single undertaking of
the kind that has ever been com-
menced. This work is under the di-
rection of Hon. Chas. A. Prouty of
Vermont, former member of the In-
terstate Commerce Commission. The
engineering work is under the control
of a board of five engineers, each of
whom has charge of a large district
extending from north to south across
the country, with headquarters in
Washington, Chattanooga, Chicago,
Kansas City and San Francisco. Each
division office has a large staff of men
employed, and on each division are a
number of field parties, of eleven or
twelve men each, each of which has
as headquarters a rebuilt Pullman car
which is moved over the line under
investigation. Tt is estimated that it
will take five to six years at least tc
complete the field work, and that
many millions of dollars will be ex-
pended by the government and the
railroads before the work is complet-
ed. Each railroad has its own valua-
tion organization which is fully as ex-
tensive as that of the government
force assigned to it, so that several
thousand men arc now engaged, di-
rectly and indirectly on this work.
In addition to the federal work,
there is a larger volume of general
valuation practice than ever before.
Appraisals are being made by the
states on all kinds of utilities, apprais-
als are necessary in connection with
the various rate cases now pending in
the preparation of the cases of the
companies, and in addition to these
there is as large an amount of valua-
tion for purchase as ever. This work
has been especially fortunate for en-
gineers, as general construction has
been slack, and this new activity has
resulted in a very marked shifting of
positions and bettering of conditions
on the part of many men.
The Object of Valuation
It may be asked, What good does
this work do? Wherein does it bene-
fit either corporations or people? It
is a part and a very important part of
the general economic reorganization
that is going on. The adoption of un-
iform systems of accounting by all
classes of corporations, investigations
as to the value, or rather the amount
of investment in property, the studies
as to taxation of corporations and as
to fair rates for public service, are
all part and parcel of the getting to-
gether of the utilities which serve the
people, and the people who either de-
pend on the utility for service or who
look to the securities of the utility as
a proper and safe field for investment.
There is a middle ground on which
all may find a common interest and
where all may find justice. It is that
middle ground that we seek, where
the utility may be permitted to main-
tain its investment and secure a suit-
able return on that investment, where


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
the small investor in securities may be
safeguarded in his corporate invest-
ments and where the consumer may
secure services at a reasonable cost.
The cost of the investment, as dis-
closed by valuation, and publicity and
uniformity of accounts, as shown by
the annual reports to the various con-
trolling commissions, will go far to-
ward giving all of us as citizens a bet-
ter understanding of the great cor-
porate problems that confront us.
There have been evils committed in
the past, evils of management, of fi-
nancing and of wildcat promoting.
There have been wicked acts of piracy
■committed in the name of finance but
the state and government commissions
have clone much to eliminate these old
•evils. There have been equally wick-
ed acts of oppression under the name
of regulation, and there has been po-
litical capital made out of the corpor-
ation issue. The citizens of the coun-
try must settle this problem of the re-
lation of the utility to the public it
serves, and the work of valuation is
one of the large tasks that is now be-
ing undertaken which will materially
help to a better understanding.
Opportunities in Valuation Work
A good many students in the uni-
versity have asked the question wheth-
er they were justified in looking to
this work as a life work. The answer
is NO. No young man can afford to
accept a position in valuation work
except as a temporary hold-over until
something better develops. The work
of valuation is essentially the work of
experienced engineers. Young men
are employed as assistants in the field,
as computers in the office, as drafts-
men and as stenographers, but the
large work of actually fixing unit
prices, determining depreciation, and
of disposing of the economic question-
that constitute the real valuation can
only be done by men with years of ex-
perience in construction and opera-
tion. No young man can afford to
spend his time on such of this work
as is open to him and neglect the op-
portunity to gain experience in con-
struction and operation. One job
makes of him a clerk and an underling
probably for life, the other job lays
the foundation for a useful life as a
professional engineer, or as a mana-
ger of a great utility. The great
thing in engineering is the knowledge
that one is creating wealth, building
great works where nothing of value
existed, serving mankind in a creative
way. Valuation offers no such oppor-
tunitv to the men now in college.


BY WM. H. HOBBS
The University and the State of
Michigan, not to speak of the country
as a whole, have been profoundly
moved in the passing of their great
figure—the President-Emeritus of the
University. It seems to be generally
accepted that the true measure of a
man is character rather than a sur-
passing brilliancy of intellect if unac-
companied by this high moral quality.
The personality of President Angell
was something ennobling, and went
out like a grateful benediction to all
within his sphere of influence. About
it there was nothing cold or formal,
but a wealth of geniality and humor
which radiated from him like flashes
of sunshine. The stooped figure which
until quite recently moved morning
and afternoon with halting gait along
the campus walks, is one that will be
keenly missed by the entire com-
munity.
James Burrill Angell was born in
Scituatc, R. I., January 17, 1829. Af-
ter preparing for college at the Uni-
versity Grammar School in Provi-
dence, he entered Brown University
and was graduated with the highest
honors in 1849. After a year of work
in the library, he undertook with one
companion an extended horseback
trip through the southern states, main-
ly for the purpose of regaining his
health, which had become seriously
impaired. His ambition had been to
enter the ministry, but the affection
of his throat continued obstinate and
he accepted instead a position as civil
engineer in the office of the city engi-
neer of Boston. In the early fifties of
the hst century engineering training
bore but little resemblance to that of
the present day, but it is interesting
to remember that young Angell un-
dertook the preparation of an elabor-
ate map of the Boston Common with
all paths and trees represented. The
greater part of his work, however,
had to do with the Cochituate Water
Supply of the city. He was the only
member of the staff who had any
knowledge of calculus, most engineers
of the time having begun as rodinen
and having acquired rule of thumb
methods in practice, with but little
conception of their meaning. In his
autobiography Dr. Angell says, "As
one recalls how slender were the op-
portunities in those days for training
studies and observes the large number
of excellent engineering schools in our
country, one may say that in no
branch of education has there been
more rapid or more helpful develop-
ment than in that of engineering in
all its applications."
In his capacity of engineer, Mr.
Angell assisted in preparing an im-
mense map to be stretched in a tent
erected on Boston Common in connec-
tion with the celebration of the open-
ing of the Grand Trunk Railroad
from Montreal to Boston. While en-
gaged in preparing his map of the
Common, the work was interrupted by
the unexpected opportunity for Euro-
pean study and travel, which he de-
cided to avail himself of. With his
companion of the southern horseback
journey, Mr. Hazard, he now visited
Europe and enjoyed opportunities for
studv in the different countries.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
While in Vienna Mr. Angell receiv-
ed a letter from President Weyland
of Brown University, offering him as
he might prefer, either the Chair of
Civil Engineering or that of Modern
Languages and Literatures in his Al-
ma Mater. It was the last mentioned
Chair which he decided to accept, and
with it ended his brief career as an
engineer, though he always retained
a lively interest in engineering sub-
jects.
Under him as professor and friend
were a number of men who have since
distinguished themselves, notably
Richard Olney and John Hay, both of
whom became Secretary of State of
the United States. Hay's biographer
says, "Professor James B. Angell,—
subsequently, President of the Uni-
versity of Michigan, — both stirred
Hay's enthusiasm and recognized his
ability. They read together several
of the great German and French mas-
terpieces, and Hay proved the best
translator Dr. Angell ever had in his
classes."'
Two years after entering upon his
professorship, Mr. Angell married
.Sarah Swoope Caswell, daughter of
Professor Alexis Caswell, D.D., who
afterwards became President of
Brown University. Mrs. Angell was
a woman of great force of character,
and an ideal helpmate to Mr. Angell,
and it is after her that Sarah Caswell
Angell Hall has been named.
They had three children: former
Judge Alexis C. Angell, of Detroit;
Professor James R. Angell, of the Un-
iversity of Chicago; and Lois Thomp-
son McLaughlin, wife of Professor
Andrew C. McLaughlin, of the Uni-
versity of Chicago.
From the plan to enter the ministry
Mr. Angell had been forced by circum-
stances to turn his attention first to-
ward civil engineering, and later to-
ward the teaching of modern lan-
guages. In i860 another complete
change in his career occurred when he
resigned his professorship to accept
the position of editor of the Prozn-
dence Journal, a strong abolition
newspaper, which he ably edited
throughout the period of the Civil
War, but resigned in 1866 to accept
the presidency of the University of
Vermont. Except for two interrup-
tions to undertake important diplo-
matic missions, this field of university
education was to absorb all his atten-
tion until, burdened with years, he re-
tired from active service in 1909 as
President-Emeritus of the University
of Michigan.
Of his editorial career Dr. Angell
wrote, "My experience of newspaper
life has been of great service to me in
all my subsequent career. Editorial
work trains one to both readiness and
accuracy in writing . . . One who has
a responsible charge in the conduct of
a newspaper has large opportunities
to understand men and to test his
courage in standing by what is right
and conducive to the public good, es-
pecially when in his opinions he dif-
fers from some of his friends."
In 1871 Dr. Angell having already
once declined a call to the Presidency
of the University of Michigan, was on
further solicitation induced to accept,
thus entering upon the service which
continued, with two short interrup-
tions, for no less than thirty-eight
years. During this period the Univer-
sity grew from a small institution of
1,110 students, thirty-five instructors
and three departments, to one of the
largest and most influential in the
country with between five and six
thousand students and seven separate
departments. There was introduced
during this period the diploma system1


87
of admission to the university from
secondary schools, the mill tax pro-
vision for supporting the university, a
system of unusual freedom of election
of studies, and graduate and summer
schools. Several of these policies
were adopted by other state universi-
ties. The Schools of Dental Surgery
and of Pharmacy were organized, the
medical courses were greatly strength-
ened and extended, and the medical
hospitals were founded.
His notable success in moulding the
future of the University of Michigan,
and through its example other uni-
versities as well, President Angell as-
cribed chiefly to two policies which
he maintained throughout. His aim
was to make the people feel that they
were in a sense stockholders in the in-
stitution, and to make all secondary
schools and their teachers regard
themselves as parts of one system of
state education culminating in the uni-
versity.
Among honors which came to Presi-
dent Angell may be mentioned the
honorary degree of Doctor of Laws
conferred in turn by Brown Univer-
sity, Columbia University, Rutgers
College, Princeton University, Yale
University, Johns Hopkins University
and the University of Wisconsin.
President Angell's career in the diplo-
matic service included his appointment
as United States Minister to China in
18S0-81, and as United States Minister
to Turkey in 1807-98. In 1887 he
was appointed a member of The Inter-
national Commission on Canadian
Fisheries, and in 1896 he was made
the chairman of the Canadian-Ameri-
can Commission on Deep Waterways
from the Lakes to the Sea, a commis-
sion consisting largely of prominent
civil engineers. He was long one of
tic trustees of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution in Washington. A brilliant
conversationalist, his genial person-
ality attracted to him distinguished
men in all walks of life, and many
were the appeals to him for his wise
counsel. In this capacity of counsellor
he was largely instrumental in mould-
ing the destinies of two important
eastern universities through a happy
selection of their presidents,—Welles-
ley College in the choice of Alice
Freeman, and the Johns Hopkins Uni-
versity, which by the wise policy of
President Daniel Coit Gilman intro-
duced a new and much needed element
into American university training.
Among the qualities which Presi-
dent Angell possesed in quite unusual
degree, was the gift of public speak-
ing. Despite a voice which was never
strong, and a manner of speech which
borrowed little from oratory, his well
chosen words and his strong personal
magnetism rendered his speeches won-
derfully impressive. Few men have
in so high a measure had the wisdom
to say just the right word at the right
time and never a word too much. The
writer well recalls a banquet at a
southern university where a long
program of speeches proved dull and
apparently almost interminable. The
banqueters were tired out when at 1 130
A. M. the venerable President Angell
was called upon to respond to a toast.
Through cleverly recalling an incident
of his horseback journey which sup-
plied a bit of local color, he soon had
everyone awake and made a speech
which brought a veritable storm of ap-
plause.
The thousands of students who
came under the influence of President
Angell, and in whom he had a strong
personal interest, are now scattered to
the four corners of the earth carrying
with them the legacy of a noble ex-
ample of the Christian scholar and

The following is a part of a lecture delivered recently before the Cercle
Prancais for the translation of which we arc indebted to the kindness of Pro-
fessor W. A. McLaughlin.
The beginnings of the Ecole des
Beaux Arts go back to the time of
Louis XIV. At that time there was
nothing methodical about the training
of young architects. The master had
a few pupils working under his orders
and this work formed their entire pro-
fessional training. Although very
limited this private education had how-
ever certain advantages, especially at
a period when the architects' problems
involved very simple solutions, for the
seigneur, his usual patron, gave him
generally a free hand. Just one thing
was required of him, namely that
what lie created should be beautiful.
This fortunate and happy epoch was
but of short duration. Little by little
life became more complex, needs be-
came more numerous, the desire and
taste for comfort came into being and
business became more methodical.
From then on a plan had to be found
to correspond to these new require-
ments and all this with means now de-
termined before hand. These changes
in this new era were reflected in art.
For art is like an open book in which
we may read the story of any civiliza-
tion, become thoroughly familiar with
it, know its virtues as well as its vices.
Architecture is history carved in stone;
each epoch, each civilization leaves
upon it. its own mark.
The training of the young architects
was the first to suffer from all these
changes ; this state of affairs soon drew
the attention of the great kings who
desired to leave behind them me-
morials of their reigns and consequent-
ly were always keenly interested in
the art of architecture. A solution had
to be found at any cost for this serious
problem, namely the training of archi-
tects. First of all a more efficient
method had to be found, a method
capable of embracing all the branches
of art. Once this question was form-
ulated, the kings did not hesitate to
subscribe from their purses the funds
necessary for such an undertaking.
These are the causes and reasons
which brought about the establishment
of the Ecole des Beaux Arts—causes
that were deep and needs that were
imperative—the needs of a civilization
that had just discovered a new point
of view through the study of the ar-
tistic and literary masterpieces of
antiquity. The Ecole, modest at the
beginning, developed in a surprising
manner; its influence at first limited
has become the most powerful and
widespread influence existing today
upon the art of architecture and its
prodigious development permits one to
forecast a still greater destiny to come.
A comparison of the monuments of
the past and a comparison of their
epochs show us that the march of civ-
ilization has influenced not only the
arts themselves but the methods of
studying them. The Ecole has under-
gone this influence to a marked de-
gree. We are no longer in the days
when it was governed by one or two
masters dictating in arbitrary fashion
what the taste should be. It has be-


89
come democratic just as the country it-
self. The method of the modern
Ecole, the Ecole of today, is to take
the student, put before his eyes all the
treasures of the past, make him see all
the suggestions they contain for the
future, then withdraw and leave him
alone to judge, then produce on his
own initiative. Moreover, it means the
competing, for the most part, gradu-
ates of the universities of their own
country. This competition lasts for a
month and is made up of tests dealing
with artistic and scientific matters tak-
ing place at intervals between which
partial reports are published. You
should see, then, the anxiety with
which we throng about the bulletin
Ecole ms Beaux-Arts, Paris
opening of this career to talent, for
talent alone decides the whole ques-
tion here : indeed to have a right to the
title ''clcve des Beaux Arts" one must
take his place among the first in the
famous competition for admission
which brings together from seven to
eight hundred candidates for whom
there are forty-eight vacancies to be
filled by Frenchmen and fifteen open
to foreigners. You can imagine how
hard it is to get in, when you realize
the number and the quality of those
board. With what care we classify our
rivals, calculate our chances for suc-
cess! It is a month full of feverish
excitement, and strong feeling and we
are lucky if we are admitted to take
the examination in mathematics, for
that is almost an honor and repays us
somewhat for the anguish through
which we have gone, for there is a
terrible weeding out before these
mathematics tests. The eight hundred
candidates are pitilessly reduced to
ninetv or thereabouts. Between these


THE MICHIGAN TBCHNIC
lucky ones there is a struggle that
knows no pity, hard work running on
late into the night, even to the dawn,
hours of intense work, feverish walks
in that pretty cour du Mdrier which
might be called the "Court of Sighs,"
for there is where the contestants walk
about waiting for their turn to go in
for the oral examination—you must
really have lived through that moment
to get any idea of what it means.
Remember that the candidate has
been living hours of exhausting ner-
vous tension for more than three
weeks—what good luck, though, to see
one's name among the laurcals (the
successful candidates).
Once admitted, the eleve lives in the
school in the midst of an environment
that is unique. Everywhere he turns
his eyes he cannot help but admire
the beautiful fragments, beautiful
paintings, the museums all a'bout him
which form so to speak a veritable
encyclopedia of art. He may at his
pleasure copy, study, sink deeply into
all these vestiges of the past and in
a word wrest from them the secret
of their beauty. Living thus in these
ideal surroundings he absorbs almost
unknown to himself the fine propor-
tions, the pure lines of these master-
pieces. That was the purpose and the
desire of the authorities—they wanted
to place him in an artistic atmosphere;
an atmosphere so strongly artistic that
he might be impressed with it for his
whole life. The very buildings serve
this purpose in an admirable way.
Some of them date from the days of
Louis XIV; others, more modern,
have become models in their style. It
would be impossible to end this de-
scription without mentioning the won-
derful library placed in a superb build-
ing due to the genius of Duban, that
great French master of modern times.
There with unheard of prodigality the
French nation has gathered together
all that the world has that is most
precious in the way of books on art.
One of the exceptional treasures of
this library is the collection of the
''Grands Prix dc Rome" and other
architectural plans—winners (laurcats)
in the grand competitions of the Ecolc.
Xow, we come to the great question
of the training given at I'Ecolc—it is
the capital point—for it really makes
the school what it is. This training is
divided into two very distinct parts
corresponding exactly to the complexi-
ties of the architectural profession. By
reason of discoveries which have
brought about comfort in buildings
and with that, new ways of carrying
it out, such as electricity—the intro-
duction of steel as frame work in
building, et cetera—by reason also of
that perfection now required in a
modern building which has become a
veritable piece of mechanism, each
part of which is constructed and put
in place beneath the very eyes of the
architect—the architect must have in
addition to his purely artistic knowl-
edge the scientific knowledge neces-
sary for the execution of his plans. His
success will correspond exactly to the
excellence of his taste and knowledge.
Science and art define architecture, art
forming the fundamental and essential
portion to which are attached by num-
berless lines, so to speak, running out
in all directions, the endless scientific
information and knowledge which are
to make certain the perfect realization
of the architect's dream. These two
words can be read quite distinctly in
the whole organization Qf the Ecole.
The scientific training differs in prac-
tically no way from that of other sim-
ilar institutions. It follows modern
progress, considers each new discov-


9i
•erv, reduces it to its simple principles
and inserts it in the program of
studies. Higher mathematics is taught
there, likewise general history of art,
physical sciences, chemistry, etc., and
their application. Civil engineering
figures largely in the program, too,
especially that part having to do with
architecture. Then conies construction,
a vast subject based on theory and
practice and including mathematics,
civil engineering, physics, chemistry,
etc., to which are added courses in law
particularly dealing with business mat-
ters and building. All these subjects
are taught according to the methods in
vogue in the grandes ccolcs. More-
over this part of the training plays here
only a secondary role and we come
now to that other part more important
after all, that part to which the Ecole
owes all its fame: that part the meth-
ods of which are so original and have
asured for I'Ecole the first place,
namely the artistic training.
Although scientific knowledge is of
the very first importance for the archi-
tect, nevertheless, it is beyond contra-
diction that his taste and artistic train-
ing are the great factors in his career.
It is this quality of the architect (be
first of all and above all an artist),
which has made possible all the master-
pieces we admire in the old world.
Filled with this idea I'Ecole has turned
all its efforts, all its experience to-
wards perfecting this training. It
considers the student as an artist
of conviction having all the pride of
his art, having also that feeling of in-
dependence which is the essence of
■every being with great aspirations.
The Ecole leaves this youthful talent
free to decide according to its origin-
ality and tastes which master it is to
•choose. Here is a marked difference
compared with other institutions; it
consists in what we call the atelier. The
atelier is made up of a group of cleres
brought together of their own volition
through similarity of taste so as to
work together. When one of these
groups is complete, it chooses a (mas-
ter) maitrc generally from among the
laurcats dn grand prix de Rome,
whose works moreover assure them a
prominent place in the profession. The
maitrc thus chosen is called "le Patron'
and gives his name to the atelier of
which he is director. The School of
.Architecture contains about fifteen
such ateliers, each one embracing from
one hundred and fifty to two hundred
students. This title "Patron" has be-
come one of the greatest honors a
ntuitre can receive—it is considered as
a mark of admiration given to his
talents. The ateliers of the Ecole des
Beaux Arts in this way bring together
in the names of their "patrons" the
most illustrious names in the domain
of art. By the fact that he is thus
chosen, the "Patron' is recognized by
the State as belonging to the jury
which presides at the decisions given
in the competitions at the Ecole.
According to their formation, the
ateliers are completely separate, one
from the other, and enjoy the most
complete self-government. The only
relationship that binds them together
is their participation in the contests. At
that time all plans are exhibited in the
great salle Melpomene without distinc-
tion, without any order, the very names
being covered with a seal which is re-
moved after the decision. The pro-
grams are drawn up by a special pro-
fessor, those of the grands concours
by the members of the Institut; they
are printed and put under seal under
the supervision of the State. The sub-
jects of these programs differ widely,
from analytical studies dealing partic-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
ularly with the styles of antiquity up
to the great problems which serve as
themes for the concours du prix de
Rome, problems which form the most
vast of architectural schemes ever
given as subjects for study. On the
day and at the hour fixed the com-
petitors are shut up in the loges, little
cells four or five feet square, furnish-
ed with a table and a stool. Each one
of these loges is separated from the
other by partitions and opens out on a
long corridor where the officers of the
State keep watch, walking up and down
all the time. The program is unsealed
and a copy given to each contestant.
Then he is required to produce in a
limited period of time, generally eight
hours, with no help other than his
memory and skill, a sketch of his solu-
tion for the program displayed. In
this way he may be required to outline
and plan the construction of a cathe-
dral, a theatre, an arsenal, a presiden-
tial mansion, etc. During these eight
hours the student is to furnish a sketch
indicating in outline the general ideas
he may have of the solution he has
found, then he hands this sketch to the
officer taking care to make a duplicate
for himself. Then he is given two or
three months in which to develop this
idea on a large scale, to study carefully
each detail, but always in the spirit
of his first sketch because any serious
change would inevitably cause the
work to be marked hors-concours
which would make the work useless
for the competition. It is while devel-
oping this idea that the life in the
atelier really begins for the student.
Bound by this sketch fie is now per-
mitted to work in common with his
fellows. The first weeks following the
montce en loge (going up into the cell)
are generally spent in visiting the mu-
seums and libraries where all works
treating the subject are read, reread
and commented upon; a great share of
the time is spent also in the atelier
where united in groups the students
discuss the subject sharply. Then is
the time for each one to bring to the
group his fund of knowledge. It is a
contest to see who is going to shine
on account of the originality of his
ideas, the correctness of his criticism
and this discussion goes on for days.
There the influence of the most ad-
vanced clears whom we adorn with the
venerable title "ancien," plays its full
role. Indeed, mingling in this discus-
cussion the "anciens" give their
opinion which is always accepted with
much consideration. The young new-
comer but recently admitted, mingles
likewise with all these groups, listen-
ing to all that is said, repeating to him-
self, almost without understanding
them, the principles of composition
enunciated by the "anciens." He may
not assimilate all these things but he
absorbs them—it is an atmosphere
made up of reasoning, of logic, of the
secrets of the art, which is as if it
were penetrating him all the time.
Little by little, however, the appear-
ance of the atelier begins to change:
some of the contestants start to sketch
plans, facades, then the discussion un-
dergoes a transformation. Now we
are getting ready to produce some-
thing, tables are arranged; each one
picks out a place where he will work
until his scheme is finished. Soon we
receive visits from comrades, who
come in groups to criticise with brutal
severity, yet a severity always sincere
and honest, the qualities of the sketch
outlined. It is the mutual system of
instruction carried to the extreme—
criticisms are constantly pouring down
on all the plans we are studying—3
battle of arguments wherein all use


93
the most paradoxical epithets. Finally
there is the "patron" who conies two
or three times a week to visit each con-
testant, to give him a general idea
ing to the most advanced students the
task of making the erections of detail.
L'Ecole is, so to speak, a little Re-
public. Its administration which looks

gram, show him the essential points
that should be accentuated, harmoniz-
ing in this manner all parties and leav-
to the observance of laws common in
interest to all represents the govern-
ment. The ateliers with their self-gov-
ernment form the states of this little


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
republic. These states, dependent only
in regard to some general laws enjoy,
on the other hand, the widest liberty.
Liberty in taste, in study, in work, in
method, in expression. This little
state, the atelier, is modeled rather on
the antique type. As in days of old, we
distinguish here two castes: masters
and slaves. The first of these castes is
made up of the students who have
given their help in the manual labor
connected with the atelier, "le service"
as it is called, which consists in doing
errands for their fellow students, buy-
ing paper and pencils, cleaning the
drawing boards, putting the library in
order and all that for a year and a
half. This is a debt which every new
comer contracts as soon as he enters
the atelier and which must be paid
without delay. This class, les anciens,
enjoys the most absolute powers. The
other caste is made up of those who
have not yet fulfilled their obligations.
Each new comer has his regular days
of "service" and must conform under
pain of punishment. These, punish-
ments vary according to the gravity of
the case and are moreover regulated
by one of the most complete penal
codes. All this convict work must be
performed under the stern eye of a
chief who has already performed his
"seri'ice," but who is still in that period
of observation preceding his admission
into the company of the "anciens."
This chief is called the "corporal"—be
is responsible to the "anciens'' for all
misdeeds committed under his orders.
This office is. however, an honor
among the newcomers. If the conduct
of this chief should require some pun-
ishment, it cannot be inflicted in the
presence of his subordinates and this
is considered a signal privilege. Once
a year the elections take place—the
newcomers are excluded from them.
The most they can do is to work for
the side they prefer, but even this is
at the risk of being caught red-handed
by the other side and this would mean
terrible reprisals in the future. As in
all serious politics the most corrupt
methods are in vogue. One candidate
for instance will announce his inten-
tion to celebrate his attainment of pow-
er by a big champagne banquet, an-
other will promise to treat them to an
cxcursio.n to Chantilly or Fontainbleau,
another, well known on account of his
poor voice, always off key, will prom-
ise not to sing during the whole of
his term as president. Such a declara-
tion produces generally a vivid impres-
sion especially on his neighbors. Al-
though these elections take place amid
wild and extravagant jokes, the re-
sults are always serious. The offices
are always given to those best qual-
ified. In this way we elect a "grand
inassicr," a chief who is to represent
the "atelier" outside, who is to defend
its interests, then a "sous-massier," a
secretary and a treasurer—no need to
add that all these offices should be con-
secrated by parties and banquets which
follow inevitably every important af-
fair at the Ecolc.
Paris does not have that cold wel-
come for the student which other great
capitals have or perhaps the students'
ideal is so powerful that it makes him
forget for an instant his own country.
As soon as he arrives, he breathes an
atmosphere that is sympathetic: he
feels quite at home in this great city.
That is because Paris is par excellence
the Student's City. There we have
that wonderful struggle where we
match ourselves in contest with rivals
worthy of our ambitions. The first
;tep towards I'Ecole, and the most dif-
ficult is that competition for admission
which opens all the doors. Various


95
means may be used to prepare the
candidate, for in spite of all the diplo-
mas lie may have, he requires a special
preparation and a very serious one.
'There are even special "ateliers" the
one and only purpose of which is to
prepare for these competitions. It is
a painful and sometimes a long task—
some candidates sacrifice two, three,
sometimes five years in preparatory
study before being admitted. In these
'ateliers fircparatoires' all the branches
are taught upon which the candidate
will be called up to reply: it is a com-
plete training. Provided with this in-
formation, with his soul full of hope
the young artist tries his strength. The
first time is rather to see how things
are done. He scarcely counts on suc-
ceeding but observes, has an eye on
•everything, learns how to fight and it
is only after a year or two of this
preparation tbat he may hope for some
chance of success. During this time
he has visited the exhibitions at the
Bcole, has judged and heard judged
the merits of each "atelier" — so his
choice is made, but tbat is not all, he
must get into an atelier; for those who
know all the tribulations that assail the
newcomers, it is easy to realize all the
horror of these words: "Get into an
atelier." A delicate procedure requir-
ing all the craftiness of an Apache
and even then he is not sure of getting
away unscathed. Generally the new-
comer has some acquaintances in the
place. On a certain day he asks to see
these chums (ropains); left alone at
the door he bears very soon cries that
have no name — formidable roars
enough to make him think he is in the
neighborhood of some immense men-
agerie: the comrades inside have just
learned of the arrival of this recruit
and are giving him a welcome worthy
of the old traditions. His entrance is
greeted by the most unexpected inter-
jections: each one finds in him some
resemblance to some bandit whose pic-
ture was seen in the last newspaper,
each one expresses without hesitation
his impression of the victim, an im-
pression far from flattering, and the
victim wonders every moment what is
going to happen to him. Finally after
a thousand tricks and pranks to bring
out the various sides of his character,
he pays his treat and then he is in a
short time the friend of everybody, for
at I'Ecole acquaintances are quickly
made and become very intimate.
If success crowns his efforts, he may
hope after two or three years of study
to pass into the first class and thus he-
come somebody in the Bcole—for one
is scarcely anybody before that first
class. There the competitions become
more interesting; it is now the great
struggle—the great programs, and be-
sides he is an ancien now, he is a mas-
ter in the atelier and may command all
the newcomers, consequently he enjoys
greater consideration. This is really
the finest period of the stay at the
Bcole. period too short, alas! He sees
sorrowfully approaching the end of his
studies; these fine years filled with
ideals, those charming comrades with
whom he has chummed so long, the
wonderful conconrs so thoroughly cap-
tivating, all this he must leave—and
for what? * * * the world, and busi-
ness, his "cartons'' folders are filled
with sketches and plans, now is the
time of realization. From all these
theories, all these dreams, he must
create realities. What a contrast this
life so purely ideal which he leaves be-
hind him and this world so real in
which he must from now on live.


ARY THEORY
BY C. T. JOHNSTON
Popular conception of the measure-
ment of distance on the surface of the
earth, and the location of land and
water boundaries thereby, is fixed
largely by contract with surveys that
have been made under the supervision
of the General Land Office, Depart-
ment of the Interior. The results of
this work touch nearly every man at
some time during his business career.
It is natural that people, generally,
should be convinced that surveying is
a field exercise based on reasonably
good guess-work. The surveys of the
General Land Office have been con-
ducted in a political atmosphere and
when politics and science become en-
tangled for a few years, science can
rarely be identified, even under a high-
power microscope. Lines that have
been surveyed and marked on the
ground through government agency,
often become celebrated later, as town-
ship, county and other political boun-
daries; hence it may be possible that
officers responsible for the policies of
the General Land Office have conclud-
ed that politics rather than science
should be given first consideration in
this important work.
The General Government cannot
plead ignorance of types of good sur-
veying, because it has fostered such
work under the direct supervision of
the United States Coast and Geodetic
Survey. This department merits and
it is accorded the praise of scientific
men at home and abroad. It is natur-
al to inquire why it is that the General
Government blows hot and cold at the
same time. Xo attempt will be made
to answer this riddle.
Since popular impressions of survey-
ing have been created more or less by
work performed under political con-
trol, we are interested in a study of
the results which have thus far become
evident. Public lands have been laid
out in townships, sections and parts of
sections under this hybrid organiza-
tion. The law relating to these sur-
veys admits the weakness of the sys-
tem in the following sentence:
"Second. The boundary lines, ac-
tually run and marked in the surveys
returned by the Surveyor-General,
shall be established as the proper boun-
dary lines of the sections or sub-divi-
sions for which they were intended,
and the length of such lines as re-
turned shall be held and considered as
the true length thereof.'' (Part of Sec.
ioo, R.S.. 2396.")
If it had been the intention of the
General Land Office to employ engin-
eers who could perform accurate work,
the measurements made would need no
such defense as this. We have found
no similar clause in the law relating
to the work of the United States Coast
and Geodetic Survey. In the Manual
of Surveying Instructions, presumed,
under the law, to be prepared by the
Commissioner of the General Land
Office, may be found sections relating
to the meander of streams and lakes.
These afford a ray of light to the sub-
ject under discussion. The Commis-
sioner of the General [Land Office;
evidently entertained some ijood in-


97
tentions. He realized that the General
Government has supervision over
navigable waters. He recognized that
settlers would he injured should large
areas of water surface be included in
tracts open to entry. It is possible that
he had some vague notion as to the
possible limits of national ownership
and control of navigable waters and
he might have entertained some ideas
as to the future responsibilities of the
States in the same direction. At any
rate, he specified that all navigable
rivers were to be meandered "at the
ordinary mean high water mark." The
same rule was applied to all other
rivers having a right-angle width of
three chains (198 feet) or more. All
lakes having a surface area of twenty-
five acres or more were treated in the
same manner.
Figure 1 is copied from a portion of
a township map prepared by the Gen-
eral Land Office. Both banks of the
river shown were meandered and the
measurements made on the ground
were presumed to be sufficiently ac-
curate to enable clerks in the office of
the local Surveyor-General to compute
the areas of the lots along the margins
of the stream. The number and area
of one lot (lot 5, Section 25, area,
44.06) are shown in the figure. Sec-
tion corners, presumed to be one mile
apart, are indicated by circles. Cor-
ners half way between section corners
are indicated by '4s- Where section
lines intersect river boundaries a
meander post is set. These are indi-
cated by Ps. The Government survey-
ors ran a line by courses and distances,
"at the ordinary mejan high water
mark," along the river bank, connect-
ing the points on the ground, indicated
by Ps in the figure. The "ordinary
mean high water mark" is perhaps the
most definitely located line commonly
surveyed. These lines can be retraced
today with greater ease than can the
majority of section lines.
When settlement took place, the set-
tler who entered lands along the river,
obtained patent from the United States
Government to an area limited by the
meander survey. The United States
Government did not grant title to the
land embraced in the river banks and
bed. A question might logically arise,
in the minds of those interested, as to-
the treatment of smaller rivers and
lakes. The General Land Office ac-
cepted surveys which showed on their
face an error of three chains per mile.
Since a section might be longer or
shorter than a mile by three chains
the settler who entered the land would
have to acquiesce and accept something
greater or less than the area shown on
the plats. This being the case, it did
not seem essential to pay much at-
tention to the area of land embraced
in a strip covered by a river less than
three chains in width. However, the
General Government has not intimated
that it gives title to lands covered by
water regardless of the size of the
stream or lake concerned.


THE MICHIGAN TECHXIC
We might reasonably assume that
the troubles introduced by the union
of politics and science, more than one
hundred years ago, might not be fur-
ther complicated and magnified. It
would have been so easy, so equitable
and so reasonable to have said to all
land owners, "Your boundaries termi-
nate at the meander survey. Where
streams and lakes are not meandered,
your possessions may run to the high
water mark. Ileyond this boundary,
whether meandered or not, is public
property, now and for all time.'' Land
owners should have been relieved from
the payment of taxes on all lands cov-
ered by water and the same rule should
apply to lands donated by them for
highway purposes. These lands should
belong to the public. Navigation uses
are the least important among the
many uses of water known to man, yet
the National (Government appears to
be interested only in this respect.
Navigation uses are public. The early
law makers possibly anticipated that
when the States came to deal with the
more important uses, they would rec-
ognize a great responsibility to the
public and act accordingly. The States,
with but few7 exceptions, have over-
looked this manifest duty and other
complications have entered to suspend
reason, deceive water users and en-
courage a vicious form of specula-
tion.
For many centuries England has
been developing principles that have
been and are of greatest benefit to the
civilized countries of the world. Eng-
land, like many European countries,
has suffered greatly from and by the
introduction of the feudal system.
Probably the most striking inheritance
of this system England displays today
is in land tenure. The farmers of a
feudal country are tenants. Thev were
vassals or slaves only a few hundred
years ago. A rule governing waters
in England, where lands owners are
few and where the uses of water are
limited in number, might operate sat-
isfactorily for a long time without
change. Such a rule did develop there
and it was made a part of the common,
or unwritten law,—a law interpreted
and altered to meet the demands of
civilization. This rule we know as the
doctrine of riparian rights. In brief,
it holds that any owner of lands abut-
ting on a stream may demand that the
waters of that stream pass his lands
undiminished in quantity and undefiled
in quality.
When our country was young, the
lawmakers and courts found it impos-
sible to meet every contingency arising
within the various States by legislative
enactments. In order to provide the
infant nation with rules that had been
proven in the mother country, the
States accepted the English common
law to supplement statutory enact-
ment. This was a wise move on the
part of our early statesmen. However,
we have made serious mistakes by re-
lying on those provisions of the com-
mon law which do not suit a people
having a different form of govern-
ment or which do not meet the require-
ments of a country differing widely
from England in- climate and topo-
graphy. The acceptance of the com-
mon law of England doubtless induced
a feeling of contentment for the time
being and men, who should have been
studying conditions and framing laws
to suit them, spent their time in other
ways. The common law is interpreted
and administered by the courts,—so
that when waters are treated under
the doctrine of riparian rights, the
courts have a double responsibility.
The rule would imply, in its element-


99
ary form, that only owners of land
abutting on a stream would have con-
trol of the (low of the stream and only
these people would be concerned as to
the quality of the water. The rule is
not and cannot be carried into effect
rigidly. The courts of the country
have discussed it from every stand-
point and the decisions rendered are
not harmonious, to say the least. There
are many outgrowths of the rule that
are more insidious in their influence
than is the parent doctrine.
Basing their decisions on the com-
mon law doctrine, our courts have held
that land boundaries do not terminate
at the meander survey, but that pri-
vate possessions extend to a theoretical
line in the channel of the river, desig-
nated as the "thread of the stream."
When the courts made this first miss-
step, they substituted something al-
most intangible and very indefinite for
something that is fairly plain. Private
interests are presumed to be given an
advantage over public interests in a
property that only the public can enjoy
and use. Private parties cannot enjoy
exclusive use of the property they are
presumed to own in the beds of rivers
and lakes and many times this cannot
be used at all. Private parties are de-
ceived, for the time being, as to the
nature and value of these so-called
rights; however, they are thereby fur-
nished with a weapon which may be
used to the injury of the public. Xo
people concerned in laying a founda-
tion in government which will redound
to their credit, which will insure peace
and contentment to their children and
which will provide protection to public
interests, where Nature decrees them
to be public, can acquiesce in such a
practice indefinitely.
The "thread of the stream" shifts
with everv variation in discharge.
While the flow of the river remains
constant, the "thread of the stream"
may possibly be found in an approxi-
mate way near one shore for a few
hundred feet, only to shift towards the
opposite shore and wander about with-
out regard to any rule or law that man
can estimate or understand. Yet land
owners along the river are presumed
to have the right to extend their
boundaries from a well-defined line
on the banks to this visionary, shifting
boundary in the river. Every consid-
eration based on science and on public
welfare and necessity demands that
the waters of streams and lakes, their
banks and beds remain for all time
public property.
When we consider a lake, rather
than a river, another imaginary Hue
or something more intangible takes
the place of the "thread of the
stream." When lakes are large, the
common law rule falters and the stu-
dent of leading cases is led to believe
that some courts have seen a light,
while treating these apparent excep-
tions, which reflects the absurdity of
the entire riparian doctrine. When the
waters of a lake recede thus bringing
to light lands that were previously
flooded, we find complications in court
decisions which indicate that it is im-
possible to depart from the boundary
fixed by the meander survey and avoid
conflicts between this phase of the
common law and simple mathematics.
Figure 2 shows a meandered lake and
the topography of its bed. The topo-
graphy has been worked out by actual
sounding operations. This lake is TiS
feet above another larger lake only one
and three-fourths miles away. It may
drain into the larcer lake at some time
in the future. When this occurs we
will be fortunate if the existing rules,
based on the coxmon Pw, ha.e been


THE MICHIGAN TECH NIC
abrogated. At present, the following
rules are in effect: Each land owner
has the right to extend his boundary
lines at right-angles to the water sur-
face (or the contour of the bed of the
lake) as the water recedes. He is also
entitled to have the same ratio of
water frontage as he enjoyed under
normal lake level conditions.
discarded and some of the best of our
more modern administrations have
long since replaced these rules by
something that is just, plain and defi-
nite. The doctrine or riparian rights
was never intended to protect water
users, but to extend power to feudal
land owners. It does not encourage
development, whether private or pub-
n*2
The map shows the land boundaries
extended in conformity with the first
rule. An inspection of the figure will
show that there are numerous flaws
in this rule when carried into practice.
For instance, where are the boundaries
between tracts, A, F, G, H and K?
The opportunities for litigation are al-
most unlimited. When we attempt to
apply the second rule we find arithme-
tic declaring war on law. Arithmetic
says that this rule cannot be applied
except in conflict with the first. Public
interests demand that both rules be
lie. It presumes to extend a feudal
privilege to owners of land which
tempts them to speculate at the ex-
pense of private and public investors.
Yet when its absurdities and impossi-
bilities are even epiestioned, the spectre
of vested rights arises to cloud our
vision and to delay the time when
common sense, based on something
no more formidable than arithmetic,
will be applied to supplant theories
borrowed from civilizations which
should be extinct in this, the twentieth
century of our Lord.


AN APPRECIATION
BY DEAN COOLEY
The death of Mr. William Robert-
son McDonald, Instructor in Forging
in the Engineering Shops, comes to us
all as a great shock—it was so sudden
and unexpected. When I met him with
his traveling bag on his way to the
hospital, a short time ago, and stopped
to inquire where he was going he told
me that he needed a little surgical at-
tention, and felt that it should be at-
tended to now while he was in such
full health. I congratulated him on
his good sense and sent him on his
way with a God speed.
Xow he has left us—gone on before.
Tie was a sturdy friend, a man of
high ideals, thoroughly in accord with
the spirit of the University, and ap-
preciative of his responsibilities to the
young men in his classes. He lived
his life like the Christian gentleman
that he was. full of faith, believing
that there is good in all things, lie
was a workman of the old school and a
splendid type of man among men who
live by the sweat of their brows.
He was a good citizen, and did his
part towards the maintenance of high
principles in his community. He re-
minded me of the men who came to
America in colonial times and helped
to build up the country. He was one
who helped make a country rather
than one made by a country. A Cana-
dian by birth and a citizen of this coun-
try by adoption he was in all respects
a true American, the kind which makes
for national strength in putting the
country ahead of the individual.
Mr. McDonald will be sadly missed
here on the campus, and thousands
who have known him by his familiar
title of "Mac" will mourn the loss of
a good and true friend.
BY W. L. MIGGETT
William Robertson McDonald was
born of Scotch parentage at Peter-
boro, Ontario, Canada, October 22,
1848.
His father was Duncan MacDonald,
as the name was then written. His
mother was Jeannette Robertson Mc-
Donald. Both parents were born,
reared, and married in Aberfeldy,
Perthshire. Scotland.
l&gt;uncan MacDonald learned the
blacksmith trade in his native town
and emigrated in 1842 to Peterboro.
Here he established a shop and be-
came well known through the reputa-
tion of his work. Perhaps his most
important task was that of forging
the heavy iron fittings for the Trent
Valley system of canal locks. Some of
these were so large and heavy that he
built a special forge out of doors to
handle them. This was in the days
when such work was done by hand,
without assistance by the powerful
machinery of today. It was a notable
achievement.
Following in his father's footstens.
the son, also learned the blacksmith
trade in the home shop and under pa-
ternal tutelage. He thus became a
master smith, trained and versed in
the lore and traditions of his craft.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
One of his patron Saints was Tubal
Cain, whom Scripture records as the
first worker in iron and cunning arti-
ficer of metals. His favorite story was
that of King Solomon, who at the
completion of his famous temple seat-
ed the blacksmith at the head of the
feast of artists and artisans employed
upon it, because without the tools
which lie had forged, their work
would have been in vain and the tem-
ple impossible.
He loved his work with an inherited
affection. He felt that he too was a
builder for the future, that his work
was essential and honorable and per-
manent. He found joy in it because
he had the vision of and faith in the
working out of human destiny.
On March ", 1S71 he was married
to Elizabeth J. Robinson, who has been
his faithful and loving wife and com-
panion throughout the long years and
who survives him.
Six children came to them in their
happy union, all of whom are living.
There were three sons and three
daughters: Miss Grace E. McDonald
of Ann Arbor, Herbert A. McDonald
of Detroit, Fred. B. McDonald of Ann
Arbor, Mrs. Agnes R. Ewald of Mon-
tevideo, Uruguay, Mrs. Mabells M.
Graves of Ann Arbor, and William R.
McDonald of Los Angeles. Cal.
As a voung man, Mr. McDonald
went into the great Canadian North-
west and worked at his trade for th?
■ Canadian Pacific Railway during the
period of its construction through that
region. He intended to settle there,
but after two or three years experience
returned east and entered the C. P. R.
shops in Toronto. Here he remained
until 1890.'He then went to St. Paul,
Minn., where he was foreman in the
Grand Trunk R. R. Shops. Tn 1892
he came to Detroit where he worked
for the Murphy Iron Works, The De-
troit Shipbuilding Company, and sev-
eral other well known iron and ma-
chinery concerns.
In September 1807 he came to the
University of Michigan as instructor
in forging in the Engineering Shops,
which position he held continuously
until the day of his death. April 2.
1916. It was during these nineteen
years of intimate association with him
that we have all learned to know and
love him so well.
The great growth of the University
and of the Engineering College, has
been during his period of service. He
accepted gladly the added responsibili-
ty incident to this growth. From the
few students at the beginning, his.
classes grew to the large number of
200 each semester. His work was al-
ways with the freshmen. His fatherly
way in managing them is best de-
scribed by the terse remark of Treas-
urer Campbell on the day he helped
fear him to his last resting place. "He
was sympathetic, and he got under
their hides.'-
Rut when it came to performing
their duty, their proper stunt of work,
he was firm and watchful. The very
few who sought to get by through un-
fair means, he sought to correct with-
ovt injury to their reputations. Xot
one of his men was ever reported to
the faculty for a misdemeanor. This
was his way with them.
A'so during his period of service as
a teacher, great changes came in his
line of work. Though his own train-
ing had been traditional and of the
old school, he gladly welcomed the
new, and was happy to know that his
rwn craft was not being left behind
in the general trend toward scientific
methods.
When the pyrometer, the sclero-


103
scope, tungsten and other alloy steels
and changes incident to them, came
into the shop, he fondled them as a
mother fondles her babe. He sought to
understand the meaning of their high
sounding names. He read books about
them and displayed the interest of a
young man just beginning to learn.
Though in his working days he was
a union man, and to the end believed
in the principle of unionism for his
craftsmen, he felt that it had no func-
tion to perform in his teaching work.
Largely to his influence do I attribute
the fact that no breath of the subject
had been heard in the Engineering
Shops through all these years.
Among his other interests Mr. Mc-
Donald was an active Mason and stood
high among his Masonic Brethren. He
was a member of the following Ma-
sonic Bodies: Detroit Lodge, No. 2,
F. &amp; A. M., Detroit; Washtenaw
Chapter, Xo. 6, R. A. M., Ann Arbor;
Union Council. No. 11, R. &amp; S. M.
Ypsilanti; and Michigan Sovereign
Consistory, S. P. R. S., Valley of De-
troit.
He was a Christian, and a member
of the Baptist Church. His pastor,
in the funeral discourse, told the
touching story of how after being in-
terested and active in church work
for many years as a non-member, he
finally asked for the rite of baptism,
saying "\ do not know that my life
will be different than it has been, but
T think now I should formally identi-
fy myself with the church." He had
tested out the Christian life as he un-
derstood it. and found it good, before
openly embracing it.
He was a lover of nature. The
plants, birds and animals loved him
and knew that he loved them. The
campus squirrels knew his office win-
dow. There was always a bag of nuts
in his desk, and in the cold of winter
there was a scramble at his window
at a time of day well known to them.
At his home he never tired of caring
for the flowers, the garden, the grass,
the trees, birds and squirrels. There
was a drinking trough in his yard that
never went dry. Trees grew from the
seed under his care. Lie had a plant
that bloomed only when the snow was
on the ground, and the rose bushes
were bent down and covered with
straw and humus through the winter
that they might rise in the spring un-
injured by the frost.
And such a friend. If you were sick
he never failed to visit you. Just be-
fore quitting time on Christmas Eve
he invariably slipped in, poked a cigar
into your hand and wished you a Mer-
ry Christmas and Happy New Year.
He would poke a cigar at you on the
least provocation. If he knew it was
your birthday or any other occasion
that warranted it, he would be there
with the cigar, which was the visible
token of his affectionate interest and
good cheer.
Dear Old Mac. You were laid to
rest with the proper' tributes of love
and respect, in the way you would
have it done. Many of your friends
were there but not all. Many, very
many, could not come.
Your devoted wife and children.
Your old fellow craftsmen, who knew
you in the prime of your working
days. Your Lodge and many of the
I rethren. Your church and her people.
Your neighbors and fellow townsmen.
Your recent shop mates. Your Dean
and members of your faculty. And
your students, past and recent, in
whose memories you are to live far
into the future. All were there in
humble tribute to an unselfish life so
rich in all that is lasting and true.


NOMICAL PROBLEMS
BY R. S. SWINTON
Illustrations Courtesy Engineer-
ing News.
Among' engineers generally there is
little faith in their own capacity for
making use of Astronomy. The truth
is that the more common and useful
observations are not difficult to make,
comprehend or compute. The engi-
neer however leaves the derivation of
tables to the mathematician. Under the
excellent system of surveying in use
by the Philippine Bureau of Lands
there is required, for each parcel of
land surveyed, a set of eight Solar (or
star) observations, which must check
each other and the adjoining surveys
within a minute of arc. An American
surveyor is at first worried at the pros-
pect but can very soon boast of sets
taken in ten minutes and computed in
half an hour.
In order to deal with the motions
and positions of the stars, planets,
Moon and Sun, we consider the Earth
to be the center of space and to be sur-
rounded by a vast sphere on the in-
terior surface of which the heavenly
bodies have their paths, quite the clas-
sic conception. The accompanying il-
lustration (Fig. i) shows such a
sphere and the Earth is so small as
to be merely a point O. The North
Pole of the Earth extended would
pierce the great sphere at A* and the
plane of the Equator seen in profile
would have a trace marked Equator.
If a person were standing on the
Earth at about 140 30' N. Latitude
(Manila, P. I.) his horizon might be
represented by its trace marked Hori-
zon and a perpendicular line to the
horizon would pierce the great sphere
at Zenith and Nadir.
It will be noted that the Latitude
chosen is measured on the Earth,
north from the Equator and will be
equal to the angle shown between the
Zenith and Equator, or between the
Horizon and the line through the
Poles. N-O-V is equal to this angle
and is approximately the altitude angle,
above the Horizon, measured in sight-
ing upon the North Star.
The Declination of the Sun is the
angle between the center of the Sun
and the plane of the Equator and is
given in tables published yearly by the
governments. (American Nautical Al-
manac*). Since the change of declin-
ation is but a few minutes per day it
may be assumed as a constant in the
graphical solution for a given day, and"
equal to the value at Greenwich Noon.
Therefore the Path of Sun is a circle
for one day and is shown in profile as
a straight line in Fig. 1. The Polar
Distance is the complement (900 —
Decl.) of the Declination and is the.
value usually given for fixed Stars.
Its value for a given Star is almost
constant throughout the year.
The Altitude is the vertical angle
measured from the horizon to the Sun
in Fig. 1. If the vertical circle while

the telescope is pointed at the Sun be
clamped and the horizontal circle or
spindle be released, the line of sight
may be made to trace a cone of revolu-
tion. The axis of the cone is the
Zenith line OC and one of the cone
elements is OB. The line of sight will
trace upon the great sphere a circle
shown in profile as AB. Since the Sun
is on this circle and also on the Path of
Sun it must be at their intersection.
Sun.
The Azimuth of the Sun is the angle
measured on the Horizontal Plate, be-
In determining Azimuth with the
transit we must have Latitude, Declin-
ation and observe Altitude. The meth-
od of procedure is as follows: Place
a protractor on line ON, Fig. 1. with
its center at O and lay off the latitude,
Zenith, Equator, Altitude, and Declina-
tion for Noon at Greenwich. Draw
AB parallel to the horizon and the
path of the Sun parallel to the
Equator. The intersection of these
lines represents the position of the Sun.
If AB be considered a plane its re-
volved position will be ASB, with cen-
tween the Sun and South, clockwise.
(Other conventions are rarely used.)
If the base AB of the cone be revolved
900 into the plane of the paper it will
fall on ASB and Sun will be projected
at .S". ACS will be the Azimuth, or if
it be a forenoon observation and the
Sun be on the far side of the great
sphere, (360s —ACS) will be the azi-
muth. The plane AB in which the an-
gle ACS is measured is parallel to the
Horizon plane and to the horizontal
plate of the transit on which the Azi-
muth is read.
^ter at C, and the revolved position of
the Sun will be S. Angle ACS, or
360°—ACS is the azimuth of the Sun.
Suppose now it is desired to find
how much the observers watch was
fast or slow. This is often convenient
when away from railroads and is an
incidental possibility in an observa-
tion.
If Fig. 1 were observed from Ar the
intersection of the Equator with the
great sphere would be in the great
circle shown in Fig. 2, and the Path
of the Sun would be a concentric circle


THE MICHIGAN TF.CHNIC
with the Sun projected at K. The
Meridian plane, or great circle of Fig.
I would be perpendicular at N (Fig.
2) or the Apparent Noon line.
Twenty-four hours equals one day
or complete circuit of the Sun. Thus
each hour equals 36o°/24 or 15° of
arc. For convenience a time protractor
may be made on tracing cloth and
held by a pin at N. The time of the
observation shown would have been
about 8:52 A. M. When the center
of the Sun is on the Meridian it is ap-
parently Noon. Since the Solar days
are not all of equal length, an average
day is used so the Xoon "Mean Time"'
may be a few minutes either before or
after Noon "Apparent Time.-' This
correction is given in the tables adja-
cent to the Declination. By making
this shift we have so called "Sun
Time" used in some farming commu-
nities. The "Standard Time" is still
different, but is taken on some Meri-
dian shown on a map included with the
tables. The angular difference be-
tween the longitude of the observer
and this Meridian, reduced to time
gives the second correction which may
be negative or positive as the observer
is West or East of the Meridian.
It may be observed in Fig. 1 that
the Path of Sun intersects the Horizon.
The Sun can be at this point only at
moments of Sunrise or Sunset so this
intersection projected onto Fig. 2
makes it possible to determine these
times. If an accurate local Almanac is
available the time of Sunrise given
may be set on its position in Fig. 2
and those corrections mentioned in the
paragraph preceding may be omitted.
A device that is sometimes used in
determining the North depends on the
fact that horizontal angles made by the
Sun at equal altitudes on a given day
are approximately bisected by the
North. For an elevation of the Sun in
Fig. 1 there is in Fig. 2 a forenoon
and afternoon position equally distant
from the apparent Noon Meridian
which is the trace of the North and
South plane through the observer. The
procedure would be: Read several
altitudes and Azimuths on the Sun in
the morning, in the afternoon catch
the Azimuths at the same altitudes.
The means of the Azimuths taken in
pairs for each altitude should be a con-
stant and equal to the Azimuth of the
true North (1800). If two series of
observations are taken, one A. M. and
one P. M., with small intervals of
time, the Azimuths for corresponding
altitudes to those taken at one time
(A. M.) may be interpolated assuming
a straight line variation between the
nearest adjacent altitudes of the other
time (P. M.).
A Corollary to the above is that
Apparent Noon occurred at a time
equidistant from each of the forenoon
and afternoon observations of equal'
altitude.
Some buildings such as Hospitals
and Art Exhibits require fenestration
which shall give certain anticipated re-
sults. Heliostats may require to be
set and pointed for starting at a given
time. Let it be required to find the
direction of a ray i- e. the Altitude and
Azimuth of the Sun at a given time.
The Latitude, Declination and Civil
time of Apparent Noon should be
known. Set the protractor on ON
with its center at O and lay off the
latitude. Equator, Zenith, and Declina-
tion. Draw the Path of the Sun par-
allel to the Equator and project it as
a Circle in Fig. 2. Lay off the angle
K-X-Sun rise or K-X-Xoon equal to
the time between Sunrise or Noon and
the given time. A' is the position of
the Sun and is projected to Fig. 1 as.


107
Sun. Draw AB through the Sun par-
allel to the Horizon. BOV is the alti-
tude of the Sun, and the Azimuth is
found as explained in the first prob-
lem.
Other problems possible of solution
are: Given Time, Latitude and Alti-
tude to find Declination and Azimuth;
or given Declination, Altitude and Azi-
muth to find Latitude and Apparent
time. In the latter case the Position
of the Sun is at the intersection of its
path and a circle having its center at
O and for its radius the hypothenuse
of a triangle with legs CO and C Sun.
CO is known since the length of the
chord is determined by the altitude and
C Sun is known because the Azimuth
is known.
Having made a graphical solution
it is a simple matter to apply trigono-
metric formulae to the original data
and arrive at as accurate results as
may be desired and with a clear under-
standing of the work. For conveni-
ence call the radius of the Great
Sphere unity. Most published form-
ulae or computation forms are better
adapted to use, having been trigono-
metrically juggled into form for log-
rithmic computation.
Before computing for Azimuth cor-
rect the Altitude by tables of Refrac-
tion and the Declination by straight
line interpolation between adjacent
values for Greenwich Noon. To sim-
plify the latter operation Plot in Fig.
2 on the Path of Sun, a point ''Green-
wich Noon" which will be the observ-
er's longitude West of Greenwich
plotted counterclockwise from the Ap-
parent Noon.
TESTS FOR THE DETERMINATION OF CON=
CRETE BOND BETWEEN PAVING BRICK
BY R. C. GORE
Owing to the severe traffic which a pavement must stand, the matter
of concrete grout bond between paving brick becomes of great importance.
Until very recently no thoughts of a nature serious enough to warrant tests
being carried out to determine the relative value of this bond matured. An
article bearing slightly on this subject appeared in the Engineering Record
for May 30, 1914. The author of this article, Mr. Wm. C. Acheson, of the
New York Highway Department, states that wire cut samples formed a
stronger bond with the grout and the penetration of the grout was equally
satisfactory. No figures were given.
A pavement in which the brick were not properly cemented together
and especially where the foundation is uneven or of earth, soon goes to
pieces, due primarily to the sepaartion of the brick one from another. Once
loosened the brick over soft or weak places settle while on solid foundation
they maintain their original position until thrown out or broken. The un-
evenness of a brick pavement caused by part of the brick settling is of itself
of sufficient importance to cause a most careful consideration of the bond.
The bond depends for the most part on two considerations. With the


THE MICHIGAN TBCHNIC
same brick it is a function of the strength of the mortar. With the same
mortar it is a function of the nature of the surface of the brick.
The tests herein described attempt, insofar as possible, to show bond
strength relative to the nature of the surface of the brick, the mortar
throughout being, of one mix. The mortar used was of a 1:2 mix by
weight, and comparing with a like mixture of cement and Ottawa sand as
shown in the table following.

The low tensile strength of these briquettes seems to be due to the
specimens being poured, permitting of no pressure for thoroughly compact-

Three pair of each kind were bonded side to side in a manner as near
like the conditions under which grout is poured in a pavement as possible.
A few pair of the same kind of brick were bonded end to end but owing
to the size of the testing machine it was impossible to separate them in a
manner satisfactory enough to consider.
The tests were made after the mortar had set twenty-eight days. The
testing apparatus consisted of a one hundred fifty thousand pound capacity
Olsen testing machine together with a wood and iron clamp.
In each case the load was applied to make the bond fail by direct tension.
Failures of bond by tension in pavement are unusual. More often these
failures occur by shearing or by stresses due to flexural action. The resist-
ance to bond failure of any kind, however, can be measured in a compara-
tive way by direct tension.
In every case the failure occurred on the plane of separation between
the brick and the mortar showing that the bond strength is in every case
less than the tensile strength of the mortar used. Only three specimens of
each type of brick were tested and the unit resistance to separation varied
as much as forty-nine per cent, in one type. The average unit resistance of
a greater number of specimens would, no doubt, be somewhere near the
average values obtained.

COPYRIGHT 1916, BY RALPH R. LEFFLER
The design of reinforced concrete
beams as given by all text-ibooks at
the present time is indirect, puzzling,
laborious and incomplete. They divide
the subject into three parts, viz.:
simply reinforced rectangular beams,
doubly reinforced rectangular beams
and T-beams, and give these parts
such treatment as to impress the stu-
dent that there is an unbridgeable gap
between them. By the aid of the chart
shown on the opposite page these gaps
are readily bridged and all three types
of beams are more easily and more
directly designed than by any of the
methods now extant.
The nomenclature adopted is that
recommended by the Joint Committee
and is as shown on the beam sections
on the chart.
This article deals mainly with the
"Design for Moment." Shearing area
is considered but the details of shear
reinforcement are not dealt with.
Explanation of the Chart.
The chart is theoretically exact.
It consists of a family of p curves
and a family of p' curves plotted on a
co-ordinate system in which the ordi-
nates are values of L and the abscissae
are values of K. Except that K is sub-
kj.
stituted for pj and L for —, the form-
2
ulas used and the flexure theory under-
lying them are the same as are com-
monly used in the text-books on the
subject.
It is plotted to a logarithmic scale
and is of sufficient scope and accuracy
for the usual problems.
Curves (that very probably are
straight lines) for values of k and
f.
— are given.
f.
For doubly reinforced beams the
d'
chart is correct when — = i/io. Judi-
d
cious approximation aided by the few
d'
loci given for values of — other than
d
i/io will enable the designer to use the
chart to secure sufficiently accurate re-
d'
suits when — does not equal i/io.
d
It is based on n= 15 which is the
value of n recommended by most au-
thorities and the value most commonly
used. A chart in which n may have
any value would be of great value in
making theory approximate more
closely to experimental data.
In using the chart the interpolation
of curves will often be found neces-
sary; it can be easily done and with
ample accuracy.
Theory.
A study of the moment equations
governing the design of simply rein-
forced concrete beams will show that
they can all be written as functions of
"fs fa
—- and — or if n be equal to 15 as

f. f8
functions of — ( —■ is usually known

in
or easily ascertained.) It is therefore
the value with which to start a
straight-forward solution of a rein-
forced concrete beam. Whether we
take the unit stresses recommended by
the Joint Committee, by the A. R. E.
A., or any other set makes no differ-
ence whatsoever in the ease with which
the solution can be accomplished.
Simple Reinforced Concrete
Beams
The procedure to design a beam
simply reinforced to carry a certain
bending moment M with certain allow-
able stresses is as follows. Divide the
allowable fH bv the allowable fc thus
obtaining the value of
f.
fc
Find this
f,
value on the chart on the curve
f,
From it move vertically to the p' = o
curve. This point on the p' =o curve
lies where some p curve intersects the
p' = o curve. The value of this p
curve gives the p to use. The abscissa
of this point on the p' = o curve gives
M
the value of K to be used in K =
bd2f8
(i). Equation (r) can then be solved
for bd2 which completes the solution
for moment. To t&gt; and d such values
can then be assigned as shear require-
ments may demand. If shear require-
ments are so large as to govern the
dimensions of the beam the design for
moment is accomplished by solving
(i) for K, fs being used at its allow-
able value. The p to use is that of the
p curve which intersects the p' = o
curve at the point whose abscissa is K.
Doubly Reinforced Concrete
Beams
Suppose the dimensions b and d of
a beam to carry a certain M, with cer-
tain allowable stresses, are arbitrarily
fixed by such limitations as head room,
clearance, architectural effects, shear
requirements, etc., the procedure would
then be as follows. Solve equations
(I) and (II) for K and L. Using K
as an abscissa and L as an ordinate
plot a point on the chart. If the point
falls below or on the p' = o curve the
beam can be designed as a simple
beam ; the value of p to use being that
of the p curve which intersects the
p'=o curve at the point whose ab-
scissa is K. If the point falls well
above the p' -=0 curve the beam must
be a doubly reinforced one. The val-
ues of p and p' to use are those of the
p and p' curves on which the point
falls. If the point falls above the
p' = 0 curve and beyond the scope of
the chart the beam is very probably
impossible as a reinforced concrete
beam and recourse must be had to
structural steel.
If the point falls but a short distance
above the p' = o curve it is possible
to design the beam as a simply rein-
forced one. The procedure is as fol-
lows. Proceed horizontally from the
point until the p' = o curve is inter-
sected. The value of the p curve that
meets the p' = o curve at this point of
intersection gives the value of p to use
for designing the beam with tensile re-
inforcement only. The actual fc will
be the same as the allowable fc, but
the actual f9 will be less than the al-
lowable fs. Carefully made cost fig-
ures are the only means of determining
whether this simply reinforced beam
will be cheaper than a doubly rein-
forced one.


TUB MICHIGAN TECHXIC
From the above it can be readily
seen that the design of simple beams
and doubly reinforced beams merge
into each other and that the chart
bridges the seeming gap that has here-
tofore been left unbridged by all
writers on the subject.
To find M when p, p', b, d, the al-
lowable fa and the allowable fP are
given, proceed as follows. Read oft
the abscissa K of the intersection of
the p and p' curves, then evaluate
equation (I) for M; or read off the
ordinate L of the intersection of the
p and p' curves and evaluate equation
(II) forM.
T-Beams.
A T-beam can be regarded as a
large rectangular beam minus two
rectangular beams, or if we combine
the two small beams, as a large rec-
tangular beam minus a smaller rec-
tangular beam. Referring to the beam-
section on the chart A BCD is the large
rectangular beam and the empty rec-
tangular spaces under the flanges of
the T-beam added together form the
smaller rectangular beam.
Let M, the allowable fs and the al-
lowable fr be given. First, design a
simple rectangular beam that will
carry the given M with the given al-
lowable f, and f,. Having found bd2,
assign to b a value in accordance with
some rules, such as those of the Joint
Committee, and then solve for d.
Ascertain the amount of tensile steel
reinforcement required and make the
width of the stem such that it can be
properly arranged. We now have the
approximate dimensions of the T-
beam. At this point it is well to in-
vestigate the shear in different sections
of the beam. Assuming that we have
found that the shear is sufficiently well
taken care of, we can proceed to finish
the design for moment.
The expression for the value for k
usually given in the text-books can be
f.
written as a function of — (assuming
f.
n= T5). This means that for every
f.
value of — there will be found on the
f,
same vertical line a point on the k
curve (or straight line) whose ordi-
nate gives the value of k correspond-
fs
ing to the value of —.
f.
Having found the value of k locate
the neutral axis of the T-beam. If
kd is less than, equal to, or very nearly
equal to t (the thickness of the flange
usually determined by the floor slab
design) the neutral axis lies in the
flange, at the bottom of the flange or
but a short distance below the flange,
in which case the design of our T-
beam for moment is already complete.
If kd is much greater than t the neutral
axis lies well down in the web. To se-
cure a correct theoretical solution it
then is necessary to ascertain how
much M is carried by the two imagin-
ary beams under the flanges.. At this
point a little thought discloses that
since these imaginary beams cause a
loss of resisting M, it is necessary to&gt;
deepen d. Having deepened d accord-
ing to our best judgment, the next
thing is to find by the formula
M = Kbd-fs how much resisting M
the deepened beam is capable of sus-
taining at the allowable unit stresses,
the beam being considered as a simple
rectangular beam, of width b, and
depth d, equal to the deepened d. The
p to use is that of the p curve which
intersects the p' =0 curve at the point
whose abscissa.is K. Again the neu-
tral axis is located by the same process
as before, and as before, if the neutral'


ii3
axis is in the flange, in the lower edge
of the flange or very close up to the
bottom of the flange the design for
moment is complete. If the neutral
axis comes well down in the web it
is necessary to ascertain how much
resisting moment is carried by the
imaginary beams under the flanges.
kd —t
From the stress diagram, k,= ,
di
the symbols for the imaginary beam
being distinguished by the subscript I.
The K, corresponding to this kj is the
abscissa of the k, on the chart. Solve
the equation M, = K1h,d1af, in which
b, is the combined Avidth of the two
imaginary beams and dx their depth.
This M, is the resisting moment car-
ried by the two imaginary beams. The
p, to use is that of the p curve which
intersects the p' = o curve at the point
whose abscissa is K,. If to Ml we add
the M caused by the loading and thus
obtain a sum equal to the resisting M
of the enlarged beam our solution for
moment is complete. If their sum is
considerably different from it, d
should be increased or decreased until
they are closely equal, the same pro-
cedure being gone through as before.
The amount of tensile steel needed for
the T-Beam is equal to pbd — PiKd^

Doubly Reinforced T-Beams.
After the student has thoroughly
grasped the foregoing solutions of the
Doubly Reinforced Rectangular Beams
and the Simply Reinforced T-beam he
will find it easy to devise a method,
parallel to that given for simple T-
beams, for designing doubly reinforced
T-beams; it being only needful to re-
member that the resisting M of the
larger beam is that of a doubly rein-
forced beam and that k is a function of
f,

fo
gram) and as such is primarily inde-
pendent of the amount or location of
the compressive steel reinforcement. It
is j that is primarily dependent on the
amount and location of the compres-
sive steel reinforcement.
This article shows that the chart
makes possible a simple, direct, exact
and complete solution of the problem
of designing a reinforced concrete
beam. Note that all equations used
are very simple.

ther along these lines are referred to

AGGREGATES
BY GEORGE H. RUHLING
Object.
During the seasons of 1914 and 1915 the writer served as deputy county
•surveyor for Seneca County, Ohio. While in this capacity he was called
upon many times to pass judgment upon different kinds of aggregates in the
erection of concrete structures. Tn Seneca county there are many lime-
stone quarries and few gravel deposits. Owing to this face nearly all con-
crete in that county is made from limestone aggregates. Tt is the opinion
of many engineers in that locality that the screenings from limestone should
not be used alone for fine aggregate in concrete because, it is alleged, the
screenings contain too much fine material called flour. In the Seneca county
specifications it was stipulated that all fine aggregate should be not less than
50% lake or clean bank sand. The other 50% might be limestone screen-
ings. This stipulation was always a source of argument between the con-
tractors and the engineer for the county, the contractors arguing that screen-
ings produced just as good and just as strong concrete as bank or lake sand.
It is the primary object of this test to show which aggregate, limestone
sand or lake sand, makes the strongest concrete.
A secondary object of the test is to show that by proper proportioning
of aggregate a stronger concrete than the arbitrary 1:2 14 mixture may be
had, using the same amount of cement with the same total quantities of
aggregates.
Outline of Prockihtrk.
While on a trip to Seneca county, Ohio, in December, 1915, the writer
visited the quarries of the France Stone Co., at liloomvillc, and through the
kindness of the superintendent of the Company, secured samples of all the
different grades of stone used in making concrete. These were shipped to
the Highway laboratory of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, and
used in the following described tests. The amounts and the kinds of sand
shipped were as follows:
France Stone Co. Xo. 3 stone about 160 lbs.
France Stone Co. Xo. 4 stone about 80 lbs.
France Stone Co. Xo. 5 stone. about 80 lbs.
France Stone Co. XTo. 7 stone about 80 lbs.
Canadian Lake Sand about 80 lbs.
Bank Sand about 20 lbs.
Four batches of three 6" cubes and as many bricks as material per-
mitted, were made up as follows:
Firts batch: 1 part cement, 2 parts No. 7 stone, 4 parts of No. 3 and
No. 4 stone evenly mixed.


Second batch: 1 part cement, 2 parts lake sand, 4 parts stone as above.
Both of the above batches were proportioned by measure, as ordinarily done
by contractors.
Third batch: same amount of cement by weight as in (11 and (2) with
aggregates proportional according to Fuller's ideal curve for maximum
density, using No. 7 stone screenings as fine aggregate.
Fourth'batch: same as (3) but using Canadian l.ake sand as fine aggre-
gate.
One cube of each was tested at 3, 7, and 28 days compression. One
brick of each kind was tested in tension after 7 and 28 days. Cubes and
bricks were seasoned one day in moist air and in water from then on until
tested.
Four batches of 15—1 13 briquettes each were made up as follows:
First batch of standard Ottawa Sand.
Second batch of No. 7 stone screenings.
Third batch of Canadian Lake sand.
Fourth batch of bank sand.
Five briquettes of each kind were tested in tension at 3, 7, and 28 days.
Briquettes were seasoned one day in moist air and in water from then orr
until tested.
A sieve analysis of all samples, as well as a determination of the per
cent of impurities in bank sand, were made.
Laboratory Work Performance:.
The following mixtures were used for the 6" cubes and bricks.
First batch, 3 cubes 1 '2 :4 mix by measure.
Weight cement 10.62 lbs.
Weight No. 7 stone screenings 21.71 lbs.
Weight No. 3 stone 20.05 lbs.
Weight No. 4 stone 19.79 lbs.
Second batch, 3 cubes 1.2 -.4 mix by measure.
Weight cement 10.62 lbs.
Weight Canadian lake sand 22.82 lbs.
Weight No. 3 stone 20.05 lbs.
Weight No. 4 stone '9-79 lbs.
Third batch. 3 cubes 1 :26 :3.4 mix by weight. Ideal mixture.*
Weight cement 10.62 lbs.
Weight No. 7 stone screenings 27.80 lbs.
Weight No. 3 stone 28.70 lbs.
Weight No. 4 stone 7.44 lbs.
Fourth batch, 3 cubes 1 :2.i 13.9 mix by weight. Ideal mixture.
Weight cement 10.62 lbs.
Weight Canadian lake sand 22.30 lbs.
Weight No. 3 stone 28. 70 lbs.
Weight No. 4 stone 12.75 lbs.
Note: Cubes were 6" by 6" by 6". Bricks were 8-H" by 3^" by 4".
* This proved not to be the ideal mixture as will be discussed later on.

The following mixtures were used for the briquettes: Proportion: I
part cement to 3 parts fine aggregate. 15 briquettes of each kind made.
First batch, 1 part to 3 parts standard Ottawa sand.
Second batch, 1 part cement to 3 parts No. 7 stone screenings

Discussion.
An examination of the screen records for the different aggregates dis-
closes the following:
With the No. 3 stone there was a rather large percentage of stone
smaller than three-quarter-inch and an insufficient quantity of one-inch stone.
Either the lower screen was inclined too much or was not of sufficient length
to thoroughly screen the undersized stone out. The Xo. 5 stone did contain
enough of the onc-quarter-inch to three-quarter-inch. The Xo. 4 stone was
screened very close to the theoretical grading as was also the Xo. 7 stone
screenings.

Witli reference to the ideal fine aggregate curve shown on plate 4, the
lane sand, contrary to the generally accepted idea of engineers and laymen
in Seneca County, was farthest removed from it. This curve shows the lake
sand to be much too fine to he used alone as a fine aggregate for concrete of
high strength. The bank sand is a little nearer the ideal curve but is also
much too fine. The Xo. 7 crushed stone sand was found to lie very much
closer to the ideal curve than either of the two above mentioned. The sig-
nificance of these facts is well brought out in the tensile tests of the briq-
uettes.
Plates 5 and 6 show the ideal combination curves for the two kinds of
fine aggregates and the proportions by weight, of the different aggregates
as determined by their ideal mix curves. On plate 6 I have shown an extra
curve representing the 1 :2 4 mix by measure using the lake sand for fine
aggregate. The reason for putting this curve on will be apparent later on
in this discussion.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Plates 7 and 8 show graphically the results of the compression and
tension tests. In the tests for tension with the briquettes it is thought that
each kind were tested for each period. Their averages, maximum and min-
imum values were plotted. Tn all 60 briquettes were tested. A study of
these curves is interesting. It is found that the lake sand produced the
lowest values.
fjj atf- ft
The hank sand came next, being yfo higher for average at 28 days.
The standard Ottawa sand followed, being 38% stronger than the lake sand
for average at 28 days. The No. 7 stone screenings topped the list, being
89% stronger than the lake sand for average of 28 days.


119
At first thought it would seem strange that the No. 7 stone screenings
showed higher average 3-day strength than at 7 days. However, this is very
likely due to the fact that the stone screenings contained some free lime
which accelerated the strength and setting capacity of the cement in the first
few days. The briquettes being kept in water after the first day, soon be-
came filled with water which allowed the lime to hydrate. This in turn did
away with the accelerating capacity of the 'lime thereby causing a slight
reduction in the strength of the cement at 7 days.
It was found that the bank sand contained slightly over 6% impurities
such as clay, loam, vegitable matter, etc. Tt is the opinion of the writer that
if this had been washed out before the tests were made on the bank sand a

somewhat higher tensile strength would have resulted. The lake sand was
quite free from impurities.
The tensile tests on the bricks should not be relied upon too strongly
as only one or two of each were broken owing to insufficient quantity of
samples. But the results do unmistakably point to the fact that for an arbi-
trary 112:4 mix. the llake sand makes much the stronger concrete for tensile
strength. Also, which is more to the point, that by a proper recombination
of the same aggregates, as shown in Plates 5 and 6, well graded screenings
will make just as strong, perhaps a stronger concrete in tension.
With reference to the compression tests shown graphically on Plate 8
we find:
Although but one cube of each kind was tested for each period of time,
the same facts are brought out as in the tests on bricks for tension, viz.:
that for ordinary 1.2 4 mixes the lake sand gives the strongest concrete bv


THE MICHIGAN TECHSIC
about 40%, also, that by proper recombination of the same total quantity of
aggregates, well graded stone screenings will make as strong and possibly
stronger concrete than the lake sand. The results show the stone screen-
ings to be 16% stronger than the strongest lake sand cubes.
Contrary to expectations, the 1 :2 14 large sand cubes, as well as bricks,
gave a higher strength than the computed ideal mixtures for lake sand
shown on sheet. It was for this reason the writer plotted the curve for the

mixture 1:2 14 on this same plate. It will be seen that this curve follows the
ideal curve closer than the computed combined curve in the lower parts, but
diverges more where the aggregates are of large size. The results show,
therefore, that it is more important that the combined curve fits the ideal
curve in the lower parts than in the upper.
Conclusion.
In general conclusion two main facts stand out. First: It will always
pay to screen aggregates and find out the proper combination whereby the
densest concrete may be had. Second: Stone screenings concrete if prop-
erly proportioned and the stone screenings well graded will make iust as
strong and probably stronger concrete than ordinary lake sand.

EDITORIAL
THE HONOR SYSTEM cerpt from our editorial columns of a
'"The direct facing of the question year ago, may serve as a record of
of cheating in examinations is gener- conditions and general student senti-
ally avoided as long as possible by ment from which to judge the success
both Faculty and students. No Col- of the present method of conducting
lege in the University of Michigan examinations in the Engineering Col-
has as yet met this problem squarely, lege.
and as a result of this apathy, it was The Honor Committee, through the
inevitable that the practice should answers received to questions submit-
come to be looked upon lightly by stu- ted to the students, was able to show,
dents, that successful cribbing should in their report to the Faculty just be-
even become an achievement of which fore the spring recess, a strong senti-
to be proud, and that drastic measures ment among the student body against
would finally be necessary to stop the the practice of cheating and a faith in
growing evil." The foregoing, an ex- the Honor System as a remedy for


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
this evil. There was an almost unani-
mous desire for the retention of the
system under which the final exam-
inations were conducted for the first
semester. Many helpful suggestions
were turned in, indicating an earnest
interest in the success of the Commit-
tee's work.
While it was hoped that every case
of dishonesty arising during the ex-
aminations would be settled in the
classroom by the students, the fact
that in a few cases no action was tak-
en at the time of the offense did not
lessen the efficacy of the system. All
cases reported to them were thorough-
ly investigated by the Committee and
action taken either directly or through
the Faculty. In one case so serious a
penalty as expulsion was inflicted.
Minor discipline was effected in other
cases.
We believe that the students of the
College of Engineering deserve the
honor resting with them implied by
the continued conduct of class work,
tests and examinations under this sys-
tem this semester. What better train-
ing in the ethics of engineering can
be had than this? The engineer must
be a man of absolute honor and integ-
rity if either he or the profession is to
attain the highest ideals. The expert
must never betray the faith placed in
the truth of his testimony. His hon-
or is of greater weight than his ac-
curacy. The man, who, while in col-
lege, works in an atmosphere of indi-
vidual honor, will have a much deeper
appreciation of the higher ideals of
the profession than he who compels
himself to be forced to be honorable.
In another opportunity within a
few weeks to take the final examina-
tions upon honor, we believe that
there will be far less than the few
cases which occasioned discipline in
February. The sentiment in favor of
this method is growing outside the
College of Engineering and will prob-
ably be crystallized in the form of an
Honor System in some of the other
Colleges of the University in time. In
the meantime, it is for us to in every
way possible add to its strength in this
College. Next fall four hundred new
men will enter upon engineering
courses. They must be taught the
thing from the first. Naturally they
will be influenced largely by the con-
duct of the older classes. In the ways
of the latter they will aim to follow.
This entails a great responsibility up-
on these older classmen. It is for the
present Freshman, Sophomore and
Junior classes to make the system as
nearly ideal as possible and to instill
into their minds the one idea—honor.
PREPAREDNESS AND ENGI-
NEERING
Recently the technical magazines
have contained a great deal relative to
the service which engineers can ren-
der in the event of war. The writers
have demonstrated that the ability of
the country to resist invasion is large-
ly dependent upon the genius and re-
sourcefulness of its engineers. Per-
haps no other field of human endeav-
or makes such broad demands upon
the science of engineering as the prac-
tice of modern warfare. The marine,
chemical, electrical, mechanical and
civil engineer are all called upon to
contribute their knowledge.
To the average undergraduate in
engineering, however, the question of
preparedness is of little more than
passing interest. He has not yet ac-
quired the experience and judgment
which would make him of service in


123
military matters. He may have his
personal opinions regarding the value
•of military preparation to the coun-
try at large but he sees no benefit to
be derived by him as an individual.
On the campus, the movement for
preparedness has resulted in an at-
tempt to secure military training. To
many, this suggests an endless routine
of drills, inarching and shouting of or-
ders and much so-called "red-tape."
But let us consider. Military training
•enforces strict compliance with orders
and the prompt and exact fulfillment
of all commands. It teaches one to
give attention to details, creates re-
sourcefulness and produces physical
well-being. Those in command are
taught to use their judgment and how
to deal with men.
The experience and training secur-
ed in military service should be of in-
estimable value to the young engineer-
ing undergraduate who is soon to go
forth in search of a position. There
is a great similarity between those
principles which are the foundation of
an efficient military organization and
those which the modern business
world requires. Inattention, lack of
diligence, and tardiness may often cost
a man his job. A strict observance of
those lessons which military training
teaches will enable the young man to
■"make good," and the physical and
moral benefit gained therefrom should
furnish him with a firm foundation on
which to build a successful career.
THE INLANDER
It is with the very best wishes for
its success that The Technic wel-
comes the advent of The Inlander—a
long lost brother—back into the fold
of campus publications.
Founded in 1908 by the Class of
"91, The Inlander, for some 16 years,
held a real and honorable place in the
life of the University, when through
lack of interest or proper supervision
it was discontinued.
Under the management of its pres-
ent organization and with proper in-
terest on the part of the student body,
we look for a re-establishment of its
old-time prestige. It fills a real need
as an outlet for the literary ability of
those students whose talents in a lit-
erary direction are not suited for the
humorous pages of The Gargoyle, the
reportorial columns of The Daily, or
the technical discussions of our publi-
cation.
With a realization by the students
of the advantages it offers, and the
real place it should fill in the life of
the University, we look forward to a
long and prosperous career for The
Inlander.
SENIOR MEMORIALS
What may develop into the biggest
move ever undertaken by Michigan
graduates, was the step taken by the
■combined senior classes memorial
committee in bringing forth the idea
of the James Burrill Angell Memorial
Fund as the all senior class memorial.
The scheme is a sort of dual one in
its nature. It provides, in the first
place, for a bronze tablet to be put in
the new library in a conspicuous place
by each departing class as the tangible
part of the memorial. A plan is now
being worked out which will care for
the tablets of senior classes for a hun-
dred years. The plate for each year's
class will be of uniform size but the
inscription may differ for each.
The other part of the memorial is
that part which is given in a spirit of
appreciation for what the University
lias done for its students as under-


THE MICHIGAN TliCHNIC
graduates. It consists in the combin-
ing of the funds which each separate
senior class would use for a memorial,
into one fund to be given to the Uni-
versity free of all limitations. Its ex-
penditure is to be directed by a com-
mittee composed of the President of
the University, the President and the
General Secretary of the Alumni As-
sociation.
The advantages of the plan are sev-
eral. It will do away with the old idea
of giving useless bric-a-brac, a scheme
which in the past has resulted in the
loss of thousands of dollars and which
has failed almost completely in leav-
ing any real, permanent memorials.
Very little of the money spent has
aided the University, and the ques-
tion each year of what should be giv-
en has often resulted in wrangles in
classes just at a time when they should
be most closely united, that is, just
before graduation. The new scheme
insures a permanent memorial of the
class in the form of a tablet; it draws
the different senior classes together by
making them realize that they are re-
presentative of a university rather
than of a department or college; and
an actual benefit is conferred upon the
University by the departing classes.
What we like about the plan is the
idealism of it, the part which calls for
the giving of money which can be
spent in any way which will benefit
the University. It is away from the
petty idea of giving only when the
giver can see in cold and hard facts
what his money is going to be spent
for. It is the putting of university
above college and department. It is
the beginning of the development of
the big, generous attitude of giving
freely to our Alma Mater, which may
later expand into a system similar to
the Yale scheme of alumni contribu-
tions which now affords an income of
$100,000 annually to that school.
It is a big idea. Failure to adopt it
will be a step backward.
STANDARD SYMBOLS
The College of Engineering main-
tains no standard code for the symbol-
ic representation of technical terms.
In some of the courses as many as
three different symbols are used to
represent a single term. This situa-
tion is as regretable as it is confusing.
In practice standard codes are
adopted by common consent. One of
the functions of the large engineering
societies is the promotion of co-opera-
tion among the members, and as a
means toward this end standard sys-
tems of notation for technical terms
are fostered. In the college is the
proper place for the correction of
such difficulties as now exist. It is
here that the engineer first becomes
acquainted with the terms and sym-
bols which he is to use in his practice.
It is true that the various text-
books in use do not all use the same
systems of notation, but this should
not prevent the College from adopting
a standard code. Such a step would
hasten the day when all authors and
schools would appreciate the situation
and lend their aid toward its better-
ment.

Neva Fellowships in Chemical Engineering
Two additional fellowships in Chemical
Engineering have recently hcen accepted
by the Board of Regents.
The Detroit Steel Castings Company
have established a fellowship for the in-
vestigation of flaws in steel castings with
particular application to the pots used in
case-hardening and heat-treating steel.
This fellowship has a value of $503 and
has been awarded to Edward R. Young,
R.Ch.E. 1015.
The Detroit Copper and Brass Rolling
Mills have established a fellowship of the
same value which will probably not be
awarded until next year. A study will be
made of methods for the elimination of
blow-holes in copper billets and brass in-
gots.
The Chemical Engineering Department
now has seven fellowships: two in Gas
Manufacture; one in Paints and Varnish-
es; one in Paper Manufacture: and three
in Metallurgy;—one supported by the De-
troit Edison Co., one by the Detroit Steel
Castings Co., and one by the Detroit Cop-
per and Brass Rolling Mills.
It was thought that these opportunities
for advanced work deserved more publici-
ty than they were receiving, and conse-
quently a special number of the University
Bulletin has been issued which deals with
opportunities in Chemical Engineering.
About 4.000 copies have been sent to pro-
fessional men, colleges and preparatory
schools, and other universities. The bulle-

tin deals in general, with the field of Chem-
ical Engineering; in particular, with the
work given at Michigan, with special em-
phasis placed on the opportunities for re-
search, the equipment of the department,
the plants visited, and concludes with the
detailed statement of the courses taught in
Chemical Engineering. Responses in the

form of applications for fellowships have
already begun to come in from as far as
New Hampshire, Texas, and California.
It is hoped that some further effects will
be seen in next fall's enrollment. The past
rapid growth of the department is shown
in the accompanying curves. The large
increase this past year is doubtless due to


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
the awakened sense of the country's de-
pendence on the chemist and chemical en-
gineer, brought about by the war. All in-
dications point to this increase being per-
manent and to the possibility of maintain-
ing the same rate of increase. The most
encouraging thing in the curves is the uni-
formity with which the enrollment has
grown for more than twenty years.
Experimental Flume
Negotiations which have been under way
between the Detroit Edison Company and
members of the Engineering College Fac-
ulty, render very probable the erection of
an experimental flume, to be located below
the Argo Dam, at the east end of the Argo
Spillway. Plans have already been pre-
pared and the accompanying sketch will
afford a clear idea of the contemplated lay-
out of the flume.
The flume will be 137 feet long and 6.56
feet wide. It will have a capacity of 225
cubic feet per second when carrying a
depth of water of 8 feet. The water will
be measured by a standard Bazin Weir at
the downstream end of the flume.
The flume will afford unexcelled oppor-
tunities for research with aerated and sub-
merged weirs, large submerged orifices,
and experiments upon the many different
methods of measuring water.
The first experiments to be performed
in the flume will be made upon the sharp
crested Bazin Weir with the aerated nappe.
The salt solution and color method of gag-
ing will be checked against the Bazin Weir
formula for heads upon the weir up to 1.78
feet, (the upper limit of the Bazin experi-
ment upon weirs). Experiments will then
be made with beads on the weirs up to 4
feet, measuring the water by means of the
salt solution method. Data will thus be
available for testing the accuracy of the
application of the Bazin Weir formula for
heads from 1.78 to 4.00 feet.
Construction will be started in June so
that the flume will be completed and equip-
ped for experimental work in the Fall of
jqi6.

Auto Engineering
The Regents, in February, authorized
the construction of the new automobile
laboratory. The old campus power house
is to be remodeled, and Supt. Marks of the
Buildings and Grounds Department, has
been given instructions to handle the work.
The general layout of the laboratory is
clearly shown in the diagram drawings.
The work of remodeling will be completed
during the summer, and apparatus will be
mercial field and to this end Prof. Fish-
leigh has taken an active part in the af-
fairs of the Society of Auto Engineers,
whose membership comprises 1,600 or more
of the auto industry's leading engineers,
and an organization which is not one in
name merely, but which at the present
time, is responsible for practically all of
the development work in this field of en-
gineering. Through his connection with
the Research Division of the Society, the

installed, ready for laboratory work in the
fall.
This will give the University of Michi-
gan unexcelled facilities in the Automobile
Engineering course, which has, in the last
few years, shown a very healthy growth
tinder Prof. Fishleigh's direction. The
growing interest in the course is demon-
strated by the remarkable increase in en-
rollment this semester. The total is 152, an
increase of 50% over the enrollment of
last year.
It is the aim of the department to keep
the student in close touch with the com-
University profits by the very extensive re-
search work which the Society has under
way at all times. As the Chairman of the
Engine and Transmission Division, he is
working with such prominent men in the
industry as O. E. Hunt, Chief Engineer
of the Packard Motor Car Co., W. A.
Frederick, Chief Engineer of the Conti-
nental Motor &amp; Mfg. Co., E. G. Gunn, En-
gineer of the Xorthway Motor &amp; Mfg. Co.,

Manager of the Brown-Lipe Gear Co. This
committee is a division of the Standard*
Committee of the Society. All problems of
design and standardization of motors, trans-
missions, clutches, etc., which come before
the general society, arc referred to this
committee. It is in this way that the Uni-
versity keeps the Auto Department in close
touch with the commercial world, which is
a great advantage to the student enrolled
in its courses.
Safely on the Huron
Every year the Huron River above the
Argo Dam has claimed, as its toll, the lives
of two or three students. This is due to
the fact that no proper means of rescue
have been provided for along the river
bank, in case a person capsized in a canoe
or was thrown into the water by collision.
To remedy this needless sacrifice of lives,
the University Boat Club this year has agi-
tated and is furthering a program whereby
the danger of canoeing will be reduced to
a minimum. This program, if lived up to
by students, will result in a year and a
future, free from those pathetic incidents
which break in on our university life with
a cruel shock at too frequent intervals.
In the first place, the general aquatic
safety rules must be respected. Inexperi-
enced canoeists should never paddle alone
or go far from the boat house until they
have become acquainted with the nature
of the craft. Fooling in canoes must be
abolished, and it is the duty of any stu-
dent who sees such performances to ad-
monish the light-headed canoeist.
Safety devices, in the form of air cush-
ions, have been provided for each passen-
ger, and a motor life boat will patrol the
river on crowded days, manned by a po-
liceman. Safety stations, containing life
buoys to the number of ten. which have
been donated by campus societies, have
been erected on the banks of the river in
zigzag fashion, one quarter of a mile apart.
Triangles, junior honorary society, donat-
ed the first buoy and they were followed
by the Sphinx. Adelphi, Alpha Xu,
Triangles' Safety Station*
Dcutscher Yerein, Upper Peninsula Club-,
and Griffins in the order named.
The Michigan Edison Company has been
prevailed upon to clear the course of the
river of obstructing stumps, trees, and
rocks; and a man from their force will be
detailed to reduce accidents in portaging
at Barton Dam. Plans for a lift have also
been considered with landing platforms.

M. E. Lab. 'Time Cards
This semester, a new system for increas-
ing efficiency in the handling of men and
work in the Mechanical Engineering Lab-
oratory courses has been introduced by
Prof. J. A. Bursley. A time clock and
work card are utilized.
At the beginning of the semester, each
student is assigned a number, which is to
identify him during the entire semester.
When he reports for work in one of the
M. E. Laboratory courses, he reports at a
rack where the work cards are distributed.
The student is given the card which bears
his number.
The work card is blocked off for tabu-
lated record and conveys all necessary in-
formation to the student, as to the work
he is to perform. In the upper left hand
corner of the card is a space for record-
ing time. To avoid confusion at the t'me
clock, all cards are stamped as "rung in"
at 1.1 P. M. or 6 minutes after one, as the
decimal time system is used. At 1.1 P. M.
the rack is closed and the remaining cards
taken to the M. E. offices. A student who
is late, must call here for his card, and
the actual time the card is given out, is
recorded above the 1.1 P. M. The clock
used is very similar to the average factory
time clock, except that the decimal time
system is used.
When a student has finished his work
for the day in a course, he returns his card
to an instructor, who fills out certain mem-
oranda, which constitutes the official record
kept of the work done. The card is then
"rung out" and filed. In this way an ab-
solute check is kept on the time put in.
The system is working out very well and
is even more successful than was expected.
New Department of Aeronautics
Beginning with the fall term in 1916. the
University will have a department of Aero-
nautics, under the direction of Prof. Sad-
ler and Assistant Prof. Pawlowski. We
feci that this department will be a distinct
addition to the curriculum of the Univer-
sity. Without going into detail, the courses
to be offered are outlined below.
1. General Aeronautics.
2. Theory of Aviation.
3. Theory and Design of Propellers.
4. Aeroplane Design.
5. Aerodynamic Laboratory.
6. Design of Aeronautic Motors.
-. Theory of Balloons and Dirigibles.
8. Design of Balloons and Dirigibles.
9. Theory and Design of Kites.
10. Design of Aerodromes and Hangars.

Marked Increase in English Courses
Recent letters from Alumni have been*
received by the English department re-
marking about the little interest taken by
Engineers in English, and their poor abil-
ity as writers of business letters.
It will probably be of vital interest to-
both student body and Alumni to hear of
the strides that the Engineering English
department is making. Out of the l,?6r&gt;
students in the Colleges of Engineering
and Architecture, 1,200 are taking English
this year, or over 4/5 of the students of
these colleges.
The new course of note-taking given-
this semester, has been welcomed by the
student body, sixty-five having enrolled in
that course. In Business English, 207 stu-
dents are enrolled in the courses. This
will probably be a welcome statement to
the ears of our Alumni who have come to
realize the advantages of this kind of Eng-
lish in preparation for life in the business
world.
It will be a pleasant surprise to many to-
learn that the increase in those taking re-
quired work from 1912 to 1916 has only
been 34 students. In other words the re-
quirements have not been changed, but the
increase in the number taking Elective
English is 6.tg, or an increase of nearly
400% over the enrollment of 1912.


THE MICHIGAN TBCHNIC
Group Eleclivcs
A new system of group e'.ectives has
been introduced in the Electrical Engineer-
ing Department under which a man can
select fourteen hours of electives from
among 39 to 66 hours, depending upon the
.group.
Under the old system, there was no free-
dom of electives. A striking feature of
this new system is, that every group in-
cludes one or more courses in Political
Economy. Students in the Power and Rail-
way group are urged to take fundamental
courses in other departments in preference
to highly specialized courses in Electrical
Engineering. The telephone group in-
cludes courses in experimental Psychology
and general linguistics. The illumination
group contains courses in Philosophy,
Architecture, and Fine Arts. This is in
line with the University's policy to increase
the cultural requirements of engineers.
Engineers' Spring Trip
Thirty-five Spring Trippers left Ann Ar-
hor April 5th and returned April 18th
from the annual engineering inspection
trip through the East. At various times
the party was split into groups of electri-
cals, under the guidance of Asst. Prof.
Lovell, civils with Mr. Bringhurst and the
mechanicals with Asst. Prof. Verner so
that places of direct interest to each group
could he visited. Several marine and chem-
ical engineering students, who were along,
chose groups that interested them the
most.
At the first stop, Youngstown. Ohio, the
mechanicals and electricals saw iron ore
transformed into tubes and other commer-
cial forms of steel by an elaborate system
of the latest type of steel mill machinery.
Here also we were openly let into the
game of shrapnel making. The plants vis-
ited were the Youngstown Sheet and Tube
Co., the Republic Iron and Steel Co., and
the William Todd Machine Works. The
civils also visited the Trussed Concrete Co.,
and the electricals inspected the new muni-
cipal power plant. Mr. W. C. Coryell, '96F.
save us his whole day and took us to the
steel mills in a private car furnished by
the Youngstown alumni. Several other
alumni were met at dinner after which
they helped us startle the natives with a
few yells.
At Pittsburg the mechanicals and elec-
tricals spent a whole day at the Westing-
house Electric and Mfg. Co., and the West-
inghouse Machine Co., and were served
a chicken dinner at noon. Our guides here,
as well as at several other plants, were
Two 30.000 K.W. Units at Philadelphia
Electric Co. Plant
technical graduates taking shop training
courses and all made us feel at home by
the enthusiasm with which they explained
details and answered questions. We were
also given the pleasure of talking with sev-
eral of our alumni who are "up'' in the
Westinghouse world.
The civils visited the American Bridge
Co. and in the evening were banqueted at
the Henry Hotel by about twelve alumni


131
who are with the Fittsburg-Des Moines
Iron and Steel Co.
Architecture was the main thing to be
seen in Washington but the manufacture
of fourteen-inch guns and other naval
equipment at the U. S. Navy Yard was
also very interesting. The capitol was in-
spected and Congress observed in session.
The Arlington Wireless station was also
visited.
On reaching Baltimore the civils were
entertained at lunch by Prof. Tilden, for-
merly at the U. of M., and now with Johns
Hopkins University. Frank Weaver, '14E,
the trips which the civils took, including
visits to a subway and the large municipal
pier, both under construction, and a drive
through the water supply system in which
the Kensico dam and several large reser-
voirs are located.
At the Brooklyn Navy Yard, the shops,
dry-docks and several types of submarines
and warships, both finished and under con-
struction, were seen. Other plants visited
were the American Telegraph and Tele-
phone laboratories and exchange, Singer
Sewing Machine Co., Interborough Trans-
it Co. Power plant, New York Central
The Boys at Philadelphia
also with Johns Hopkins University, con-
ducted the group to the famous Ba'tmore
sewage disposal plant.
Two days were spent in Philadelphia
where the new battleship Idaho and other
ships under construction were seei at the
New York Shipbui'ding Company's p'ant.
Other places visited were the Philadelphia
Electric Co., Electric Storage Battery Co.,
water purification plant. Independence
Hall, University of Pennsylvania, etc.
Our four days in New York were
marred only by the necessity of spending
two or three hours of valuable time each
night in the "hay." Mr. J. W. F. Bennett,
'qoE, one of New York's foremost consult-
ing engineers was responsible for many of
Terminal electrification, and the Pennsyl-
vania station. The last day and a half
spent in New York, Saturday afternoon
and Sunday, were given over to general
sight-seeing.
The mammoth General Electric plant in
Schenectady was visited by the whole par-
ty and a fine dinner was served to us in
the company's dining room. A complete
inspection of the American Locomotive
plant here was also made.
The above is but a scant outline of the
trip and cannot show how well it was
worked' out and enjoyed. For further de-
tails see any one of the party whom we
think are unanimous in voting it the best
jaunt ever.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
■Camp Davis
At present indications the Summer Camp
attendance promises to be a record break-
er as it is expected that over a hundred
will take to the tall pines this year.
The camp has been greatly improved by
the addition of a sewer and a septic tank
and a new permanent kitchen of galvanized
steel construction. Steel buildings have
also in part replaced the canvas tents. It
is the aim of the Surveying Department
to eventually replace the tents with steel
buildings as they cost but little more and
last much longer.
State Society Appointments
The Michigan (State) Engineering So-
ciety recently appointed a Committee on
Legislation consisting of Dean Bissell of
the Michigan Agricultural College, as
■chairman, and Prof. C. T. Johnston, Prof.
A. J. Decker, and L. C. Smith of the Uni-
versity of Michigan.
The society feels that engineers of the
state may be of greater service, than at
present, in public affairs that concern their
profession.
The work of the committee is therefore
to increase legislation and to arouse inter-
est along such lines as,—Drainage Laws,
Highway Laws, Administration of Streams,
City and Village Planning, etc.
-Electrical Laboratory
A series of experiments for the Elec-
trical Laboratory courses, are being de-
veloped by Professors Parker, Higbie, and
MacKavanagh, which, in conjunction with
the class room work, it is hoped will show
more clearly the various features in the
operation of electric machines, than do
the present series.
It is the opinion of the Electrical Engi-
neering faculty that the laboratory experi-
ments should be conducted more for the
purpose of elucidating principles than to
make a man an expert in commercial test-
ing.
Chemical Lectures
Prof. A. H. White read a paper on Feb.
3, before a meeting of the National Asso-
ciation of Lime Manufacturers in Cleve-
land on "The Use of Lime in Stucco and
Rich Mortars."
Prof. Ware and Prof. A. E. White both
spoke recently before the Ann Arbor En-
gineering Society; the former on "The
Disintegration of Concrete," and the latter,
on "Brass as an Engineering Material."
New Text
"Alternating Current Electricity" is the
title of a book by Profs. Timbel and Hig-
bie, which came off the press during the
week of March 15.
Varsity Band Manager Leaves
Mr. S. J. Hoexter, faculty manager of
the Varsity Band, and formerly an in-
structor in mechanical engineering, has re-
signed as instructor, to take the position
of works superintendent of the Garage
Foundry and Machine Company of Kala-
mazoo, Mich.
Laboratory Enlargement
The removal of the Highway Laboratory
permits Room 102 to be given over entire-
ly to the Testing Materials Laboratory.
The enrollment in Engineering Mechanics
courses, 5 and 6, has taxed the facilities of
the laboratory to the utmost and Profes-
sor Menefee is contemplating the addition
of new benches and equipment for cement
testing.
Chemical Engineers' Vacation Trip
Upper classmen in chemical engineering
made a five days trip during the spring
vacation. Among the plants visited, were
the Postum Cereal Company of Battle
Creek, the Bryant Paper Company and the
Standard Paper Company of Kalamazoo,
the Illinois Steel Company, Gary, Indiana,
and the Universal Portland Cement Com-
pany, Buffington, Indiana. A number of
other plants were also included in the it-
inerary.

MECHANICAL
Heat Transmission Through Walls
In January of this year, the large box
which was constructed for the purpose of
investigating the transfer of heat through
walls, was mo\ed from its former location
in the Mold Loft of the Engineering Build-
ing to a new location outside the building.
It is now placed in the angle for.r.ed by
the walls of the Mechanical Laboratory
proper and the boiler room.
It may be remembered that the original
plan of testing was to maintain a sptcified
low temperature within the box, which, to-
gether with the room temperature without
the box, would cause a heat flow inwardly
through the walls. With this arrange-
ment, a successful preliminary test was se-
cured last year. Considerable difficulty
was experienced, however, in operating re-
frigerating plant to maintain a steady tem-
perature of brine circu'ating through the
coils within the box. The accurate meas-
urement of the temperature of the brine
entering and leaving the coils also pre-
sented difficulties. While the "ammonia
thermometer" which was developed for the
purpose, gave accurate results, it required
a great deal of care in handling.
When the box was moved to an out-
door location, the problem of furn shing,
regulating, and measuring the heat supply
to the inside of the box was at once solved
by electric heating coils. At the same
time, the measurement of the temperature
within the box by means of electric resist-
ance thermometers, which were also used
in the previous plan of testing, was easily
accomplished. The new difficulty was the
fact that the outside temperature could not
be controlled; but it was believed that peri-
ods of practically constant temperature
condition could be taken advantage of to
secure tests of several hours' duration; and
that tests might be carried for several days
at a time, wherein considerable fluctuations
in outside temperature could prevail with-
out introducing serious error in the re-
sults.
A recording thermometer whose bulb is
located within the box gives a record of
the inside temperatures. The record of the
outside .temperature can be secured at the
observatory, and this can be corrected to
temperature at the box by periodic read-
ings of outside temperature at the box.
Periodic readings of the electrical indicat-
ing instruments give a record of the heat
input. Rearrangement of the heating ele-
ment to provide for constant voltage is
now being made. This will permit the use
of an integrating wattmeter, which will be
loaned by the Detroit Edison Company
through the kindness of Mr. George Lewis.
It has been pretty definitely determined
that the heat loss from the box, with the
thick removable side in place, is 8.28 B.T.U.
per degree difference. The temperature
within the box was about 92° and the tem-
perature outside was about 16°, giving a
difference of 76°. As the box is 4' X4' x6',
inside dimensions, the inside surface is 128
sq. ft. and the value of K for the walls of
the box based on the inside surface is
0.0647. The walls are n" thick, consisting
of seasoned pine wood, air spaces and cork
filled spaces. The outside surface is, there-
fore, 250.8 sq. ft. and the value of K, fig-
ured on the outside surface is 0.0330.
Tests were made with the removable side
of the box replaced by a sash of ordinary
double thickness window glass. Complete
results have not yet been obtained, but it
appears that the value of K for the sash,
is about 0.70 for the sash in a vertical
plane; about the same, or a trifle higher
for the glass in a 45° position up; about
0.75 for the glass in a horizontal plane on
the upper side; and about 0.50 to 0.60 for
the glass in a horizontal plane on the low-
er side.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Auto Engine Heat Balance Test
One of the most important tests which
the automobile department has ever under-
taken is being run in connection with the
M. E. 33 advanced laboratory course. The
set up for the experiment is probably one
of the most elaborate ever attempted. The
object of the test is to determine the heat
balance in an automobile engine; that is,
to measure the heat energy in gasoline and
to determine just how much of this energy
goes into brake-horse power, friction horse
power, cooling water, cooling air which
goes by the motor at road speed and what
percentage goes into the exhaust gases.

Heat Balance Test Set-up
The tests are being run at motor speeds
corresponding to road car speeds of 18
miles per hour, 28 miles per hour, and 33
miles per hour, and with the motor devel-
oping several different horse powers from
5 H. P. to maximum.
Two runs have been completed and the
results have been remarkable. The first
one was made at 640 R.P.M. with the en-
gine developing 5 H. P. This test showed
heat unaccounted for of 7.7%; and the run
at 640 R.P.M. with the engine pulling 20
H.P. showed heat unaccounted for of only
2.6%.
Summaries for the two runs are as fol-
lows:

Loss of Heat From Underground Steam
Fifes
The Department of Mechanical Engi-
neering is about to commence a series of
tests with a view to determining the loss
of heat from underground steam pipes.
Two general cases will be taken up: first,
with the pipe bare; and second, with the
pipe protected by different kinds and sys-
tems of insulation. A section of bare 3"
pipe has already been laid in a trench in
the court south of the Mechanical Labora-
tory. The plan view of the trench is in
the shape of a U. The steam supply and
return can thus both be observed in the
Mechanical Laboratory. It is proposed to
make investigation at different steam pres-
sures and different velocities. Ultimately,
it is planned to lay another section of pipe
in an adjacent similarly arranged trench.
This second section of pipe may be pro-
vided with various kinds of insulation. The
performance of the insulated section can
then be compared directly and simultane-
ously with that of the bare pipe.
Mr. W. A. Warrick is working on this
investigation as a thesis for his Master
degree.
Auto Laboratory
Complete brake-horse power, friction
horse power, and gasoline economy tests
were recently run in the laboratory, on the
4-cylinder truck motor which has been put
on the market by the Hercules Motor Man-
ufacturing Company of Canton, Ohio; and
also upon a single cylinder experimental
slide valve motor called the "Silent Amer-
ican" and developed by the Jos. L. Skeldon
Company of Toledo. Ohio.
Steam Trap
A steam trap, intended particularly for
boiler feed service, has been set up in the
boiler room of the Mechanical Laboratory.
Means have been devised to test the trap
both as a boiler feed pump, and as a pump
operating against any head desired, up to
that corresponding to the stream pressure.
LTp to the present time, so much trouble
has been experienced in getting the trap to
operate at all, that no tests have been made.
CIVIL
Sewer Pipe Tests
During the past winter, the Sanitary Ex-
periment Station of the Department of
Civil Engineering has been carrying for-
ward an investigation into the more im-
portant characteristics of the various types
and brands of sewer pipe, sold to Michi-
gan municipalities.
Both vitrified clay pipe and concrete pipe
are being put through identical tests. These
tests furnish a measure of the supporting
strength of the pipe when laid in the
trench and also determine the ratio of ab-
sorption, modulus of resistance and speci-
fic gravity of the material of which the
pipe is composed.
Up to the present time, approximately
300 pieces of pipe have been tested. It is
the intention to continue the investigation
until it covers about 500 or 600 test pieces,
in order that fair comparisons may be
drawn, not only between different materi-
als and brands of pipe, but also between
different types or patterns, for example,
between "standard" pipe and "double
strength" pipe, between "standard" sock-
ets and "deep and wide" sockets, and be-
tween 2-foot and 3-foot lengths.
It is the present expectation that the
results of the complete series of tests will
be embodied in a special engineering bul-
letin, to be made available to city engineers
and other municipal officials.
Sanitary Experiment Station
One among the many branches of engi-
neering in which the sanitary engineer
must be well versed is hydraulics. When
a study of the sanitary situation in any
community is made, one of the first and
most important questions to be answered
is.—what is the quantity of sewage to be
disposed of?
This information may be gotten by any
one of several methods commonly employ-
ed, such as building weirs, timing floats or
coloring matter during their passage
through a known length of sewer, or using
current meters. But these methods either
require considerable construction or are


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
dependent on certain hydraulic conditions,
such as straight clean pipe or otherwise un-
disturbed conditions of flow, which do not
often exist.
So it is with considerable interest that
the Sanitary Experiment Station has been
investigating the possibilities of the so-
called "Chemical Method" of determining
the flow in sewers, since this method re-
quires no special construction in the sewer
and its results are not affected by any hy-
draulic conditions that may exist; in fact,
it is claimed that the flow of mountain tor-
rents may be measured accurately by its
use.
The procedure briefly is this. Brine of a
known strength is added to the sewage at
a constant rate. The sewage is sampled
at a point just above the entrance of the
brine and also at a point far enough below
to give the brine ample opportunity to
thoroughly mix with the sewage. Quanti-
tative analyses of the samples are made
which reveal the amount of chlorine added
per unit of flow. This value divided into
the quantity of chlorine added by the brine
'per unit of lime gives the discharge of the
sewer directly without any further correc-
tions or computations. In order that the
results of the tests may be of general ap-
plication, they are being tried on the main
outfall sewer of Ann Arbor on Fuller St.
Study of Sewage Fillers
Mr. George H. Ruhling and Mr. Edward
J. Lieber, two graduate students in san-
itary engineering, are engaged this spring
in a special study of the operating charac-
teristics of the contact filters at the San-
itary Experiment Station.
Four "primary" and two "secondary" fil-
ters of this type have now been in opera-
tion at the Station for nearly two years,
using broken stone, gravel, and screened
cinders, the three filtering materials most
commonly available to Michigan cities; and
although routine tests of their efficiency
have been continuously made during that
period, no thoroughgoing analysis of their
performance has hitherto been attempted.
Messrs. Ruhling and Lieber are under-
taking an economic study of this type of
filter as applied to the purification of ordi-
nary domestic sewage, involving a consid-
eration of materials, rates, dosing cycle,
self cleansing features, and general effi-
ciency, with the end in view of determin-
ing the operating program best suited to
the conditions imposed by Michigan condi-
tions.
HYDRAULICS.
Discharge Coefficients over Weirs
Messrs. F. A. Nagler, C. N. Ward, and
Allen Sherzer, graduate students, under
the direction of Prof. King, are running
experiments in the Hydraulic Tank to de-
termine the coefficients of discharge over
right-angled notched weirs. Experiments
are being run in heads up to 1.8 feet, which
is in excess of the head to which experi-
ments in this line have ever before been
run. They expect to check by their results,
the present formulae on this subject in hy-
draulics.
Mr. Ward, also under Prof. King's di-
rection, recently conducted experiments on
the river to determine coefficients of dis-
charge through the gates of the Argo Dam.
Velocity measurements were made by
means of a Pitot tube.
Rate of Flow
At Prof. Running's suggestion. Mr. C.
N. Ward has prepared apparatus to deter-
mine the rate of flow of water over wicrs.
The method is entirely new and originates
with Prof. Running, who is collaborating
with Prof. King in its development.
Huron Rate Curve
Mr. Wisler was engaged in getting an
accurate rate curve of the Huron River
during the recent high stage period. Work
was carried on at the Hydraulic Station
on the river.
Exhibit
Arrangements have been made to exhibit
a number of aeroplane models in connec-
tion with the naval exhibit to be held May
17th and 18th. A large six-passenger bal-
loon will also he inflated and exhibited.

CHEMICAL
(J as Coals
The tests on the results of exposing gas
coals to the weather, which have been car-
ried out jointly by the Bureau of Mines
and the Michigan Gas Association are now
in their fifth year. Actual tests to deter-
mine gas yields are now being run under
the direction of Prof. A. H. White by the
Gas Fellowships, J. T. Xaylon and B. A.
Standerline, assisted by H. O. Andrew, R.
G. Felger, J. D. Stone, and W. W. Wat-
son. With Prof. White, are also working
A. G. Plankel, who is investigating the
properties of magnesium oxychloride ce-
ments; and E. H. Streeter, who is studying
the possibilities of producing alcohol by
destructive distillation of beet molasses.
Prof. Campbell's work on the constitu-
tion of steel is being continued with L. J.
Gurevick, who is studying the properties
of the carbides which exist in steel.
Working on some phase of paint and
varnish problems under Prof. Ware, are
A. J. Gaus, who is trying to find some
working test for evaluating Japans; and
S. M. Pinkerton, who is studying the chem-
ical changes that occur when Japans are
■dried.
The work of Prof. A. E. White on boil-
er tubes, begun for the Detroit Edison Co.,
and out of which the Detroit Edison Fel-
lowship developed, has furnished problems
for three men besides the holder of the
fellowship, namely, C. S. Blomshield, W.
S. Girvin and H. J. Smith. The effect of
the carbon content of the metal on the in-
crease in the size of grain which is known
to take place in boiler tubes under certain
circumstances, is Mr. Blomshield's problem.
Mr. Girvin is studying means of preventing
grain-growth in strained metal, while Mr.
Smith is trying to find a method for pre-
venting segregation of phosphorus, which
is connected with the brittlencss sometimes
developed by tubes.
S. Hcrsch and C. F. Smart are studying
the problem of locating cavities in non-
ferrous castings. G. J. Horvitz is work-
ing on the relation between dissolved gases
in metal and its liability to corrosion.
The problem of finding some possible
uses for metallic calcium is being contin-
ued by E. Bird under Prof. Badger. Mr.
Bird is trying to determine the action of
mixtures of nitrogen and carbon monoxide
on the metal, with the possibility in mind
of forming a nitrate from which ammonia
could be made. With Prof. Badger are
also M. A. del Valle, who is studying the
methods used in purifying sugar cane
juices; L. G. Hulbert, who is trying to
make dense and uniform carbon articles
for electric furnace resistors by treating
the hot articles with hydrocarbon gases;
and W. A. Miller, who is working out the
most desirable composition for certain re-
agents used for the determination of oxy-
gen.
Prof. Rue has working with him H. B.
Higbie, who is interested in the possibility
of recovering valuable products from the
acid and alkali sludges produced in the
purification of lubricating oils; and J .W.
Robinson, who is working on collodion lac-
quers.
Dr. Laird is directing the work of E. C.
Wright, who is studying the effect of the
temperature at which they are burned, on
the properties of pots for melting glass.
ELECTRICAL
Electrical Research
A group of students under the direction
of Prof. Parker are doing research work,
to determine the proper location of protec-
tive reactances in power stations, with ref-
erence to the effect on normal voltage reg-
ulation, power transference between ma-
chines, and transient voltage regulation at
the time of short circuit. The tests are ex-
pected to develop important data.
Relation between Direct and Diffused
Lighting
Under Prof. Hi^bie's direction, experi-
ments are being conducted to determine the
proper relation which should exist in elec-
trical lighting systems between direct and
diffused light for the best appearance of


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
objects. This is a problem which the pho-
tographer solves in the development of his
art, but no tangible means exist to the il-
luminating engineer for attaining this end.
The object of the experiments under way
is to determine quantitative relations
which can be used in the design of light-
ing systems.
Tests on Lamp Sockets
Tests are also under way to establish
an economic comparison of turn down de-
vices for lamp sockets. The average man's
lighting bill amounts to about $25 per
year. It is estimated that with the proper
turn down devices a saving of one-tenth
of this amount can be effected for each
socket.
Voltage Drop in Lighting Systems
Experiments to determine the proper
voltage drop in lighting systems, for the
most economic installation are being con-
ducted. Data, up to the present, in this
direction, has been purely empirical and
the engineer has relied on his experience
and judgment, in great part, to guide him
in designing.
Eleetrieal Seniors
Electrical concerns have already spoken
for practically the entire class of senior
electricals. Among the firms who have
applied for men are: General Electric Co.,
Westing-house Electric and Mfg. Co., West-
ern Electric Co.. Wagner Electric Co., of
St. Louis, Bell Telephone Operating inter-
ests and a number of individuals.
Automobile Ignition Tests
I. N. Cuthbert, '15E, H. C. Drake, '16E,
NT. L. Dolph, '16E, under the direction of
Prof. Railey, are conducting tests in the
Ignition Laboratory of the University to
determine variations in power in an auto-
mobile engine due to sparks of different in-
tensity. Very little research has been done
along this line and very complete tests have
been planned. The same men will also in-
vestigate the effect of varying voltages in
battery systems, on the timing of the spark.
The Work of the Building Department
The past year has been a very busy one
for the building department. In nearly ev-
ery department of the campus, they were
called upon to render service, but their
efficiency was given a thorough test in the
construction of the New Science Building.
They supplied all the furniture, consisting
of laboratory tables, wall-cases, shelving
and special laboratory equipment with a
total cost of $12,000. In all, the work han-
dled by this department in the Science
Building, amounted to $70,000, as they in-
stalled all the plumbing, the electric wiring,
the direct radiation system, the concrete
tables and hoods, the mechanical w-ork in
the green house, the electric switch board
and the painting.
On April 5th, the bids closed for the ex-
tension of the Waterman gymnasium. The
contract calls for the extension of the east
and west wings. 48 feet each. This exten-
sion will allow a new 10 lap to the mile
running track, and the installment of a
new tiled shower bath to accommodate 60
showers, and will increase the locker and
hand ball facilities
At the present time, funds for a pool are
lacking but the building department is look-
ing forward and is making the necessary
changes so that at any time in the future
it will be a simple matter to have the
pools installed.
C^rass seed has been sown all over the
campus and new shrubbery placed in dif-
ferent sections.
On Palmer Field, i2,oco yards of dirt
have been removed from the top of the hill,
and the hill graded to enable the playing
of cricket, hockey and other sports.


139
Power House Chimney
Prof. Allen is authority for the state-
ment that the old power house chimney
sways 8 inches at the top in a high wind.
Lest some, among the more timid of us,
should give the old power house a wide
berth in the future, when walking down
the diagonal walk, he hastens to add, that
if the chimney did not sway, its elastic
limit would have been exceeded and there
would be real danger.
The B.V.D. Dance
In perfect harmony with the ruling of
the faculty the B.V.D. dance broke up at
two o'clock Saturday morning, March 10th.
About sixty couple turned out and they are
all unanimous in the opinion that they
had a fine time.
Michigan Opera
This years Michigan Union Opera, re-
peated the successes of recent years, play-
ing to capacity houses on the three nights
of its presentation in Ann Arbor. It was
equally well received on its road trip where
it was everywhere met by enthusiastic
alumni.
All-Nation Revue
An innovation in the theatricals of the
University was the All-Nation Revue, pre-
sented by the foreign students on March
7th and 8th at Hill Auditorium.
Around Louis Reimann, '16L, who, as
the central figure, represented Humanity,
the nations of the world gathered in their
native costumes and with the unique light-
ing and scenic effects, contributed to form
a very elaborate spectacle which was well
received bv the audience.
New Statistical Society
The first college and actuarial society in
the United States, has recently been form-
ed at Michigan to be known as the "Ac-
tuarial and Statistical Society of the Uni-
versity of Michigan," and whose purpose
will be to promote the study of this phase
of mathematics.
All Publication Dance
On the evening of March 23rd, the staffs
of the Michigan Daily, Gargoyle, Alum-
nus, Tf.chnic, and other campus publica-
tions held a dance at Granger's Academy
which proved a decided success and it is
hoped that it will be made an annual affair.
New Library
Work on the new half million dollar li-
brary will be started in May.
Student Council
The Student Council has been very ac-
tive on the campus this past semester and
has made its influence felt more than ever
before. Working with the City officials
and officials of the Edison Company, they
have launched a strong campaign to make
the Huron River safe for canoes. Life
preservers, telephones, numerous signs and
life boats will be included in this "Safety
First" campaign.
The council has recently inaugurated a
series of weekly dances which are under
the supervision of the Council and have
proved very popular.
A committee of student council members
has been appointed to confer with repre-
sentatives of the Women's Judiciary Coun-
cil, on the plan of including women repre-
sentatives in the Student Council.
New Magazine
The Inlander, a magazine of the literary
college, has been revived, after having sus-
pended publication several years ago.
Library Chimes
The old library chimes which, for the
past 33 years, have sounded the famous old
"Cambridge quarters," at 7.30 in the morn-
ing and 5:30 in the evening, may soon be
silenced. It rests with the Board of Re-
gents, whether or not they shall be in-
stalled in the new library. Sentiment is
strongly in favor of their retention.
Spring Contests
May 19 and 20 have been announced as
the dates for the annual spring games.

OUR GENERAL SOCIETY
Once again the Engineering Society finds
itself surrounded by difficulties and it is
necessary for the students of the College
of Engineering to get behind the organiza-
tion and push if it is ever to be successful.
It is too late to do much this year, but
next October over 300 new men will enter
the Department.
This is the opportunity. These men
must be made to realize that the Engineer-
ing Society is a big thing, and it is up to
the men who are now in the Department to
get behind the Society and make it the big
thing we want to make next year's fresh-
men believe it is. The possibilities of the
Society, for real benefit, to the engineering
student, arc almost unlimited if the men
would take the interest they should in its
development.
What is lacking then is the proper show
of interest on the part of the student body
and the question arises, "How are we to
arouse this interest, and once aroused how
are we to keep it alive?"


141
The remedy we think, lies in more fre-
quent meetings of the Society where mem-
bers will have a chance to take part in the
discussion. There should also be a devel-
opment of the social possibilities and sev-
eral dances and smokers should be held
during the course of the year. An im-
posing program of events, to present to
our 300 freshmen and an earnest effort to
live up to this program, should be the most
effective means of increasing the member-
ship in the Society. The men should be
made to realize they are missing something.
The social activities of the Michigan Un-
ion do more to increase its membership
than the most convincing talk of a solici-
tor. We do not advocate a strictly social
atmosphere for the Society but a happy
blending of business and pleasure. Next
year is the time for results but now is the
time to prepare.
Lecture
Dr. C. B. Stoufftr of the University
health service addressed the General So-
ciety recently, on the subject of first aid.
His lecture embraced the various methods
of resuscitation from electrical shocks,
drowning and asphyxiation and was illus-
trated by various death preventive appli-
ances, including the pulmotor.
A. S. M. E.
On Friday. Mar. 31, the A. S. M. E. com-
bined with the A. I. E. E. to hear Mr. G.
W. Lunn of the Commonwealth Edison
Co.. Chicago, give an interesting talk on
"Central Stations."
Mr. Lunn sketched briefly the history of
central stations, and took as an example
of the latest development the three plants
of his Company at Chicago which he de-
scribed in detail. The site, buildings, prime
movers, boilers, auxiliary apparatus, elec-
tric machinery, tests, and safety provisions
•were described, and the welfare work of
the Company outlined. In conclusion Mr.
Lunn presented the advantages of this
field to the technical graduate. The lec-
ture was followed by slides illustrating the
points taken up.
The branch is now conducting a mem-
bership campaign which is proving success-
ful. Remember Mechanicals! this society
offers you four advantages:
1. You receive the A. S. M. E. Journal,
a magazine keeping you in touch with the
latest engineering developments, with the
proceedings of the General Society, and
with the big men of your profession.
2. You become automatically eligible to
the General Society, not requiring the rec-
ommendation of three members.
3. You get a membership card which
entitles you to the privileges of a general
member.
4. You will have a chance to develop
your power of expression by presenting, if
you wish, a paper before the branch at its
regular meetings.
A. I. E. E.
Notice of Spring Elections
Election of officers for the year 1916-
1917, will be held at one of the lectures
given during the month of May. Watch
the bulletin boards for announcement of
the exact dates. All members are request-
ed to be present at this meeting.
As is mentioned elsewhere, Mr. G. W.
Lunn of the Commonwealth Edison Com-
pany of Chicago, spoke before a joint meet-
ing of the student branches of the A. I.
E. E. and A. S. M. E.
At least two more lectures will be given
before the A. I. E. E. Owing to the great
number of student activities that occur in
the few weeks previous to graduation, the
schedule will probably not be extended.
AUTOMOBILE SOCIETY
Mr. Hower. of the Willys-Overland
Company of Toledo, Ohio, lectured before
the Automobile Society recently on the
Knight sleeve valve motor. His lecture
was illustrated by moving pictures and
proved very interesting, as well as instruc-
tive, to the large audience which crowded
the auditorium in the Engineering Build-
ing.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
1916
F. K. Hirth, Reporter.
The class was fortunate in getting Ralph
Collamore, '97E, to speak at the March
Assembly. With some of his experiences
since leaving school as a starting point, he
spun some good every-day philosophy, for
the seniors' use in the near future. If this
every-day philosophy is what has carried
him to the position he holds in society, it
is surely worth while.
The class athletes this year are in large
measure like that "poor young man" who
liked his hammock best. Although last
year, the class landed a good place in bas-
ket ball; and Camp Davis developed a
league of indoor baseball artists, thus far
this year, it has failed to connect with
this brand of athletics. The class's sole
claim to distinction lies in the fact that
Trelfa, Jones, Warren and Wickham were
out of their hammocks long enough to earn
their numerals among the class relay teams.
With these few exceptions, the athletes are
all Mexicans.
1917
H. S. Taylor, Reporter.
At the February assembly Dr. Stouffer,
of the Health Service, gave an interesting
talk on practical camp life. He laid es-
pecial emphasis on correct sanitation and
told of the various methods used at Camp
Davis in this work. An outline of the An-
nual Spring Trip of the Junior Engineers
was announced by Prof. Lovell. At the
business session an assessment of fifty
cents was voted upon and accepted.
Those juniors who attended the March
assembly enjoyed a strong talk by Rev.
Lloyd C. Douglas. He is a man who can
hold the interest of every one who hears
him and he always has a word of wisdom
to impart. His remarks were woven
around the central idea, "Faith in Hu-
manity."
Harold "Toby" Taylor was elected Camp
Manager of the Civils at a special meeting
called by the Surveying Department for all
who expect to attend summer camp this
year. H. H. Phillip, president of the sen-
iors, discussed the camp life and showed
slides of pictures taken last summer.
There are several of the junior chemi-
cals who seemingly have especial affinity
for liquid bromine. W. Lee Watson is the
latest victim; he is just recovering from
serious burns sustained from this chemical.
A burette from which he was pouring the
chemical came apart and spread the liquid
over his hand.
About ninety couples attended our last
dance held Friday, March 3. The "Rag
Pickers" kept everybody in line and all
those present say they had a "regular"
time.
Owing to the success of our last attempt
at staging a dance, Chairman Bartelme, of
the social committee, announces another
one in May.
The engagement of Dorothy B. Sturgeon
to Bruce "Hick" Woodburg was recently
announced.
Vincent Guillermety has recovered from
slight trouble with his ear. He was in the
hospital for more than a week.
1918
H. O. Trerice, Reporter.
Gordon Johnson, our basket ball mana-
ger, announced at the class meeting of
March 30th that we were tied for fourth
place on the campus. He also said that we
were first in the engineering college.
Prof. Friday, of the economics depart-
ment, spoke at our assembly Friday, March
30. When it comes to "pep" this man cer-
tainly has it in full measure. He also has
a vocabulary including a few words not
found in the dictionary. Economics, of
course, is what he is interested in and he
tried to show where the engineer fitted in
to this field.


143
If you want to get a lot of publicity be
a class treasurer.
"Behind the Scenes," as a title for a
speech, sounds interesting, yet one never
can tell a thing about a speech from the
title.
Some one has said that the class assem-
blies are poorly attended and correctly so.
The reason that a great number of the ab-
sentees offer for not being present is that
they never know anything about tEe as-
semblies until they are all over. As a
means of reaching all it might be suggested
that signs announcing the meeting be plac-
ed on the bulletin boards at least three days
in advance. At present a few hours' no-
tice seems to be the limit of time given.
There is more than one reason why we
should be glad that "Pat'' Smith is an '18
man.
President McKee is on the job every
class meeting. This is unusual in face of
the example set for us last year.
About one-tenth of the class belongs to
the Engineering Society. The records
show that we have the lowest enrollment
of the four classes represented.
Can you suggest any method by which
we can make class activities a bigger suc-
cess? If you have anything up your sleeve
worth while along that line, write it up and
mail it to The Technic, or drop into the
office and talk it over with the man at the
desk. Anything worth while along that
line will be printed in the coming October
issue.
Three and one-half dollars to the good
is the final report of the treasurer on the
"Wheel and Axle Ball." It was an engi-
neers' dance and any one present was nev-
er in doubt as to that fact. Everybody had
lots of "pep" and things went off in fine
style. We wish to thank Prof. J. R. Allen
and Mrs. Allen, also Prof. Stevens and
Mrs. Stevens for the interest they took in
the affair. Chaperoning is not always the
most pleasant of occupations and those who
try it don't always succeed; however, the
above combination worked fine.
Our hockey team has justified our ex-
pectations.
1919
E. M. Miller, Reporter.
Prof. C. T. Johnson, head of the survey-
ing department, addressed the assembly on
March 1st. His subject was "The History
and Development of Surveying."
On Wednesday, March 15th, Prof. Fish-
leigh addressed the class on the possibili-
ties in mechanical engineering with special
reference to the automobile field. The talk
was concluded with some interesting fig-
ures as to the rapid growth of the auto
industry in the past few years.
Prof. Bursley chose a similar subject,
when he addressed a later assembly of the
class. The particular phase of the subject
emphasized was railroading and scientific
management.
The "Preparation for the Profession of
Electrical Engineering" was the subject of
Prof. Higbie's talk before another of the
class' weekly assemblies. He dealt with
the qualifications necessary for a man to
have in order to enter this field, and point-
ed out that a special liking for mathemat-
ics and a good imagination were essential.
On Wednesday, March 29th, Prof. Par-
ker, head of the Electrical Engineering de-
partment, addressed the assembly on "The
Field of the Electrical Engineer in the Out-
side World."
"Civil Engineering" was the subject of
Prof. Riggs' talk, on April 5th. He spoke
of civil engineering as a whole, concluding
his talk with a history of the profession at
Michigan, and mentioning many prominent
Michigan Alumni in the profession.
On March 3rd the first class banquet was
held. Plates were laid for 50 at the Delta
Cafe. Among the speakers were O. C.
Marckwardt, J. E. Thorton and Prof. A.
H. White. Music was furnished by the
Aeolian Saxophone Orchestra. Vocal se-
lections by Frank W. Grover, and selected
banjo music by A. J. Norton, were favor-
ably received. The committee in charge
consisted of chairman, R. D. Smith, and
Henry N. Brand, Leslie W. Page, Maurice
G. Sheldon and Charles W. Horr. The
next social event was in the form of an
"all fresh frolic," and was held after the
spring recess.


Recent Exhibitions
The Ann Arbor Art Association was
very fortunate in procuring the large col-
lection of paintings of the Albright Art Gal-
lery of Buffalo. The exhibit was loaned
to the Detroit Museum of Art in tempor-
ary exchange for their art collection. It
was with the utmost difficulty and persua-
sion on the part of Prof. Lorch that per-
mission was obtained to bring the pictures
here to Ann Arbor. The collection con-
sisted of many beautiful paintings by noted
modern artists, among them representatives
of French, German, Scotch, and American
schools.
Architectural Exhibit
A collection of architectural drawings
was exhibited in the Alumni Memorial
Hall that attracted considerable attention.
Student work from ten representative
schools was shown. A fine chance was giv-
en to compare the achievements and meth-
ods of rendering used by the different
schools. The exhibition of our own Arch-
itectural College held its place well with
the other schools, and proved very inter-
esting to the visitors. Among the work
from the University of Michigan were sev-
eral designs solving problems that have
been agitated in connection with our own
University. These consisted of proposed
designs for a Campus Theatre, a Faculty
Club House and an Infirmary. Other de-
signs from our department were the large
Observatory by Prof. Robinson, which was
published in the Journal of the American
Institute of Architects, and the Oriental
Fountain by Mr. Wells Bennett, which re-
ceived a medal from the Beaux-Arts So-
ciety. Both of the latter designs are grad-
uate work in the College of Architecture.
Spring Exhibit
The Architectural Exhibit which will be
held in May promises to be the most beau-
tiful as well as the most successful one
that has been held thus far. Extensive
preparations have been made by the differ-
ent committees and a chance will be af-
forded the public to become better ac-
quainted with the workings of the Archi-
tectural College and the work done there.

man of the exhibit and the other commit-

Basket Ball
The Architects showed up exceedingly
well in basket ball this season, only losing
two games. The first of these was to the
Soph Engineers. The last was to the Fresh
Lits playing them for the Campus cham-
pionship. It was a well fought game and
the Lits had a hard time winning by a
score of 31 to 25. The players were R.
Hickey, G. L. Cheffy, O. Cartwright, M.
Hammond, T. Y. Hewlett, R. Kruger, and
L. W. Worden. You all did fine team
work and it was hard luck, boys, that you
didn't win. There is no loophole for next
year, however, and we are bound to win
the campus championship then. Each of
the players will be awarded his numerals.
LECTURES
Bragdon
Mr. Claude Bragdon, a well known arch-
itect of Rochester, New York, and a well
known writer on architecture and the al-
lied arts gave two most interesting lectures
before the architectural students on Wed-
nesday, April 5th. The subject of the af-
ternoon lecture was "Organic Architecture"
and dealt with architecture in connection
with the spirit of the times. He brought
out the point that the architectural stu-
dent must appreciate beauty and be able
to infuse his work with it. The evening
lecture was on "Art and Geometry." He
dealt with figures of the fourth dimension
and illustrated his lecture with slides and
drawings of the fourth dimension and its
relation to ornament. Mr. Bragdon is a
unique figure in the world of art, and has
become well known through his numerous
writings, among which are his books en-
titled "The Beautiful Necessity" and "Pro-
jective Ornament." The New York Central
station at Rochester was designed by Mr.
Bragdon. Mr. Bragdon was the guest of
the Alpha Rho Chi fraternity for dinner
the evening of his lecture. We were in-
deed fortunate in having Mr. Bragdon talk
to us and hope that he will visit us again.
Design Problems
Few students outside the Architectural
College appreciate how much it means to
the architects to get an "A" grade in their
design. A "C —" grade will pass the de-
sign and get the student a certain number
of points according to the time given for
the problem. Each grade above "C—"
gives a certain additional number of points
and as credit is given on the point system,
it is up to the student to make as high a-
grade as he possibly can. If at the end
of the semester he has an excess of points,
they go towards credit in the next design
course. This enables the good student to
advance as rapidly as his ability justifies.
A series of sketch problems is being giv-
en to the advanced class in design. Eight
hours are allowed for each problem. These
sketches become the basis for extended
problems which will be developed by the
students during the last eight weeks of the
semester.
Alumni Notes
A recent visitor to the College of Arch-
itecture was Mr. W. A. Otis, class of 187S.
He is of the firm of Otis and Clark, Chi-
cago architects and the designers of the
new University Y. M. C. A.
Mr. C. W. VVright, '12A, and Mr. Ernest
Kremers. '12A, architects at Niagara Falls,
New York, had their design for a twelve-
room grammar school published in the Jan-
uary issue of the Western Architect.

James F. Bourquin, '03
James F. Bourquin, who is Vice-Presi-
dent and the manufacturing genius of the
new Liberty Motor Car Company of De-
troit and one of the few who know just
what type the new Liberty car will prove
James F. Bourquin, '03
to be, made his entrance into the automo-
bile industry when the business "was in
short pants." In fact, he assisted the en-
gineering department of the Olds Motor
Works as early as IQ02 while still at col-
lege.
After he was graduated from the Engi-
neering College in 1903, he immediately
joined the engineering and experimental
division of the Olds Company, specializing
in the building of motors. In furtherance
of his motor study he joined the engineer-
ing department of the Peerless Motor Car
Company in 1905, but within a year Olds
again claimed his services, placing the
building of the famous Olds motors in his
charge.
The- organization of the E. R. Thomas
Detroit Company opened up new possibili-
ties and Bourquin joined them in the same
year, remaining through the transition peri-
od and assisting in the reorganization when
the institution became the Chalmers Com-
pany in 1910. He resigned as superintend-
ent of manufacturing of the the Chalmers
Company in 1910, to become General Man-
ager of the Paige Motor Company having
direct charge of the manufacturing.
In the earlier days of the industry quan-
tity production was unknown and the man-
ufacturing chiefs came in much closer con-
tact with the actual work of production.
Bourquin is familiar with every minute


147
process in the building of a motor car and
is capable not only of directing the work,
but can actually take the place of any of
the men working under him operating the
complicated modern machines which have
so speeded up motor car production. At
the time he took charge of the Paige Com-
pany but 200 of the early two-cycle cars
were being built each year. In 1915, when
he left to become Vice-President of the
new Liberty Company, under his able di-
rection the Paige yearly production had in-
creased to 8,000 cars.
Vice-President Bourquin is a specialist
in the building of automobiles. All his
life has been devoted to the manufacturing
of motors and motor cars. He has a won-
derful capacity for organization and with
Percy Owen, President of the Liberty Com-
pany, he has gathered together a group of
manufacturing specialists remarkable for
their wide automobile, experience. He is
well equipped for his new task of building
up the Liberty manufacturing organization
and his past success is a practical guaran-
tee of the mechanical excellence of the
new Liberty.
He also has a faculty of gaining the sin-
cere loyalty of every man working with
him and it is his personality which has
done much to further the feeling of friend-
liness and good-fellowship existing in the
Liberty organization.
In keeping with the sales policy of the
Liberty Company, Bourquin is silent re-
garding the new car. However, his asso-
ciations with Chalmers and Paige, his
knowledge of economical production and
the more recent connections of other Lib-
erty officials bear out the assumption that
the new Liberty car will sell for a mini-
mum price.
Alumnus Invents New Tile
Guy M. Wells. 'I2-'I3, editor of The Ohio
Architect and Builder, has sent us a com-
munication concerning a new hollow build-
ing tile which is the invention of John
Eisenmann, '7t. We print the same here-
with:
Architects throughout the United States
will be interested to learn of the announce-
ment of a new building tile, which is the
invention of John Eisenmann, F.A.I.A., of
Cleveland, Ohio.
The size and shape of the tile is the re-
sult of a need experienced by Mr. Eisen-
mann in the designing of tall buildings, the
original demand being for a material which
would at once lighten the load of curtain
walls in skyscraper construction and also
bond with the exterior facing, usually
brick. Not only have these needs been met
John Eisenmann, '71
in Mr. Eiscnmann's patent, but the ma-
terial, on account of the manner in which
it bonds with itself, makes a wall which is
superior to that made up either of com-
mon brick or hollow tile alone.
It was in rr)i2. according to Mr. Eisen-
mann, that the need of an improved build-
ing tile was brought to his attention. At
that time he was consulted by a hotel com-
pany in Cleveland as to the feasibility of
adding several stories to its building.
It was found that the method of con-
struction used in the building could not be


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
continued further without considerable re-
inforcement of the frame from the ground
up and that the project would have to be
abandoned unless some method could be
found to lighten the wall, floor, and all the
•dead loads resting upon the frame. Sev-
eral methods of hollow tile construction
were considered, but none met the require-
ments of bonding or interlocking with the
facing, framework, or other structural
parts of the building. The tile was invent-
ed to meet these needs.
In 1914, 1,600 blocks were manufactured
by the Camp Conduit Co., and used by
Mr. Eisenmann in the remodeling of the
Superior Avenue front of The Arcade, of
which he was the original architect. Here
it was found that not only was the load
lightened but the new tile bonded into a
stronger wall than if it had been laid up
in solid rock, showing that its adaptability
is practically unlimited for any work in
which common brick is used in combina-
tion or connection with it.
A factory for the manufacture of the
tile is now being erected by a company
which has taken over the manufacturing
rights. The letters patent are held by a
parent company organized by Mr. Eisen-
mann for the purpose. "Manell," which
is the trade name for the tile, is ex-
pected to be adopted as the standard ma-
xerial for lightening loads on structural
steel, and at the same time as a backing
for any wall faced with brick, stone, stucco.
terra cotta or any material proportioned
according to the brick units, the unit of
proportion of the tile being that of the
common brick. In other words it is the
long-sought standardized building tile. It
may also be used alone as a cheap, strong,
fireproof bearing wall.
Industrial Preparedness
H. E. Coffin, '03, Chairman of the Com-
mittee on Industrial Preparedness of the
Naval Consulting Bureau, has opened of-
fices in the Engineers' Building, New York.
Here Mr. Coffin will accelerate the work of
mobilizing the industries of the country,
comprising almost two-thirds of the world's
output, for preparedness purposes. The co-
operation of the nation's business men is
being sought through the Chamber of
Commerce of the United States. With the
support of the manufacturers the next step
will be to gather information about 40,000
plants through 240 field directors, (a board
of five men from each state), who are lead-
ers in their professions.
This information will be tabulated under
the direction of W. S. Gifford, chief sta-
tistician of the American Telephone and
Telegraph Co., who is the supervising di-
rector of the field work of the committee.
The idea is that the government will place
small yearly orders for military and war
supplies with each plant, to be filled at
cost, and in event of war each plant will
receive orders based on a io% profit.

By Mile. Mameyclla dc Tausi
Dear Ed.: I have cigarette stains on my
fingers. What is a good way to remove
them?—Co-Ed.
Answer: Use green ink. You can at-
tribute this to writing letters. If you can-
not write, try smoking a pipe.
Dear Ed.: I have an extremely trouble-
some wart on the back of my neck. How
can I remove it?—'19 Lit.

BY O. E. HUNT,'07, CHIEF ENGINEER CARRIAGE DIVISION PACKARD MOTOR
CAR COMPANY
There is a general impression
among laymen, and to some extent
among engineers, that aircraft motor
design problems do not differ greatly
from those encountered in the design
of automobile motors, and that the
one important dissimilarity is that the
motors for air work must be of the
very lightest weight. It is true that
internal combustion engines have
proved to be the most successful mo-
tive power for each type of machine
and that the same fuel is used in both
cases, but the service conditions are
so totally different as to make the ex-
tremely light weight that is desirable
in aircraft motors only a very small
percentage of the total difference be-
tween the two problems.
In the case of the car motor, great-
er flexibility is required. The motor
must handle the car smoothly at slow
speeds, and must be capable of rapid
acceleration and high maximum speed
without any re-adjustment of the car-
buretor. In aircraft motors, the
speed range, under load, is only a
small fraction of that required for
car work. In this respect the aircraft
motor carburetion and ignition prob-
lems are simpler than the correspond-
ing car problems, but this advantage
is more than offset by the fact that the
motor for air service must handle a
very wide temperature and altitude
range with, if possible, no change in
carburetor adjustment and with a
minimum change in efficiency. Varia-
tion in air density, at various alti-
tudes, is indeed one of the major
problems confronted. Such basic fac-
tors as compression, valve timing, car-
buretion, etc., have to be worked out
to give the best compromise in the
way of results over a normal range of
from one-half mile to two miles above
the earth. This results particularly in
a compression that is abnormal when
the plane is at, or near, the ground.
It has been suggested that an ideal so-
lution of the problem would be a
ready means of varying the compres-
sion space, but it is obvious that a sat-
isfactory mechanical scheme for do-
ing this would be a difficult accom-
plishment.
Again,—air service is heavy duty
service. It is safe to say that the av-
erage car motors do not operate at
full load during five per cent of their
total life. All ordinary service, ex-
cept the climbing of exceptionally
steep hills, is part throttle work. Road
and traffic conditions do not permit of
continuous full throttle operation.
Taking the exceptional condition, a
cross-country trip in record time, with
the average car, would not permit of
full throttle driving for more than
twenty per cent of the distance cov-
ered. In air work, if the motor were
to be operated at a speed only suffi-
cient to sustain the plane in the air
the duty would be very much heavier
than in the average car service. Fur-
ther, in the air there are no road or
traffic conditions to interfere with
full throttle operation at any time,
and in trying for cross-country rec-
ords, the motor could be made to pull
full power continuously. It is obvious
that an aircraft motor carries a much
heavier average load than a car mo-
tor, and that its bearing areas,
strength of power transmitting mem-
bers, and provision for lubrication


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
would have to be generous, if the
same total life in service were to be
obtained.
Another condition of air service
that introduces difficulties is that of
the flexible motor mounting. In a
car motor, under all normal condi-
tions of service, the frame is of great
assistance in keeping the motor in
alignment. In aeroplane work, the
mounting is constantly weaving and
twisting. As a matter of fact, in
tractor type machines, the motor is
used as a sort of nose piece, which as-
sists in holding the fuselage frame
work together. In other words, a mo-
tor for aircraft service has to be rigid
enough to maintain all working parts
in alignment in full power service and
in addition, to assist in holding the
body of the plant together.
Still another condition which tends
to increase the severity of air service
is that the point of final application of
power is directly connected to the mo-
tor unit. In the case of a car, rear
wheels that are out of balance, or out
of plane, would have very little effect
on the life of the motor. Aeroplane
propellers that are out of plane un-
doubtedly tend to straighten up like a
gyroscope, thus tending to bend the
propeller shaft and strain it's mount-
ings. If out of balance, as for in-
stance when they become broken in
the air, they would put a centrifugal
load on the shaft which would de-
velop tremendous strains in it and in
the bearing housings. If mounted di-
rectly on the crankshaft, these strains
would be added to those already im-
posed by the normal operation of the
motor.
In both car and aircraft motor de-
sign, the general tendency is, of
course, toward maximum volumetric
and weight efficiency; that is, maxi-
mum output per unit of weight. How-
ever, in car motors, quietness and flex-
ibility are important factors, and the
compromise design that results when
they are given due consideration is
too heavy to be satisfactory for air
work. In motors for air service,
noise has been up to the present time,
a matter of little moment, and it
will never be necessary to sacrifice
efficiency and increase weight to ac-
complish reduction in mechanical
noise as the roar of the propellor is
sufficient to drown out all noise of
this character. The open exhaust, now
used on all aero-motors, can of course
be done away with without any seri-
ous loss in efficiency or great addition
of weight. Flexibility too does not
need to be considered, and as a result,
the weight per unit of power realized
in the best aircraft motors is now on-
ly about one-half of that of the best
type of high speed car motors.
The popular impression that light
weight is the most important factor
in aircraft motor design must arise
from the fact that only the lightest of
objects will float in the air, and early
developments in aerial engineering
did much to support this theory.
When the first flights were made, the
flying speeds were slow, and it was
extremely difficult to get the planes
light enough so that they would read-
ily leave the ground with the power
that was avilable. The pioneers in
the field were more interested in stud-
ying the phenomena of flight than in
developing motive power, and as a re-
sult, they chose the line of least re-
sistance in their efforts to reduce the
weight, per unit of power, of their
machines. They lightened their planes
and power units by discarding all
parts that could possibly be omitted
as unnecessary, and still have the
things hang together, even temporar-
ily and by trimming the necessary


163.
ones down to and below practical
weights for heavy duty service. In
other words, they seem to have given
little consideration to the severity of
the motor service and as a result, they
tried to operate, under heavy duty,
motors which had not sufficient ma-
terial in vital parts to handle the
stresses that would result from even
the lightest service. As an example,
it is common knowledge that one of
the foremost American investigators
built his motors without even lock
washers at the most vital points and
that, although they were of the 4-cyl-
inder type and consequently subject
to vertical vibration, they were at-
tached to the fuselage by 5/16" stove
bolts.
Many of the early motors were
practically of the automobile type but
after these motors, with the strength
of vital parts trimmed down to and
below the limit, had failed to give sat-
isfactory service, aeroplane designers
seem to have gotten the impression
that the failures were due to the type,
and that an entirely different type was
needed to get dependability, with
lightweight, for air service. Many
freak motor designs resulted; also,
many modifications of generally ac-
cepted car practice. The only motor
resulting from this stage of develop-
ment, that is still in anything like gen-
eral use, is the rotary "Gnome,"
which, according to reports from the
war front in Europe, has the lightest
weight, per unit of power, of any suc-
cessful type, and although its de-
pendability is only fair and its econ-
omy poor, it is very satisfactory for
extremely high speed restricted range
scout plane service.
A reversion from freak motors to
motors of the automobile type was in
process when the European war broke
out and applied the acid test to air-
craft motor engineering. It is safe to-
say that in the two years since the
outbreak of hostilities, more has been
accomplished in determining what air-
craft motor types are to be, than in
the whole period of air experience
that preceeded it. Briefly, the war
experience has established a new or-
der of importance of aircraft motor
characteristics with dependability first:
economy, second; weight, or better
weight per unit power, third; and
initial cost, last. It has been demon-
strated that motors that have had
the last ounce of weight skinned out
of them, at the expense of dependa-
bility, may easily result in delivering
an expensive flying unit into the hands
of the enemy, due to motor failure
over his lines. It has also demon-
strated that a motor that has been
made light, at the expense of oil and
gasoline economy, may, when the nec-
essary weight of fuel and lubrication
is considered, have much less range
of action than a considerably heavier
power plant, giving better economy..
It has further demonstrated that for
heavy duty high speed service units
made up of a large number of small
cylinders are much to be preferred to
those which use a comparatively small
number of large cylinders. As a re-
sult, multi-cylinder motors, of the fix-
ed cylinder water-cooled automobile
type, are now considered to be the
most satisfactory for all air work,
with the possible exception of very
high speed scout work, where extreme
light weight is of maximum import-
ance.
We will now consider what details
of construction would be best suited
to the special conditions encountered
in air service and the requirements
that experience has laid down. In
order to simplify matters, we will as-
sume that we want to produce a mo-


THE MICHIGAN TBCHNIC
tor of between 200 and 300 h.p. for
military service, such sizes being those
in greatest demand.
We must first consider the question
of the relation of motor speed to pro-
peller speed. Up to the last two years,
practically all aeroplane motors had
the propeller mounted on an extension
■of the crankshaft. The top limit for
■efficient propeller speed is about 1,400
r.p.m., so motors of this type would
be limited to this maximum speed.
Since volumetric efficiency is a func-
tion of motor speed, and a low figure
for weight per h.p. is important, it is
obvious that the ideal motor should
be operated at as high a speed as is
consistent with proper dependability.
The present tendency is to operate the
motor at crankshaft speeds of from
2,000 r.p.m. to 2,400 r.p.m., depend-
ing upon the size, and use spur reduc-
tion gearing to bring a separate pro-
peller shaft down to an efficient speed.
Assuming that a given motor pro-
duced 200 h.p. at 1,400 r.p.m., and
weighed 800 pounds, we would have
a weight of 4 pounds per h.p., if the
motor were to be operated with the
propeller mounted directly on the
crankshaft. If this same motor were
of such design that it would stand up,
under continuous heavy duty work, at
2,100 r.p.m., and it carried the same
torque to that speed, it would develop
300 h.p. at the higher speed which,
with a 5 per cent gear and bearing
loss, would leave 285 h.p. available
at the propeller. As the addition of
reduction gearing would not increase
the motor weight by more than 75
pounds, we would have in the reduc-
tion gear motor a unit developing 285
h.p. at a weight of 875 pounds, or we
would have accomplished a weight,
per h.p., of less than three and one-
tenth pounds. No further comment
need be made on the desirability of
operating the motor at high speed and
using a reduction gear, provided the
design is made properly dependable,
and the carburetion and lubrication
problems are worked out to give sat-
isfactory economy at the higher speed.
These conditions can be properly met
in units of the size under considera-
tion.
We must next determine upon the
number of cylinders to be used. Since
we have decided to operate our motor
at comparatively high speed, and use
reduction gearing, it is obvious that
it is desirable to keep the cylinder
bore as small as possible, in order that
the pistons and rods may be small and
light and thus keep bearing pressures,
due to their inertia, within safe limits.
Again, — valve durability is greatest
with small valves, and it is conse-
quently of advantage to keep the cyl-
inders small so that a dependable size
of valve may not produce loss of effi-
ciency, due to too high a gas velocity
at the maximum motor speed. Both
considerations argue for the highest
number of cylinders that is practica-
ble. For motors of the size and max-
imum speed agreed upon, the piston
and valve sizes, necessary for the 8-
cylinder type, would run well up to
safe limits. A 12-cylinder motor
would give a much better margin of
safety, and this type has the further
advantage that it is inherently in per-
fect rotating and reciprocating bal-
ance, a very important point, when it
is considered that vibration is a seri-
ous foe of both plane and motor life.
Another important point, in favor of
twelve cylinders, is the fact that the
lesser included angle between the cyl-
inders would result in a narrower mo-
tor which could be housed behind a
radiator, or bonnet front end, that
would present much less surface to


165
the air. Low wind resistance is of
maximum importance in high speed
aeroplane design, and the other things
being equal, the motor construction
that permits of the best stream line
shape in the fuselage, will have the
advantage. This point is so important
that one American maker has set the
blocks of his 12-cylinder motor at 400,
in order to reduce the motor width.
This results in an uneven spacing of
engine impulses, but this is of no im-
portance, since the engine is always
operated at high speed. Further,
there is no interference with proper
balance as the two 6-cylinder motors,
being each in perfect rotating and re-
ciprocating balance, can be combined
at any angle without bringing about
an unbalanced result. It might be ar-
gued that an 8-cylinder motor could
be closed up to this same 400 angle.
This is not true, since the width of
the cylinder base determines the least
practicable angle between cylinders,
and this would be greater the larger
the bore. Again, the 8-cylinder mo-
tor, built to the same engineering
standards, would have a longer stroke
and would of necessity, be wider, due
both to a greater cylinder height and
greater included angle between cylin-
ders. Low wind resistance, and ab-
sence of vibration, are so important
that it now appears that the 12-cylin-
der motor will ultimately be favored
for all sizes of aircraft motors, due
to these considerations above.
Over-all length is a most important
factor in light weight motors and we
will next consider valving and the de-
sign of the crankshaft and connecting
rods, as they all have an important
bearing on motor length. In deter-
mining valving, we confine ourselves
to the consideration of poppet valve
gears, as this type of valve has proved
to be the most dependable for high
speed, heavy duty service. From the
standpoint of both efficiency and econ-
omy, valves mounted in the head give
best results. In motors of the size
and speed, under consideration, two
valves, per cylinder, will be ample to
give maximum efficiency without mak-
ing the valve size so great that de-
pendability is sacrificed. If we mount
the valves transversely of the cylin-
der, and on its center line, the motor
length will not be determined by the
valves, but rather by the cylinder wall
thickness, and a proper provision for
water space between cylinders. For-
tunately, such an arrangement of
valves, is best operated through rock-
er arms from an over-head camshaft,
and as this type of operating mechan-
ism has been proved to be the most
dependable for high speed service, we
have an ideal valve gear combination
to produce minimum motor length and
hence light weight, together with max-
imum efficiency and economy.
Coming to the crankshaft, the
shortest motor will have the smallest
possible number of main bearings, as
any bearings between cylinders will
separate the cylinders further than
would be necessary to provide for the
walls and water space, which has been
made the limiting factor in cylinder
center distance by the valve gear we
have chosen. We will not go into de-
tails but will merely state that ex-
haustive tests, recently conducted,
have shown that a 3-bearing shaft,
of proper size to give stiffness, is the
ideal shaft for 6 and 12-cylinder mo-
tors. Such a shaft places a long bear-
ing at the center of the motor where
it is needed to handle the inertia
forces that are in phase on the adja-
cent crank throws. When propor-
tioned for moderate bearing pressures,
the bearings will become long enough
to give the best possible retention of


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
the lubricant. Further, a shaft of
this type is in perfect rotating balance
between each pair of bearings so that
there is no loss of power, at speed,
due to a friction produced by a ten-
dency of the shaft to run out because
of unbalanced centrifugal conditions
between two adjacent bearings.
Having decided upon the shortest
possible crankshaft main bearing and
valve gear constructions, we will find
that a proper strength of crank cheeks
will not give sufficient pin length to
accommodate a side by side position-
ing of connecting rod bearings of am-
ple area. We have the alternatives of
lengthening the motor by spreading
the cylinder centers to accommodate
side by side bearings, of proper size,
or using the scissors type of rod. The
scissors type is open to the objection
that it cannot readily be adjusted for
wear, but ample bearing area and
good lubrication will largely nullify
this fault and the saving in material
weight will be found to be sufficient
to justify the design. Connecting rod
and piston length determine motor
height, and consequently have to be
carefully considered in light motor
weight. Many successful motors have
connecting rods only about 1.6 times
the stroke. This way of reducing mo-
tor weight is particularly practical in
six and twelve-cylinder motors, as
these types do not have their rotating
and reciprocating balance disturbed
by an increase in connecting rod an-
gularity.
Coming now to cylinders, we have
a problem in which the choice is not
clear. Aluminum cylinders, with
pressed in steel barrels, are meeting
with considerable success according to
the latest erports from the war front.
They are open to the objections that
the material is porous and that salt
water attacks aluminum, so that such
cylinders are not suitable for sea-
plane work. Cast iron cylinders, of
extremely light design, requiring ex-
ceptional foundry work, have also
been successful. The principal ob-
jection to them is their weight. An-
other construction, which has reached
its highest development in Germany,
is a built-up cylinder, having forged
steel barrels, with separate forgings
for gas passages, spark plug bosses,
etc., welded to them and the whole
covered by a welded-on sheet metal
water jacket. Blocks of two cylin-
ders of this construction, for a 4" x 6"
motor, weigh less than 20 pounds.
Such cylinders are quite expensive to
produce, but they are sturdy and de-
pendable and their lightness, and the
fact that they are not attacked by salt
water, bids fair to make them the ul-
timate goal for air service work.
Again, lightness justifies increased
manufacturing cost. In connection
with cylinder design, it should be
borne in mind that in heavy duty air-
craft work, water jackets should be
longer than are common in automobile
practice. They should extend well be-
low the bottom piston ring when the
piston is at the bottom of its stroke.
The water passages should be care-
fully studied to insure against the pos-
sibility of steam pockets under all
conditions of service, and to bring the
water as close as possible to the valve
seats, spark plugs and other vital
working parts that are exposed to in-
tense heat.
In piston design the most impor-
tant considerations are light weight
and a clearance in the cylinder and a
ring construction that will permit just
the proper amount of oil for satisfac-
tory lubrication to reach the cylinder
walls and will prevent the passage of
any excess into the combustion cham-
ber. Aluminum alloy pistons are


167
ideal for aircraft service. Their
weight permits corresponding weight
-savings in the connecting rods and
their bearings. In constant duty mo-
tors, a minimum number of piston
rings can be used, as the motor is al-
ways operating at a definite tempera-
ture and hence the skirt clearance of
the piston can be made close so as to
assist the rings.
Rigidity and lightness are the main
essentials in crankcase design. It goes
without saying that the material
should be aluminum. The crankcase
section should be as deep and as wide
as possible and scientifically ribbed.
In the best practice, the crankshaft
main bearings are held between the
upper and lower halves, and the main
bearing bosses are joined to the walls
by box section ribs. A separate sump,
attached to the lower half, acts as an
oil reservoir. All joints should be
lapped together and assembled with-
out gaskets, as their absence will in-
sure against the development of leaks,
due to blown gaskets, and thus make
for maximum oil economy.
The driving of the over-head cam-
shafts is a problem that has been solv-
ed in a number of ways. Bevel gears,
spiral gears and a spur gear train have
all been used successfully. Depend-
ability and lightness are the important
essentials, and while camshaft drive
is still a moot question, the spur drive
is steadily gaining ground.
Coming to the cooling system we
have already mentioned, in connection
with cylinder design, the necessity for
ample jackets and the elimination of
steam pockets. Centrifugal pumps,
of the automobile type, have been the
most successful for water circulation.
All water joints should be so made
that they will not be opened up by
motor vibration, or the twisting of
the fuselage. Soldered joints are not
as successful as hose connections of
first class material. The pump and
piping must, of course, be so designed
as to insure a uniform distribution of
cooling water, in an amount sufficient
to take care of continued heavy duty
work. Radiator capacity must, of
course, be supplied in proportion.
In determining upon intake mani-
folding and carburetor design, effi-
ciency and economy are the most im-
portant considerations, and each mo-
tor size and normal speed will intro-
duce a special problem, in the solution
of which, due weight will have to be
given to the effect of change of tem-
perature and change of altitude,
which have already been mentioned.
The lubrication problem is also one
of efficiency and economy, and the all-
pressure system has proved most sat-
isfactory. For greatest efficiency, pro-
\ision should be made for delivering
oil, under pressure, to all motor bear-
ings with the exception of the piston
pins and the piston to cylinder bear-
ing. Continued efficiency should be
obtained by arranging to keep the oil
cool, and making the cylinder and pis-
ton construction such as will prevent
products of combustion from passing
the piston and reducing the lubricat-
ing value of the oil. The piston to
cylinder fit, which will be most effi-
cient in keeping products of combus-
tion up, will also serve to keep oil
down, and accomplish maximum oil
economy. Ground joints, assembled
without gaskets, and proper throw-off
rings on all shafts, that pass outside
the case, are also vital factors in get-
ting the best oil economy. Another
point that should be mentioned, in
connection with economy, is that the
sump should be of such design that
the oil carried in the crankcase can-
not run into cylinder barrels, or up
against loose bearing fits, and be rap-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
idly wasted when the plane is climb-
ing or gliding at steep angles.
Up to the present time, magnetos
have been favored as a source of ig-
nition. This has been due to the fact
that they were more fully developed,
better made and consequently more
dependable than the contemporary
battery systems. The recent develop-
ment of battery systems that are
equally as well made and dependable
as magnetos and are much lighter in
weight, (particularly for multi-cylin-
der motors), has turned the attention
of aircraft motor engineers to bat-
tery ignition. It might be argued that
battery ignition would require a heavy
battery that would not be needed if
magnetos were used, but the general
tendency toward starters on aero-
planes makes a battery necessary for
starting purposes, and a battery of
sufficient size for starting will handle
the ignition as an incidental.
Turning to details, every nut on the
motor should be locked with a cotter
pin; through bolts should be used
wherever possible; wherever the de-
sign conditions require studs, they
should be base locked with castle nuts
and cotter pins. If accessibility or
other considerations make the use of
cap screws necessary, their heads
should be wired together after assem-
bling. All threaded fastening parts
should have a screw driver and
wrench fit,—that is, a fit so tight that
it cannot be handled by the fingers.
This fit is to be obtained by close
clearance on threads accurately cut to
the same pitch in both male and fe-
male pieces instead of by a slight dif-
ference in pitch in the two pieces.
In laying down the design, it should
be borne in mind that in field service,
repair work will be done under ad-
verse conditions, with few tools, and
probably by second-rate workmen.
Extra expense in first cost is warrant-
ed wherever it will make the result
fool-proof against an unintelligent re-
pair man.
In summing up, let us consider how
well we have taken care of the im-
portant requirements of dependability,
economy and light weight in laying
down our ideal design. Dependability
has been provided for by the use of
reduction gear type of gear drive, by
comparatively small pistons and small
valves, by a stiff crankshaft with long
bearings, by complete pressure lubri-
cation, by steel cylinders with long
jackets, by a large heavily ribbed
crankcase made leak-proof and by un-
gasketed ground joints. In securing
dependability, we must rely, to a large
extent, upon the use of the very high-
est grade of steel scientifically heat
treated, in propeller shafts, connect-
ing rods, reduction gears, valves,
valve rocker arms, etc. Generally
speaking, dependability is the sum
total of good engineering and good
workmanship extended to the minut-
est detail. Economy has been pro-
vided for by a careful study of the
vibration and manifolding require-
ments of the individual motor under
consideration. It might be noted in
passing that one-half pound of fuel,
per h. p. hour, is considered to be a
good result for full throttle running.
Oil economy has been procured by
good piston seal, an oil tight housing
construction and proper throw-off
rings on all shafts that pass through
it. Fuel and oil economy combined
have much to do with the range of a
flying unit which is determined by its
own weight, plus the weight of the
passengers, plus the weight of the
supplies. Light weight, per h. p.
hour, has been arrived at by running
the motor at high speed and gearing
down to an efficient propeller speed r


169
by making the crankshaft, valve gear
and connecting rod construction such
as will give the least over-all motor
length; by built-up steel cylinders, and
by using special materials and the best
of workmanship in the manufacture
of every part.
This discussion attempts to gather
the vital points of a broad subject in-
to small compass. If it has accomp-
lished this in a manner that will make
for a better general understanding of
the problems of aircraft motor design,
it has justified its existence.

DEVELOPMENT OF COLLEGES OF ENG-
INEERING AND ARCHITECTURE
BY THE TECHNICAL GRADUATES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
Chicago, June 27, 1916.
To the President and Board of Regents of the
University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.
Gentlemen :—
The Chicago Engineering Alumni deem it a great privilege, as well as
a pleasure to appear before you today, entirely upon their own initiative, for
the purpose of presenting a memorandum upon certain features of the
University's activities, from the view-point of the technical business life as
distinct from that of a purely collegiate atmosphere. This memorandum
presents no demands; it infers no criticism, it assumes no superior ability of
judgment. In fact, the ideas expressed may be considered radical to some
extent for the time being at least. But the memorandum is predicated upon
the intimate and personal interest of the technical Alumni in the welfare of
the University and higher education in general, and the recommendations
are presented entirely in this spirit.
Gentlemen, a new era is upon us. With the gradual but continuous
advancement and intensification of industrial development and of efficient
business as well, grows the demand for graduates of a higher class and
more efficient training, particularly training in resourcefulness and creative
ability, i. e., the fundamental art of knowing how to think straight. In fact
the term "Engineer" seems almost to require a new and more significant
definition. The economic aspects of commercial life are introducing prob-
lems and requiring a standard of intelligence and judgment never before
required of younger men. Specialization in the industries has developed a
demand for scientific research and economic development based thereon,
which carried to their logical conclusion, may alone form the ultimate basis
of national prosperity as is evidenced by the recent advancement of the
German nation. The administrative responsibilities of the Engineer in
public works and particularly in public relations grows year by year. New
opportunities for usefulness have developed from conditions ensuing upon
the colossal wastage of the European war and the inevitable turmoil that
will prevail in international commercial relations at its conclusion. These
conditions, apparent more to the man "on the street" than to others in less
intimate contact with the vital forces at play, have prompted an inquiry by
the Chicago Engineers as to the extent of these new opportunities for de-
veloping to their maximum the facilities at the University for creating the
necessary Man-Power required to cope with impending problems.
This inquiry we hope, is not a spasmodic effort, although it happens to
be the direct result of the unusual interest aroused by the last annual meet-
ing of the Chicago Engineering Alumni, at which we set out for discussion


in its various phases the relative position of the Engineer with respect to the
National movement for industrial development. With many of us, the
objects of this inquiry are held to be fundamental. The conclusions are
applicable not only to Michigan, but also, to a greater or less degree, to every
institution of learning, which when efficiently co-ordinated, might ultimately
constitute the very back-bone of racial ascendancy.
Organization of Inquiry. As a first step, the collective opinion of the
entire graduate engineering body was sought. The returns were analyzed
and classified, certain expressions of opinions being quoted as far as per-
mitted by the time at our disposal. It also seemed desirable in stabilizing
our conclusions, to obtain data upon the comparative activities of other in-
stitutions, both by correspondence and personal interviews.
The results of this inquiry as presented herein convey the composite
opinion of nearly 500 Engineers in active life, apportioned through all the
classes from i860 to 1914, inclusive. Among these are included the Chi-
cago Alumni, who through special committees and meetings have officially
signified their unanimous approval of this memorandum.
I. The Specific Objects in View.
In securing this composite opinion, the object has been: (1) to direct
attention to prevalent conditions in and out of college, as we see them, (2)
to assist in securing maximum improvement in the facilities for higher in-
struction and technical training, (3) to secure for the University as a whole
further support, both moral and financial, commensurate with its very high
place among the educational institutions of the country, (4) to institute a
closer bond of practical co-operation between the University and the State,
the Industries and the Nation. In this, we are but voicing the hopes and
aspirations of the distinguished head of the Colleges of Engineering and
Architecture to whose magnificent personality and efficient service, aided
by helpful administration and that of our beloved Dr. Angell, is due the
acknowledged achievements of the University. But we have reached our
conclusions quite independently and if the Faculty and Administration ulti-
mately finds itself in accord therewith, we shall be doubly pleased.
II. Analysis oe Collective Opinion.
All engineering graduates were invited to express themselves in general
or in detail upon the following subjects:
1st: The desirability of a close inquiry by the Board of Regents
into the present status of the Engineering College, as to its work, its
facilities and opportunities.
2nd: Whether the prevailing movement toward industrial research
should find expression in the immediate establishment of adequate
facilities therefor at the University supported as far as possible by
private endowment.
3rd: As to the disposition of the results of such research work
when conducted with the assistance of outside parties commercially
interested in these results.


In other words, this idea was sought to be brought out—whether the
time had arrived for meeting the public demand, heretofore largely unex-
pressed, for further and higher service by the University through the
intensive development of its technical department.
Results of Inquiry:
Total Alumni, i860 to 1914, inclusive 2882
Total less deceased and address unknown 2392
Replies received—524 22%
Distribution of replies received:
For the decade beginning i860 57%
1870 41%
1880 40%
1890 43%
1900 22%
Four years " 1910 14%
The results of these replies when analyzed revealed a most gratifying
unanimity of opinion which may be expressed in the following general
terms:
(1) That this movement bears the general sanction of the Alumni of
the Colleges of Engineering and Architecture.
(2) That advanced collegiate work and more especially advanced tech-
nical research on public and industrial problems are vital and should be
encouraged.
(3) That closer co-operation between the University, the State and the
Industries as well as between Regents, Faculty and Alumni is highly
desirable.
(4) That the Engineers responding to this inquiry are very representa-
tive of the great majority of the active engineering fraternity is evidenced
by the following classification of the registered Alumni by vocation:
Practicing Engineers and Architects and technical assistants 57%
Executive officers 25%
Commercial undertakings 4%
Other professional work 2%
Educational work 8%
Science and arts 1%
Miscellaneous 3%
Total 100%
Representing commerce and industry 88%
Number of classified vocations represented 59
On the question of disposition of the results of research work, definite
opinion was expressed as follows:
In favor of exclusive use by donor 12%
In favor of limited use by donor 40%
In favor of full publicity 19%
Total 71%
Non-committal or uncertain 29%


173
Of the last mentioned, a few were of the opinion that the benefits of
research should be shared jointly by the University, the Public and the donor.
It is impracticable to cite even a small fraction of these letters in this
memorandum, but the few appended extracts seem to offer particularly rep-
resentative data and suggestions thereon.
III. Relative Status of Other Institutions.
At this phase of the inquiry, an expression of opinion was sought direct
from the department heads or from Michigan men on the faculty of other
institutions. And the appended questionaire was drafted with the particular
object of revealing conditions in such institutions as might serve to develop
useful experience in rendering our own recommendations to you more
authoritative.
The replies indicated an almost uniform desire to broaden the scope of
engineering training so as to provide for advanced or graduate research work
in the various technical branches, not academic, but distinctly applicable to
present day problems, particularly as required by the specialized industries
of various States. In many cases this work was limited only by the avail-
able funds, making it necessary to carry on research work, if at all, in con-
nection with the academic or undergraduate department with very indiffer-
ent results. In several cases research work was carried on through an
Engineering Experiment Station organized quite independently of the
undergraduate departments, although with interlocking directors. By co-
incidence or otherwise, colleges of the West and Middle West appear to
have adopted more generally this method of increasing the usefulness of the
University, and in one case at least, the demand for extension service even
resulted in the establishment of a Technical Service Bureau available for
consultation and advice to every community of the State.
The organization and purpose of these engineering experiment stations
are very clearly stated in the following quotations from a large western
State University:
"(1) To correlate and systematically group together the results of
scientific investigations as they are conducted under the various departments; (2)
to plan, organize and direct additional work to be carried out along the lines which
will be of practical benefit to engineers in general and to the State or locality in
which the School is situated in particular; (3) to act in stimulating and elevating
the engineering education given by the school; and (4) to arrange for the publi-
cation and distribution of the results of engineering and industrial research work.
The University organized such a station in 19—, with the Dean of the School of
Engineering as Director and the balance of the staff made up of the Chancellor
of the University and the heads of the various engineering departments. Up to
the present time the financial support of the University Engineering experimenta-
tion has been through the appropriations gathered through the various depart-
ments of the Engineering Schools, and the work of investigation has been carried
on by men regularly appointed to the instructional staff but relieved of teaching
duties to some extent in order to give time for special investigations."
It is quite apparent that the attempt to conduct any great amount of
advanced or post-graduate research in connection with the regular under-


graduate work, using the same laboratory and facilities, has been unsatis-
factory. Further, it appears that some institutions possess exceptionally
good equipment in some one branch, others in other branches.
The very essential provisions of scholarships and fellowships seems to
to depend largely upon the facilities available for carrying on advanced
specialized work. For example, the Mellon Institute of Pittsburg, which
was organized only recently for industrial research, enjoys fellowship funds
aggregating $20,000 per annum; Lewis Institute of Chicago receives this
amount from the cement industry alone.
In these institutions suitably equipped, it is found that extensive and
valuable service to the various departments of the State Government is
rendered, not only by consultation and advice, but especially through con-
tinuous research in such vital matters as water supply, sanitation, highways
and waterways, valuation of public utilities, bacteriological and chemical
surveys, protection of pure foods and drugs, etc. Where such laboratory
equipment was not fully available, this service was correspondingly re-
stricted.
In but few cases was encouragement withheld from the technical staff
in engaging in a certain amount of outside consulting work. On the other
hand, this outside work was generally considered quite necessary in the
technical branches to insure progress in the work of the Faculty commen-
surate with that of Applied Science in the Industries.
The results of research in these Experiment Stations are often pub-
lished in permanent form by the University Press. Usually the results of
all fellowship research even when privately supported are required to be
made public, at least after a limited period, such as three years. In only one
case was the publication of the results found to be subject to the donor's
consent.
The question of competition with established engineering concerns arose
only once, and this through the establishment of a Technical Service Bureau,
the purpose of which, however, was at first misunderstood but later en-
dorsed. In general, routine work, such as material tests, chemical analysis,
assays, etc., are avoided insofar as independent commercial laboratories
have been already established within the State to do this necessary work.
Several active institutions have strengthened their relations with the
Public by encouraging the use of their auditoriums for conventions of
technical and industrial societies and their libraries, museums and labora-
tories for reference or demonstrations, thus enabling the Faculty to come
into much closer personal and professional touch with the industries repre-
sented than would otherwise be possible by such erratic representation as
results from Faculty members themselves meeting the expense of attend-
ance at distant points.
In general, therefore, the pursuance of industrial research under en-
dowed fellowships has become quite firmly established and no serious ques-
tions of ethical policy have arisen except perhaps in the publication of the
results of research where some restrictions are occasionally warranted to
enable the industry to adjust its operations to the new method developed
prior to the publication of full details.

IV. Conditions at the University of Michigan.
We may now profitably discuss affairs in the family, so to speak, apply-
ing the same analysis as to other institutions discussed above. Much data
has been asked for by this Committee and cheerfully furnished by the
various members of the Faculty. Its interpretation has been a revelation.
Some striking exhibits relating to rate of growth are presented with this
memorandum, both in Tables I and II and in graphical form, Figure 1.
While it is fully realized, that "mere bigness is no criterion of virtue," yet,
the fact of this steady upward growth of attendance at technical schools
to over 1600 students (including graduates) or more than the enrollment of
all of the other professional colleges combined, and this in the face of a
distinct cessation of growth in most other technical institutions and large
declines in some of them, is indeed gratifying. Likewise the equally rapid
growth of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, although partly
due to the influx of undergraduates in Law and Medicine since the realign-
ment of work in these three Colleges.
Facilities: But whatever the total figure may be, the outstanding fact
is this:
Since the beginning of the last decade, the Colleges of Engineering
and Architecture have been responsible for 44 per cent, of the growth in
attendance; it has received 37 per cent of the increase of departmental
appropriation; and it has been allotted only 33 per cent, of the increase
in floor space.
It is true that within very recent years, the Literary and Engineering
Colleges practically shared alike in proportional appropriation (upon an at-
tendance basis). However, in a department where heavy laboratory equip-
ment forms so important a part, it is no wonder that the Colleges of Engi-
neering and Architecture may have found itself at times in extreme difficul-
ties in adjusting itself to this unexpectedly rapid growth, in spite of the
assistance extended by your Administration for new buildings. Again has
it become a disturbing reflection to us that important advanced courses have
to be withdrawn or reduced because of lack of facilities for proper under-
graduate instruction.
This fundamental matter of building accommodations is well illustrated
in the accompanying Table No. II. It appears, that the average floor space
per student enrolled in the Technical Schools has decreased since 1910 ap-
proximately 20 per cent, due to increasing attendance. At this rate of
decrease only three years will elapse before there will again occur the
crowded conditions of 1907, i. e., before the new engineering building was
completed.
Research Fellowships: The real meaning of these statistics now be-
comes apparent. Particularly does this apply to the limited facilities for
advanced technical research. Broadly speaking, except in naval architecture,
we find no adequate equipment for such research, whatever is available be-
ing required mainly for undergraduate instruction. This is particularly


unfortunate as there is a strong sentiment among the Faculty, as well as the
Alumni for advanced research and although every effort is being made to
encourage the endowment of fellowships by engineering and architectural
concerns to foster this work. Michigan has no scholarships or honoraria
established by the University for higher technical research. The seven fel-
lowships already secured form hardly a start as compared with the youngest
research institution of the country—the Mellon Institute of Pittsburg. No
organized effort seems to be made towards co-operation with various techni-
cal and industrial societies by welcoming their conventions, participating in
their deliberations and thereby gaining their confidence in the furtherance of
progressive research work, such as will be possible when the new Michigan
Union is in operation.
Field of Research: Even with the limited facilities at hand some valu-
able investigations are under way or have been completed, especially by the
Naval, Chemical, Highway and Sanitary laboratories. Others of vast im-
portance must await further facilities. It seems desirable to call your atten-
tion to some of the most striking opportunities and varied applications of
this work.
The Naval Testing Tank stands pre-eminently as a type of equipment
capable of producing the highest results as it has done especially in the ad-
vanced design of submarines. It was built none too soon. A similar type of
equipment, though relatively inexpensive in character, is in effective use at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for testing all forms of air
craft models built by the numerous aeroplane works of the Eastern States.
(See reports on wind tunnel experiments in aerodynamics. Lieutenant J. C.
Hunsaker et. al., Smithsonian Institute).
The New Automobile Testing Laboratory is a much needed facility and
should study the gasification of combustible fluids to develop apparatus for
the use of low grade petrol distillates such as kerosene, possibly a bi-fluid
type of carburetor especially for motor vehicles. This work will automatic-
ally co-ordinate with that of the Highway Laboratory.
In the Chemical Laboratory, problems of industrial chemistry should be
studied more and more under commercial rather than laboratory conditions,
requiring specialized equipment. For several years the department has been
operating practically as a training school for chemical instructors, the oppor-
tunities being too great in the industries for profitable work.
In the Highway Laboratory, studies of sulphite waste as a dust preventa-
tive are under way. It should conduct tests of road foundations and materials
best suited for continuous maximum service, especially for automobile high-
ways, which are subject to unusually rapid deterioration. Also the prevalent
failure of street railway track and paving foundations in cities urgently
requires research. Some additional equipment is required at the present
time.
The Sanitary Experiment Station already has a continuous two years
record of comparative operation, which will be of value in the study of
sewage disposal. Several cities have requested investigations into the design


and test of large cement pipe sections. The sanitary station could well be
extended to make possible further experiments in water purification.
In the Mechanical Engineering Laboratory, much intensive work is im-
possible with the present equipment. It is understood that the division of
hydro-mechanics has produced a design of water turbine which had to be
sent to the testing flume at Holyoke, Massachusetts, to be tested, and there
showed the highest efficiency on record.
The equipment should include a Diesel engine and efforts directed
toward the study for the use of heavy fuel oils for surface as well as sub-
sea craft and the development of a turbo-motor for air craft suited to the
high speed. We understand that the mechanical laboratories are so crowded
that there is $15,000 worth of machinery standing in the yard without a roof.
In the Electrical Laboratories, there are many studies to be made in
telephonic and radio-transmission, methods of minimizing the cost of copper
in transmission and distribution systems, etc., which are all vital questions of
the times. To study transmission problems adequately, the laboratory
should have an artificial transmission line equipment and an adequate high
voltage testing transformer set.*
In Railroad Engineering, practically no research is possible, and the
College has been wise, for the time being, to transfer students on specialized
work to the laboratories of Purdue and Illinois Universities until such time
as necessary facilities are developed.
An Adequate Hydraulic Laboratory is at present the most important
necessity. And it would seem that the University is fortunate in securing
from the Detroit Edison Company a site and water rights at Barton Dam.
Out of 14 college laboratories, only one, at Cornell University has such a
large gravity supply of water available. The new flume, recently authorized,
will be of temporary. assistance. With proper facilities, invaluable work
could be done in turbine testing water measurements and stream flow, etc.
The inability to test the experimental turbine above mentioned is an indica-
tion of the handicap under which the College is working.
Public Service: In matters of broader service to the State and Indus-
tries, the College of Engineering has done unusual service considering its
equipment. This work includes the survey of St. Clair Flats, lake surveys,
triangulation of waterways, and consultation in water supply and sanitation
in numerous cities. In the appraisal of public utilities alone, properties
totaling one and one-third billion dollars, in value, have been appraised,
about 00 per cent of which was done under commission of Cities or the
State. It is hoped an educational campaign for the state administration of
streams and water supply and also a codification of the present Michigan
drainage laws may soon be carried out.
The most encouraging part of all this, is that the personnel of the Col-
lege has already demonstrated its ability to accomplish results of unques-
* This is a matter of some personal interest to the speaker, as it develops that for
the last 16 years the only apparatus available for high voltage testing has been a small
100,000 volt transformer designed and built by him in 1899 as a thesis.


tioned practical as well as scientific value. To achieve the necessary breadth
of view point, the members of the faculty are very properly permitted and
encouraged to engage in outside consulting work, and the Board of Regents
is to be commended heartily for their foresight in making this possible.
What now seems to be most urgently needed is the separation of graduate
and undergraduate work with more space and more equipment so that ad-
vanced technical research may be prosecuted along distinct lines suggested
by the most urgent needs of the country's industries. It is hardly to be
doubted that the desired outside support would then become available.
We consider it essential, to render such research of maximum value,
that the results be published in permanent form. Should casual publication
in magazines and technical society proceedings be depended upon, much good
work could hardly hope to find a place of record.
In the matter of immediate publicity of the result of research work, the
rulings of the Board of Directors of the Graduate School and of the Board
of Regents, are mainly in accord with the collective opinion of the Alumni
as previously presented, except perhaps in very special cases where an un-
usual development or process should be uncovered in the course of research,
the publication of which would work unnecessary hardship upon the donor
of the fellowship, if some opportunity should not be first allowed to adapt
existing processes to the new discovery. This would simply give a prior
right to the donor within a very limited period.
Finally there exists very important and pressing research problems of a
broader nature, which could well receive attention either by the Graduate
School, or by the Bureau of Research such as the technical phases of city
planning, administrative efficiency in cities, public utilities and industries,
etc. Carrying this idea to its logical conclusion, it should also be possible
for the State to repose in such a Research Bureau as contemplated such
functions as would cause it to become a State Bureau of Standards, thus
encouraging standardized precision work. Such a source of disinterested
opinion would be invaluable in such cases as the preparation and fulfillment
of complex specifications, the proper standard of utility service, etc. Only
recently a movement has been inaugurated in one of the American Technical
Societies by which such local research and standardization bureaus should
be co-ordinated under the control of a central research organization, located
presumably at Washington, through which the most effective results could be
obtained for the country as a whole by assignment of certain subjects to the
various laboratories best equipped to handle them. This suggestion arose in
connection with the plans of the Naval Advisory Board for developing the
resources of this country in those particulars where its industries are serious-
ly handicapped by the lack of material due to the European War. The idea
however is fully as applicable to normal industrial development, and it is
quite in accord with the principles of Conservation of Resources, which this
country has definitely accepted. The University College, London, has also
just announced the completion of a research laboratory for this very purpose.
Such an organization would be invaluable in formulating the conditions
and making possible the establishment of more intimate trade relations with
Pan-American countries which are now lamentably handicapped by lack of


such standards suited to the countries, climates and peoples involved. Desul-
tory research could be of only limited value; organized research would be of
the most far-reaching value. It may be pointed out in this connection that in
Germany the industrial and educational systems are so co-ordinated that the
industries automatically turn to the technical laboratories for the solution of
their efficiency problems. This method we are just beginning to adopt in
this country.
SUMMARY—RECOMMENDATION OF COMMITTEE.
In summarizing the scope and purpose of this memorandum, no better
method can be followed than by submitting for your further consideration
certain recommendations as definite as it seems expedient to make at this
time. These may be stated as follows:
1st. That a comparative inquiry be conducted by the Board of
Regents into the work of the College of Engineering and Architecture,
the professional standing of its graduates, the compensation of its-
faculty members in view of the demand from the industries for technic-
ally trained men, the equipment and building facilities for both graduate
and undergraduate work and of the ways and means whereby the in-
tegrity of graduate degrees may be best maintained along with adequate
undergraduate instruction.
2nd. That a distinct department or Bureau of Technical Research
be organized on some plan sufficiently flexible that the laboratories may
be developed either as separate units where funds are limited, or more
centralized as may be found most practicable.
3rd. That a University Press be established to promulgate the re-
sults of technical research as well as the work of other Colleges, both
professional and literary.
4th. That intensive study be devoted to the immediate needs and
opportunities of service to the State and the Industries and that every
possible means of encouraging their co-operation be adopted.
5th. That attention be given to directing this work into channels of
special usefulness for the furtherance of foreign trade relations, es-
pecially with Pan-American countries.
6th. That inquiry be made to ascertain the possible field of im-
mediate co-operation with such organized bodies as the Naval Advisory
Board and the various Engineering Societies and commercial bodies for
the most efficient organization of technical research throughout the
country.
Closure: Gentlemen of the Board of Regents, we conclude this very
cursory presentation of our ideas. You will appreciate that sufficient time
has not been available to perfect them as they should have been perfected.
But we feel that the underlying principles expressed will receive due con-
sideration by you and we pledge you our hearty support in any further efforts


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
that may be necessary on our part to assist you in carrying out those phases
of the program proposed which will most directly meet the present needs.
And we also hope that this arousal of interest of the Engineering Alumni will
be only a beginning of helpful co-operation and that this interest will extend
to the Alumni of all other departments of the University to its ultimate last-
ing benefit.
Appreciating the courtesy of this hearing, we respectfully transmit here-
with this memoranda.

Member Naval Advisory Board.
"This development in the University of Michigan is strictly parallel with,
corresponding developments elsewhere, however, and since I was connected with
the faculty of the Schools of Engineering of Columhia University for a dozen
years, it is not difficult to understand that a pressing series of problems must
have arisen at Michigan as well as in other universities having schools of engineer-
ing. The growth of these everywhere has exceeded all expectations and predic-
tions, and it promises to continue in our own country for some time to come. The
simple fact seems to be that a course of diligent study in any branch of engineer-
ing fits men well for a large variety of occupations wherein capacity for effective
accomplishment is the chief desideratum.
Evidently the time has come when a strong appeal must be made to the
State, and possibly also to individual benefactors, for enlargement of facilities at
the University, not only for the purpose of giving elementary or undergraduates
instruction but only for the purpose of providing opportunities for advanced in-
struction and for productive research.
In general it is to be anticipated that few benefactors will be disposed to give
funds to a state. Hence, whatever may be the increasing needs of the Depart-
ment of Engineering at the University, they must be expected to be met chiefly
by increased appropriations from the State. Such appropriations, I think, will be
forthcoming when the facts with regard to the growth and value of the Univer-
sity are clearly set forth to the Regents and to the State Legislature.
Every great school of engineering should have five to ten eminent men con-
nected with it whose business is chiefly that of research. They may also ad-
vantageously give instruction to a limited degree; but their students, if they are
of the right kind, will not need much instruction in the presence of evolving ad-
vances and improvements in engineering science. It will require some time, how-
ever, for the educational public and our university authorities to fully appreciate
the value of this branch of university activity. As a nation, however, we shall
be in peril in competition with other nations if we provide no facilities for the
generation of men who not only possess knowledge but who can acquire new
knowledge. Thus, while I would consider this second desideratum in an engineer-
ing school not so practicable of easy achievement as the other, I would regard it
as of much greater importance to the future of the University and of our country.
It is a very encouraging sign of the times that the alumni of our universi-
ties are thinking of these problems, and I am sure that rational solutions of them
will be found if we on our part as engineers show the same degree of patience and
persistence found essential in the development of our professional problems."
2. Charles F. Brush, '69. Cleveland, Ohio.
"The general scheme proposed seems to me a most excellent one and calcu-
lated to make the engineering department directly and immediately useful to the
engineering and manufacturing interests of the United States, without in any
degree curtailing its heretofore field of usefulness in turning out competent
Engineers.
The questions whether or not manufacturers who furnish considerable sums
of money for carrying on specific investigations should have sole benefit of the
work for any great length of time is a somewhat difficult one. If they are to have-


110 protection in the benefits arising from a particular investigation to which they
have contributed largely in money they will not contribute. On the other hand, if
they were to have exclusive benefit the University would not be rendering to the
general public the full benefit of its operation as a University. It would seem
then, that protection for a limited time in the exclusive use of information gained
would be a more practicable distribution of benefits."
3. George H. Benzenberg, '67. Consulting Engineer, Milwaukee. Past
President, American Society of Civil Engineers.
"The amount of research work that is being done by other Universities,
which is attracting the attention not only of the business world but also of the
Prospective students, ought to stimulate Michigan to enter upon the sr.me field of
work, success in which goes very far in bringing the name of the University
prominently to the front.
I doubt, however, whether it would be good policy to give any concern the
exclusive benefit of any such research work even though such concern had con-
tributed largely or even entirely to the expense of carrying on such work.
The University is a public institution supported by the State and I fear its
administration would subject itself to considerable criticism if it allowed its
facilities being used for individual advantage in competitive business.
The State can well afford to provide for such work in consideration of the
prestige it will give the institution. The revelations in this field disclosed by the
present European war ought not to necessitate submitting any argument in favor
of establishing research bureaus in connection with our leading Universities and I
am sure the Alumni of Michigan are a unit in hoping that the Regents will give the
engineering department full opportunity of expanding its work in this line."
4. Jas. MacNaughten, '88. 2nd V. P. and Gen. Mgr. Calumet and Hecla
Mining Co., Calumet, Michigan.
"I am in full accord with the suggestion that the Regents acquire a more
intimate knowledge of the work of the Engineering College. Experience in
Europe is showing the results of technical training. There is no reason why the
Engineering Colleges of this Country should not be of as great usefulness to the
Government and the country at large as they have been to Germany. If there
is a proper co-operation between the public, the Regents and the Engineering
College there is no limit to the usefulness of the College or its effect on the
future of the State."
5. E. B. Perry, "89. Mgr. and Engr. Industrial Works, Bay City, Mich.
"Presumably, comparatively, few manufacturing institutions of the state have
the organization, talent or time for extended research along the many lines which
would be profitable, but their regular lines of business develop the need of solving
such problems as they arise, and if it were understood that the research depart-
ment of the university was available, I am sure it would be a very popular move-
ment."
6. /. II. Hunt, '05. Research Engineer, The Dayton Engineering Labora-
tories, Dayton, Ohio.
"It seems to me that when the public in general once begins to realize how
completely that part of our present civilization which contributes to our comfort


and progress is dependent on the engineering work of the past, there will be very-
great increase in the support that they will be glad to give to engineering colleges,
which are training the men who are to carry on this work."
7. B. IV. Conable, '99. Sec. and Treas. Barnhart Brothers &amp; Spindler,
Chicago, Illinois.
"I think it is also desirable to encourage the Regents to investigate the work
being done by the Engineering Department, and to further familiarize themselves
with it. Present day business is based upon engineering to such an extent that
every person should have a pretty fair idea of what engineering means, and how
much practical knowledge, outside of strictly technical matters, is included in the
various engineering courses, making them a valuable source of training for any
young man, no matter what he expects to do later on. Many people are apparently
not familiar with this aspect of engineering training, and while I have no doubt
the Regents are fully aware of its importance, I believe that every legitimate-
means should be used to impress upon them the needs and importance of the
Engineering Department."
8. A. A. Schlichte, '09. Marquette University, Milwaukee, Wis.
"I feel very strongly that co-operation has been one of the main reasons of
its success in Europe in the past. If one considers the remarkable success of the
Bradische Analin and Sodafabrik and then stops to think that it attained that
position not because of money or the knowledge of any one man on the com-
pany's pay-roll but because of the hearty and sincere co-operation of the various
German Universities and the State then one can truly realize what true co-opera-
tion between business, school and State can accomplish. We truly need such co-
operation in our country."
9. E. IV. Haack, '12. Royal Oak, Michigan.
"There should be a laboratory of this nature available somewhere for man-
ufacturing concerns to resort to, to have new ideas tried out and the State Uni-
versity is the proper place for it. Here we have men representing all kinds of
engineering who are best fitted to solve any problems of a technical nature that
may arise. At present we have nothing of this nature and manufacturing con-
cerns are often compelled to do without certain data which they need on account
of the prohibitive cost of the necessary apparatus to make the test or lack of men
capable of making a correct interpretation of the test after it is made. Our
State Agricultural College at Lansing affords free information to the agricultural
world and some excellent results have been obtained thereby and there are just
as great possibilities in the commercial world."
10. T. 0. Perry, '72. Oak Park, Illinois.
"If our Regents do not encourage experimental work by our professors I
think it is because they have not grown out of that old notion that a professor
ought to be so thoroughly conversant with everything in the line of his specialty
that no further experimental work could be of any assistance to him, or else he
is expected to be able by theory alone to supply all needful information.
In early life I was often admonished not to experiment. That I suppose
was because by natural inclination I often questioned printed sources of infor-
mation. I can truly say that in my line of work I have learned by experimental
work nearly all that I know with any degree of certainty and have found text-
book information generally not incorrect but often positively misleading."


11. James N. Hatch, '92. Consulting Engineer, Chicago, Illinois.
"In England, the Royal Society is granted $20,000 a year and there is dis-
tributed to other sources for similar purposes, $125,000. Since the beginning of
the war, a large number of college professors have placed their services at the
disposal of the Government for scientific research.
Germany contains a large number of special research institutions and in
that country, a college professor is looked upon as a specialist and is employed
by the war and naval departments of the empire in a great many special duties.
In Austria, the technical schools for industrial research are given amounts
encouraging the professors to interest themselves in various kinds of research
work.
In France, all universities, technical colleges, and higher engineering schools
are government institutions and as such are liberally supported, and they thus
form the main sources for research.
In Sweden, all engineering officers are graduated from engineering schools
as are naval constructors and architects.
In Russia, the Imperial Moscow Technical College receives from the new
office $100,000 for experiments, and for co-operation and training aviators.
In Spain, $57,000 per year is spent for industrial research by post graduate
students at technical schools.
In Switzerland, the Federal Polytechnic College at Zurich receives about
$20,000 per year for research in materials of construction and for field tests.
The Japanese Government has just appropriated a million dollars for re-
search work on the lines of allied engineering and the Japanese emperor has added
to this, $500,000 for the same purpose.
With the above in mind, I am more than ever convinced that the University
of Michigan should reach out into the research fields and be of more general
benefit to the State of Michigan and to the nation and I would favor a movement
by the alumni to interest the Regents of the State in making appropriations for
this purpose, for I believe that the State will receive in return benefits that will
greatly outweigh the amounts which might be spent in carrying on this research."'
12. Lester Kirschbraun, '04. Director Chicago Paving Laboratory.
"All sound advancement in the engineering profession is dependent largely
upon research work. This research work is to the largest extent of the kind
which must be developed under conditions apart from commercial life. The
universities with equipment, scientific staff and available material for carrying
out detail work are the ideal centres for conducting this necessary research work.
The University of Michigan, in accordance with its spirit, age and traditions^
should be a leader in developing this research work in a practical manner.
The writer is personally interested in Highway Engineering and the knowl-
edge of the fitness of various materials and their application to the new science.
This branch of the engineering profession is in its infancy, and there is a crying
need of the right kind of research work which, if properly applied, will be effec-
tive in directing the good roads movement into scientific channels with immense
savings of money. The men in commercial practice in this field have neither
the time, means nor equipment for carrying out extensive research work. The
universities are the ideal sources from which this pioneer work should come."'
13. H, L. Brown, '12. Asst. Editor Electrical World.
"This brings to my mind a point which I have long watched and felt that
the University of Michigan was very much behind the times on, and should


take action to remedy. We ought to have some better means than the Michigan
Technic for publishing news of the activities of the engineering department.
The University of Illinois has derived a tremendous value from the frequent
pamphlets it has issued on the various engineering experimental tests carried on
by the engineering department. These tests are gotten out in a very readable
and valuable form and accompanied by brief abstracts and sent to practically all
the technical papers in the country.
The result is that since these pamphlets with their already prepared ab-
stracts are sent to all the technical journals and a great many others in the
United States, that the University of Illinois is very widely and favorably adver-
tised. And it is a perfectly legitimate and commendable advertising work for
the university to carry on. I firmly believe that this one thing has done more
than any other toward giving the University of Illinois the prestige which it
now enjoys and which it has secured very largely in a comparatively short time."
14. Fred R. Hoovey, '99. Bridge Engineer, Kansas City, Mo.
"The only suggestion which I am able to make at this time and which may
be helpful, is that the University work along the proposed lines with 'trade asso-
ciations' rather than with individuals or individual companies. Nearly every line
of business has its trade associations and, generally speaking, the trade associa-
tions contain as members and representatives the best of those in one particular
line of business. Trade associations themselves make for efficiency, and I be-
lieve that by working as suggested with trade associations rather than with indi-
vidual persons or companies a greater harmony and more general benefits will
be secured."
15. IV. M. Clapp, '84. Treasurer, the Cleveland Foundry Company.
"I think no set rules could be established but that each case should be con-
sidered on its merits and an agreement reached before the money was accepted
and the work undertaken. In some cases it might be wise to give an exclusive
license without return from the manufacturer. In another case it might be wise
to give an exclusive license to a manufacturer, he to pay a royalty and his first
payment of lump sum to apply on future royalties. In another case, it might be
wise to give only a shop right with or without royalty, reserving the right to
license others. The decision might in some cases involve public health or public
safety and the question would then be one of the general public welfare and
would have to be considered entirely from that viewpoint."
16. G. R. Simpson, '86. United States Patent Office, Washintgon, D. C.
"As to any inventions made in such work, the patent should belong to the
student. The corporation interested and co-operating with the student should
have a license under the patent. As to the State, a license should be provided
for the use of the invention in certain specified state institutions not engaged in
commercial business, i. c., not in manufacturing, mining or public utility business."
iy. T. E. Bamum, '92. Cutler Hammer Mfg. Co., Milwaukee, Wis.
"The thing to be done then would seem to be to bring together in some way
the efforts of these public and private laboratories for the general good of the
industries of the country. If this might be done the work in the general field
might be subdivided amongst the various laboratories so as to avoid the duplica-
tion of effort, and in general to obtain the object desired with a minimum of cost
and in the shortest time.


Small corporations are unable to support such a research laboratory, and
it would of the greatest benefit to the smaller comapnies. Such work as the col-
lection of all information on companies. Such work as the collection of all in-
formation on certain industrial problems, which would be availble to the small
manufacturer, would be of the greatest benefit. I believe, however, that what-
ever work is done should be made free to the public, so that the various manu-
facturers might avail themselves of the results of the research work by payment
of a small fee."
18. /. //. Hunt, '05. Research Engineer, The Dayton Engineering Lab-
oratories, Dayton, Ohio.
"I wish to suggest that it will probably not be desirable to attempt a hard
and fast rule to cover the question of publication of the results of engineering
investigations by students who have received financial support from engineering
manufacturers. I believe that, wherever possible arrangement should be made to
provide for publication, but that a rigid rule to this effect would exclude a lot
of work that would be very desirable to have the University carry out, both for
the sake of the University itself and on account of the fact that it will put the
students in touch with advantageous opportunities after graduation. I have
known of cases in the past where manufacturers would have been desirous of
having work along certain lines undertaken, but could not have considered hav-
ing this work done if publication were necessary, because in order to have the
work carried on efficiently it would be necessary to put at the disposal of the
student and instructors sources of information along related lines subjects which
were not yet available for publication at the time in question. The question of
the publication in the particular case could very probably be left to the Dean to
settle in conference with the manufacturer supplying the funds."
19. Henry S. Razvdon, '12. Bureau of Standards, Washington, D. C.
"My work here at the Bureau of Standards rather influences me in the
question of whether a manufcturer should for a time be allowed the sole use of
any findings made, to take the negative stand. The day of "trade secrets" is
passing and one should not delay it."
20. Dean B. Wilhelm, '06. The Gray Eagle Reduction Co., Mayer, Ariz.
"It appears to me that all ideas and data obtained in such an investigation
should be given to the general public. The University is a public institution
supported principally by state taxes, therefore, all information derived from the
institution should be for the good of all. The above question is well answered
by a conversation I once heard between a policeman and a lady with her small
son. The boy had picked some wild flowers in a public park and the policeman
had objected. The lady informed him that she was a tax payer and that that
was public property. The reply was, "I fully appreciate that fact, madam, but
you are making private property of it"

BY HORACE W. KING, '95
Measurement op Flowing Water.
The measurement of flowing water is continually becoming a problem
of greater importance to the hydraulic engineer. This has been largely
brought about through the rapid development in the fields of water power
and irrigation and the increasing demands of our cities for water for
domestic purposes.
New methods of measurement have been suggested from time to time
during the past century, and the last decade has been especially notable in
this regard. There has also been displayed great interest by the engineering
profession in studying the data of the earlier engineers which has recently
formed the basis of a number of interesting and valuable contributions to
engineering literature. In many cases the old data have been supplemented
with new experiments, thus giving the results of the earlier investigators
a wider range of application.
Our knowledge of hydraulics is derived almost entirely from experi-
ments. The number of basic equations which can in any sense be consid-
ered theoretical, may be counted on the fingers of one hand, and in every
case these formulas must be modified by empirical coefficients before they
can be safely applied to practical problems.
Most of the problems in hydraulics with which the engineer has to deal
refer either directly or indirectly to the determination of the quantity of
water that will flow through some form of an orifice, weir, pipe, or open
channel. In each case the formula of flow is based upon experimental data.
Scope op Investigation.
This paper deals with the determination of the quantity of water that
will flow through a right-angled V-notch weir with sharp edges. One of
the equations investigated is the basic formula given in all works on hy-
draulics,
in which Q is the discharge over the weir in cubic feet per second and H
is the measured head of water passing over the weir. C represents an em-
pirical coefficient to be determined by experiment.
In order to make the study more general, with a view to obtaining a
formula which will more closely fit experimental results the expression
Q = C'H°
has also been investigated. In this case both C and n must be determined
experimentally.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Experimental Data Used in Investigation.
Three sets of experiments have been investigated, as follows:
i. By Professor James Thompson,* of Belfast, Ireland, in 1858.—
Range of head, from 2 inches to 7 inches.
2. By James Barr.f of Glasgow, Scotland, in 1907-9.—Range of head,
from 2 inches to 10 inches.
3. By C. N. Ward, F. A. Nagler, H. R. Leach and A. F. Sherzer,
under the writer's direction at the University of Michigan in 1916. Range
of head from 0.16 ft. to 1.79 ft.
Table 1 is a summary of the published results by Prof. Thompson.

From the above data Prof. Thompson chose a mean value for C of .305.
His formula of discharge then becomes:
Q (cu. ft. per min.) =.305 (H inches)2-s
This formula with Q in cubic feet per second and H in feet becomes ap-
proximately,
Q = 2.54H-5
For over 50 years this formula based upon the very meager data con-
tained in Table 1 has been generally accepted for determining the discharge
over a sharp-edged right-angled V-notch weir.
The Experiments by Barr throw much additional light upon this im-
portant subject. Several hundred experiments in all were performed and
it appears that the most precise methods of measurement were used. The
water was measured volumetrically. The mean of Barr's results is given
in Table 2.

is not a constant but varies about 3^% between heads of 2 inches and 10
inches.

Description of University of Michigan Experiments.
In Table 3 the result for each experiment is the mean of from three to
eight observations. Heads were measured with a hook gage in a pail at-
tached to the side of the flume in which the weir was located, about six feet
upstream from the weir. A y± inch hose about 30 feet long was used to
connect the pail to the flume.

The flume was 8.05 feet wide and about 5 feet deep. The angle of the
weir was 2.0 feet above the bottom of the tank. Water from pumps was
admitted through the bottom of the flume about 22 feet above the weir.
Baffles were constructed about 15 feet above the weir which reduced oscil-
lation of the water. A very uniform discharge was maintained by the
pumps, and very little oscillation or fluctuation was observed in the pail
where hook gage readings were made.
After discharging over the weir the water was conveyed to the weigh-
ing tank. The maximum quantity of water weighed was 25,000 lbs. for the
higher heads. For low heads a quantity of water was weighed which would
keep the length or run about three minutes.
The method used in measuring water was to close the gates of the
weighing tank and set the weight on the scale beam ahead to some suitable
point, say 5,000 lbs. A stop watch was started the instant the beam tipped.
The weight was then moved ahead an amount equal to the quantity of water
to be weighed and the watch stopped when the beam tipped a second time.
The watch could be read to fifths of a second.
The temperature of the water during the progress of these experiments
was nearly constant, about 65 ° Farenheit. A careful determination of
specific gravity at this temperature was made and the weight per cubic foot
of water was found to be 62.40. The accuracy of the scales was tested by
applying a dead weight of about 5000 lbs., and they were found to be in
satisfactory adjustment.
Study of Experiments.
The results of the experiments in Table 3 were investigated by the
method of least squares to determine the value of the constants in the
expression
Q = C'H"
The resulting formula to two decimal places was
Q = 2.52//2-47
In order to compare the University of Michigan experiments with those
of Thompson and Barr, Table 4 has been prepared. Columns 2, 4 and 6
give values of C in the formula
for each set of experiments. These represent the means of the experimental
values for each head and corresponding discharge. This mean was ob-
tained by plotting the experimental values of C against H and drawing a
mean curve through the potted points. From these values of C correspond-
ing values of C in the formula
were computed as given in columns 3, 5 and 7.


It will be noted in each set of experiments that the value of C gradually
decreases as the head increases. This indicates that an exponent of H less
than 2.5 should give a more nearly constant value of C. From column 7 it
will be seen that an exponent of 2.47 for the University of Michigan Experi-
ments gives a nearly constant value of C, approximately 2.52, which has
already been given as the co-efficient obtained from the least squares method
of solution.

An exponent of 2.478 for Barr's experiments will give a nearly con-
stant coefficient equal to approximately 2.48.
The exponent of H that would best fit Thompson's experiments is
nearlv 2.49. There is however but little information available regarding
the manner in which these experiments were performed and as they cover
such a narrow range of discharge they are not entitled to the weight of the
other experiments. The effect of velocity of approach would have the
effect of slightly decreasing the value of C or C for the higher heads, but
this increase would be insignificant for Rarr's Experiments and the Uni-
versity of Michigan Experiments.


A very careful investigation was carried on by Barr to determine the
effect of roughness of the upstream surface of the notch plate. Barr's-
original experiments were performed with notches cut in smooth brass
plates. To determine the effect that roughness of the upstream face had
upon discharge the surface was varnished, and dusted with emery before the
varnish dried. The effect of this roughening was to increase the discharge
about 2%.
The weir for the University of Michigan Experiments was cut from
a steel plate % inch thick, the upstream edge being a sharp right angle, and
the lower edge beveled to make the crest of the weir %" thick.
It will be observed from columns 5 and 7 of Table 4 that the values of
C' are about 2% greater for the University of Michigan Experiments than
for Barr's experiments. This may be accounted for by the effect of rough-
ness of the upstream surface of the weir plate as observed by Barr. The
plate used in the University of Michigan Experiments was of ordinary
commercial steel plate and undoubtedly very much rougher than the smooth
brass plate used in the Barr Experiments. Assuming that this explanation
accounts for the 2% discrepancy the two sets of Experiments give results
varying by less than 1 % throughout.
It appears from this investigation that the discharge over a sharp-edged
right-angled V-notch weir, cut from commercial steel plate, or other metal
of similar roughness is given within an accuracy of 1 % by the formula
For a similar weir cut from metal having a very smooth upstream face
the data contained in Table 4 for Barr's Experiments should be used.
Comparative Accuracy of V-Notched and Rectangular Weirs.
The notch weir has a decided advantage in accuracy over the rectangu-
lar weir in measuring small quantities of water and is therefore better
adapted to the measurement of small discharges which fluctuate and at times
become small.
This may be shown by assuming that Q for a rectangular weir is given
by the Francis formula
0 = 3-3'-"A5
and that for a notch weir it is given by the formula
Q = 2.52tf2-47
Assume Q = o.i sec. ft. then
H2=.27i


Assume an error of + .005 feet in measuring head, then for the rect-
angular weir
0 = 3-33 H»-s= .1085
and for the notch weir
Q = 2.52//2-t7= .1048
In other words an error of .005 ft. in measuring head will introduce
an error of 8.5% for a rectangular weir one foot long and 4.8% for a
right-angled V-notch weir. If the rectangular weir were 2 feet long the
corresponding error for a discharge of 0.1 second ft. would be 13.0%, the
error increasing with the length of the weir. For a discharge of 1.0 second
foot the errors in discharge corresponding to an error of .005 foot in meas-
uring head would be
1.7% for a right-angled V-notch weir. v
1.7% for a rectangular weir 1 ft. long.
2.7% for a rectangular weir 2 ft. long.
5.0% for a rectangular weir 5 ft. long.
In this connection it should also be remembered that considerable un-
certainty exists regarding discharge over rectangular weirs for heads below
0.2 ft. It thus appears that the V-notch weir has a decided advantage in
accuracy over the rectangular weir for measuring small discharges.

Announcement of the Engineering The progress of aviation to the
College this year, with some approxi- present time is without parallel in the
mation to care, were treated to a sur- history of the conquests of nature,
prise. Under "Sequence of Studies," To get a proper conception of this,
a whole page was devoted to nothing one needs only to consider such an
else than outlining a course in Aero- aerial display as the war fleets of the
nautical Engineering. To many, es- European nations, and at the same
pecially the underclassmen, the term time to rememher that these achieve-
was unfamiliar, much more the sci- ments had their beginnings in the
ence masquerading under that name, humble efforts of the Wright Broth-
Few, perhaps, drew the correct con- ers, but thirteen years ago. Neverthe-
clusion,—that a valuable innovation less, the work that has made possible
had been made in the curriculum; that this advance has been characterized by
a step had been taken which gives fur- "rule of thumb" designing and empir-
ther evidence that Michigan is in the ical experimentation. Interesting and

fundamental principles have been de-
monstrated, but until recently, little at-
tempt lias been made to apply theory
to the safe construction of aircraft.
Aerial navigation has been, especially
in this country, more the domain of
the daring aviator and the sportsman
than the scientist and engineer.
Not so with the future. What the
number and nature of the achieve-
ments will be, it is not possible to pre-
dict. This much is certain, that the
progress witnessed will be large meas-
ure depend on the use that is made of
the technical information being gath-
ered in all countries, and on the inves-
tigation, both theoretical and experi-
mental, of the individual problems of
aircraft design and construction. The
aeronautical engineer must come;
trained in college; kept in touch with
the latest research and practice by
technical publications and organiza-
tions, such as are characteristic of the
otber engineering branches.
If this is the case, aeronautical en-
gineering is indeed already in our
midst. In August of this year, the
first technical magazines on aerial
flight made their appearance,—"Avia-
tion and Aeronautical Engineering"
and "Aerial World." At the same
time "Aerial Age" added material of
technical as well as descriptive na-
ture. Courses in aeronautics have
been given in engineering schools for
the past three years. In 1913, Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technology in-
troduced such work as graduate study,
for which mechanicals, electricals and
marines were eligible, and the situa-
tion there is the same today. The de-
partment is well equipped and much
valuable work has been done. In 1914
Michigan offered three courses, which
were as much a success as could be
expected of preliminary work. They
were merely electives, to be taken by
any student of the College. This year
fourteen studies, totaling twenty-two
hours, are announced, as one of the
three groups of naval architecture and
marine engineering. Since the prelim-
inary work for marine engineering is
not the same in sequence as for aero-
nautical, the special four-year pro-
gram above mentioned has been work-
ed out. This makes aeronautics prac-
tically a department by itself.
Other universities will no doubt
commence this work rapidly. Cer-
tainly the possibilities for success in a
field where the near future will bring
a greater demand than the supply of
technical services, will cause many
coming engineers to seek instruction
in this field. The promise of original
and interesting work will draw others.
Whatever the response to this demand,
we can say with pride that Michigan
is one of the pioneers,—in the front
rank.
FROM THE FRONT
One of the recent exchanges re-
ceived by the Teciinic is a war issue
of Applied Science, the organ of the
University of Toronto (Ontario) En-
gineering Society. The present num-
ber is the first one which has been put
out since publication was stopped in
August. 1915, and another is not to
be published until after the war. The
little book well portrays the spirit of
the University men toward the war,
for it states, "there has been a steady
stream of school men answering the
call of King and Country." There fol-
lows a list of the valorous deeds of
undergraduates and alumni who have
been in the service.
All of which gives us a better appre-
ciation of our own good fortune in not
having class and faculty rolls reduced
by a similar catastrophe.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
IN THIS ISSUE
We are fortunate in being able to
present an exceptional article on hy-
draulic research work in the College.
Professor King, of the Civil Engineer-
ing Faculty, has for some time been in
supervision of experimental work on
the flow of water over right-angled
V-notched weirs. It has been possible
to carry the investigation out using
higher heads than had heretofore been
used, with the result that the coeffi-
cients are given for a much wider
range.
Another article of especial note is
"Aircraft Motors" by Mr. O. E.
Hunt, of the Packard Motor Car
Company. At the time of the advent
of the Packard Twin-Six motor, we
asked Mr. Hunt for a discussion of
this new type, but at that time he was
engaged with aeroplane motor design
so that he could find no time for liter-
ary labors. At this early opportunity,
however, he has favored us with an
interesting story of the problems and
their solutions encountered in the de-
sign of this latest type of engine. It
is noteworthy in that it appears dur-
ing the first semester in which Aero-
nautics is taught as a course in this
College.
God bless my boy! my mother cried,
Another hundred! Dad replied.
Oh, how tired, how hard I've tried,—
Oh, happy day! I am through with hash,
Ann Arbor's menu—pork and trash,
Aniline fluid, a coffee spash.
Alas! I serve in an auto shop,
Have a position ala kerflop,
A weekly stipend of a twenty spot—
I am an Engineer!


AUTUMN, the season when Nature
adorns herself in her brightest hues,
when the trees are a kaleidoscope of
color, the corn and pumpkins are yellow in
the fields and the air is fresh and invigorat-
ing—Autumn and its football days, finds
us on the threshold of another university
year.
After a summer of varied activities—in
the factories and the harvest fields, at the
seashore, citizen military camps or the en-
gineers' summer camp—activities which
have led us over the country in every direc-
tion, we have returned to the old familiar
scenes and to a new year of possibilities
and opportunities.
The usual hustle and hurry and excite-
ment which marks the opening of the fall
term, were everywhere evident during the
first few days of school. Old friends were
to be greeted, new ones to be met, summer
experiences to be talked over and familiar
scenes revisited.
An unusually large group of freshmen
are here. The eyes of the University are
on these yearlings. The fraternities are
rushing men; the publications are seeking
recruits to their staffs; the athletic authori-
ties are weeding out the athletes, and the
faculty are endeavoring to launch them on
a trip which will carry them without dis-
aster over the four year course of their
university career. We are quickly initiat-
ing them into Michigan life and traditions,
and they have learned of the Michigan
Union and all the other worth-while insti-
tutions and activities of the campus.
The upperclassmen have registered and
classified; we have begun to study; we have
been to Ferry Field to see the "Hurry Up
Man" working out as promising a squad
of footballers as we have seen in several
years; we have been to the "Maj," the
"Orph" and the "Arc;" we have been to
Martha Cook and the Busy Bee. We are
quickly mobilizing our scattered interests
to the banner of the University and prepar-
ing for "one beeg Michigan year." Life
in a college town is once again resuming
the even tenor of its ways and the year
rolls merrily on.
When the College Editor's copy for these
columns was fast becoming due at the
Press and when he had finally set himself
to the task of preparing it, he scratched his
head a number of times, he sharpened his
pencil a number of times more, he gained
considerable experience in the art of floor-
walking and in general, moved in an atmos-
phere of worry and doubt. College activi-
ties had been practically suspended since
June. But a very small proportion of the
student body had spent the summer in Ann
Arbor, and everything looked far from
bright for "ye editor." Just about this time
however, stories began to drift in about the
wonderful times the fellows had had at
the engineer's summer camp; visits to the
laboratories brought to light the research


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
work which had been going on; quiet and
unobtrusive corners of the laboratories dis-
closed story possibilities in unique proces-
ses and instruments; a look about the
campus and we saw many changes, and the
editor quickly brushed away the cobwebs
of doubt and got to work.
In one corner of the Chemistry building,
there is a cabinet display of metals and
photographs of metal sections. Perhaps
few of our embryo engineers have ever
paused to notice it, or to realize the great
and growing importance of these photo-
graphs in our industrial establishments of
today, which handle iron and steeL Mr.
Harold Wood, last year's holder of the
Edison Fellowship, enlightens us on this
subject in an interesting description of
metallography and its industrial appli-
cations.
"Mac" and "Burnsie," editors of The
Technic and of the "Black Fly," the engi-
neers' summer camp paper, have furnished
us with glowing accounts of their summer's
outing and of the difficulties and tribula-
tions of a backwoods editor. We had to cut
them short or there would not have been
space for anything else in this issue.
1920, Attain These Ends
This is for you: "First, conserve your
health. Second, cultivate the ability to
express yourself in writing and in oral
speech, in clear, concise, correct English.
Third, extend your horizon by reading and
studying industrial and political history,
political science, economics, labor problems,
and banking. Fourth, be careful in selecting
your associates and do not become a man
of technical details. Finally learn to serve,
participate in public affairs, and last and all
the time, be courageous, have an ambition
for a large success, and then work hard to
attain that goal."
Equatorial Sextant
When working with the splendid equip-
ment now furnished by the department of
Surveying, few students pause to think of
the difficulties which confronted the sur-
veyor of a half century ago. A glan~e in
the display cabinet in the instrument room
of the Surveying building will impress up-
on the mind some of the handicaps under
which the old surveyor labored. Some of
the early instruments were notably crude;
others very ingenious. Among the l.tt^r
class there remains to us one novel and in-
teresting instrument, the equatorial sextant.
Asst. Professor C. O. Carey has wiitten
the following interesting account of its-
history.
The equatorial sextant was invented by
William Austin Burt, an American sur-
veyor, and the inventor of Burt's Solar
Compass, which has been in general use in
the United States Land Surveys. The
names Burt and Watson are given as-
makers.
Mr. Burt was born in Worcester, Mass.,
in 1792, and died in 1858. He was employ-
ed for some time in surveying in New
York state and came to Michigan in 1824.
A great part of the northern portion of
the state of Michigan was surveyed by
him between 1840 and 1847. He did much
to improve methods of surveying and to-
detect defective and fraudulent surveys,
which were of common occurrence in early
land surveys. He was also a judge of the
circuit court of Michigan, and a member
of the state legislature. He was one of
the men influential in projecting the ship-
canal at Sault Ste. Marie.
This instrument was patented in 1856,
but on account of Mr. Burt's death occur-
ring such a short time after this it did not
come into general use, and only the one
instrument was made. It was presented
to the University of Michigan in iQOp,
through Professor J. B. Davis, by the heirs-
of Austin Burt, the son of William A.
Burt, the inventor. Part of the correspond-
ence between Professor Davis and these
heirs is given below.
January 12, 1909.
Prof. Joseph B. Davis, C.E.,
University of Michigan,
Ann Arbor, Michigan.
Dear Sir:
In pursuance of correspondence, recent-
ly, between Mr. H. E. Burt and yourse'f.
the undersigned who are the only living-


201
heirs of Austin Burt, deceased, whose
Equatorial Sextant, the invention of his
father, William Austin Burt, is considered
a precious heirloom, now have the pleas-
ure of presenting the same, through you,
to the University of Michigan. We hand
you, also, therewith a pamphlet of Instruc-
tions for the use of this Instrument, pre-
pared and published by its Inventor Jan-
uary 1st, 1858. In January of that year,
while instructing a class of some twelve
lake and sea captains in the use of th;
Equatorial Sextant, William A. Burt was
stricken fatally with heart disease, from
which he died in August, 1858, and this will
account mainly for the fact that the in-
strument did not come into general use on
the sea, as his Solar Compass had come
into general use in the land surveys of the
United States.
As an heirloom, this instrument would
have very little interest for other than the
undersigned and their children; hut in the
possession and care of the University,
among those who make a study of Naviga-
tion and Engineering subjects, both the in-
strument and its Inventor are likely to
awaken special interest. At least, we hope
so. It was while engaged in the inspection
of defective and fraudulent surveys in
Michigan that its principles and mechan-
ical construction were conceived of.
Yours very truly,

My dear Sir:
By the hand of Robert M. Fox of De-
troit I received from your family,—the liv-
ing heirs of your father.—on the evening
of Tuesday, the 12th of January, ioco, your
treasured heirloom of Judge William A.
Burt, the same being an equatorial sextant
of his invention and make. With this sin-
gular and interesting instrument came the
letter donating the same to the University
of Michigan, and also a photograph of the
instrument, with an incomplete copy of the
pamphlet that describes the use of this
sextant, dated 1858. Doubtless the copy
of the pamphlet was the best to be had in
Detroit. As I have your comp'ete copy it
is my intention to have it copied in full by
a typewriter for preservation with this
sextant, before returning it to you.
The Michigan Engineering Society be-
ing in session here at the time, I exhibited
the sextant at the meeting next day. The
connection with the name of William A.
Burt assured the exhibit of a welcome. I
regret I was not able to give the sextant a
better presentation than I did,—not having
an opportunity to familiarize myself with-
its working.—but the strangeness of this
sextant,—being entirely unique so far as
my own knowledge goes,—interested many
of those present, especially those who were
born surveyors.
You will in due time receive a suitable
acknowledgement from the Regents. In
the mean time please accept my personal,
grateful appreciation of your generous
gift. I am pleased to become the custodian-
of this remarkable instrument. It seems
to me to be remarkable not only for the
idea involved, or embodied in it, but a.ho
for its mechanical construction. Its con-
struction involves mechanical difficulties
which I am sure would be apprec'ated by
makers of instruments of precision of the
present day, not to say those of 1855.
Michigan was very fortunate in having
Judge Burt for a citizen. Fortunate in
many ways, some of which are matters of
my own knowledge from records, and in-
formation from several sources. The more
I learn of him the more I respect the marr
and his work,—but especially the sound-
ness of his judgment, the balance of his;
mind and his trustworthiness.
Respectfully,
(Signed) J. B. Davis,
Professor of Geodesy and Surveying.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Neither the pamphlet of instructions
mentioned in the correspondence nor a
copy of the same can be found with the
other information about this instrument
left by Professor Davis, but a careful
study of the sextant shows how it is to be
used. The purpose of the instrument is
the solution, mechanically, of the spherical
triangle formed by the pole, the sun, and
the zenith of the observer.
The instrument has two vertical, con-
centric circles about ten inches in diame-
ter, one fitting closely inside the other.
The outer circle is rigidly attached to the
base M, but the inner circle is free to ro-
tate about the common center (Fig. i).
To the inner, vertical circle is attached a
polar axis C with a graduated arc D per-
pendicular to it, for measuring the hour
angle. The outer, vertical circle carries
a graduated scale A, by means of which
the inner, vertical circle can be set to cor-
respond with the latitude of the place of
observation—to make the polar axis paral-
lel to the axis of the earth. Attached to
the base M, and in the plane of the vertical
■circles, is a vertical axis carrying the grad-
uated, vertical altitude arc E, and also car-
rying a vernier arm I, which moves around
the graduated, horizontal, azimuth arc F.
The vernier arms G and H are attached to
a horizontal axis through the vertical axis,
at the center of the concentric, vertical
arcs, and rotate simultaneously on this
axis, in the plane of the vertical arc E. The
vernier G is moved along the graduated
arc B to set off the declination, and at the
same time the vernier H moves along the
arc E, giving altitude. The vernier arm G
is connected with the vernier arm J by
means of a bar with slot for clamping in
any position for declination of the sun.
When vernier J is set at zero, vernier I
should read zero also. With vernier arm
G clamped in position for declination, as
the vernier arm J is moved along arc D
through any hour angle, the arm G moves
with it in declination, the vernier I moves
in azimuth along the scale F, and vernier
H moves along the altitude scale E.
The instrument can be used in the de-
termination of longitude from a single ob-
servation of the sun for altitude with a


203
sextant, knowing the latitude of the place
and the declination of the sun. First, shift
the inner, vertical circle until its index on
scale B is set at the reading for the latitude
of the place of observation as shown by
the outer scale A. Clamp K with its tan-
gent screw is used for this setting. Set
vernier G for the declination of the sun,
and clamp in this position, using clamp
L and its tangent screw. Move vernier J
along the hour angle arc D until vernier
H, which moves simultaneously along the
scale E, is set for the observed altitude of
the sun. Use clamp N and its tangent
screw for this setting. Now read vernier
J for the hour angle and vernier I for the
azimuth of the sun.
Fig. 1 shows the instrument set for zero
hour angle and zero azimuth, the posi-
tion for setting off the declination. Fig. 2
shows the instrument in position for the
solution of the triangle. It can be used
for the solution of the triangle with any
planet or star with declination no greater
than about 25 degrees, in place of the sun.
METALLOGRAPHY
It has only been within the last fifteen
years that the science of metallography has
heen seriously considered by metal manu-
facturers and consumers. The purpose of
this paper is to outline, in a very brief way,
some of the applications of the science that
Tiave caused its extraordinarily rapid de-
velopment.
Historical
The first paper published on the subject
of metallography was by Sorby in 1864.
This consisted merely of a few notes on
the microscopic structure of iron. In 1868,
Tschernoff made the first important step
in the advancement of the science, when
he enunciated the chief laws which lie at
the foundation of the metallography of iron.
In 1885, Brinell added to these laws and in
1888, Osmond stated that the extraordinary
influence which heat-treatment and the
presence of certain foreign elements have
on iron, was due to allotropy. Very soon
after this important discovery, came the
rapid development of the special or alloy
steels. Among the most important of these,
may be mentioned the austenitic mangan-
ese steel, which was discovered by Hadfield
in 1898. This was the first substance to
combine very great hardness with great
ductility. Later, Taylor and White intro-
duced the high-speed tool steel which re-
tains its hardness even when it is heated,
by the friction caused by rapid cutting, to
a dull redness. Lying alongside of the
actual discovery of the processes for the
manufacture of steel and the blast furnace
process, may be placed the science of met-
allography, for, through the influence of
this science, the metallurgy of iron and
steel has been placed on a scientific basis.
The Microscopic Examination of Metals
In the early days of the science, investi-
gators thought that the ideal method of
examining metals under a microscope, was
to prepare a very thin section of the metal
and examine the same by transmitted light.
Very great difficulty was encountered in
doing this. It has been estimated that a
slice of iron thin enough to transmit even
10 per cent of the light falling upon it,
would have to be less than ix io~* m.m.
thick. The fallacy of attempting to pre-
pare such specimens is evident at once.
The structure of the metal is very liable to
undergo a change during the preparation,
in fact it is difficult to see how such a thin
section could be prepared without changing
the structure, and the resultant material,
therefore, would not be typical of the metal
examined.
Later the use of Roentgen rays for the
purpose of penetrating metal of greater
thickness was investigated. At that time
the technic of radio-activity was still in its
infancy, and no reliable results were ob-
tained. During the last year, however, this
method has been used to very good advan-
tage in determining the presence and loca-
tion of various impurities in metals.
The method, as used by the modern met-
allographist, consists in preparing a com-
paratively flat surface on the specimen, and
then grinding this surface perfectly flat by
means of a very fine emery wheel. After


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
this has been done, the flat surface of the
specimen is polished by holding it very
lightly on a cloth covered disk, upon which
is placed polishing powder, a small stream
of water being allowed to spray upon the
rapidly revolving disk during the operation.
The sample is held so that the polishing
operation takes place at right angles to the
scratches left on the surface by the fine em-
ery wheel. When these scratches are worn
off, the operation is repeated on another
disk, using a finer grade of polishing pow-
der. This operation is repeated usually
with three different grades of polishing
powder before a surface absolutely free
from scratches is obtained.
Many different kinds of polishing pow-
der can be found on the market. The writ-
er has found alundum and alumina, ground
to different degrees of fineness, very satis-
factory.
After the surface of the metal has been
prepared, the structure is developed by a
process called etching. There are a great
many methods followed in doing this, as
nearly every different type of metal or al-
loy requires a different etching reagent to
properly show its crystalline structure. The
reagents most frequently applied are weak
organic acids or dilute solutions of mineral
acids in alcohol or water.
It has been shown by various investigat-
ors that every metal has present between
its crystals an amorphous material. This
amorphous material is more soluble than
the crystalline material and therefore the
process of etching consists merely in dis-
solving a portion of this amorphous inter-
crystalline material and leaving the less
soluble crystalline material unattacked. An
example of a metallic surface so treated is
shown in the case of pure iron. This is
illustrated by the photomicrograph in Fig.
I.
In order to get a permanent record of
this structure, it must be photographed
through a microscope.
Industrial Applications
The microscopic analysis of a metal or
alloy reveals its internal structure or anat-
omy and its proximate composition, while
the chemical analysis reveals only its ulti-
mate composition. The physical properties
of a metal or alloy are very closely related
to its proximate composition and crystalline
structure. Since the exceptional industrial
importance of all metals and alloys depend
upon their physical properties, it is at once
evident that careful microscopic study is-
very necessary in order to correctly under-
stand their behavior. Although chemistry
gives the metallurgist a large store of in-
valuable information, without which both
the physician and the metallurgist would be
in total darkness, it throws but little light
upon the actual anatomy of the matter be-
ing investigated.
The analytical chemist may tell us that a
certain steel has the following composition:
Carbon 0.56%
Silicon 0.30%
Manganese 0.45%
Sulphur 0.05%
Phosphorus 0.08%
without our being able to form any idea
as to its physical properties. Such a steel
may have a tensile strength of some 70.000
lbs. per square inch, and a ductility repre-
sented by an elongation of 20 per cent; or a
tensile strength of 150,000 lbs. per square
inch, combined with practically no ductility
at all; it may be hard enough to cut glass
or so soft as to be bent into nearly any
shape. A microscopic study of the metal
enables one to accurately predict its physi-
cal properties while no such prediction
could be given with a mere knowledge of
the chemical composition.
The four photomicrographs shown in
Figs. 2, 3, 4 and 5, all of which are of rel-
atively coarse grained samples, illustrate
four typical structures of a steel of the
above chemical composition. Fig. 2 shows-
the untreated metal as received from the
rolling mills. It shows the typical sorbitic-
pearlitic structure, and by knowing this we
can predict very easily its physical behav-
ior. In Fig. 3, is found the same steel af-
ter being annealed. The crystals are a lit-
tle larger and the structure is nearly all
pearlitic. From this we know that its tens-
ile strength would be a little lower than
that of the untreated steel and also that its.

THE MICHIGAN TBCHNIC
ductility would be much greater. In Fig.
4 is found the structure of the metal after
having been hardened. This shows a typi-
cal martensitic structure and tells at once
that the steel has a high tensile strength
and a very low ductility. The structure of
the same steel after having been tempered
is illustrated in Fig. 5. This is a martens-
itic-troostitic structure and denotes maxi-
mum tensile strength with none too high
ductility. This small series of photomi-
crographs shows very clearly how indes-
pensible the microscope is to the modern
metallurgist.
The effect of cold rolling and annealing
is splendidly observed through metallo-
graphic examination. Fig. 6 shows the
structure of a cold rolled brass bar. The
presence of a large number of slip bands
on each crystal indicates that the metal is
in a strained condition and is very hard
and brittle. Upon annealing this strained
metal, it recrystallizes, removing thereby
the strains and producing a very soft and
ductile product. The structure of the metal
after having been so treated is given in
Fig. 7.
Metallography goes further than to
merely show the micro-constituents of a
metal or alloy. By means of it, one is able
to study the distribution of these constitu-
ents. The distribution, relative dimensions,
shape, etc., of the micro-constituents have
as great an effect upon the physical prop-
erties of the metal as do the micro-constitu-
ents themselves.
A very interesting example of this is
shown by the photomicrographs in Figs.
8 and 9. Both were from specimens of
chromo-nickel steel used for automobile
gears. The chemical composition of each
was the same; the fractures looked exactly
alike to the naked eye, yet the one shown
in Fig. 8 had an elastic limit of 110,000 lbs.
per square inch and the other an elastic
limit of 170,000 lbs. per square inch. A
comparison of the two photomicrographs
shows at once that the first ha'd a very
uneven segregated structure, while the sec-
ond was exceedingly homogeneous. The
reason for the great difference in elastic
limit, therefore, is at once apparent.
Like any other science which has any
claim on commercial recognition, metal-
lography has been compelled to withstand
much ill-will and lack of sympathy from
certain types of so-called "practical men,"
who have a decided contempt for anything
scientific. In spite of this, however, the
science has made and is still making tre-
mendous strides. This may be appreciated
when one realizes that today there are not
less than five hundred industrial labora-
tories in the United States splendidly
equipped for the making of metallographic
examinations.
CAMP DAVIS
It was 'way back in the early part of the
college year of 1915-16 that the interest in
the Camp Davis of 1916 was aroused among
the Civil Engineering students of the class
of 1917. Daily there could be seen in the
Engineering Society rooms and elsewhere,
little knots of men who had attended camp
the summer preceding. A pack of pictures,
a good yarn, or something equally inter-
esting, reminiscent of the days of camp,
was the source of interest. For the first
few weeks, camp was lived over again for
these men. Is it any wonder, then, that the
Civils of '17 found their thoughts turning
to plans for the following summer, when
they might enjoy the pleasures of this
Wonder Place? Long before college closed
in the Spring the organization was well un-
der way. A Camp Manager was elected,
who in turn selected committees to take
charge of the various features, such as
transportation, sports, and the publication
of the Black Fly. Minute details were an-
ticipated, and as far as possible provided
for. Such was the inception of the Camp
Davis of iqi6.
Camp Davis officially opened Monday.
July 3. On the last days of the previous
week, the population had rapidly swelled
from the dozen or twenty men who had
come early to assist in the preparation for
the others, to its final total of nearly one
hundred and fifty men. The greater num-
ber of the men made the trip by boat, leav-
ing Detroit, disembarking at Cheboygan,
then taking a small launch down Indian

River over the beautiful inland route and
landing at the northern end of Burt Lake,
within a couple of miles of the camp site.
The remainder of the trip was made over-
land by foot. Baggage, of course, had
been left at Cheboygan, and was brought
over the thirteen miles to camp by truck.
The first Sunday—well, the Black Fly put
it pretty well—"The Sabbath may be a day
of rest but John reported all the hammers
and saws in camp in use Sunday morning,
to say nothing of the wash boards and
laundry soap."
The first working day was dubbed
"Clean-up Day." If there were any arti-
cles in camp that were movable, they were
moved. The mouth of the harbor was
dredged out; the lumber in various scrap
piles was sorted and repiled; the hillside
back of camp was raked free of brush and
the refuse burned; the road through the
swamp to Burt Lake was cleared of a year's
growth; the base line was brushed and
tape stakes restored where they had been
moved; anything and everything productive
of a lame back and sore muscles, was in-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
dulged in. This sort of an endurance con-
test lasted through the day until the middle
of the afternoon, when the parties were
mercifully excused for the day. Some men
went to bed and stayed there until roll-call
the following day.
The first holiday in camp, and really too
early to be enjoyed, was the Fourth. The
day was spent around camp, arranging
those little things which add so greatly to
the comfort of life in the wild, and in
On Saturday evening the lights were allow-
ed to burn until 10:30 instead of 9:30, and
on Sunday morning roll was not called un-
til 7:3c As a rule, alarm clocks were set to
ring at about 6 o'clock in the morning. A
couple of minutes later, the greater portion
of the camp population was in the lake,
coming out in time 'to dress for roll-call

sports and sightseeing and becoming ac-
quainted with the new order of things.
On land there were baseball games, quoit
contests and handicap races; the water
sports were rowing, swimming and diving.
The following weeks were occupied with
the daily prescribed work of the course.
The program was as follows:
6:20 A.M.—Roll-call.

fessor Johnston and announcements from
Camp Manager Taylor. Breakfast over,
the half hour until time for work was
spent in making the beds and otherwise
arranging the tents for inspection, and in
drawing out the instruments for use during
the day. Promptly on time, work was
started and continued through until quit-
ting time, when, if the party was near
camp, dinner was had in the mess tent, or,
if at some distance, lunch was eaten in the
field. By 5 :oo P. M. all parties were back
in camp, and a few minutes later found
them in the lake, which was most refresh-
ing after a hard day's work. After sup-
per, there were the ball games and boat

races until darkness, when the time was
either taken up at the "sings" or in per-
forming necessary duties, such as making
office records of the day's work. At 9:20
P. M. the electric lights were flashed, and
by 9:30 the camp was largely between wool-
en blankets.
One of the factors having much to do
with the general enjoyment and the -con-
geniality of camp life was the splendid or-
ganization of all activities. Each branch
of sports had its manager, who saw to it
that schedules were formed and adhered to,
that records were accurately kept. This
Any Day was Monday
order and regularity added greatly to the
enthusiasm and increased the keenness of
the competition.
Baseball assumed the role of the king of
sports. Nearly every evening after supper
found each of the two diamonds the scene
of a hotly contested game, with plenty of
rooters along the sidelines. Two leagues-
were composed of six teams each. The
Mosquito league boasted of the Alidades,
Tapes, Levels, Staves, Sextants and Tri-
pods; in the Black Fly league there wer&lt;*
the Plumb-bobs, Transits, Axes, Rods, Pins
and Chains. The teams of each league
played twice around during the eight weeks
of camp, and the season was closed by
playing off the championship between the
two leagues. The winning teams were the
Alidades and the Plumb bobs, and the con-
test between them ended in a victory for
the Alidades. The game as played was a
sort of hybrid indoor baseball played out
of doors, and was plenty fast enough for
the sand which composed the diamonds.
Probably the most strenuous sport which
was indulged in regularly was that of row-
ing. A half mile course was marked out
with flag buoys, starting in front of the
Biological Station (otherwise known as the
"Bug Camp") and extending westerly, end-
ing at the diving tower in front of Camp
Davis. Ordinarily, there was little wind
so that the course proved easy. But one
day the sad news came out that there was
a three-foot rise in the surface between
the two ends of the run; one party, in lev-
elling, finding that there was that much
error in the statement that "water seeks
its own level." The rowing championship
was decided by elimination contests, four
crews rowing at one time and the two
crews losing, being eliminated. The boats
used were wooden clinker type craft, and
were manned by three at the oars and a
coxswain.
Quoits served as the favorite sport of
the faculty, most especially as an after-
dinner pastime. Many were the stogies
and boxes of fig newtons which changed
hands over the outcome of some of these
contests. Toward the latter part of the
term the highly exciting and strenuous
game of chess came into great favor with
certain members of the teaching staff, who
contracted the malady to such extent that
pocket chess boards were taken into the
field in order that the progress of the game
might not be delayed.


211
An ideal beach greatly enhanced the en-
joyment of aquatic sports. A firm, sandy,
gently sloping bank fronts the camp site,
and extends into the lake for some fifteen
to twenty feet where it drops abruptly off
to a varying depth of from twenty to forty
feet. A tall tripod-shaped diving tower
stood at the brink of the ledge. Some five
or six feet above the water's surface was
the spring board and above this were two
other platforms, the first about twelve feet
and the upper one nearly twenty feet from
the lake. Seldom was this place unoccu-
pied during the play hours of camp. One
of the sports which was practically invented
during the summer was that of log racing.
Along the beach there were several logs
which had drifted ashore, from one to two
feet in diameter and fourteen to sixteen
feet in length. These were floated and
then manned by as full a crew as could get
astride them. They were propelled in any-
way possible, by stroking with hands and
feet, by paddling or by swimming. Not the
easiest thing to do was to keep on top of
the log, for with ten men making all possi-
ble movements, riding a floating log is not
the most stable occupation imaginable.
One of the weekly events was the ap-
pearance of The Tilarh Fly, the camp pub-
lication. The copy was printed and sketch-
ed on tracing cloth, 18" x 20", from which
blue prints were made and distributed.
Each issue contained the scores and aver-
ages for the sports of the previous week,
and sidelights on the various humorous and
serious events of the camp. The cartoons
were particularly interesting, each graph-
ically illustrating some ludicrous incident.
This work was well supported by the stu-
dent body, there being a weekly circulation
of nearly 150 copies.
Saturday afternoon and Sunday there
was no scheduled work, the time being set
aside for the use of the student. It fre-
quently happened that many of the men
were caught up in their work so that an
excursion might be enjoyed for the week-
end. On several occasions these were ar-
ranged; some of the places visited were
Mackinac Island, Cheboygan, Topinabee
and Pctoskey.
The biggest day of the camp was Visi-
tor's Day. During the course of the sum-
mer the camp is rather an exclusive place.
Visitors and sightseers are not encouraged
to come, since their presence rather demor-
alizes the order. But one of the late days
of the session, usually the Friday of the-
week preceding the breaking-up day, is giv-
en over entirely to the visitor and the sight-
seer. The camp is on parade as it were.
Our Distinguished Guests
Pres. H. B. Hutchins, Regent J. E. Beai,
and Prof. Roth
All of the activities are in the hands of the
students. The IQ16 Visitors' Day exceeded
all records for attendance. Over 250 out-
siders were registered at the Administra-
tion Building. The program consisted 01
varied sports and exhibits. During the
morning, a baseball game was held between
the faculty and the students, resulting in a-
close victorv for the instructors by the


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
score of 7 to 6. Following the game, a
comedy farce, entitled "Dedication of the
Michigan Union," was acted. Nearly ev-
■ery one of the hundred students played
some part in the show so that it may be
truly stated that it was a most "stupendous
spectacle, with a hundred people on the
stage at one time." Lunch was served at
noon. There were barrels of potato salad,
sandwiches, lemonade, and plenty of other
good things. In the afternoon there fol-
camp was ever visited by the President of
the University. In company with two of
the Regents, the Hon. J. E. Beal and the
Hon. W. H. Sawyer, and Professor Roth of
the Forestry Department, President Hutch-
ins made a few hours' sojourn. For their
pleasure, a camp sing was held, in response
to which short talks w-ere given by the
President, Regent Beal and Professor Roth.
This was a gathering which will be long
remembered by those who were so fortunate
"Goo-Bye Boys"
lowed an exhibit of plane table surveying
and observations on the sun for the deter-
mination of time. Then came the sports.
Ashore there were races of all sorts, greas-
ed pole climbing contests, and boxing bouts
in barrels. The aquatic sports consisted of
swimming and diving contests, boat races,
regular and novelty, underwater distance
swims, and pillow fights staged on a pole
over the lake. The last act on the day's
program was a rousing sing by the camp.
The "Yellow and Blue" closed the greatest
Visitors' Day ever staged at Camp Davis.
Douglas Lake was especially favored
during the session of camp by the visits of
prominent Michigan men. The last sum-
mer was the first time that the Engineers'
as to be able to enjoy it. At another time,
Professor Riggs was a welcome visitor,
punctuating his far too short stay by a talk
on the plans and prospects for the Engineer-
ing College for the coming year. Dr. Wm.
French, formerly of the Scmitics Depart-
ment of the University, had his camp on
the shores of Douglas Lake, where, in com-
pany with his father, a couple of weeks
were spent in outdoor life. Dr. French
has purchased some of the lands adjacent
to that of the University, and some of the
practice work of the students was put to
good use in surveying this tract. Occasion-
ally the evening camp fire was livened by
the presence of one or both of these friends.
In all, a more notable list of visitors would


213
be hard to pick, and the camp as a whole
certainly appreciated the honor of enter-
taining them.
It was rather a sad day, that last day of
camp. While everyone was naturally eager
for the change from camp to urban life
again, still there was a sort of regret as
the time for departure drew near. One
could not help but think that seldom if
ever would he again be a citizen of such a
•community as this had been, where the
•shams of society had for the time been
forgotten and needless conventions dis-
carded.
MICHIGAN MEN IN PULP AND
PAPER
The University of Michigan was well
represented at the sixth meeting of the
Technical Association of the Pulp and Pa-
per Industry. This meeting was held in
New York City September 27, 28 and 29,
in connection with the meetings of the
American Chemical Society and the Second
National Exposition of Chemical Indus-
tries.
Mr. Henry E. Fletcher, Ch.E. '07, has
been the active president of the Association
since its formation and presided at the
New York meetings.
Mr. V. E. Fishburn, Ch.E., '15, chemist
for the Watab Pulp and Paper Company,
Sartell, Minn., in collaboration with the
manager of the Company, Mr. O. L. E.
Weber, who graduated from the Engineer-
ing College in 1803, presented a valuable
paper at the meetings dealing with a new
method for controlling the production of
ground wood pulp. This method not only
controls the quality of the product but also
makes possible a very marked increase in
production.
Professor Rue and Mr. F. Edwin Ford,
holder of the Michigan Paper Manufactur-
ers' Fellowship at the University last year,
presented a paper on "A Study of Some of
the Factors Influencing the Retention of
Fillers by Paper Pulp." This paper is bas-
ed upon the experimental work carried out
by Mr. Ford and represents the first con-
tribution from the pulp and paper labora-
tory at the University since the establish-
ment of the Fellowship by some of the
pulp and paper manufacturers of Michigan
in the Spring of 1915.
These papers will be published in an early
issue of "Paper," the official organ of the
Technical Association of the Pulp and Pa-
per Industry.
Highway Engineering.
The work of the highway laboratory of
the Engineering College will be greatly ex-
panded this year. A machine for testing the
floors in bridges has been added to the
equipment. Facilities have been established
for the testing of asphalt and bituminous
road materials. Prof. Cox's teaching staff
has been materially strengthened by the
addition of several new men. J. D. Rue, of
the chemical engineering department, and a
teaching assistant will supervise the test-
ing of asphalts and bituminous highway
materials. Roscoe Gore has been appointed
an assistant in highway engineering. Mr.
Gore will be a joint employee of the univer-
sity and the state highway department at
Lansing. He is a former city engineer of
Tecumseh, Nebraska. These men, with
E. F. Boyd, laboratory assistant, Eric Blom-
gren, who holds the R. D. Chapin fellow-
ship, and the holder of the Alexander Dow
fellowship, yet to be appointed, will con-
stitute an able staff for investigations and
research.
Of interest to men who are thinking of
enrolling in the highway engineering de-
partment, will be the following statement
of an official of the Automobile Chamber
of Commerce, relative to the opportunities
for college men in this branch of engineer-
ing.
"College and university students who
specialize in the highway engineering
branches of civil engineering courses will
find unusual opportunities henceforth of
securing early employment and good pay
after winning their degrees.
"There has long been a decided lack of
trained road engineers, and the demand for
them is increasing rapidly. Probably no


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
other branch in engineering offers such
sure reward for time.
"Eighteen state highway commissions out
of 24 reporting to the National Automobile
Chamber of Commerce in New York City
state that there is a lack of trained road
engineers, and 16 say that preference would
be given to graduates of college highway
engineering courses in the appointment of
additional road engineers.
"Nearly i,6oo engineers are now employ-
ed by the 24 state commissions, and in ad-
dition about 2,000 are employed as county
and city engineers in 19 of the states.
"Salaries of highway engineers range
from $900 to $5,000 a year. The average is
about $1,800.
"There has been a tremendous increase
in highway improvement throughout the
country during recent years and the de-
mand for good roads is growing rapidly.
Highway commissioners report that they
anticipate the number of engineers employ-
ed by the state highway department will be
doubled at least within five years.
"Enactment of the federal good roads
bill appropriating $75,000,000 for construc-
tion of public roads during the next five
years, provided the various states appro-
priate an equal amount, assures the ex-
penditure of $150,000,000 on main state
highways in that period. This will greatly
stimulate the building of minor roads by
the states and counties.
"More than $250,000,000 is now spent an-
nually in the United States for road con-
struction, repair and maintenance."
Another fellowship in highway engineer-
ing has been given by Alexander Dow,
general manager of the Detroit Edison
Company. The fellowship is given for two
years and provides that a study be made of
road improvements, desirable for Washte-
naw County.
Military.
Enlisted in Company I, of the 31st regi-
ment of the Michigan National Guard, are
twenty-one Michigan students, who are now
on duty on the border. This number com-
prises one-fifth of the total enlisted person-
nel of the local company. The number in-
cludes two graduates, Paul de Kruif, assist-
ant professor of bacteriology in the univer-
sity and Attorney George Kennedy, a grad-
uate of Michigan and Princeton. Other
Michigan men enrolled are: Clarence
Wuerth, '15E, Clark Potter, eng. special,
George Barber, '18E, Dale Kaufman, '17E,.
Dallas Kendall, '17E, Roy Elliott, 'i8Er
Raymond Lee, '18E, William Pommerening,

Prof. William H. Hobbs made a special
trip to Washington during the summer for
the purpose of ascertaining the best condi-
tions under which the University could co-
operate with the government in installing
the department of military science. On his
return to Ann Arbor he compiled an article
on the results of his findings and upon the
relation of the new government measures
to military training in universities. This
article was written for publication in an
eastern magazine and will appear in the
near future. The substance of the article
reads in part, as follows:
"Experience has shown that in event of
war men of college education quite general-
ly offer their services to the government and
rise rapidly to positions of commanders,
whether they have had previous military
training or not. Hence the vital necessity
of giving them a suitable military educa-
tion, if the frightful incompetence shown
by officers of our Civil War, during the
early years of that struggle, is to be avoid-
ed in war with a nation really prepared.
"As regards to universities and colleges
such as Michigan, Indiana. Kansas, and the
privately endowed institutions of the east-
ern seaboard, which do not have compul-
sory military training, the Defense Act re-
cently passed provides voluntary as op-
posed to compulsory military training finan-
cially supported by the federal government,
and with an organization of uniformed mili-
tary units as nearly as possible like those
of the land grant institutions.
"In these institutions (like Michigan).


215
as well as the others, the war department
will provide all necessary military equip-
ment including rifles and side-arms, artil-
lery, public animals, with caretakers, mech-
anisms, blacksmiths, etc., and will provide
forage for public animals and all expenses
for maintenance of such expensive equip-
ment as is required for artillery units. The
only financial obligations put upon the uni-
versities is the requirement that they pro-
vide bonds and insurance for the safe keep-
ing and return of the equipment, and suit-
able quarters (armory) for the storage of
the equipment and for the offices and class-
rooms of the military department."
President Hutchins spent a short time in
Plattsburg during the summer, as a mem-
ber of a committee appointed by the govern-
ment to inspect the training camp there.
This was just previous to August 10 when
the camp was thrown open to several
thousand college students and business men.
Engineering English
In bringing before the men in the engi-
neering college the courses which are of-
fered in the English department, the Tech-
nic is endeavoring to stimulate and foster
an already growing interest, on the part of
the engineers, in the cultural courses of the
engineering curricula. Present day require-
ments demand of our modern engineer that
he be more than a pure technician, a man
who is well grounded in the principles of
his profession but who has neglected to ac-
quire that broader education which is stim-
ulated and fostered by a study of English
Literature, Economics, Political Govern-
ment and the like, a study which makes him
alive to the issues of the day and able to
deal intelligently with questions outside the
realm of pure engineering. The impor-
tance of such study has been emphasized
repeatedly by the engineering college fac-
ulty, with the result that the enrollment of
engineers in the cultural courses has stead-
ily grown during the past few years.
The demand for elective courses in Eng-
lish has become so insistent, that the Eng-
lish department has this semester offered
several of the courses which have ordinar-
ily been given in the second semester. Prof.
Marckwardt's course in the Modern Novel
and Mr. Grinell's course in the Modern
Drama, afford the student opportunity for
discussing exactly the types of contempo-
rary literature to which he is naturally in-
clined, with the probable result that he will
find himself at the end of the course better
able to distinguish between the merely pop-
ular and the really meritorious.
English 21, which may now be said to
have passed well beyond the experimental
stage, has also proved very popular with
students desiring advice and direction in
their reading. It has become the logical
introduction to the special courses in the
short story, the novel and the drama. While
it can, of course, give only a glimpse into
these various fields, it is usually sufficient
to stimulate further study. It has in fact
given many ot the students their first im-
pulse toward systematic reading. Both Mr.
Wright and Mr. Schneider, who comes to
Ann Arbor from M. A. C, will have sec-
tions this semester.
English 2 is to be reorganized by Mr.
Marckwardt. This course should attract a
substantial body of students who desire to
lay a more satisfactory foundation for their
future work than can be afforded by Eng-
lish 1 alone.
A course in Technical Journalism is giv-
en this semester which aims to prepare the
student, by a study of fundamentals, for
the course offered the second semester for
the Technic Staff and those who are spec-
ializing in this field. This course is known
as English 7 and is conducted by Mr.
Wright, who succeeds Dr. Bradley.
A special two hour section of English I,
to be known as English ia, is given this
semester for such students of architecture
as cannot conveniently enter the four hour
section. It is to be followed next semester
by a four hour section of English 2, to be
known as English 2a. Both these courses
are especially adapted to the tastes and
needs of archtectural students. They are
in charge of Mr. Bennett.
Mr. Thornton's course in oral English
has already proved its value as meeting the
demand of students for training in those


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
types of public speaking, which are of prac-
tical use to engineers and architects.
The elective courses outlined by the Eng-
lish department, cover such a variety of
work that all students who desire to do
work in English, may find something to
their taste.
Summer School
The enrollment in the various depart-
ments of the university during the summer
was as follows: Literary department, 827;
Engineering department, 355; Medical, 188;
Law, 179; Pharmacy, 28; Library Methods,
28; Biology camp, 33; Embalming, 7; Grad-
uate School, 261; or a grand total of 1,808.
Mentor System
A sum of money has been voted by the
Regents for broadening the scope of the
mentor system in the Engineering College
with the particular end in view of better
enabling the freshmen to get on their feet
scholasticallv.
Faculty Changes
Prof. Anderson of the mechanical engi-
neering faculty, who is on a leave of ab-
sence, will not return to the university un-
til next year.
Prof. John Airey has been granted a
year's leave of absence. He is acting as
chief munitions inspector for the Allied
Armies in this country.
Prof. Menefee has resigned to take up
private work in Jackson, Mich.
Porter H. Evans, '14E, and Frank R.
Zumbro, '15E, have been appointed instruc-
tors in electrical engineering.
Prof. E. E. Ware, of the chemical engi-
neering department, has been granted leave
of absence for the coming year. He will be
enframed in superintending the additions
which are being made to the varnish plant
of the Acme White Lead and Color Works
of Detroit. To relieve the conditions caus-
ed by Prof. Ware's absence, Mr. Claire
Upthegrove has been appointed instructor
for the coming year. Mr. Upthegrove grad-
uated in the class of 1014 and since gradua-
tion has been with the Detroit Copper and
Brass Rolling Mills. He will probably have
some of the work in Ch. E. 1 (Engineer-
ing Materials) and some work in Metallog-
raphy.
Mr. W. S. Shepard, of Washington, D.
C, has been appointed teaching assistant
in chemical engineering. His work will be
in connection with the course in Gas and
Fuel Analysis. Mr. Shepard has been
teaching this work at the Catholic Univer-
sity of America.
Civil Engineering
The staff of the civil engineering de-
partment has seen some changes this year.
Professor J. H. Bringhurst has resigned
to go to Johns Hopkins University.
Two new men have been added.—Mr.
Orange M. McNeil, and Mr. Perry A. Fel-
lows, both instructors in civil engineering.
Mr. Fellows comes to the department af-
ter a wide experience. Since his gradua-
tion from Michigan in 1906 he has been en-
gaged chiefly in railroad work. He spent
one year with the Pennsylvania, as assist-
ant on the corps; five years with the Cen-
tral of Georgia, as draftsman, one year
with the Atlantic Coast Line, in the same
capacity; and then three years with the
Winnsboro Granite Corporation as General
Superintendent. Since 1915 he has been in
the Engineering College doing graduate
work.
Mr. McNeil is a graduate of the Univ.
of Colorado. He was for two years with
the American Bridge Company at Airev.
Indiana, and then employed in the engi-
neering department of the Santa Fe R. R.
For the last three years his work has been
mainly in structural steel construction i:i
New York City and Chicago.
Chemical Engineering
At the June meeting of the American In-
stitute of Chemical Engineers, held in
Cleveland. Prof. Ware read a paper on
"The Effect of Storage on Mixed Paints."'
embodying the work done under his direc-
tion by Mr. R. E. Christman. holder of the
Acme Fellowship during the past year.
Prof. A. H. White spoke informally at the
dinner of the Institute.


217
Prof. A. E. White gave two papers be-
fore the American Society for Testing Ma-
terials at Atlantic City in June. One was
on "Specifications for Condenser Tubes"
and the other on "Grain Growth in Boiler
Tubes." This latter paper is the resuh of
Mr. Harold Wood's work as holder of the
Detroit Edison Co.'s fellowship.
Architecture
Professor S. J. Kimball has been granted
leave of absence for one year. During this
time he will be studying colonial architec-
ture at Harvard. He has obtained an Ar-
chaeological Fellowship, under which he
will pursue his work.
Meeting of the American Society of Heat-
ing and Ventilating Engineers
The American Society of Heating and
Ventilating Engineers met in Detroit and
Ann Arbor for their semi-annual meeting
in July this year. The meeting in Ann Ar-
bor was held on July 20th, in Room 348 of
the Engineering Building. At this meeting
a paper was presented by Professor Allen
on "Heat Transmission through Building
Materials" and by Professor Emswiler on
"Coefficient of Friction of Air Flowing in
Round Galvanized Iron Ducts." As the ex-
perimental work, forming the basis of both
of these papers, had been done in the Me-
chanical Laboratory, the members of the
Society were afforded the opportunity of
an inspection of the apparatus as it had
been used
The work of the Mechanical Laboratory
was further represented to the Society in
a "Report Relative to the Best Position for
a Radiator in a Room," by a special Com-
mittee of which Professor Verner is a
member.
New Motor
The Maxwell Motor Company of Detroit
has recently shipped a Maxwell 4-cylinder
motor to the department for laboratory
tests and for demonstration purposes.
In the laboratories of the Engineering
College, very little in the way of new inves-
tigation has been started during the sum-
mer. What work has been done along this
line has been toward the completion of
problems which were undertaken last semes-
ter. Some of this work has been mentioned
in previous issues or incomplete results of
a particular problem have been given. We
now can supplement this with more com-
plete information concerning the work.
The tests to determine the heat transmis-
sion through common, double thickness
window glass have been completed and cer-
tain coefficients established. Complete testi
were made of a new power transmission
chain which is being developed by the
Douglass Saw and Machinery Company of
Massachusetts. Several investigations of
lighting problems have been completed, as
has also the heat balance test of the Hud-
son 6-54 motor.
The results obtained in all these investi-
gations are important and have been ob-
tained at the cost of great patience, perse-
verance and care, on the part of senior and
graduate students who have carried on the
work under the direction of members of
the faculty. They should prove interesting
as well as instructive.
Model
A model to illustrate shear and lending
moment has been constructed in the Shops
from designs prepared by the Engineering
Mechanics Department. This modtl should
prove of value in actually demonstrating
to the student how the forces of shear and
bending act.

Pamphlets
The pamphlets published by The Te:h-
.nic for Engineering Mechanics Courses I,
2, and 3 have proven an immense: advance
■over the old form of mimeographed notes.
A sheet correcting such errors as have
been discovered will be issued next year.
Larger Testing Machine Needed
Space is now available for a tension-
■compression machine of large capacity.
That such a machine is needed is evidenced
l)y the large number of requests for tests
received, which must be refused, owing to
the lack of a testing machine of sufficient
size to make the test. Also the instruction
and research work of the Department re-
quires a machine of greater capacity than
those now available. It is to be hoped
that the necessary appropriation can be se-
cured in the near future.
Testing Machine Loaned
The 100,000 pound tension-compression
machine in the Testing Materials Labora-
tory has been loaned to M. A. C. to tem-
porarily replace the machine which was de-
stroyed in the recent disastrous fire at that
institution.
Building Tile
Professor Abbott is co~ductin2 tests on
bmilding tile which will be of much value
when completed.
Radiator Locations and Positions
The men in the M. E. 22 Course have
performed a number of tests to determine
the relative heat giving capacity of a
steam radiator when placed in different lo-
cations and positions in a room. While
the tests have brought out some interest-
ing things, they arc still somewhat incon-
clusive up to the present time, owing ta
the fact that the heat capacity of the walls
behind the radiator may have had differ-
ent influences at different positions of the
radiator. It is planned to complete the
work if possible this year.
MECHANICAL LABORATORY.
Heat Transmission Through Building Ma-
terials
Some very interesting, and what are be-
lieved to be reliable results, were obtained
during the second semester of the past year
on the apparatus for determining the heat
transmitting properties of materials used
in building construction. This apparatus
for determining the heat transmitting prop-
erties of materials used in building con-
struction has been described briefly in these
pages before.
So far, but a single material, viz.. com-
mon double thickness window glass has been
tested. The coefficient of heat transmis-
sion was quite satisfactorily determined for
glass in a vertical position (as in a win-
dow), in horizontal positions, both as sky-
light and floor, and in a 45° slanting posi-
tion as in a skylight roof. The coefficient
was found to be about .63 for the glass
vertical; .6r for the glass horizontal, as a
skylight; .58 for the glass slanted, as a
skylight; and .47 with the glass horizontal,
as a floor. The above values were found
when the outside air was quiescent.
In order to duplicate more severe weath-
er conditions, the glass was subjected to an
improvised rain storm, by means of spray
nozzles discharging against it. Wind con-
ditions were imitated by blowing a blast
of air across the surface of the glass by
a blower. Finally, the effect of a combina-
tion of wind and rain was determined, the
sprays and blower both in operation.
For the condition of rain, no wind, the
coefficient was found to be 1.25; wind, but
no rain, 1.05; combination of wind and
rain, 1.48.
The work done, and results obtained
formed the subject of a paper at a meet-
ing of the American Society of Heating
and Ventilating Engineers, when they met
at Ann Arbor, July 20th, of this summer.
This work requires a vast amount of pa-
tience and perseverence. The experimental
box is now located out of doors. The out-
side temperature is subject to all the vag-
aries of the weather. If a room were avail-
able where a steady, controlled temperature


219
could be secured, results could be obtained
in one-quarter of the time it requires now.
Mr. G. R. Urch, teaching assistant in the
Mechanical Laboratory during 1915-1916,
had immediate charge of the tests, and the
greatest credit is due him for the results
so far obtained. It is planned to continue
the work during the year 1916-17, extend-
ing the investigation to plate glass, and pos-
sibly concrete or brick.
Tests of Power Transmission Chains
During the spring and summer, a num-
ber of tests of a new power transmission
chain were made in the Mechanical Labor-
atory. The chain referred to is being de-
veloped by the Douglas Saw and Machinery
Company, of Indian Orchard, Massachus-
etts an organization of which the officers
(C. L. Harpham, J. M. Barnes, and H. L.
Coe, and W. F. Temple), are all old Mich-
igan men.
The chain is especially designed' to be
used at high speeds. Four different sizes
of the chain were tested, all being designed
to transmit 20 h.p., but at different speeds,
viz., 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, and 5,000 ft. per
minute.
The chains transmitted power from a
motor shaft to a shaft carrying a fan brake.
The efficiency of the chains (including the
fan shaft) ranged from 93 to 96%.
Speeds of 5,000, 4,000, and even 3,000 ft.
per minute are unusually high for chain
drives.
Coefficient of Friction of Steam Flowing
in Pipes
Some additional experimental work was
done along this line last year by Messrs.
F. C. Riecks, and W. J. Warren. This co-
efficient had already been investigated a
year before, but for low pressure steam
only. Messrs. Riecks and Warren investi-
gated the friction loss at higher pressures,
practically checking the coefficient at low-
er pressures, confirming the usual supposi-
tion that the friction is directly propor-
tional to the density. This completes the
work which had been planned for the 1%"
size of pipe which had heretofore been used
in this work. It is planned to replace the
i/4" P'pe with a larger size, and continue
the investigation to ascertain the influence
of pipe size on the coefficient.
Heat Loss From Underground Piping
Some preliminary work was done last
spring. For this work, a 3" pipe of 100 ft.
length is buried some 3 or 4 ft. below the
ground in the court of the Engineering
Building. Electric resistance thermome-
ters are also buried in the ground to the
same depth, at different distances from the
pipe. The plan in testing is to measure
the amount of condensation of steam caus-
ed by the loss of heat from the pipe. Tests
will be made under different conditions of
pressure and velocity within the pipe. Af-
ter the tests have been completed on the
bare pipe, the pipe will be covered by un-
derground piping insulation furnished by
the Ric-Wil Company, of Cleveland, Ohio.
This investigation is being made by Mr. W.
A. Warwick, teaching assistant in the Me-
chanical Laboratory.
Work in the Mechanical Laboratory is
under the direction of Prof. J. E. Ems-
wiler.
ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING.
Illumination Tests
One of the largest items in the cost of
electrical energy for lighting is the cost of
distributing the energy over the wires be-
tween the power house and the lamps. The
largest part of this cost of distribution is
the cost of conductor material or copper.
The purpose of one of the investigations
undertaken by the electrical engineering de-
partment was to determine how far this
cost of distribution could be reduced by
reducing the size of the wires, without
producing enough pressure drop in the cir-
cuit to be noticeable or objectionable to the
customer. Lighting circuits have common-
ly been designed heavy enough to limit the
total pressure drop to from 2 per cent to
4 per cent. The investigators were unable
to discover any visible effects upon the


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
lights unless the variation of voltage ex-
ceeded 6% to 10%, and the flicker was not
objectionable unless the voltage variation
exceeded 6% to 10%. This was for instan-
taneous variations, with the observers con-
scious they were to occur and watching for
them. For slow variations the minimum
per cent change of voltage perceptible at
the lamps, is found to vary greatly with
the rapidity of change and with the intens-
ity of illumination employed. Thus, for
the most usual intensities of illumination
(around 1.7 foot candles) the least per-
ceptible change of voltage is 5% if it
changes uniformly for 10 seconds, or 7% if
it changes uniformly for 20 seconds, or
10% if it changes uniformly for 90 seconds
or any longer period.
Considering that in any wiring system,
the changes come unexpectedly and are
therefore not so easily noticed as when
looked for, and that the variation of volt-
age at any lamp is likely to be only a frac-
tion of the total difference of pressure be-
tween power house and lamp, it is evident
from this investigation that wiring systems
for lights can be designed much smaller
and therefore less expensively than at pres-
ent, without impairing the quality of ser-
vice.
For this semester, it is planned to con-
tinue these investigations so as to deter-
mine what the limiting values would be
for a large number of observers who are
not aware they are being experimented up-
on.. It is also planned to make measure-
ments on typical buildings, to determine
how large the voltage variation is likely to
tbe, compared with the total voltage drop
in the system, and how rapidly the variation
is likely to take place.
With this information in hand, designers
of distributing systems should be able to
proportion them much more accurately than
at present while still giving equally good
service and the saving may easily run into
millions of dollars.
A second investigation by the electrical
engineering department was concerned with
the relative economy of turn-down devicec
for electric lamps. The two which are
most commonly used, were tested, namely
the lamp with two filaments ("Hylo" lamp),
and the turn-down socket in which any or-
dinary lamp is used, resistance in the lamp
socket being introduced in series with the
lamp by pulling a chain.
The tests showed that the double fila-
ment lamp is much more economical to op-
erate than the rheostatic socket device. In
fact, under ordinary conditions, the con-
sumer may expect a net saving of about
five dollars per year for each double fila-
ment lamp that he chooses to install. In
arriving at this figure, in addition to the
data of the text, it was assumed that the
lamp is about 40 watt or 32 candle-power
size, that it operates turned down to about
2 candle-power for about 8 hours each day
and that energy costs ten cents per kilo-
watt-hour. For larger candle powers and
higher rates for energy, or longer hours of
use, the saving would be still greater.
A third investigation was concerned with
the quantitative analysis of good and bad
lighting effects, by determination of the rel-
ative amounts of diffused and directed light
and the best direction of the latter. A
large number of measurements and photo-
graphs were taken, but more work must be
done before conclusions may be drawn.
These investigations were all carried on
under the direction of Prof. H. H. Higbie.
HYDRAULICS.
A New Method for Deriving Weir Form-
ulas
A new method for determining the rate
of flow of water over weirs, devised by
Prof. Running, has been tried out in the
hydraulic laboratory with gratifying re-
sults.
The main advantage in the new method
is, that it requires only a single experiment
for determining' the rate of flow of water
over a weir for different heads, and is ap-
plicable to weirs of high head as well as
to weirs of low head.
The different pieces of apparatus requir-
ed, were carefully set up by C. N. Ward,
and with the assistance of F. A. Naglerr
H. R. Leach and A. F. Sherzer, the experi-
ment was performed with a right angle V-


221
notch weir. The method will, however, ap-
ply equally well to weirs of any form. A
gate, closely fitting the inside of the weir
prevented the water from escaping until
ready to begin the experiment. The re-
cording apparatus consisted of a chrono-
graph, connected electrically with a dial
and also with a pendulum. By means of
the pendulum, accurately rated, the chrono-
graph recorded time to one one-hundredth
of a second. A float, which caused a hand
to turn on the dial, enabled the investigat-
ors to record the different heads of water
to one one-thousandth of a foot.
From the record, the corresponding val-
ues of times (t) and head (h) were read.
The relation between these, for the weir
used in the experiment, is expressed to a
close approximation by the equation
(i) t = -24.438 + 63.647 h"--
The differential equation, expressing the
fluctuation of water level is
(2) Qdt = —Sdh,
where Q stands for the quantity of water
in cubic feet flowing per second, and S
stands for the area in square feet of the
horizontal section of the tank. For the
tank used S = 231.068 square feet. Differ-
entiating (1) gives the relation
dt = - (63.647) (i.459)hJ-dh.
Multiplying this equation by 231.068 and
dividing by (63.647) (l.4S9)hJ*" gives the
equation
231.068
(3) hI4Mdt = — 231.068 dh
(63.6-17) (i-459)
The right hand members of the equations
(2) and (3) are identical and therefore
the left hand members are. This gives the
formula
231.068
(4)Q = h""
(63.647) (I.4S9)
= 2.488 h54"
or less approximately Q = 2.49,11'".
The values of Q computed from this
formula agree very closely with the experi-
mental values obtained by Prof. King in
another way.
It may be pointed out that the method is
well adapted for experiments on the flow
of water through pipes.
AUTOMOBILE ENGINEERING
Heat Balance Test
The heat balance test on the Hudson 6-54
motor that was started last year by the
M.E. 33 advanced automobile laboratory
class has been completed. This test con-
sisted of several runs at different horse-
powers corresponding to different car
speeds. The final results show an accuracy
as remarkable as that found in the prelim-
inary runs mentioned in the May Technic
where the various losses were itemized. In
no case did over 5% of the total energy
supplied to the motor by the gasoline, get
away unaccounted for. The Technic hopes
to publish a full description with results
later.
A new set up, also for determining the
distribution of heat energy, is in progress
for a Franklin 6-30 and a high speed Chal-
mers 6-30 motor. When these tests are
completed, the data available on the com-
parative heat balance values in these three
representative types of motors will give to
the industry, information not now available
and will be a stimulus to design which will
reduce these losses.
Nezv Equipment
A fine addition to the already splendid
equipment of the automobile laboratory is
a new Cadillac cut-out chassis which forms
one of the finest demonstration models ob-
tainable for lecture and design sections.
The chassis is the gift of the Cadillac Mo-
tor Car Company.
Horsepower Tests
It is intended, in connection with the
M.E. 33 course, to run a series of tests
which will determine the horse power to be


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
delivered at the rear wheels to drive differ-
ent cars at various speeds on the road. Pre-
liminary work along this line last semester
resulted in the working out of methods of
proceedure and measuring apparatus. Data
is to be determined for three typical weights
of cars.
Auto Lab.
Work on the new auto laboratory, which
was planned several months ago, has been
held up by the Regents, who have been
considering several plans in connection
with the extension of the engineering lab-
oratories. The delay means that more ex-
tensive improvements than at first planned,
will be undertaken.
CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
Prof. Badger conducted during the sum-
mer some large-scale tests to determine the
exact effect of boiler water treatments in
the Park Place plant of the Detroit Edi-
son Co. The tests consisted in measuring
the total amount of water entering the
boiler for several weeks, analyzing it, and
then determining the final distribution of
the dissolved matter so introduced by de-
termining the amount and composition of
the blow-off and also the amount and com-
position of the mud and scale remaining in
the boiler and purifiers.
The department has announced the hold-
ers of fellowships for 1916-17.

MATHEMATICS
Below is a resume of the development
and research work of the department of
mathematics for the past year.
"A New Method of Deriving Weir For-
mulas" is the title of a paper presented by
Professor Theodore R. Running to the
American Mathematics Society at Chicago
in April, 1916. This paper is to be pub-
lished in the Engineering News. He has
also completed the manuscript of a book
entitled "Empirical Formulas."
A new calculus text by Professor Love
is to be used in the Engineering College
this year.
During the past year Professor Tomlin-
son Fort presented two papers to the Amer-
ican Mathematical Society, one entitled
"Lineal Differential Equations" and the
other, "A Class of Expansions in Oscillat-
ing Functions." The first will be published
in the "American Journal of Mathematics"
and the second in "Annals of Mathematics."
Professor Fort is at present working on
some problems in connection with the
Sturm-Liouville and allied series.
A paper by Dr. Poor on "Vector Analy-
sis" appeared in the bulletin of the Amer-
ican Mathematical Society for January.
1916. A second paper entitled "A Certain
Type of Exact Solution of the Equations
of Motion of a Viscious Liquid" has been
accepted for publication in the Rendiconti,
the official organ of the Italian Mathemati-
cal Society. Dr. Poor's immediate interests
are in vector analysis of four dimensions
and mathematical physics.
During the past year Dr. Kusterman pre-
sented two papers to the American Mathe-
matical Society, one on "Fourier's Con-
stants of Functions of Several Variables"
and one on "Functions of Bounded Varia-
tion in Two Variables." The former will
appear in the American Journal of Mathe-
matics and the latter in the Mathcmatische
Annalen.
The contribution of William V. N. Gar-
retson to the research work of the math-
ematics department during the past year
is the work embodied in his paper entitled,


223
"On the Asymptotic Solution of the Non-
Homogeneous Differential Equation of the
Nth Order—A Particular Solution," which
was his dissertation for the Doctor's de-
gree. This degree was conferred on him
by Michigan, last June. The article is now
ready for publication. In this paper, the
author considers the roots of the so-called
"Characteristic Equation" as distinct. He
is now trying to generalize the problem by
removing all restrictions from the roots.
Professor Hildebrandt has recently com-
pleted a paper entitled "On a Theory of
Linear Differential Equations in General
Analysis," which has been accepted for
publication by the Transactions of the
American Mathematical Society. He is at
present engaged in extending some of the
results of this paper. During the early
part of the summer, he attended a course
of lectures at the University of Chicago by
Professor Moore on some recent develop-
ments in General Analysis, some of the re-
sults of which he expects to use in his own
researches.
Dr. L. A. Hopkins has recently published
an article in the Astronomical Journal, Nos.
683-684, entitled "On The Theory of The
Motion of The Small Planets," and shortly
there will come from the press a new edi-
tion of the Analytic Geometry, of which he
is a joint author with Professor Alexander
Ziwet. At present he is engaged in the
study of the perturbations of Jupiter upon
the motion of the small planets of the An-
dromache type.
Dr. Nelson attended the meeting of the
Chicago section of the American Mathe-
matical Society, which was held April 19,
at the University of Chicago. At this meet-
ing, he read two papers—-"Plane Nets with
Equal Invariants." and "Quasi-periodicity
of Asymptotic Plane Nets." The first of
these will appear shortly in the Rendiconti
del Circolo Matematico di Palemro. The
second was published in the June number
of the Bulletin of the American Mathe-
matical Society. During the summer he
has been preparing a paper on "Relations
between the Projective Differential Theo-
ries of Conjugate Nets of Curves on a Sur-
face and of Plane Nets."
The Engineering Society has begun the
year 1916-1917 with every indication that
its efforts will be appreciated by the engi-
neers. Three hundred men had taken out
membership cards October 5th, which was
just three days after the classification of
men had begun. It was particularly grati-
fying to see the way the freshmen joined
and the General Society and the branches
hope to retain their interest during the four
years of their university career.
The branch societies, which are the stu-
dent branch of the A. S. M. E., the student
branch of the A. I. E. E. and the civil
branch, are working hard to put the Society
on its feet this year and they are planning
a strong program of speakers.
The General Society whose function it
is to promote the best of good fellowship
among the men in all classes in the engi-
neering college, will give dances during the
winter. The dances will be known as the
Engineering Society's "Cost of Production"
dances. The plan is to sell tickets for a cer-
tain amount. The actual cost for music,
hall, flowers and incidentals will be divided
by the number of men who attend and a re-
fund made to the ticket holder who will
identify himself at the Society Rooms by
means of a stub. Tickets will be sold to
members first and any left will be placed
on sale to non-members. The first dance
is planned for the near future.
A number of good weeklies such as the
Saturday Evening Post, Collier's, Puck,
Judge, Country Gentleman and a number
of others have been placed in the Society
Rooms and this will keep the men in up-to-
the-minute light reading.
While four or five hundred members is
a satisfactory membership the Society is


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
not going to stop at that, for it wants ev-
ery man in the Engineering College to join

You will find a barrel of laughs in the
Transitory Slants columns; you will find
a lot of inspiration in the Alumni News
where the deeds and exploits of our alumni
are recorded, and you will find a lot of

lege Notes. All this in addition to excel-
lent articles by members of the faculty
which we want you to start reading with
this issue.
Waterman Gym
During the past summer Waterman Gym-
nasium has been enlarged, in order to meet
the demand for better facilities, owing to
the increased amount of work, in connec-
tion with the various classes in compulsory
physical training, and in intercollegiate and
intramural athletics. The main floor will
be 246 ft. x 90 ft., giving enough space for
a 10 lap track for distance running, and an
80-yard straightaway for sprinting. There
will also be a jumping and shot putting
pit, 12 ft. square, on the main floor, made
of dirt and covered with a trap door, when
not in use. This arrangement will reduce
injuries to jumpers, usually occuring when
landing on the edge of mats, and also give
broad jumpers an opportunity for practice
during the indoor season, a condition which
has never before been taken care of. Shot
putting can also be indulged in, with less
danger of damage to the building and ap-
paratus. In the basement the increased
area will accommodate approximately
4,000 steel lockers; at present 2,000 lockers
are installed, 500 additional steel lockers
have been ordered, to meet the increasing
demand. Last year all lockers were taken,
and in consequence a number of freshmen
entering in February were compelled to
postpone their work in physical training
until the coming year, on account of this
limited facility. Eventually all the wood
lockers now installed will be replaced by-
steel ones, and connected up with a ventil-
lating system, whereby each locker receives
air under forced pressure. Along the east
side of the basement a special room is con-
structed for handball, this was found neces-
sary in order to improve the playing effi-
ciency of this game, by preventing the ball
bounding back under the lockers, which
frequently occurred on the old open style
of courts. Special building foundations
have been constructed on the west side of
the basement, for the installation of a swim-
ming pool, 35 ft. x 76 ft. Realizing the
great value of knowing how to swim, every
effort will be made to have a swimming
pool in connection with the gymnasium; its
construction will be carried out along the
lines of the latest sanitary and hygienic re-
quirements. Until the swimming pool is
installed, this space will probably be con-
verted into a rifle range. An entirely new
bath room has been constructed, containing
between 60 and 70 showers, equipped with
the latest type of hot and cold water mixers.
The drainage, plumbing and general fixtures
of this room will be thoroughly up to date.
On the south side of the building, in addi-
tion to the new shower bath room, the
completed plans also call for the follow-
ing arrangements:
Basement: Small locker rooms for facul-
ty and varsity athletes. Rooms for swim-
ming instructor, janitor and storage pur-
poses.
First floor: Offices for the Director of
Outdoor Athletics and Director of Gym-
nasium, also rooms for physical examina-
tions , dressing and bathing, together with
a special trophy room.
Second floor: Office for the Director of
Intramural Athletics. Rooms for boxing,
wrestling and fencing. Lecture room for
football and baseball teams and special
classes in physical training.
Third floor: Will be used for storage.


225
The new office portion of the building
and swimming pool, will be delayed in con-
struction for the present, until an additional
appropriation is granted by' the Board of
Regents.
During the past year an outdoor wood
running track has been constructed adjacent
to the gymnasium, making it possible to run
outdoors practically all the year round, es-
pecially when ordinary roads and the
cinder track are covered with snow and
rain.
With the enlargement of the gymnasium
numerous changes are to be made in the
physical courses for men. Besides the reg-
ular course for freshmen there will be
classes in gymnastics and competitive ath-
letics for those who desire to coach or
teach.
Every year a number of positions are
open along this line because of the demand
for college men on this work. No credit
will be given in this work. The theory and
practice of coaching of the four major
sports, football, baseball, track and field
athletics, and basket ball will be taught
this year, the plan being to give students
actual coaching to do.
In the classes in gymnastics, lectures and
quizzes will be given in anthropometry,
first aid methods of teaching, and growth
and development. Particular attention will
be given to the development of proficiency
in practical gymnastic apparatus and in
squad leadership in calesthenic exercises.
Michigan Union and Y. M. C. A.
The University of Michigan is fast as-
suming a most enviable position among
American universities, in the facilities it
offers its student body for the promotion
of the oft-mentioned democracy of spirit
which prevails here. The excavations for
the new $1,000,000 Michigan Union build-
ing, which will be the social center of Mich-
igan student life, are well under way while
the magnificent new University Y. M. C. A.
is almost completed.
New Library
The excavations for the new University
Library are completed and ready for the
builders.

Co. of Tulsa, Okla., in the Engineering
and Geological Department. He has been
running plane-table surveys of the topog-
raphy of the oil fields, which is the scien-
tific method of oil prospecting. He had a
serious time about the first of the year
with a case of blood poisoning brought on
by an injury to his foot. He says the horse
doctor that treated him thought it was ery-
sipelas and didn't discover his mistake until
Ly had pretty near cashed in. When Ly
heard the landlady dickering with the un-
dertaker, though, without as much as a
"by-your-leave" to him, he decided that
he'd better take a hand himself. The result
was that within a day he was on the mend
and within two weeks was back to work—
all of which goes to show that it takes
more than an Oklahoma veterinary to kill
off a Michigan engineer. Address, 728 S.
Denver St., Tulsa, Okla.
Abram Fisher was another to try his luck
in the most cussed state in the Union. Abe
went to work for a construction firm in
Ardmore, Okla. It wasn't long before Abe
was about as popular on the job where he
was inspector as the proverbial wood-pussy
at the well-known May party. Things went
from bad to worse until one of his friends,
whose aim was better than the rest, suc-
ceeded in dropping a 2 x 6 from the fourth
floor of the Post Office, which token of
esteem-caught Abe right on the bean. When
he came to, he registered his opinion of
Oklahoma ethics all over the face of the
Superintendent of Construction and then
went to Chicago to have his own physiog-
nomy straightened out. Except that his

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS
(By Mile. Mameyella de Tausi)
Dear Ed.: A prominent optician states
that exercise should be given my eyes
daily. How can I do this?—Fresh.
Answer: You have the wrong idea, my
son. This is not "Physical Culture." How-
ever, I might suggest that you sit on the
senior benches at some fashionable Lit
class hour, and, without moving your head
do as the other fellows.
Dear Ed.: My wife says she is going
to buy cheaper hats and save money. How
can she do it?
Answer: Easily—by reducing her over-
head expenses.
Dear Ed.: The Turks were thick as
peas. What should I have done?
Answer:
them!
Shell them—of course—shell

SOO LOCK
BY W. B. JAMES, 'I6E, ASSISTANT ENGINEER, OSCAR DANIELS CO.
CONTRACTOR
Sault Ste. Marie, or the "Soo," as
it is commonly called, is a city of
about 14,000, which owes its incep-
tion to the rapids in the St. Mary's
River, which made vessel passage im-
possible. The subsequent growth of
the city has been largely due to the
engineering works which have made
possible the passage of large ships.
The first lock ever constructed was
built on the Canadian Side for the fur
trading canoes of the Hudson Bay
Company. The first ship lock, how-
ever, was built on the American Side
by the State of Michigan. This, of
course, has long since been replaced
by a larger lock. At present there are
three parallel locks on the American
Side and one on the Canadian Side.
The oldest of these, the Weitzel, is
outgrown, leaving only two on the
American Side in use. These are
large; the second lock being 800 feet
long by 100 feet wide and 21 feet
draft, and the third, 1,350 feet long
by 80 feet wide and 25 feet draft.
The lift on all three locks is 18 to 20
feet, depending on the lake level.
This third, or Davis Lock, is the
longest lock in the world, and the
fourth which is now under construc-
tion is practically a duplicate of it.
The tonnage which passes through
the locks in one season is enormous.
Something over 100,000.000 tons have
gone through already this season,
ships being locked through at the av-
erage rate of one in every 12 minutes.
It takes 15 to 20 minutes to complete
one lockage which means that there
are usually several boats in the lock
at one time. Four large boats and a
number of smaller ones in a lock is a
common sight; it is said that as many
as 14 have been passed through at
once.
The third lock was officially opened
in the fall of 1914, and some time be-
fore this the excavation for the fourth
lock was commenced. The increase
in traffic has been such that the gov-
ernment is spending an additional one
and a quarter millions dollars in order
to take care of it. It will only be a
matter of time before the first lock,
the Weitzel, will be torn out and re-
placed by a new one, which will like-
ly be larger in some dimensions than
any.yet built.
As already said, the Soo has owed
its growth largely to the engineering
work which has made the passage of
the rapids possible for large ships.
One is impressed by this fact as he
stands in the tower of the govern-
ment building and looks across the
locks to the powerhouse developing
some 60,000 h.p., the International
Bridge with its mammoth jack-knife
span, the biggest of its kind; and be-
yond this, the compensating dam
which controls the flow of water over
the rapids and assures a regulated
supply of water for the locks and
power house.
The' excavation for the fourth lock
was under way during the construc-
tion of the third lock, and about a


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
year after the third was finished, con-
creting was begun on the fourth.
This was in the fall of 1915, and
% work of concreting or form build-
ing has been going on ever since.
The plans were furnished and the pre-
liminary work was done by the gov-
ernment engineers. The reference
lines are in the nature of co-ordinates
parallel and perpendicular to the lock
axis. Permanent points have been lo-
cated in the rock and also in the con-
crete as fast as the work has moved
ahead, and benchmarks have been
placed at convenient points for eleva-
tions. The government engineers
have direct supervision of the work
and they keep in close touch with it
through their inspectors. The plan
for carrying out the work has been
to place the floor (which is simply a
series of culverts under one roof)
first, and follow with the walls.
After the weather became too cold
last fall, 1915, to permit of concret-
ing, attention was turned to the build-
ing of wide wall forms and to the
construction of a larger mixing plant.
The wide walls are 33 feet in width,
being built to contain the gate bear-
ings and the shafts, tunnels, piping,
and minor machinery necessary to
their operation. The principal ma-
chinery is to be housed in a small
building on top, but this is a separate
contract and so is not a part of the
present company's work. The wide
wall forms, built during the Winter,
were set as closely to position as pos-
sible, but as the "shells" had little or
no permanent bracing they were a
good deal affected by the weather be-
fore time to finish them ready for the
concrete. Some new methods will be
employed for holding the lower gate
forms previous to the placing of the
concrete. A great deal could be said
of these wide wall forms, but it takes
a personal view of them to appreciate
the volume of detail and amount of
labor involved in bringing them into
shape. The wide wall forms are di-
vided into blocks about 38 feet in
length in order to facilitate placing
concrete. The lining-in of the faces,
which stand 50 feet high above the
lock floor, is by far the hardest and
most particular part of the prepara-
tion of the forms. The specifications
call for a face which shall not vary
more than a quarter of an inch from
a true plane and the forms have all
been brought to this degree of accu-
racy. The lining-in of the face is ac-
complished by placing vertical 10 by
14 inch timbers up the outside of the
form against the horizontal ribs.
These are adujsted by cables and turn
buckles fastened at the top and run
to anchors, front and back. Tie rods
are run through the form from front
to back, spaced about 6 feet vertically
and 7 feet horizontally, or as permit-
ted by the shafts and passages. A net-
work of temporary struts is placed
inside to hold the form out to line
until the concrete rises furnishing the
pressure necessary to keep it out. The
tie rods are encased in light sheet met-
al tubes so that they may be with-
drawn and used again after the con-
crete is set. The first blocks were
poured continuously until finished,
but it was found almost impossible to
get labor for a third shift and per-
mission was granted the contractor to
make joints but not more than four
in any one block. Stops are now made
at the most convenient elevation for
placing the minor forms, gate bear-
ings, anchorage trusses, and the like.
Concrete is brought to the top eleva-


237
tion on the canal side of the block,
but the back is left about 5 feet be-
low grade back of the 10 foot line in
order to facilitate the placing of num-
bers of manholes, pipes, etc., which
are part of these blocks, and which
can be set to greater advantage if the
rest of the concrete has been placed
first.
THE NARROW WALL FORMS
Connecting the wide walls of the
upper gates to those of the lower
gates are what are termed the narrow
wooden bulkheads which may be
swung out on hinges after the block
is cast, allowing the form to be rolled
ahead to a new position. These forms
are 30 feet long, each leader block be-
ing placed this distance ahead of the
last and the follower placed to cover
the space between. This method is
advantageous, since there is no time
lost in setting the follower, it simply
being brought flush with the blocks
already poured. The idea of using
the forms in this manner was not a
new one; the third lock contractors
The Third 'Soo' Lock or Davis Lock
walls. These walls have a gravity sec-
tion 26 feet wide at the bottom, ic
feet at the top with the perpendicular
face rising 50 feet above the canal
floor. There being more than 2,000
lineal feet of this narrow wall with
the same cross-section, steel forms
of special design were made to be
used in pouring it. There are twc
forms for each side of the canal, a
leader and a follower. The leader is
a unit in itself, being provided with
having used it, but the forms them-
selves have been lightened and other
minor changes made which consider-
ably improve their handling. A little
difficulty was found at first in keeping
the face lined, but three or four set-
ups were enough to overcome them.
The forms, as are shown, consist of
two trussed steel faces tied together
above the top with I-beams and
through the center by three tiers of
two and one-half inch rods. The faces


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
are hung from the top by adjusting
screws, and are held in line by jacks
to the side trusses. The truss on the
inner face rests on four sets of trucks,
running on standard weight rails, laid
with ties on the lock floor. The out-
side truss has two sets of trucks run-
ning on a rail laid on elevated timbers.
The steel forms are set by first rolling
to place and then fastening the bottom
to anchors set in the floor of the lock.
The tie-rods are run through metal
sleeves from the front to the back face
and the nuts tightened. Two plumb-
bobs are hung next to the face and
this is then lined in by turning the ad-
justing jacks and the nuts on the tie-,
rods. After this process the hoppers
are set on the top of the forms and
the chutes are hung down inside. The
"muckers" finish the form by clean-
ing out and washing the bottom. In
the leader form two key-way forms
are placed in each bulkhead and the
bulkhead covered with graveled pa-
per, which afterward sticks to the
concrete and forms the expansion
joint. A lead stopwater is inserted
on each side of the block so as
to span the expansion joint when
the intermediate is poured. The lead
is a strip fourteen inches wide and is
clamped on the bulkhead in the form
of an angle, with one leg sticking
straight out into the block. When the
bulkhead is removed, the leg of the
angle which lay next to it, is bent out
to project into the space for the next
block and is subsequently encased in
the concrete placed here, completing
the stop across the expansion joint.
Only a small amount of reinforcing
is placed in these blocks, this being
near the top to take care of tempera-
ture changes. A mooring hook, which,
in the operation of the locks, is for
the use of small boats, is placed in a
small recess near the top of every sec-
ond block. The use of chutes and the
absence of reinforcing makes the
pouring of the narrow walls relative-
ly simple, and it is here if anywhere
that the contractor makes his profits.
THE MIXING PLANT
The mixing plant is located at the
east end of the excavation, next to the
lower lock approach. It is built close
to the retaining wall of the approach
canal, so that rock and gravel may be
taken directly from scows and placed
in the bins or stored on the bank. This
work is done by two electric, stiff-leg
derricks, carrying two-yard clam-
shell buckets, and a small locomotive
crane, whose main use is to pile rock
above the conveyor tunnel. A con-
veyor belt runs through this tunnel,
receiving the rock through gates in the
top and carrying it to a bucket con-
veyor which places the rock up in the
bins. From the bins, the rock is fed
down into measuring hoppers, where
cement is added and the batches
dropped down into two, two and a
quarter yard mixers below on a still
lower level. One mixer handles grav-
el and the other trap rock concrete.
The cement house is arranged as
conveniently as possible with regard
to the mixer and to unloading cement
from the boats. The bags are han-
dled largely by electric conveyors,
there being two portable ones placed
across the narrow dock from the boat
to the house. The conveyors inside
take the sacks from the portables, car-
ry them to the roof, and along the
length of the building, and drop them
at any desired point. Flat cars are
run into the cement house from the


239
mixer and loaded under cover and
switched back to the hopper level of
the mixer by a dinkey engine.
The concrete from the mixers is
dumped into two-yard "Lakewood"
buckets, carried on narrow gauge flat
cars handled by dinkey engines. Five
buckets constitute a train load. Filled
buckets are run out to the forms
where a locomotive crane lifts them
off and dumps the concrete into the
hoppers, if a narrow wall is being
poured, or lowers them directly to the
concrete level before dumping if a
wide wall is being poured. The tracks
are on two levels, one in the bottom
of the pit and the other on the bank
on the back of the walls. Three lo-
comotive cranes take care of the con-
crete, one remaining continuously in
the pit and the other two above or in
the pit, as needed.
During the past season the concret-
ing has gone slower than was expect-
ed, so that at present less than half the
total estimated yardage has been
placed. Labor has been very scarce,
especially carpenters, and the com-
pany has had to face a hard situation,
but it is expected that with some im-
provements in the mixing plant and
organization, that the 'remainder of
the 175,000 yards will be placed close
to the contract time.

PROBLEMS
BY DWIGHT B. CHEEVER, '91E
A PAPER FOR THE LEGAL CLUB OF CHICAGO. OCTOBER 30, 1916
When asked to read a paper this
year I said I would do so if the
Committee would select the subject,
and the above is what our worthy
President and Secretary assigned.
I assume from the title given, and
also from the verbal explanation
which accompanied it, that what the
Club desires is information as to the
character and routine of the work of
attorneys-at-law specializing in the
subject of patents, trade-marks and
copyrights, and commonly called
"Patent Lawyers."
The term "Patent Lawyer" used in
the classified directories; office door
signs, and stationery, designates men
more or less engaged in the soliciting
of patents before the United States
Patent Office, and indirectly those of
foreign countries, as well as those who
are in addition engaged in litigating
Court cases involving patents, which
cases differ from cases involving deeds,
trusts, bankruptcy, divorces only in
subject matter. I used the word "ad-
dition" advisedly because every patent
lawyer begins his career with patent
soliciting and no matter how high he
gets in the Court end of the game, he
always has to devote some part of his
attention to the Patent Office work
even though it be merely supervising
junior firm members or clerks, for it is
the Patent Office branch of the prac-
tice which initially brings the clients
who ultimately bring or send the Court
cases.
As you all know, a patent is ob-
tained by filing in the Patent Office
what is known as a patent application
comprising
First, Drawings illustrating the in-
vention, if the same is capable of
illustration;
Second, A specification which is
nothing in the world but a description
in plain mechanical language of the
invention shown in the drawings and
how it works, and
Third, A set of claims setting forth
those features of the invention which
the inventor believes to be new and
patentable over the prior art. The
application, after being prepared and
executed by the inventor is filed in the
Patent Office, and sent to an Exam-
iner who has charge of the particular
class of inventions to which the appli-
cation relates. This Examiner looks
over the prior art before him and
either allows or rejects, or partially
rejects and allows the claims of the
application as filed, writing a letter
to the applicant's attorney in the mat-
ter. The attorney for the applicant
obtains copies of the references, con-
fers with the client thereon and either
argues the matter as it stands or
amends and argues, as the situation
warrants, this process being kept up
until an agreement or a total disagree-
ment with the Examiner is reached,
whereupon either the patent issues or
is abandoned, or an appeal is taken to
one of the upper tribunals of the Pat-
ent Office.
You will see from the character of
the work just described that a patent
solicitor does not have to be an ordi-
nary lawyer at all, but it is very neces-
sary that he have a good knowledge
of mechanics, and a good mechanical


241
vocabulary so that he can on sight
properly and technically describe ma-
chines in all sorts of arts which he
never heard of before. It is not at
all uncommon for a busy patent so-
licitor to, in a single week, have to
prepare applications in such radically
different arts as, pianos, dynamo elec-
tric machines, locomotives, railroad
track devices, phonographs, cotton
picking machines, automobiles, cloth-
ing, and so forth. The attorney's side
of this work is hard, exacting and if
exclusively persisted in too long be-
comes somewhat of a drudgery, but
it is here that the young attorney gets
his foundation training and the clients
who swear by him, and later bring or
send him the pleasanter and more
lucrative litigation matters. There
never comes a time when a patent at-
torney can afford to turn away from
his office the man with the patent ap-
plication. He must either do it him-
self or hire somebody to do it, for
wholly apart from the money which
they bring, patent applications are the
sure feeders for more important work.
One often hears the remark among
patent attorneys that the soliciting bus-
iness does not pay. This is a very
great mistake. There are in Chicago
men who do nothing but patent solicit-
ing and decline litigation work, who
make very good incomes.
There are many interesting prob-
lems which arise in connection with
the patent soliciting branch of the
business, particularly in connection
with Patent Office practice, but I
doubt if these would be of any special
interest here. I shall therefore con-
fine the remainder of this paper to the
work of the patent lawyer proper; that
is to say, to one who handles the work
of a first-class office outside of the ex
parte patent applications.
PATENT OFFICE INTERFER-
ENCES.
The law provides that a patent shall
only be issued to the first inventor of
the subject-matter. This is a large
country, and it not infrequently hap-
pens that two or more persons in dif-
ferent parts of the country acting en-
tirely independently, invent substan-
tially identical devices and file patent
applications thereon. Again, it some-
times happens, thougli I am happy to
say not as often as many people sup-
pose, that one man makes an invention
and files a patent application thereon,
and another man steals it from him
and perhaps before the first man files
his application files in the Patent Of-
fice an application on the stolen inven-
tion. In either of these situations, the
Patent Office declares what is known
as an interference, which is nothing in
the world but a first-class law suit be-
tween the two or more applicants to
determine who in fact first made the
invention in question, so that the Pat-
ent Office can ultimately issue the pat-
ent to the right party. In such an in-
terference proceeding, each party has
to file what is called a Preliminary
Statement; that is to say, a sworn
declaration of what he claims he will
be able to prove, as to the dates of
his invention, when he made drawings,
made and tested a machine, and so on.
These are filed under seal and are all
opened by the Patent Office at the
same time.
When the parties come to take
proofs they are bound by these state-
ments which are not amendable and
the proofs must conform thereto.
Where the dates of the two state-
ments intertwine and the invention is
considered important by both parties
and both parties have money, the
chances for a long, hard, expensive


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
fight requiring all the skill and energy
of the ablest legal minds are very
great. I have known several such con-
tests where each side spent some $10,-
000 to $25,000 or more. Fortunately
for the clients, many of these inter-
ferences are disposed of because one
applicant did not allege invention
ahead of the other's officially proven
filing date. Many more are disposed
of because one side or the other on
reading the Preliminary Statements
decides that he cannot win or that the
invention is not worth the expense
of the prospective fight, but however
disposed of, an interference usually
brings added legitimate fees to the
attorneys who prosecuted the original
application.
PATENT SUITS.
When a patent is issued, giving to
the inventor, as provided in the
Statute, the exclusive right to exclude
others from making, using or selling
the invention for a period of seventeen
years, if the invention is of any value
competing devices usually promptly
appear, and the important question is
presented to the attorney for the pat-
entee to determine whether or not the
competing device is in fact an infringe-
ment of the patent, and to the attorney
for the maker of the competing device
whether the patent is valid and
whether his client can safely make the
competing device without being held
an infringer of the patent in question.
The determination of this same
question in the two respective camps
requires the highest sort of skill in the
study of the mechanics of the invention
as set forth in the patent itself, the
prior act in which it rests and the
mental temperament of the judge or
judges who will have to ultimately de-
cide the question if a suit is brought.
Opinions in this end of it are very im-
portant and far reaching in their re-
sults in money values and should, and
do, bring good fees. Some of the
greatest satisfactions in the profession
come from telling a client that he can
disregard notices of infringement and
ultimately have a court of last resort
say the opinion was right. The con-
verse is of course true when the wise
and just court can't see it and decides
the other way.
If the two attorneys on opposite
sides of the question agree, there is
sometimes a settlement of matters be-
tween the parties involving the draw-
ing of very important contracts in-
volving not merely questions of patent
law alone but highly technical contract
law, and the anti-trust laws, including
not merely the Sherman Act but the
Clayton Act, which few to date under-
stand.
If the parties on the opposite sides
of the question under discussion dis-
agree, the matter goes to the United
States Courts and here the real trou-
bles of the patent attorney and the
real expenses of the litigant-parties
begin.
There is a more or less general dis-
position on the part of the general
practitioner, particularly of the higher
class, to speak belittlingly of the patent
lawyer, but I want to say right here
that insofar as the remarks refer to
the work of the patent lawyer in the
actual trial of cases, there is absolutely
no justification for it. While there
are very few patent cases tried before
a jury, the trial of a patent case under
the new United States Equity Rules
requires just as much skill and just as
much ability of a technical legal char-
acter as is required in the trial of any
equity case, and this must be supple-
mented by a thorough mechanical
knowledge.


243
A patent case when once started is,
legally speaking, like any other equity
case. Pleadings, methods of taking
proof, methods of argument below,
appeal and argument above are just
the same as any case in the United
States Courts. The serious problems
presented by the new United States
Equity rules are more keenly appreci-
ated by the patent lawyer than the gen-
eral practitioner because he has more
cases. Among these problems may be
mentioned how to get the material for
and file an Answer in twenty days in
a case where the Plaintiff has had
months or years to prepare his case;
where, when and how interrogatories
may be filed and how answers thereto
are to be made or avoided, how to pre-
pare for and take evidence as to prior
uses within the time set forth in the
Rules where the Court declines to
grant an extension of time, as it fre-
quently does; the preparation of and
the answer to Bills of Particulars, all
of which matters were wholly un-
known prior to the preparation of the
present Rules, and regarding which
the Courts are very largely in conflict.
And last, but not least, the guessing
how a Judge with no mechanical ex-
perience is going to decide a case in-
volving intricate mechanical, electrical
or chemical questions.
THE DAILY ROUTINE OF THE
PATENT LAWYER.
A patent lawyer who has graduated
from exclusively soliciting into a court
and general practice will, in the course
of a day or a week, interview a
client who desires a patent application
filed, and arrange with a draftsman to
prepare the necessary drawings; talk
with another client who wants a con-
tract drawn, possibly prepare it in his
presence; receive an order for an
opinion on an important matter, write
or wire to a Washington associate for
a search in the prior art on which to
base it; confer with another client rel-
ative to the desirability of bringing a
suit, or the value of his defenses to a
suit already brought, then go back and
prepare the first client's application,
turn it over to Clerks to do the me-
chanical parts of getting it into the
Patent Office, go out of town for two
or three days taking or attending on
the taking of depositions in some inter-
ference or a suit; return and write
the opinion previously ordered, spend
a day, a week- or a month in the trial
of a case in Court, attend to the
amending of a previously filed applica-
tion which has been acted upon by the
Patent Office Examiner, fire a stenog-
rapher and hire a new one, and so on.
He omits entirely calendar "first calls"
and other annoyances of the ordinary
state practice.
THE CHARACTER OF THE
PATENT LAWYER.
There are about one thousand patent
lawyers in active practice before the
Patent Office, one hundred and fifty
of whom practice in Chicago either in-
dividually or as members of firms.
Fifty more are near enough to Chi-
cago to be members of the Patent Law
Association, from which you will see
that roughly one-fifth of the business
of the country is done in this vicinity.
From my own acquaintance with the
members of the profession in this lo-
cality and in the Eastern Cities, I can
assure you that outside of advertising
concerns whose signatures end in
"Co." or "Company," the shyster is
practically unknown in the patent law
practice. There are exceedingly few
men in the profession whose verbal
stipulation is not absolutely good. With


THE MICHIGAN TECH NIC
few exceptions, patent lawyers are
gentlemen with whom it is a pleasure
to transact business, and if there is
anything in this life in doing business
in pleasant surroundings and among
pleasant people, the patent lawyer cer-
tainly has it. The patent lawyer does
not often have matters involving the
large lump sum fees which we read
about in the papers as awarded to some
firms who conduct or oppose railroad
receiverships and bankruptcy proceed-
ings, etc., but the business does have a
regular schedule of fees payable for
work done, practically regardless of
result, and if a man is any good in
getting business so as to keep himself
reasonably busy, he has no trouble,
even when working on plain patent
soliciting only, to make a good living
for himself and his family. There are
a few men right here in Chicago whose
income from purely patent work is re-
puted from thirty to fifty thousand a
year and upward. Incomes from three
to fifteen thousand a year are not at
all uncommon. I know of one so-
called clerk who draws six thousand.
TRAINING AND GETTING A
START.
I am often asked by students how
best to prepare for the work. A court
patent lawyer may be a lawyer with no
mechanical training or experience ex-
cept what he picks up by hard work,
but there are very few who enter the
business in this way. A great many
of the men, whether college engineer-
ing graduates or not, take the civil
service examination, become Patent
Office Examiners, study law in the
night schools in Washington, D. C,
and finally graduate first into clerks
and then into members of firms out-
side. Others start in firms as drafts-
men or stenographers, learn patent so-
liciting from the members of the firm
by whom they are employed, study
law in Chicago law schools and finally
work into the firm, but this course does
not ordinarily produce men of the
highest class. A few of us were for-
tunate to be graduates of engineering
and law schools of standing and with
some common law experience before
entering the specialty practice, and I
know of no better preparation. Start-
ing in the business in Chicago is almost
impossible for the man who attempts
to open his own office on coming to
the city.
The only way to acquire business
with any reasonable1 rapidity is to start
with an established lawyer or firm and
either remain long enough to secure
an acquaintance and reputation among
people having patent matters before
withdrawing, or better yet, grow into
and up with the firm, for the business
of all patent law organizations is one
of slow but steady growth, one client
sending another and the component
man who is there attending to things,
whether an original member of the
firm or not, is the one who gets the
growth.
OUTSIDE OPINION OF THE
PATENT LAWYER.
As I have heretofore noted, there is
a disposition on the part of the gen-
eral practitioner to consider the patent
lawyer as a rather narrow individual.
This is, in my opinion, a mistake, for
while it is true that he does not have
to, at all times, know all the law in all
its branches, he does have to know and
must keep continually learning a great
deal about many branches of the
sciences and the arts which the ordi-
nary lawyer never hears of. He does
have a thorough practice in law in
every branch of the United States


245
Courts not merely in patent matters
but frequently in trade-marks and
sometimes in copyrights and this not
merely in one city, but all over the
country, for one never knows where an
infringer is going to turn up or pur-
chasers of a client's good sued. He
also occasionally has to go into State
Courts in suits on patent contracts
outside the jurisdiction of the United
States Courts, in view of which I think
that the average high class patent
lawyer is just as broad a man in a
legal way as the average high class
general practitioner.
To sum up: The profession or bus-
iness of patent law requires the
studious attention of engineering law-
yers of ability; its surroundings are
pleasant and the income reasonably at-
tainable is good. I have no hesitation
in recommending it to any high-class
young lawyer possessing any inclina-
tilon toward mechanical things, partic-
ularly to those who are graduate engi-
neers.

ERTIES OF AN AEROPLANE
W. FREDERICK GERHARDT, '17E
In aeronautics, as well as in othei
fields of engineering, immediate solu-
tion of design problems is generally
not possible. In the design of an
aeroplane for certain specified duties,
too many unknowns are present in the
computation, so that preliminary cal-
culations must be made, which involve
many assumptions. The exact effect
of these assumptions on the final per-
formance of the machine is not known.
An analysis of the properties of the
machine as thus designed must, there-
fore, be made to determine whether
or not it fulfills the requirements for
which it is being built. If it does not,
a second design and analysis must be
made, and sometimes even a third.
The aeroplanes as then built will give
results agreeing closely with those
required, although further changes in
the test machine may be necessary.
It is evident, then, that there must
be at hand a simple yet comprehensive
method of analysis of performance
properties which will apply to any
aeroplane. It is the purpose of this
paper to outline such a method. Since
the computation involved takes the
same general form for all types of ma-
chines, the principles can be best
brought out by working through a
specific example. Accordingly, the
Nieuport monoplane shown in Fig. i,
a French model, has been chosen as the
basis for the discussion, partly because
it is a machine which has demonstrated
its worth, and partly because full data
on it is available for the analysis.
The amount of data necessary for
such a calculation of properties is
small. It is easily obtained after the
specifications of the preliminary design
are known. In the first place a three-
view scale assembly drawing must be
used to determine the dimensions of
the members of the structure. Then
the characteristics of the motor and
propeller specified must be obtained for
power computation. These are gen-
erally furnished by the makers. Fin-
ally some general aerodynamical data
must be secured, such as the air reac-
tion characteristics of the wings and
tail surfaces being used, and the resist-
ance coefficients of all the different
types of members composing the struc-
ture. Such data is obtained from the
researches of the aerodynamical labor-
atories as those of Eiffel, the Univer-
sity of Paris, the Royal Aircraft Fac-
tory, the National Physics Laboratory,
and Boston Tech.
In the case of the Nieuport machine
here analyzed there is no difficulty in
regard to any of the above data as the
design being dealt with is not new but
standard.
The metric system,—kilograms, me-
ters, seconds,—has been used in this
paper, and with justification. The di-
mensions of the Nieuport monoplane
and all the aerodynamical data above
mentioned are given in metric units,
and much difficulty would be found in
transposing the quantities. Most im-
portant, however, this system is in-
herently a much simpler one than the
English in which to perform the rather
cumbersome calculations. Wherever
necessary for clearness, the English
equivalents will be given.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
In treating the problem presented,
this paper will take up first, the struc-
tural resistance; second, the character-
istics of horizantal flight; third, the
characteristics of climbing flight;
fourth, the characteristics of gliding
flight; fifth, the altitude attainable;
sixth, the radius of action; and seventh
the stability.
THE STRUCTURAL RESIST-
ANCE.
In the analysis of the properties of
any aeroplane, the structural resistance
must first be determined. It is the
starting point of all calculations. It
is the resistance offered to forward
motion, by all parts of the structure
except the wings and tail surface. To
be complete, this determination must
include the resistance at one speed, the
resistance at various speeds, and the
equivalent area of the structure.
The Resistance at One Speed.
The structural resistance is first
computed at one speed. In the com-
putation, two cases must be distin-
guished, one in which the effect of the
propeller wind is neglected, the other
in which it is considered.
Neglecting the Propeller Wind.—
The simplest case is, of course, the
former. The resistance is the sum of
the resistances of the individual parts
composing the structure, computed at
one velocity. These separate resist-
ances are found from the empirical
formula,
R = K • A • f ■ V
where K is the coefficient of resistance,
taking care of the form of the part, A
is the projected area perpendicular to
the direction of motion, in the factor
of correction, taking care of the in-
clination of the part, and V the ve-
locity of the aeroplane relative to the
air. The data thus obtained on the
monoplane is tabulated in Fig. 2. The
total resistance is 6.634 kg. (14.58 lbs.)
Considering the Propeller Wind.—
There is, however, an additional re-
sistance due to the propeller wind.
Every propeller has some slip; i. e., it
projects the air behind it with a ve-
locity greater than that at which it
moves forward. This difference may
safely be assumed to 15% of the speed
of the machine, or the velocity of the
parts behind the propeller 1.15 of the
normal. This increased resistance is,
strictly, not constant, but variable, but
the error involved is negligible. Since
the resistance varies as the square of
the velocity, the true value for such
parts is 1.3225 of the normal, an addi-
tion of 32.2%. The parts affected are
determined from Fig. ia. The compu-
tation of increased and total resist-
ance is tabulated in Fig. 3. The final
corrected value for 10 m. p. s. is 7.862
kg. f 17.3 lbs.)
The Resistance at Any Speed.
Knowing the resistance at one speed,
we may now compute the values at
various speeds. As before, there will
be two values for any velocity, as the
propeller wind is considered or not.
Neglecting the Propeller Wind.—
If the propeller effect be neglected, the
resistance at any speed is the value at
10 m. p. s. multiplied by the square of
the ratio of the velocity considered, to
10, or
R = 6.634 (V/10)2
The results of the computation are
plotted in Fig. 14.
Considering the Propeller Wind.—
If, on the other hand, the resistance at
any speed is computed from the value
at 10 m. p. s. corrected for propeller

Structural Resistance, With and Without Propeller Effect


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
effect, the results will be different. The
equation becomes,
R = 7.862 (V/io)2
The results obtained in this calculation
are also plotted in Fig. 4.
The Equivalent Area.
The equivalent area is an important
item of the structural resistance of an
aeroplane. It is used most frequently
in further computation of properties.
It is the area of a flat plane the resist-
ance of which, when perpendicular to
an air flow of velocity equal to that of
the aeroplane, is equal to the resist-
ance of the machine itself. There are
two values of this area, since the re-
sistance of the machine may be taken
with or without the propeller effect.
Neglecting the Propeller Wind.—
The value of the equivalent area found
without considering the propeller ef-
fect is the lower of the two. It is
found by solution of the equation
R = KAV2
for A, which gives
A = R/K V2
Since K is .08 for flat planes and the
corresponding resistance is 6.634 kg.
for 10 m. p. s.,
A = 6.634/.o8(io)2
= &amp;27J. (8.9 ft.2)
Considering the Propeller Wind.—
The higher equivalent area is found if
the propeller effect is taken into ac-
count. By the substitution of the cor-
responding resistance in the above
formula,
A = 7.862/.o8 (io)2
= .o83m2. (10.57 ft.2)
The equivalent area and resistances
as found by taking the propeller wind
into consideration, are of greater im-
portance in the determination of the
properties of the machine. They rep-
resent the worst conditions existing in
the machine during flight. Hereafter,
in the computation, these values will
be used almost exclusively.
THE CHARACTERISTICS OF
HORIZONTAL FLIGHT.
The next step in the determination
of the properties of an aeroplane is a
consideration of the characteristics of
horizontal flight. The computation
must be made in two stages, the ve-
locities corresponding to all possible
angles of incidence of the wings, and
the practical range of velocities.
Velocities at Various Angles of
Incidence.
For every angle of incidence of the
main wings of an aeroplane there are
corresponding horizontal velocities.
This can be seen from the formula for
velocity which is thus derived. In
horizontal flight the lift of the support-
ing surfaces must just balance the
weight of the machine, or
W=(K'A' + K"A") V2
where W is the weight, K', A' are the
lift coefficient and area of the wings,
and K", A" those of the tail. Solving
the equation for velocity,
V = V W/(K/A' + K"A")
If W be considered as a parameter, K'
and K" are the only variables. These
coefficients depend solely on the angle
of incidence. Hence the velocity varies
with this quantity and has a definite
value, or series of values, for each
angle.
In this computation of velocities
definite constant weights of the ma-


251
chine will be assumed. Practically,
the weight varies constantly through-
out flight, due to loss of fuel, but such
a consideration makes the problem too
complicated. Two values for the Nieu-
port are chosen, 575 kg. (1265 lbs.),
the load with full fuel and oil tanks,
and 475 kg. (1045 lbs.), the load with
empty tanks. There will be, then, two
velocities for each angle of incidence.
The lift coefficients of the support-
ing surfaces are taken from experi-
mental results of Eiffel. Those for the
wings are given in the curves of Fig.
5, which curves have been corrected
to take care of the difference between
the actual wing and the surface tested.
Those for the tail are found from the
curves of Fig. 6, after the angles of
The total area as corrected,
A't = 2o+ i.4=2i.4m2.
For the tail,
A"a= 5-.78-.322=1.25^.
A'
5+ 1.25 = 6.25,,
The results of the computation of
velocities at various angles of inci-
dence are plotted in Fig. 7, after tabu-
lation. The values of angles corre-
sponding to various velocities will
hereafter be obtained from this sheet.
Range op Velocities Attainable.
Not all the velocities computed,
however, can be obtained by the ma-
chine in horizontal flight. There is a
practical range outside of which it
Fig. 5, 6, 7
incidence have been corrected for
decalagc and the downward wake of
the air leaving the wings.
The areas of the wings and tail as
used in the calculation are not the
actual areas, but are larger in order to
take care of the increased lift due to
the propeller wind effect. The value
of the increased area is the product of
the percentage of the surface in the
wake of the propeller and the factor
32.2% as derived for increased resist-
ance. For the wings, the additional
area,
A'
20- .022 • .322= I.4„
cannot fly. This range is determined
by a consideration of the power re-
quired and the power available at
various velocities.
Pozvcr Required.—The power re-
quired for flight can be calculated from
the total resistance and velocity. In
terms of h. p.,
P = Rt-V/75
In this calculation the velocities used
are those corresponding to the integral
angles of incidence used above. There
are two such values for each angle,
due to the computation from two


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
weights, and hence two values of the
power.
The total resistance is made up of
several factors. It is the sum of the
structural resistance, the wing drag
and the tail drag, or,
The value of the first term at various
velocities can be found from the curve
for corrected resistance of Fig. 4.
For the wings,
R'I = K'-A'-V2
For the tail,
R",
:K"-A"-V2
The drag coefficients of the wings are
found from Fig. 5, and of the tail from
Fig. 6. These coefficients vary with
the angle of incidence. The velocities
here used are the same as those just
mentioned. This determines the total
drag of the machine.
The computations for the power re-
quired are, after tabulation, plotted in
Fig. 10. The velocities of minimum
power are 21.4 m. p. s. (48 mi. p. h.)
at io° incidence of the main wings for
575 kg., and 19.7 m. p. s. (44.1 mi. p.
h.) at 9.5 ° for 475 kg. weight.
Power Available.—The power avail-
able is determined from the character-
istics of motor and propeller. For any
r. p. m. and velocity of the machine,
P = n p
where n is the efficiency of the pro-
peller, and p the h. p. delivered by
the motor at those conditions. The
values of the second factor are given
in Fig. 8 as functions of r. p. m., and
of the former in Fig. 9 as functions
of V/(N) D where N is revolutions
per second. Hence these factors can
be combined, and the power found for
a series of r. p. m. using several ve-
locities for each r. p. m. This calcu-
lation after plotting the values gives
the curves drawn in Fig. 10. An enve-
lope of the curves is drawn to repre-
sent the maximum power at different
r. p. m. The maximum power is 55
h. p. at a velocity of 32.4 m. p. s.
(72.5 mi. p.h.) and about 1200 r. p. m.
The practical range of velocities
may be obtained from an inspection of
the data at hand. The intersection of
the power required and power avail-
able curves gives the limits. For 575
kg. weight the values are 18.8 m. p. s.
(42.2 mi. p. h.) at 200 incidence, and
30.1 m. p. s. (67.5 mi. p. h.) at 30;
for 475 kg. 16.7 m.p.s. (37.4 mi.p.n.)
at 190, and 30.1 m. p. s. at 20. This
completes the determination of hori-
zontal flight characteristics.
THE CHARACTERISTICS OF
CLIMBING FLIGHT.
In the analysis of the properties of
an aeroplane, gliding flight is another
factor which must be investigated. The
climbing velocities and angles must be
computed and the relation between
them noted.
The Velocities and Angles of
Climb.
The velocities of climb depend sole-
ly on the power excess for their mag-
nitude. The values are given by the
relation,
v = 75-p/W
where p is the excess power and W the
weight of the machine. The values
575 and 475 kg. are used as before.
The climbing angles are given by the
equation,
6~ tan-1 (v/V)
where V is the horizontal velocity of
the machine. A plot of the results of
the calculation is shown in Fig. 11.


253
The Relation Between the Veloci-
ties and Angles op Climb.
Interesting relations hold between
the velocities and angles of climb, a
knowledge of which is valuable to the
pilot of the aeroplane are brought out
by the curves. From an inspection of
these curves it can be seen that the
maximum velocity of climb does not
occur at the same time as the maxi-
mum angle, but at a horizontal veloc-
ity slightly greater. For 575 kg., the
maximum climbing velocity occurs at
a horizontal velocity of 22.2 m. p. s.
(49.6 mi. p. h.) and 8.50 incidence,
and is 2.8 m. p. s. (550 ft. p. m.) ; the
maximum angle at 21.6 m. p. s. (48.3
mi. p. h.), and 9.50 incidence, and is
7.20. For 475 kg., the maximum
climbing velocity occurs at 20.6 m.p.s.
(46.00 mi. p. h.), and 8.50 incidence,
and is 3.9 m. p. s. (770 ft. p. m.) ; the

maximum angle at 19.4 m. p. s., (43.5
mi. p. h.), and 10.00 incidence, and is
11.20. No further computations on
climbing flight are necessary.
THE CHARACTERISTICS OF
GLIDING FLIGHT.
In the analysis of the properties of
an aeroplane, gliding flight is another
factor which must be determined. Two
cases present themselves for solution,
gliding with and without power.
With Power.
When gliding under power, a ma-
chine may be treated as climbing at a
negative angle. This simplifies the so-
lution of the problem, as the gliding
angle may be read off the climbing
angle curves in the negative region,
if the corresponding horizontal veloci-
ties or angles of incidence are known.
It is not necessary to determine the
gliding velocities. Fig. n gives the
curves containing the negative climb-
ing angles or gliding angles when un-
der power.
Without Power.
If the aeroplane glides without
power, the gliding angle must be found
in a different manner. It is given by
the formula,
tan 4&gt; = (R + R'* + R"x + RP)/W
where Rp is the resistance offered by
the propeller at rest. This latter re-
sistance is very hard to determine. It
is therefore customary to drop it and
use for the other terms the corrected
values. Whence,
tan &lt;£ = Rt/W
where R, is the total resistance at the
velocity investigated. The minimum
gliding angle will then be at the ve-
locity or incidence of minimum resist-
ance. As before a series of values is
found for each of the two weights in-
vestigated. The results of the calcula-
tion are plotted in Fig. 12. For 575
kg., the minimum resistance occurs at
a horizontal velocity of 22.6 m. p. s.
(50.5 mi. p. h.) and 8.00 incidence,
and is 94.3 kg. (207 lbs.) ; the gliding
angle here is 9.320. For 475 kg., the
minimum occurs at 20.6 m. p. s. (46
mi. p. m.), and 8.3° incidence, and is
80.0 kg. (176 lbs.) ; the angle here is
9-56°.
THE ALTITUDE ATTAINABLE:
It is necessary to know the altitude
limitations of an aeroplane. Every
machine has a limit beyond which no
manipulation on the part of the pilot
will force it. Its determination is a
matter of balancing the power required
against the power available at various
altitudes.
The Power Required.
As the machine climbs the power
necessary to drive it increases. From
an analysis which will not be made
bere. of the influence of the change
of density of the air, it will be seen
that.
p: = P„ Vd./d-
where P0 and d0 are the power and
density of the air at sea level. The air
density varies according to the law,
d&gt;i = do • e~do' V13-6' bo
where h is the altitude at which the ma-
chine is flying, and b„ the barometric
pressure at sea level. Therefore the
power required can be computed for
various heights.


255
In the above equation the power at
sea level may be taken as the minimum
required for horizontal flight. This
minimum power corresponds to a defi-
nite attitude. Although the attitude
changes in climbing, and although the
machine is not always flying at mini-
mum power, the power required can
be figured from this minimum, as the
above law takes care of the change
automatically. For 575 kg., the mini-
mum is 27.3 h. p. at 21.4 m. p. s. (48
mi. p. m.) and 10.00 incidence. For
475 kg.» ^ &gt;s 2I° n- P- at !9-8 m. P-
s. (44.3 mi. p. h.) and io.o0 incidence.
The power required varies with the
weight in any flight as seen before.
The maximum and minimum values
have been used previously only. It is
likely, however, that the machine
would start With fuel tanks full and
attain its maximum altitude in say two
hours. The weight of the machine
would then be 525 kg., approximately.
The power required for this weight is
found by interpolation of the values
for 575 and 475 kg.
From tabulation of the computation
curves plotted in Fig. 13 may be ob-
tained.
The Power Available.
The power available is not constant
as the altitude of the aeroplane
changes. A double effect is produced
on the motor: both compression ratio
and volumetric efficiency are cut down
in proportion to the change of air den-
sity. Hence,
R'x=ykV + RV
where P0 is the power available at sea
level. This may be taken as the maxi-
mum developed, and is as before seen
55 h. p. A further variation in power
is brought about by the variation of the
efficiency of the propeller, but this
will here be neglected. The computa-
tion is arranged in the curves of Fig.
13-
The altitude attainable may be deter-
mined by an inspection of the curves.
The value is given by the intersection
of the power required and power avail-
able. For 525 kg., the average weight,
2750 m. (9000 ft), is the limit. The
minimum and maximum values, for
575 and 475 kg, are 2250 m. (7,350
ft.), and 3100 m. (10,200 ft.).
THE RADIUS OF ACTION.
A determination of the radius of
action is still to be made in this
analysis. A calculation of the veloci-
ties of the aeroplanes at various r. p.
m. of the motor and propeller, and
the fuel consumption per km., is neces-
sary.
Velocities at Various R. P. M.
The velocities at various r. p. m.
can be found from the data already at
hand. The maximum velocity inter-
sections of the power required and
power available curves give the value
sought. These curves are represented
in Fig. 10, those used to determine the
range of velocities, and the intersec-
tions are marked (i).
The two sets of velocities corre-
sponding to the two weights are not
the ones which are used directly in
this computation. A single set is nec-
essary to the solution of the problem.
As the machine decreases in weight
from a maximum to a minimum dur-
ing an endurance flight, a mean weight
may be assumed as correct. The ve-
locities for 575 and 475 kg., then, are
found and the mean taken.
The calculation on this item is shown
by the curves plotted in Fig. 14. The
maximum is 30.1 m. p. s. (67.5 mi. p.
h.), at 3.5° incidence, and 1200 r.p.m.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Fuel Consumption per Kilometer.
The fuel consumption per km. can
be determined if the consumption per
hour and the velocities at various r.
p. m. are known. The latter has just
been determined, and the former can
be read from the curves of motor
characteristics of Fig. 8. The fuel
per km. is merely the fuel used in an
hour, divided by the number of km.
run in that time, or
w = q/3.6 • V,
where q is the fuel consumption per
hour, and V the velocity at the r. p. m.
chosen. The results of the compu-
tation are also plotted in Fig. 14. The
average minimum consumption is .196
kg. per km., at 750 r. p. m., 24 m. p. s.,
and 6.00 incidence.
The radius of action can now be
computed. Since the longest flight is
attained at the minimum consumption
per km., and since the capacity of the
tanks is known, the necessary data is
at hand. The latter item is 85 kg.,
maximum capacity. Therefore the
radius of action,
r= 857.196 = 440 km. (274 mi.)
This is the maximum distance that
can be covered in one trip by careful
manipulation of the machine. The an-
gle of incidence must be varied as the
weight decreases, to keep the machine
at economical velocity.
STABILITY.
The stability is the next property to
be considered in the analysis of the
performance of an aeroplane. It is the
most important, as a machine is use-
less if it is not stable during flight, no
matter how favorable its other charac-
teristics. Two types of stability must
be distinguished, statical and dyna-
mical.
Statical.
An aeroplane is statically stable if
righting moments are called into play
which tend to restore it to the normal
when for any reason it deviates there-
from. Stability about all three axes,
longitudinal, lateral and directional,
must be considered. The calculation
of the moments acting on the ma-
chine is, however, similar for all three
cases. The Nieuport will, therefore,
be investigated for longitudinal stabil-
ity only, the most complicated case.
The moments acting on a machine
out of the normal longitudinal position
are four in number. The total wing
reaction, the total tail reaction, the
head resistance and the propeller
thrust each tend to rotate the ma-
chine about the center of gravity. The
moment caused by the latter will, how-
ever, be neglected in this computation,
as the line of thrust passes almost
through the center of mass.
Head Resistance Moment. — The
head or structural resistance moment
is the sum of the moments of the in-
dividual resistances. These separate
resistances are already found and tab-
ulated in Fig. 2. The arms only need
to be determined; they can be scaled
from the drawing as the resistance
may be considered as concentrated at
the center of gravity of each part. The
results are not here shown. The
total moment is + 2.148 kg. m. at the
normal attitude of the machine. It is
assumed, however, that this moment
remains constant for all angles of inci-
dence.
Wing Reaction Moment.—A compu-
tation of the wing reaction moment
involves the combination of the lift and


257
drift to form one force acting at a cer-
tain arm. The value of the total re-
action at any angle of incidence is
given by the right triangle law,
Also,
RV-VKV+RV
R'X = KVA'-V2;
R'y = K'y-A'-V2.
The values of K\ and K'y are as be-
fore given in Fig. 5. A' is 21.4 m.,
and V is 10 m. p. s. The attitude of
the reaction is determined by the ratio
of the lift to the drift. Its position on
the chord of the wing, or the distance
from the center of the span of the wing
at which it cuts the chord, is given in
Fig. 5 also. The arm is then found
by scaling on the drawing the perpen-
dicular distance from the reaction as
thus determined to the center of grav-
ity. These moments are different at
each angle of incidence.
Tail Moments. — The tail reaction
moment is calculated similarly to that
of the wing. The angles of incidence
used must, as previously done, be
corrected for decalage and wing ef-
fect. The total reaction can be found
directly, as the coefficients of total re-
action are given in Fig 6.
R'u — K"a- A"- V2
A' is 6.25 m2, and V is 10 m. p. s. If
will be assumed that this reaction acts
through the center of the tail, and per-
pendicular to it, as the errors involved
are small. The arm is then found in
the same manner as that of the wing
reaction. As in the case of the wing,
the moment differs at each angle of
incidence.
Combined Moments. — To obtain
the combined effect of these moments,
the three are added algebraically at
each angle. The result of this work
is given in the stability curve as plot-
ted in Fig. 15. The angle of incidence
at which the curve crosses the axis is
the normal attitude of flight, or where
the righting moments are zero. This
angle is 5.50. If this be called O, the
angles measured from it will be angles
of pitch. At any angle of pitch, the
curve shows the moment in kg. m.
tending to restore the machine to the
normal attitude. This completes the
determination of longitudinal statical
stability.
Dynamical.
An aeroplane is dynamically stable
when, and only when, the oscillations
set up by any disturbance tend to be
damped out as time goes on, leaving
the machine in its normal attitude.
Since damping requires that the mo-
ments set up tend to restore it to the
normal, it is evident that the machine
must first be statically stable. On the
other hand, since it is found in practice
that at low speeds the best machines
take up oscillations that increase in
amplitude, it can be seen that a ma-
chine that is statically stable is not
necessarily so dynamically.
The dynamical stability is not, how-
ever, often determined for the pre-
liminary design. In the first place,
there is no mathematical method of
analysis for it. In the second place, it
is not necessary. The design is usually
considered satisfactory if, other re-
quirements being fulfilled, the machine
is statically stable, for the changes in
the structure necessary to secure dyna-
mical stability will not affect the other
properties to any appreciable extent.
For these reasons this phase of sta-
bility will not be taken up further,
here.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
This, then concludes the determina-
tion of the performance properties of
the aeroplane, in the specific example
worked out, and in general.
CONCLUSION.
Thus there is presented for the use
of the designer a statement of the
characteristics of a machine built ac-
cording to his plans. The resistance
of the structure, the velocity limits of
flight, the highest and longest flight
possible, and finally the behavior dur-
ing flight are all known. For the Nieu-
port machine they are are arranged in
Fig. 16 in tabular form. With such
information the design may be ap-
proved or altered until such analysis
shows it to be satisfactory.
The value of the information so ob-
tained is not, however, confined to de-
signing. It may properly be applied
to the actual piloting of the aeroplane.
An incidence meter, and a tachometer
are usually provided on a present day
machine. The pilot may, therefore,
adjust the wings to the proper atti-
tude, and the motor to the proper r.
p. m., and thus attain the maximum
or minimum horizontal speed, climb
the fastest, glide the farthest, etc.,—
in short, utilize with certainty all the
advantages which the machine pos-
sesses.

Fig. i6. Summary of Properties
It is evident, then, that such an
analysis of performance properties is
very valuable, if not indispensible, to
the manufacture and use of aeroplanes.


J. D. GORDON
An examination of the catalogue of
almost any college or school of engin-
eering indicates that the course con-
sists of a successive and progressive
line of theoretical subjects. This suc-
cessive line of theoretical subjects and
other correlative ones, when pursued
for a term of years, is supposed to
furnish a young man with an educa-
tion which should make him a suc-
cessful civil, mechanical, electrical, or
other specialized engineer.
The point is often raised whether
this course of training accomplishes
its purpose, or does the great school
of experience furnish the necessary
training for the really successful en-
gineer. The most natural verdict,
viewed from the standpoint of results,
is that it is a combination of the two.
What can the college or university do
to make its share more intensive so
that success may be more readily ob-
tained? The cry has been raised that
the engineer is not accorded his proper
share of recognition in the world. The
doctor, lawyer and other professional
man seem to have a royal road to rec-
ognition compared with that of the
engineer. One wonders why. Is it
because the engineer's accomplish-
ments are less notable? The primary
reason is that modern engineering is
a product of the recent century. The
older professions have long realized
the need of cultural study for the
members of their professions. These
cultural studies have enabled the older
professions to force recognition of
their accomplishments.
It is recognized today that the aver-
age engineer lacks cultural training.
He is really put through a hot-house
of engineering training and the result
is that the employer of graduate en-
gineers finds something vital lacking
in his employee. If he is a careful,
patient employer who wishes to real-
ize on what appears a half bad invest-
ment, he studies, coaches, pets, molds
and reshapes the young man, and af-
ter much time, expense and labor, fin-
ally reaps the benefit of a good engin-
eer.
As examination of the alumni reg-
ister of any engineering college reveals
rather startling information. Instead
of the majority of the graduates fol-
lowing their strict, theoretical training,
and becoming engineers in the sense
of being inventors, creators, designers
of new and novel things, they are in-
stead salesmen of cement, machinery
and implements; managers, superin-
tendents and directors of mills, water
works, electric light, gas, telephone
and kindred public utilities. What are
the duties of these directors, man-
agers, superintendents and sales man-
agers?—nothing more than technical
business men—a thing unheard of a
century ago. In those days the men
who went to college studied literature,
science and the arts, and prepared for
the ministry or literature. The man
out of college preached the gospel,
wrote literature or became a merchant.
Civil engineering consisted of survey-
ing only.
The last century produced the tele-
phone, telegraph, street railway, elec-
tric light, gas for heating and illumin-
ating; and with it arose a demand for
men who were not only business men,


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
but who, of necessity, had to be tech-
nical men, who could understand the
technical problems arising in the busi-
ness. The ordinary individual who en-
tered these businesses found he had
to become a self-made engineer, or
through sheer hard work had to se-
cure in the practical school, a techni-
cal training.
There is, of course, and always will
be a demand for the engineer of the
type who creates and invents, but the
majority of the graduate engineers
finally find their way into positions
which are nothing more than techni-
cal business men or directors of cer-
tain technical work. It is this feature
of our life that has caused the wonder-
ful growth and development of the
engineering schools and colleges. Un-
fortunately the large number of the
young men who take up these courses
do not seem to get the proper con-
ception of what kind of work they
will pursue upon graduation. As a
rule, they are sent to college on the
basis that they will be the type of
engineer who creates or invents.
There is something mysterious
about engineering because it deals
with the science and the forces of Na-
ture, about which the layman under-
stands very little. It is this halo of
mystery which tends to bring into this
work young men who are unfitted, or
who, upon graduation, discover that
they are not going to invent and cre-
ate. Probably for the first few years
they suffer some keen disappointment
in not following what they felt was
the ideal of a chosen profession.
As evidenced by the published alum-
ni registers and the knowledge of the
older men in the profession, at least
three-fourths of the graduates are
technical business men. What then
is lacking in the ordinary graduate
to better fit him for the profession of
a technical business man?
In the early history of public util-
ities, if the director of a utility was
called upon to explain his business to
the public, to defend his rates, to de-
fend his method of doing business,
he hired a lawyer. Lawyers were ac-
knowledged, and are acknowledged, as
the grand mouthpieces of the world;
they are the orators; they can talk and
convince or at any rate are supposed
to. Today any one engaged in engin-
eering work realizes how fallacious is
the idea of hiring or engaging a law-
yer to represent any public utility in its
arguments, or in its dealings with the
public or the quasi-judicial bodies
known as public service commissions.
It takes a man, and a sane business
man at that with a technical training to
bring home to any public body, or to
any commission, just what he is trying
to do in his business for the public.
Let us take, for instance, a rate
case. He is trying to earn a proper re-
turn for his stockholders who have in-
vested their money; he is trying to fur-
nish an adequate service to the public
at a reasonable price, within the reach
of all; he must of necessity main-
tain certain depreciation and reserve
funds; there are certain factors which
create overhead expense in being ready
to serve; there are certain expendi-
tures for development work. All these
and many other points he must pre-
sent in a clear, concise manner and his
knowledge of them all must be exact
if he hopes that his arguments will
carry weight. To engage a lawyer to
do such work as this would be useless
for unless the lawyer had in some way
secured a technical knowledge or edu-
cation of the subject with which he
was dealing, his arguments would be
weak and unconvincing. Even such a


261
matter as franchises—the securing of
them for public utilities—was former-
ly considered an exclusive field for
lawyers. The request for this right to
engage and pursue in a certain busi-
ness is of an engineering nature. To-
day it is the engineer who pleads his
cause before the city or other body of
authorities for this right to do busi-
ness, because this privilege of doing
business invariably involves a rate and
return on the money to be invested;
and so many other points in the use
of streets, alleys, highways and by-
ways, that, though an attorney may
assist in seeing that the rights and
privileges as drawn up are in proper
legal form, the making of the deal is
entirely within the province of the en-
gineer.
Another branch of engineering
which has developed wonderfully is
that of salesmanship. There are of
course, salesmen who need no techni-
cal knowledge, who deal in commodi-
ties that require no technical knowl-
edge, but the salesmen who handle the
millions of dollars worth of supplies
and machinery that are sold to the
various public utilities, are salesmen
who must of necessity be technical
men.
I recall a few years ago that a small
town desired to purchase and place in
operation a municipal lighting plant.
There were representatives from
some of the large electrical manufac-
turing companies, who desired to sell
the town the necessary dynamos, boil-
ers, turbines; men who desired to sell
wire, insulators, poles, conduits and
other fittings. And I recall how amus-
ing it was to see these men, who were
technical graduates and were supposed
to know their business, attempt to ex-
plain to this body of city councilmen,
(which consisted in this case of a dry
goods merchant, a hotel proprietor, a
liveryman, two clerks in a tin mill, a
barber and a street railway conductor)
that one man's generators were better
than another, because, as one man
stated, "Mine are three-phase and the
other man's are single-phase; there-
fore, the town will get more for its
money," and arguments of a similar
character. The most notable feature
of these salesmen, as it impressed me,
was that they seemed to be unable to
talk; they seemed to be unable to get
to their feet and tell these people,
(which was as ordinary a body of lay-
men as you would find in most any
town) just how they should go at it
to start their municipal plant and put
it on its feet.
I think this feature is one that is
very much neglected in any school of
engineering. A man makes a recita-
tion in English that would probably
shame a nine or ten-year-old school
boy—just so he answers the instruc-
tor's questions—and perhaps he gets
a good grade for his answers. A bet-
ter study of English and then the use
of this study of English in the various
technical courses will result in over-
coming this difficulty. Engineering stu-
dents should have oratorical societies
or debating societies, or they can use
their engineering societies for debat-
ing engineering questions. I can think
of any number of questions which can
be put before an engineering society
which would bring out in the students,
not alone the desire to learn to talk,
but the ability to talk well and to ar-
gue: and there is no asset more val-
uable to them than this when they get
out into the world. Let the engineers
debate a subject—"Shall a franchise
be granted to a competing electric
light company in—let us say Ann Ar-
bor—for a term of twenty-five years.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
on the promise that the new company
will sell electric current at two cents
per kilowatt?" This would bring out
a problem that will train a man to an-
swer any sort of a proposition of a
similar character. It would also en-
able a man to get some confidence in
his method of applying for a position.
I know that to most any engineer who
has been out for a number of years,
it cannot help but strike him as tragic
to see young men just out of college,
or who have been out only a year or
so, come in and apply for a position.
Men who have put in years in getting
an education, step into an office and
state they desire a position. I have
often asked a man who holds a degree
in electrical engineering—-"Well, what
sort of a position do you desire?"
"Oh! I don't know; I am a graduate
in electrical engineering," is the usual
reply. "Well, we are a large corpor-
ation; we employ engineers on con-
struction work; some men like main-
tenance work; some men get into the
auditing department, and some men
get into the Commercial or Sales de-
partment. Just what would you like?
Would you want to start off as gen-
eral manager, or would you want to
take a job where you could learn some
phase of the work first?" The men
often look at yon sheepishly and won-
der just who the joke is on; whether
it is meant in a spirit of levity, or
whether this conference taking place
is real. It is real, very much so, and
it is sad that a man who steps in to
sell his services cannot do so with a
well defined plan in view.
It is similar to the salesman who
steps in to sell you a piece of appara-
tus—let us say a vacuum sweeper—
and you ask him, "Well, can you pick
up lint and pins with this sweeper?"
and he says, "I don't know; I suppose
so." Or you ask, "In time, if this mo-
tor or sweeper becomes clogged with
dirt, can you take it out, to clean it,
without wrecking the machine?"
"Well, I don't know; I will have to
ask my boss about it." It is exactly
a similar situation with the young
man who attempts to sell his services.
This man could no more sell anyone
the sweeper, though it may have mer-
it and may have been well advertised,
than the young man can sell his ser-
vices, unless he can come in Mr. Pros-
pective Employer's office and state
just what he has and what he desires
to sell.
Another feature of modern engi-
neering education that must be devel-
oped is the ability to write a letter and
to make a report properly. I care not
where the graduate gets employment,
the tendency today is for business to
be handled in larger and larger units;
and the more this is done, the more
business is handled on what is known
as a correspondence basis. A man
makes a deal or sells some machinery
over the telephone; he confirms this
by letter. This letter must specifically
and in a clear and concise way report
the actual transaction.
To take an everyday fact from life,
it is humorous sometimes to see an
ordinary layman order a part for an
automobile. He will write a letter to
the factory and say that—"one of the
things, or hickeys, or thingabobs that
runs from the engine back to the rear
end, and has little humps in it, has
broken and I want a new one; I can-
not find a picture in the catalogue."
This letter reaches an engineer in the
motor car factory, and he writes back
—"In reply to your letter of a certain
date, we have your inquiry with refer-
ence to a certain part for your car,


263
number so and so. From the descrip-
tion that you give us, we presume that
this is the gear of the left side of your
transmission. If you widl advise us
whether you desire this transmission
set on the driving shaft, and whether
you also desire the necessary key with
it, we shall he pleased to ship it to
you." Anyone can well imagine how
exasperated the layman will be when
he gets this very technical description
of what he is supposed to want.
Think of the problems that come up
in any technical business in ordering
machinery, in ordering supplies; how
aggravating it is to get correspond-
ence from supposedly good sales man-
agers and good engineers that fairly
drive one crazy to understand. It re-
minds me so much of the man, who,
on the telephone ca'lled a feed store,
and when the man at the feed store
said, "This is Jones' feed store," he
proceeded to give his order. "I want
ten bushels of oats, two bales of hay
and a fifty-pound sack of bran." The
feed man said, "Thank you very much
for your order, but who is this for?"
The man at the other telephone said,
'Why, for a horse, you fool! Do you
suppose I wrant to eat it myself?" A
great deal of technical correspond-
ence often develops into correspond-
ence of this nature.
Recently I knew of a case where
an order was placed for some doors,
and a bright sales manager, who had
been.furnished with a detailed sketch
showing the size of the doors and
what they were to be made of, wrote
back and wanted to know what the
doors were for.
This I feel is the great problem in
engineering education; to add to it
just these two items of developing in
the engineer the ability to talk, so that
he can properly place his proposition
or his subject before an employer util-
ity body or prospective purchaser; and
second, to develop his use of English
so that he can write and confirm and
describe in pure English, with just
enough of his technical knowledge, so
that any man anywhere can under-
stand exactly what he is driving at.
Any written subject, of course, must
always take into consideration the
party to whom it is going. If the en-
gineer will develop an ability to talk
and write and do so property, his pro-
fession will soon emerge from that of
the mysterious and will soon take its
rightful place among the other learn-
ed professions.

work. That a more liberal use of the
facilities should be made, is the con-
tention of this body.
These ideas are by no means new.
There has been felt for some time an
increasing appreciation of the relation
of the university to the industries.
That this relation has not been devel-
oped to its greatest possible extent in
this country has been too well shown
by the European war. It is evident
to everyone that whatever other ef-
fects the war will have upon the na-
tions involved, its close will find those
nations with a scientific, industrial
and commercial organization that will
be of supreme advantage in the period
of competition that will follow. We,
as a nation, must be prepared to meet
this crisis with a similar advance. The
advance must, in a large measure, be
based on technical research, of a char-
acter that the industries cannot han-
dle, because they are not properly
equipped.
It is natural then that the univer-
sity be looked to for a solution of our
problems along these lines. Our in-
stitutions have been turning out engi-
neers of high caliber as the primary
duty and have considered the job fin-
ished. This is not enough; their in-
fluence should not end there. The
technical equipment and knowledge


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
residing in them, should serve the
graduate fully as well as the under-
graduate. The investigation of the
problems that arise in industry and
the research work necessary is largely
of a character that demands develop-
ment apart from commercial life. Few
manufacturing concerns possess the
facilities for extended work along
lines that would be profitable. With
the co-operation of the university,
problems could be solved that other-
wise might remain unsolved.
With such work in the university
would come a wider diffusion of sci-
entific knowledge. At present engi-
neering firms must undertake their in-
vestigations either in private labora-
tories or in those of private firms. The
results usually remain a secret. In
the university laboratory, from the
very nature of the institution, the re-
sults would receive a dissemination in
those fields in which they would be
the most valuable. Undoubtedly re-
strictions which are justifiable in cer-
tain cases, would be imposed, but no
hard and fast rules would hold. The
suggestion of the Chicago Alumni,
that a press bureau be established
seems to be a logical solution of the
publicity question. While the Tech-
nics will gladly co-operate in the pub-
lication of research bulletins to as
great an extent as possible, the vol-
ume of this work, once under way,
would find our columns inadequate.
That State Universities should co-
operate in industrial research in some
such manner as has been suggested is
highly desirable from the point of
view of the prestige of the University
and the furtherance of industrial pro-
gress. Michigan's College of Engi-
neering and Architecture, standing as
it does among the progressive institu-
tions of the country, should take this
opportunity to advance herself and
the interests of industry.
PROHIBITION AND THE MICH-
IGAN CAMPUS
The passing into effect of statewide
prohibition in 1918 will have its effect
on student life at the University and
some readjustment must inevitably
take place. The stein does not hold
the place in modern college life that it
did a few years ago. Several factors
have brought this about. The size of
the modern university has tended to
abolish the once favorite Bohemian
type of college life, except possibly in
a few small organizations. Again,
the competition and the necessity for
efficiency have to some extent produc-
ed the change. Nevertheless, it is a
fact that the picturesque "fill-your-
tankards" type of student life of a
while ago has been retained to some
slight extent.
That the new order of things will
meet with the approval of the major-
ity, was definitely indicated by the re-
sults of the straw vote taken on the
question just before election. Just
this moral satisfaction accorded the
student will have a desirable effect.
The celebration of athletic victories
will exhibit the corrective influence of
prohibition to a greater extent than
anything else. The snake dance, the
bonfire and the free show will be un-
affected, but the attempts at depreda-
tion will cease. The passing into ef-
fect of the amendment will be an au-
spicious event for the Michigan Un-
ion. The Union has been fighting
fierce competition in its efforts toward
the maintenance of a clubhouse, a
competition some features of which it
could not meet. With these particular


267
features removed, success is assured.
We believe that the people of the.
State of Michigan have decreed well
for the University.
YOUR LAST SEMESTER
The program in force in the Col-
lege of Engineering is so planned that
the regular number of hours to be
carried in the last semester of the sen-
ior year is considerably less than is
required in preceding semesters. This
arrangement makes possible the car-
rying of back work during the last
months of college without the neces-
sity of carrying extra hours. It is a
commendable plan. It has saved many
a man the time and expense necessary
to complete another semester's work
in order to get a degree, when he
lacked but four or six hours credit.
But how about the man who has
pulled through the first seven semes-
ters on schedule? He has worked
diligently from the beginning of his
course and now finds himself with a
light load on the home stretch. He
looks back and thinks of the hard
work spent in the pursuit of- knowl-
edge, and the inclination to "take it
easy" for once comes over him. He
says that he has earned a rest and is
entitled to it. That's a logical view
of the situation to take, you say. Very
true, but here's another view. You
are finishing your last year of under-
graduate study. Very probably you
will never again be placed in an atmo-
sphere of study, experiment and in-
vestigation, or have at your disposal
such tutors and facilities as you find
about you at the present time. You
have all of this free, yet you would
rather loaf and have a good time than
take advantage of the opportunities
before vou.
How about your English? Can you
write a technical report that is as good
a technical report, as the engineering
about which you are writing is good
engineering? Have you letters with
punch about them which will cause
the desired effect? Can you talk as
convincingly as you think and write?
If not, the English department wants
to see you. Do you understand a
modern accounting system, or will
your future bookkeeper be the only
man who knows anything about your
finances? Do you understand the re-
lations between capital and labor, rela-
tions which are of utmost importance
to the engineer? If not, there are
classes in Economics open to you.
Your credit is good anywhere on
the Michigan campus. Your treasur-
er's receipt is a due bill and it is not
used up until you have a full schedule
of hours. The good engineer is also
a good financier. Get your money's
worth.
TO FIRST YEAR MEN
Within a few weeks you will have
closed the first semester of your
course at one of the greatest engineer-
ing schools in the country. You have
become acquainted with some of
Michigan's customs; you are learning
some of her traditions; you may have
an appreciation of Michigan spirit.
This is true as a result of observation
rather than participation. You don-
ned a gray cap at first because it was
the healthy thing to do; now you wear
it because it is your privilege, accord-
ed members of no other class. You
are beginning to feel your responsibil-
ity in carrying out and perpetuating
Michigan's customs.
Honor in examinations is the great-
est tradition of the College of Engi-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
neering. You have been told of the
simple system which forms the basis
for its accomplishment. Nothing fur-
ther need be said here along those
lines. The rest is up to you. All
that Michigan asks and demands of
him who desires to be known as a
man among men is honesty upon hon-
or. Xo man is a true Michigan man
who will allow his name and that of
the College to be sullied through a
breach of the code of honor. When
you enter upon the final examinations
within a few weeks let this thought
rest with you: Xo one but myself may
deprive me of that greatest of per-
sonal attributes, my honor; and there
is nothing so rich that I would stake
against it.
There are bound to be some among
the many students in the College who
will not come into a full realization
of the meaning and significance of all
this. For these men a great moral
support is required, and it must come
through the efforts of their fellows of
stronger will. A treacherous expres-
sion of friendship and good will is to
give assistance or allow a friend and
classmate to obtain aid dishonestly.
It is like hitting a man when he is
down. Do not, unconsciously of
course, place a man under conditions
of which he is not the master, but
rather back up his moral courage with
your own support. You would not
hesitate to help a man in a physical
fight, why not do the same in this
moral fight, the results of which are
of far greater importance. The man
you thus support will appreciate your
services later, even if he does not at
the time. A word from you at the
critical moment may change the whole
future of a man's life.
Will you do your duty?
VOLUME XXIX
With the publication of this issue,
another volume of The Michigan
Technic has been completed, and the
work of the present Staff is done. As
we who are passing from active ser-
vice, look back over the months, yes
years through which we have first fol-
lowed, then guided the course of the
journal, there comes over us a feeling
of sadness, of regret that we must
part. Our interests have so long been
wrapped between front and hack cov-
ers of the magazine that at times we
are loath to give up the work.
Tf there have been any progress or
any successes, it is to the credit of the
loyal Alumni, Faculty and student
support. Without them nothing could
succeed. We bespeak a similar sup-
port for the future.
It is with the utmost confidence in
their ability that the retiring Staff
passes on to their successors, the man-
agement of the Tech nic and allied
publications, and with them their
heartiest good wishes for a pleasant
and successful vear.

WHILE the torch light parades, flar-
ing banners, huge bonfires and ex-
cited throngs which characterized
the presidential elections of a few decades
ago are a page in history, the excitement
and interest which prevailed at such times
are as alive as ever. Hughes and Wilson
were the watchwords of the campus. The
political situations were the sole topics of
conversation and argument among students
who come to Ann Arbor from the four cor-
ners of the country. The excitement during
election week was intense and when the
name of the winning candidate was finally
given oiit to the people there were huge
sighs of regret and of satisfaction among
the men on the campus.
With the presidential election of 1916 a
thing of the past and the football season
but a pleasant memory of hard-fought bat-
tles and honorable defeats and big vic-
tories, the men in the University are turn-
ing their attention to less excitable pur-
suits. Denny's banquets at the Union are
becoming very popular. Great quantities
of cider and doughnuts and smokes are
being consumed at class and society
smokers.
The senior and junior campus honor so-
cieties have been initiating their pledges
and each day saw some hapless group of
neophytes being ushered into the sacred
portals of some mysterious society.
Thanksgiving has come and gone with
its boxes from home which provided many
a midnight banquet for freshmen and
sophomores.
Work in the laboratories of the Engi-
neering College is getting under way and
much valuable work will be done. The ex-
perimental flume at the Argo Dam has
been completed and experimentation already
started, while the Highway Laboratory is
nearly completed and is already occupied.
We are settling down for a winter of
profitable work and study.
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN EXPER-
IMENTAL HYDRAULIC FLUME.
AT ARGO DAM.
During August. 1016, just as the Engineer-
ing Department was contemplating the pur-
chase of the materials for the construction
of the experimental flume, described in the
May issue of the Technic, the officials ot
the Detroit Edison Company notified the
Civil Engineering Department, that they
would finance the construction of the flume,
donating the use of the same to the Uni-
versity of Michigan.
Excavation and preparation of the site
was started on Sept. 9th; the flume was
completed on Nov. 11, at a total cost to the
Detroit Edison Company of about $1,300.00.
Water has since been turned into the flume.
The flume proved absolutely water tight,
thus necessitating no leakage corrections to
be introduced into the experimental calcu-
lations.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
The flume connects with two of the flood
gates at the Argo Spillway, making a dis-
charge of about 250 cfs available for some
experiments. Its total length is 138.42 feet;
36.1 feet of which is S.o feet wide, and 8.75
feet deep; while the main testing section,
which is 102.42 feet long, is exactly 2
meters (6.56 feet) wide and 8 feet deep.
A standard Bazin weir has been constructed
at the end of the flume—2 meters wide, and
3.72 feet high. The crest, however, departs
from Bazin's design in that it is made of
the weir at a point of attachment 6 feet up-
stream from the weir. This is the location
used by Francis and Fteley and Stearns in
their original investigations. Gages Nos. 3
and 4 are hook gages so arranged by a sys-
tem of gate valves and pipes that the head
upon the weir throughout a range of 4
feet may be observed at points on either
or both sides of the flume, 16.35 feet
upstream from the weir. This is the point
of attachment used by Bazin in his experi-
ments on sharp crested weirs.
Experimental Flume
a brass strip inserted in a plate of cold
rolled steel. This feature insures no corro-
sion of the sharp knife edge, at the crest.
Such corrosion has been known to result
in 1-5% error in discharge values.
The flume is equipped with two sets of
adjustable baffles, one set being vertical and
the other horizontal. By proper adjustment
of these baffles, practically uniform distri-
bution of point velocities of flow can be
maintained throughout the entire flume
cross section.
In order to observe the "head" on the
Bazin weir, four gages have been installed.
Gage No. 1 is a piezometer tube indicating
with an accuracy of .002 foot, all heads on the
weir through a range of four feet. Gage
No. 2 is a hook gage recording heads on
Experimental gaging sections may be es-
tablished at any point in the flume. If this
section is placed near the upper end of the
flume, the lower end of the flume forms an
excellent measuring basin of about 3,000
cu. ft. capacity.
The capacity of this flume, and the avail-
able water supply at practically a constant
head gives this Michigan flume the unique
distinction of being excelled by no other
experimental flume in this country. Ex-
periments may be readily performed on
aerated and submerged weirs, V-notch
weirs, both small and large, free and sub-
merged orifices, current meters, Pitot tubes,
chemical and color gaging, etc.
The first work which is now being car-
ried on as the weather permits, is the cali-


271
bration of the standard Bazin weir at the
end of the flume. This calibration will be
carried to a head of 4 feet upon the weir
by means of the "Salt Solution" method of
Chemi-hydrometry. This calibration will
give very valuable experimental data upon
several questions: A comparison of the
modern "Salt Solution Method" with the
established standard of the weir, checking
its own accuracy and applicability, and that
of the Bazin weir formula as well. Since
the experiments upon which Bazin based his
formula extended only to a head of 1.78
feet, these experiments, which will be car-
ried to a head of 4.0 feet, will afford orig-
inal and authoritative data, upon which we
may base the extension of the Bazin weir
formula to high heads.
After a standard weir has been calibrated
by the salt solution method a means is pro-
vided for accurately measuring discharges
for other experimental work.
CHEMICAL FELLOWSHIP.
Mr. M. W. Patterson. '17E, has been
awarded the Hoffman Scholarship by the
Chemists' Club of New York. There are
two scholarships which were this year
awarded for the first time by this organ-
ization. They were open to all students
in Chemical Engineering in the United
States, and Mr. Patterson and the Univer-
sity of Michigan are both to be congratu-
lated that one of the two was given to a
Michigan man.
MARINE ENGINEERING.
At the meetings of the Society of Naval
Architects and Marine Engineers held in
New York November 16 and 17, two papers
were read, both of which were based upon
the results of experiments conducted by
students in the naval tank here during the
past year. "Feathering Paddle-wheels," by
Professor E. M. Bragg, points out the ad-
vantages and disadvantages of feathering
paddle-wheels as opposed to radial paddle-
wheels for river, lake, and ocean steamers.
"The Resistance of Various Types of
Barges in Shallow and Deep Water," by
Professor H. C. Sadler, is a digest of a
number of experiments originally under-
taken from the Board on Experimental
Tow-boats, U. S. Army.
At the present time the students in the
marine engineering department are con-
ducting an investigation of the effect upon
resistance of changes in the prismatic co-
efficient, starting with a parent set of lines.
PITTSBURGH STARTS ENGINEERS'
CLUB.
Under the title, "Michigan Engineers'
Club of Pittsburgh," an organization has
been launched in that city to promote the
best interests of the Engineering College of
the University of Michigan, to further ac-
quaintanceship and good fellowship among
Michigan engineers of Pittsburgh, to fa-
miliarize local manufacturers and the gen-
eral public with the experimental work of
the Engineering College and its commercial
value; to assist its members in securing
better positions and recent graduates in se-
curing employment; and also to assist the
General Alumni Association. Weekly lunch-
eons will be held by the club. Dean Cooley
addressed the members at their first large
meeting which was a beefsteak dinner held
at the Fort Pitt Hotel in June, 1916.
HIGHWAY LABORATORY.
The new Highway Laboratory, which oc-
cupies the remodeled old power house, is
rapidly being put into shape and will be
entirely completed in the near future. A
1 SO-ton bridge testing machine is now being
installed at a cost of approximately $1,500.
On this machine, the laboratory will be able
to test concrete arches up to sixteen feet in
length. Other apparatus, which will make
the laboratory one of the most complete of
its kind in the country, is being rapidly
installed.
The laboratory has about six thousand
feet of floor space. One room is set aside
for the testing of cement and concrete ag-
gregates, while another is provided for the
testing of roadstone, sand clay mixtures and
brick. The bituminous laboratory, formerly


THE MICHIGAN TECHSIC
in the chemistry building, has been made a
part of the Highway laboratory.
Mr. Tour, a graduate of the University of
Colorado, has been appointed teaching as-
sistant in the bituminous laboratory.
Mr. H. C. Coons, '16E, has been awarded
the Alexander Dow Scholarship in High-
way Research.
Sanitary Engineering.
W. R. Drury, who graduated in 1913. has
been appointed teaching assistant in sanitary
engineering to fill the vacancy made by the
resignation of W. G. Harmon, who becomes
sanitary engineer for the city of Toledo.
Mr. Drury was assistant sanitary engineer
of Ann Arbor and later assistant city engi-
neer of Flint.
Mr. H. H. Bartlett, assistant in sanitary
engineering, has been placed in charge of
the Sanitary Experiment Station for the
coming year.
'•WHO'S WHO AMONG THE
ENGINEERS"
Being a review of the non-scholastic ac-
tivities of engineering students who work
to foster and keep alive Michigan traditions
and institutions and to create an atmosphere
about our days at Michigan which make
them such pleasant memories in the years
to come.
That the engineers do play a prominent
part in the activities of the campus is very
well shown by a glance over the roster of
the 'Varsity Band for the year 1916-1917.
Twenty-four per cent of the entire band
personnel are engineers, despite the fact
that the Engineering College is regarded as
one of the busiest colleges in the Univer-
sity. The men represent nearly every in-
strument.
Among these men are G. J. Higgins. '19E.
C. E. Zwickey, 'lyTS,, H. C. Koch, '19E, G.
Husted, '19E, W. McKee. '18E, D. K.
White, '19E, M. B. Cutting. '17E, M. A.
Xetter, '17E, H. Gray, '17E, P. Carroll.
'18E, T. B. Dimmick, '17E, and L. R. Hal-
ton, '18E. Most of them took an active
part in this year's Band Bounce and we all
recall the playing of James Stevens, '18E,
how well he was received, and how he
charmed the audience with the sweet strains
from his mandolin.
The engineers have heartily supported the
organization of a campus division of the
National Xaval Volunteers whose existence
was recently created by an act of Con-
gress. Among the campus division's offi-
cers are: Lieutenants, K. W. Heinrich and
O. M. McNeil: Ensign (aero corps), Prof.
F. W. Pawlowski; Ensigns, E. A. Harring-
ton and H. E. Barrett, grad.; Yoeman, R.
Dodd. '18E.
The annual Michigan Union "Spotlight
Vaudeville" was revived this year after
having been suspended in 1915. Don Smith,
'17E, was general chairman. Gordon Smith,
'17E, was stage manager, and was assisted
by E. G. Dudley, '18E. Dick Gardiner,
'17E, had charge of the lighting effects,
while Thatcher Rea, '17E, was chairman of
the costumes committee. H. A. Taylor,
'17E, compiled the program. There were
several feature acts and an old-time min-
strel show in which C. L. Fordney, '17E,
and other engineers took an active part.
The show was a big success.
A. A. Schupp. '17E. is general chairman
of this year's Michigan Union Opera. The
book and lyrics are ready and everything
points to a repetition of last year's success.
Staatz M. Abrams, '17E, acted as chair-
man of the Cornell Mass Meeting at Hill
Auditorium November 9. Among the
speakers were Otto Carpell, 'ii-'mL, who
won fame as halfback on several Yost ag-
gregations, and Frank Murphy. 'i5-'i6L.
Abrams was also one of the student speak-
ers at the big football smoker November 25.
J. R. Pollock, '17E. R. R. Baker, '17E,
W. F. Gerhardt. '17E, M. W. Patterson,

BAND BOUNCE.
The Band Bounce, which was given at
Hill Auditorium, to finance the band's trip
to Cornell, was as big a success as in form-
er years. Musical acts, unique dialogues,
and spicy sketches characterized the even-
ing. The features offered by the band, as
well as the various acts, were received by
a huge audience with great enthusiasm. On
several occasions between the shifting of
scenes, the Bounce assumed the nature of
a "pep" meeting, as was shown by the cheers
for the members of the team and band.

PULP AND PAPER RESEARCH.
Since the establishment in the Department
of Chemical Engineering of the Pulp and
Paper Manufacturers' Fellowship a little
over a year ago, by some of the pulp and
paper manufacturers of Michigan, there has
been a most gratifying increase in the in-
terest shown in this industry by students
of Chemical Engineering. Three graduate
students and four seniors are doing re-
search work in this subject.
The work which Mr. Ford began last
year on the "Study of Some of the Factors
Influencing the Retention of Fillers," is be-
ing continued by C. W. Hallahan, who holds
the Pulp and Paper Manufacturers' Fellow-
ship this year. Very finely divided min-
eral substances, such as china clay, tales,
barium sulphate, calcium sulphate, etc., are
mixed with the paper-making fibers. When
the sheet of paper is formed some of this
mineral is retained by the fibers and aids
in producing an opaque sheet, and at the
same time fills up the interstices in the
sheet and gives a much smoother surface.
The opacity is an essential property of
paper which is to be used for printing on
both sides as in book paper. This is espe-
cially true where it is desirable to use very
thin paper. Smoothness of surface is a
prerequisite to the production of good half-
tone prints.
These mineral fillers are normally much
cheaper per ton than the fibers that enter
into the composition of the paper. Fre-
quently, however, as much as two-thirds of
the mineral added drains away from the
newly formed wet sheet owing to the ex-
treme fineness of the mineral particles. This
loss makes the actual cost of the effective
filler equivalent to three times the price paid


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
per ton. Filler to the amount of 20 per
cent or 30 per cent of the weight of the
fiber is frequently added to the mixture. It
is evident, therefore, that any means that
can be used to increase the retention will
not only afford a better control of the oper-
ation but will also permit a material finan-
cial saving.
Mr. Hallahan is making test sheets under
varying experimental conditions and deter-
mining the retention obtained, in an attempt
to establish a relationship between the prop-
erties of the pulps on the one hand, and the
properties of the filler on the other, and re-
tention values.
Pulps differ from each other depending
upon the raw material from which they are
prepared. Moreover the properties of an
individual pulp may be greatly altered by
suitable mechanical treatment in the pres-
ence of water.
Clays and tales show widely differing
characteristics depending upon the locali-
ties from which they are procured. The
degree of fineness varies from sample to
sample and the colloidal nature is much
more strongly marked in some cases than
in others.
Mr. Hallahan is trying to obtain physical
measurements of these various properties
and plot them against retention.
The influence of the addition of certain
chemicals, such as rosin soap, sulphate of
alumina, and starch, must be taken under
consideration.
Once these relationships have been estab-
lished the manufacturer will know how to
modify his present practice so as to obtain
a higher efficiency in the utilization of his
mineral filler.
Three-quarters of a century ago rags
were the only fibrous material used to make
paper. During the last half of the 18th
century rags gave way. except for the very
highest grade papers, to pulps made from
wood. Owing to careless methods of lum-
bering the wood supply has rapidly de-
creased. This fact, coupled with the fail-
ure of imports of wood fibers under pres-
ent war conditions, has, in many cases,
more than doubled the cost of wood pulp.
These facts have brought under considera-
tion the use of other materials than- wood
for pulp supply. Many of these plants pro-
duce pulp which is entirely satisfactory for
paper. The economic condition which pre-
vented their earlier introduction have now
changed and the future may see radical
changes in the list of available raw ma-
terials.
In the study of the suitability of a fib-
rous plant for paper pulp it is necessary
to determine the amount of pulp which can
be obtained from it; the method by which
the fibers can best be isolated; the amount
of chemicals consumed in this process; the
proper conditions of temperature; strength
of chemicals and duration of treatment re-
quired; the amount of bleaching compound
needed to produce a white pulp; the size,
opacity and other physical and chemical
properties of the fibers, as well as the
strength of the paper made from these
fibers. With these facts at hand it is pos-
sible to judge whether the fiber is suitable
for paper making, and, if so, for what type
of paper it is best adapted.
The Laboratory is equipped to make the
above tests on a small scale, and R. B.
Yetter is studying wheat straw as a pos-
sible substitute for poplar wood. M. A. del
Valle, together with R. A. Hayward and
C. W. Rcade, are investigating the possi-
bilities of Yagrum as a paper pulp plant.
Yagrum is similar in some of its character-
istics to bamboo, but the stalk is more near-
ly solid and the woody fibers are not so
compact. It grows in approximately a
three-year cycle. Large tracts of Yagrum
are available in Porto Rico within easy
reach of water and water power.
The shortage of pulp supplies makes the
economic re-utilization of waste paper of
increasing importance. R. W. Jennings is
investigating the conditions most favorable
to the deinking, decoloring and isolation of
the fibers from book and ledger papers.
Pulp made from these materials can be
used to advantage in the manufacture of
book and magazine papers.
To determine the kinds of fibers that have
been used in a sheet of paper and the rela-
tive proportion of each recourse must be
had to microscopic analysis. W. L. Wat-


277
son is making* a microscopic study of the
various fibers commonly used in paper and
is investigating the effects of stains on dif-
ferentiating these fibers from a quantita-
tive standpoint.
CHEMICAL ENGINEERING.
Since the beginning of the war a great
deal has been said in regard to the immense
importance of nitric acid for military pur-
poses. All explosives contain nitric acid as
their most important constituent. In this
country the sole source of supply is Chile
saltpeter. The question of a source which
would be available if our imports were cut
cjff is a vital one, and three or four pro-
cesses are known by which nitric acid can
be made from other materials than salt-
peter. One of these processes starts with
ammonia. The conversion of ammonia to
nitric acid has long been known as a labora-
tory experiment, but the conditions to se-
cure a yield that would render the process
commercially feasible, and to secure a pro-
duct of the strength necessary for the man-
ufacture of explosives, is a more obscure
matter. Prof. A. H. White, assisted by
Mr. Binnall and Mr. Andrew, the present
holders of the Gas fellowship, is carrying
on experiments to clear up some of these
points. Owing to alterations at the Gas
plant, the work at the testing station, which
usually occupies the fellowship men, is
temporarily interrupted.
For a number of years a large series of
cement test pieces have been under observa-
tion to determine the effect of waterproof-
ing materials. Measurements on these are
being continued by Mr. Richards, under
Prof. White, and new experiments started
along the same line. Under Prof. White
are also Mr. Rankin, who is interested in
the recovery of nitric acid from mixtures
of sulfuric and nitric acids (a problem aris-
ing in the manufacture of explosives and
in other phases of the newly-developing
chemical industries); Mr. S. Cohen, who is
studying some minor phases in the purifi-
cation of illuminating gas; and Mr. Waite
who is trying to recover some of the con-
stituents of waste coke oven gases, other
than the ones which have a recognized value.
Although absent on leave this year, Prof.
Ware is directing the work of the Acme
White Lead and Color Fellowship, held
this year by Mr. Brock. This year's prob-
lem is the effect of driers on the life of
paints and varnishes. Mr. Zimmerman is
also working under Prof. Ware on a prob-
lem involved in certain gums used in var-
nish manufacture.
Prof. A. E. White has a large number of
research problems under way. All the fol-
lowing men are working under his direc-
tion; Mr. Archer, holder of the Edison
fellowship, is studying the effect of various
factors on the malleabilization of iron. Mr.
H. J. Smith, holder of the Detroit Copper
and Brass Rolling Mills fellowship, is
working on various problems, especially
design of ladles, for handling brass in
large furnaces. It has been customary to
melt brass in crucibles; but since the war
graphite for crucible manufacture has been
unobtainable, hence the necessity for
handling brass in furnaces of entirely dif-
ferent design. Mr. Young, holder of the
Detroit Steel Castings fellowship, is in-
terested in the cause of failure of cast steel
carbonizing boxes and lead pots. These
pieces often exhibit very erratic behavior as
far as length of service is concerned, and
it is desirable to find the cause of this.
Mr. Harold Wood, who held the Detroit
Edison fellowship last year, succeeded in
demonstrating the relation between the time
of annealing and the temperature of an-
nealing on grain growth in steel. This
grain growth results in great brittleness and
an exact knowledge of the conditions under
which it takes place is of importance. Mr.
Robinson is studying the relation of me-
chanical deformation of the section involved
to this growth, and Mr. Bretsch, Mr. Dig-
nan, and Mr. Leo are working on other
phases of the same problem. Mr. Blecki
and Mr. Nethaway are applying the same
inquiries to brass. Mr. Carrite is interested
in the reasons for the development of brit-
tle and porous metal when aluminum is
remelted several times. Mr. Burleigh is
studying the effect of temperature on the
flotation process, a recent development of


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
great importance in the concentration of
ores.
Prof. Badger is continuing his work on
metallic calcium. The general problem is
that of finding uses for this little-known
metal. It has some peculiar chemical prop-
erties, but the application of these prop-
erties has never received much attention.
The work is along two lines. One, the
possible use of the metal in some process
which shall lead to the fixation of nitro-
genas ammonia, is being studied by Mr.
Shepard, Teaching Assistant in Gas analy-
sis. The other line is the use of the metal
for a deoxidizer in copper, brass, or alum-
inum casting. Possibly some alloys may be
found which will have some useful com-
binations of properties, such as, perhaps,
toughness with very low specific gravity.
This phase of the problem is being worked
out by Mr. C. G. Smith.
Prof. Rue's work in connection with
paper is reviewed elsewhere in this issue.
Dr. Laird has charge of the work in Cera-
mics, and has already done some promising
work on the artificial development of plas-
ticity in clays. This work is being con-
tinued under him by Mr. Wright. With
him are also Mr. Breitung, who is working
on the question of retarders for gypsum
plasters; and Mr. Scholl, who is trying to
make opaque colored glass.
Mr. Upthegrove, who came this fall from
the Detroit Copper and Brass Rolling Mills
to take the new Instructorship, is taking up
the general subject of deoxiders for brass.
It seems to be impossible to cast brass (or
any other metal, strictly speaking) which
shall be absolutely free from blowholes
and be entirely continuous. This problem
is particularly difficult in the case of brass,
and is the cause of many defects in fin-
ished brass goods. This work is connected
with Prof. Badger's on the one hand, and
with the work of the Detroit Copper and
Brass fellowship on the other. Mr. Joseph
is assisting in certain phases of this work.
Mr. Upthegrove is especially interested in
this problem because of his connection with
the above company and hopes to carry out
factory scale experiments in the course of
the work.
MECHANICAL LABORATORY.
Tests in the Mechanical Laboratory to De-
termine the Heat Loss from a Steam Pipe
Buried Underground.
Mr. Warrick, Teaching Assistant in the
Mechanical Laboratory, with the assistance
of Mr. C. A. Beery, in the M. E. 22 course,
is taking up this investigation again this
semester. The general plan of testing is
to measure the weight of steam condensed,
and from this, to determine the heat loss.
The condensed steam is collected in a sep-
arator and is drawn down to a minimum
level and weighed at frequent intervals by
opening a drain valve. This requires con-
tinuous attention on the part of an investi-
gator. Since tests, to be of any value. «n
this kind of work, must extend over an
interval of many days, the above method
of disposing of the condensate requires a
great amount of time.
In order to eliminate the element of so
much personal attention, some form of au-
tomatic trap will have to be devised. With
such a device in operation, the whole ap-
paratus may be made practically automatic
in operation, requiring attention only a few
times a day. Tests may then extend over
any period desired.
In the meantime, steam has been turned
into the pipe and electric resistance ther-
mometers placed at different distances from
the pipe. As soon as the ground becomes
saturated with heat, so to speak, a test will
be commenced.
Tests in the Mechanical Laboratory to De-
termine the Coefficient of Friction of
Steam Flowing in Pipes.
This work is being continued from last
year, by Messrs. E. W. Brousseau and R.
H. Lawson, in the M. E. 22 course. Some
tests have been made to check the results
obtained last year. Further tests have been
to determine the friction of 900 ells and
at the present time the friction introduced
by globe valves.
All the work done so far has been with
l'/i" pipe. As soon as the tests on the
valves have been finished, the 1%" test
pipe will be replaced by a larger size and
a similar series of tests will be run on it.


279
Messrs. H. H. Parks and C. T. Perkins,
of the M. E. 22 class, have undertaken an
investigation in the Mechanical Laboratory
to determine something about the efficiency
of automobile radiator fans. It is pro-
posed to investigate different types of fans,
measuring the power required to operate
them and the quantity of air handled. The
apparatus for the work is now nearly com-
plete and the tests will be commenced in
a short time.
HYDRAULICS.
A thorough study has just been begun in
the Huron River Valley with a view to the
determination of the relation between pre-
cipitation and run-off. Twelve standard
rain gages have been obtained from the
U. S. Weather Bureau. These have been
installed at points approximately nine miles
apart throughout the valley of the Huron
River. At each of these stations con-
tinuous records of precipitation and weekl)
records of the elevation of the ground
water level will be obtained covering a
period of about two years. Also continuous
records of discharge of the river will be
obtained at Ann Arbor.
With these factors known an attempt
will be made to correlate precipitation and
run-off, using the ground water as a con-
necting link, proper correction being made,
of course, for vegetatian and evaporation
losses. If any method of determining this
relation can be discovered its reliability
can easily be tested out inasmuch as both
precipitation and run-off records for the
Huron River are available covering a long
period of years. It is confidently expected
that if a method can be developed that will
give good results on the Huron River with
its numerous lakes and springs and widely
varying conditions of soil and geological
formation, at least equally good results
should be obtained on any other stream.
The Detroit Edison Company is financing
the investigation. Mr. G. E. Lewis, Engi-
neer of Water Power Plants for the same
Company and Mr. C. O. Wisler, instructor
in Civil Engineering, have installed the
gages.
The Engineering Society's recent house
to house campaign and the formation of
a new chemical branch brought into the
society an additional two hundred members,
making the total membership six hundred
and fifty.
The society rooms have had the appear-
ance during the past month, of a tailoring
establishment, as all the corduroy trousers
have been measured and distributed there.
The society's first membership dance was
held at the Union on Friday night, Decem-
ber 1st, with Ike Fisher's Banjorine-Saxo-
phone Sextet providing the music. It was
an engineer's dance from start to finish,
with everything there but the corduroy
pants and slide rules. The fellows must
have spoken early as they had a corner on
nil the fairest co-eds.
A. I. E. E.
On the evening of October 25th, Prof. J.
C. Parker, head of the Electrical Engineer-
ing, spoke to Senior and Junior Electri-
cals on " What the Student Branch of the
American Institute of Electrical Engineers
means to a Student of Electrical Engineer-
ing." He pointed out that the greatest bene-
fit was derived not from the facts that the
A. I. E. E. is the recognized leading society
of the electrical industry in this country,
and that among its eight thousand members
are numbered most of the leading engi-
neers, but by each member contributing his
share in extending the standards of the
electrical engineer.
Wednesday evening, November 15, Prof.
J. W. Langley, Ph. D.. consulting metal-
lurgist for several of the steel industries in
and around Pittsburgh, spoke on the "Com-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
position and Properties of Steel for Elec-
trical Uses." Special charts were drawn by
the speaker for the occasion. Professor
Langley emphasized the necessity of the
analysis of steel as a specification require-
ment in electrical manufacturing, and that
the manufacturer should be required to
submit the B and H curves of the steel.
Professors A. E. White, of the Chemical
Engineering Department, and B. F. Bailey,
of the Electrical Engineering Department,
opened the discussion in which several of
the students took part.

The A. S. M. E. branch of the Engineer-
ing Society held a smoker recently, at which
Chairman Art Hecker outlined the advant-
ages and plans of the branch, and Profes-
sors Zowski and Verner were the speakers
of the evening. There were plenty of
smokes, cider and doughnuts, and about
sixty mechanicals turned out to enjoy.
Civil Branch.
The Civil Branch held its first meeting
recently to prepare plans for the coming
year.

H. S. TAYLOR, REPORTER.
The first meeting of the class of '17E
was held in room 348 of the Engineering
Building and served to introduce the new
president, Art Hecker, to the class in a
formal way. The time was devoted entirely
to the transaction of business.
Prof. Riggs, as chairman of the assembly
committee, urged on the class the import-
ance of attendance and outlined the general
policy of former classes in the conduct of
their assemblies.
At each succeeding assembly there is to
be a representative speaker in each of the
branches of engineering.
Harold Winchell introduced the corduroy
pant proposition and Don Smith gave an
entertaining and convincing argument in
favor of its adoption. After a lively discus-
sion the class resolved to adopt cordurny
pants as the official insignia of the senior
engineering class of 1917. This custom is
in vogue at Cornell, Dartmouth, Princeton.
I.eland Stanford, University of Wisconsin,
California, and many others. A committee
was appointed to handle the matter and the
meeting adjourned.
The next meeting of the class was desig-
nated as the time for the first official appear-
ance on the campus of the senior engineers
and their chamois colored corduroys. More
than two hundred pairs of corduroys ap-
peared in the assembly.
A short time was devoted to business.
The treasurer reported the finances of the
class in good shape. The social committee
announced a smoker and dance for the near
future. President Hecker announced his
various committeemen and then the speaker
of the day, Mr. C. F. Hirschfeldt, of the
Detroit Edison Co., was introduced. Mr.
Hirschfeldt is a former Cornell professor.
1918
H. O. TRERICE, REPORTER.
The first class meeting of the year was
held on October 19, 1916, and was crowded
with business from beginning to end. It
was without a doubt the liveliest and best
attended class meeting that the class of
'18 has ever held. Waldo F. McKee, the
retiring president, introduced Prof. John-
ston, of the surveying department, who will
have charge of the assemblies of the class
for the year. Prof. Johnston in his brief
talk, urged that the class attend all as-
semblies in order that a fair representation
might be present when important business
is transacted. He also urged that the stu-
dents make some use of their mentors.
Prof. Johnston is a man who interested the
class and they believe themselves fortu-
nate in having him as a mentor for the
whole class.


281
During the meeting some enterprising
classman suggested that the class have a
class directory. It took about two minutes
to put through a motion and then a com-
mittee was appointed, consisting of the
following men: Byron E. Breckenridge,
chairman; Arvin E. Clark and Karl Bintz.
These men will be depended upon to pro-
duce the class directory.
The Class Election.
As usual, Miss Dorothy Hall was unani-
mously nominated and elected class secre-
tary. She seems to have a corner on that
job and one would stand about as much
chance of beating her out of it as he would
of defeating Johnson in California. The
class certainly believes in letting well
enough alone.
One surprising feature of the meeting was
that about half of the men nominated for
office were not present, and when these men
were called for no reason was offered by
anyone for their absence.
"Tobie" Taylor, student council man in
charge of the election, stated in an inter-
view after it was all over, that he was great-
ly surprised at the large number of men
who were ineligible to hold a class office.
Nearly half of the men nominated found it
necessary to withdraw their name because
of scholastic difficulties. He said that he
wondered if this was a characteristic of the
junior class or if they considered the elec-
tion not as seriously as they should.
Waldo McKee is in charge of the social
activities of the class for this year, and they
are expecting Mr. McKee to give them
something worth while in the line of dances,
smokers, etc. They have already held one
smoker, which was certainly up to form,
and are now waiting for the first dance.
The class president, Mr. S. S. Atwood,
is also the student council representative,
and if there is anything that the class would
like to have that body act upon, it should
let Mr. Atwood know about it. The student
council meetings are open to the students
and are held every Thursday evening in
the north wing of University Hall.
1919.
A. G. PICKARD, REPORTER.
The first assembly of the class was held
October 19th. Many failed to see the an-
nouncement and consequently there was a
small attendance. Class officers were nom-
inated and the following Tuesday afternoon
set for election day.
The second meeting was held November
16th. A class assessment of fifty cents per
member was made. President Smith ap-
pointed F. S. Sanders chairman of the
social committee. After the business meet-
ing the class enjoyed a talk by Professor
Brumm, of the Literary College.
1920.
A. E. DYMENT, REPORTER.
The freshmen engineers meet.in assembly
every Wednesday at eleven o'clock, iu
room 348 of the Engineering Building.
Stanley Lowe was elected class president.
Other officers, viz: vice-president, secre-
tary, treasurer and managers for the vari-
ous athletic branches, were elected.
At the second meeting of the class the
constitution was read and adopted. An
assessment of fifty cents was levied on
each member of the class. The class has
been proportioned off into groups of eight,
each with a group representative, whose
duty it is to attend the group representative
meetings which are held once a month, and
to collect the class dues from his group.
At the first group representative meeting
a smoker to be held at the Union December
1st, was arranged for.
The 1919 Engineers have every reason to
be proud of their fine class spirit. Over 175
of the boys turned out to the smoker held
at the Union November 21st. Prof. J. R.
Allen was the principal speaker of the even-
ing, and a talk was also given by "Maurie"
Dunne, our great left end. While the boys
were refreshing themselves with cider and
"sinkers," the Aeolian Trio, consisting of
Messrs. Howe, Ingham, and Wilson, fur-
nished the music. The fun started at 7:30
and lasted until 9:30.


The Architectural Society Dinner.
The Architectural Society held, upon the
evening of November 10, its initial function
of the year—a dinner at the Cafe Delta.
It will not be far wrong to say that this
was one of the best get-together meetings
that the society has had in some time, and
very probably, the "best ever" since the
genesis of the organization.
The speaker of the evening was Prof.
John Beverly Robinson, late of the Uni-
versity of Washington, St. Louis, who is
probably most generally known through his
book on architectural proportion, a work
that has been very widely read and greatly
appreciated by the members of the archi-
tectural world. His talk was thoroughly
enjoyed by all present. In his quiet, easy
manner he told of the times when archi-
tecture as a profession had not yet attained
the general recognition which it has now
come to enjoy—of the times when the pro-
fession was just beginning to make a place
for itself in America, a period at which an
architectural education was not as easy to
obtain as at present, since almost every uni-
versity of any importance has included the
study of architecture as a branch of its
educational system. He spoke in great
praise and appreciation of the work of Prof.
Ware. In the course of his talk he also
gave a view of the life in the architectural
department of Washington University. It
is in talks such as his that the student finds
inspiration.
Prof. Lorch also gave a short talk which
was well received.
A few remarks were made by J. D. Ken-
yon bringing to notice the possibilities
awaiting the society in a social way. Sev-
eral suggestions were made for entertain-
ments that would prove helpful in con-
tinuing the work of putting new life into
the society which the dinner had so ad-
mirably started.
A few musical selections were rendered
by a string quartette of the following per-
sonnel:
Robert Frantz, piano, Chas. Rose, ukulele.
Paul Kamper, first mandolin, and Rodger
Morrow, second mandolin.
Toastmaster Gilbert Stanley Underwood
outlined in a general way the work to be
done to "resurrect the society from a pre-
mature grave." It meant that every mem-
ber of the department must do his share,
great or small, in furthering the growth of
the organization, he said, in order that it
might be placed upon the firm foundation
which it rightfully deserved. It is planned
to bring exhibits here through the society,
and by every available means to make it a
real factor in the life of the department in-
stead of a mvth.
Lectures.
Thomas H. Mawson, Hon. A. R. I. B. A.,
lecturer on landscape design to the Uni-
versity of Liverpool, spoke at Memorial
Hall, on the evening of Thursday, Xovem-


283
ber 16. His subject was "Making of a
Home" or "Unity of House and Garden."
Upon the afternoon of Friday, November
17, a second lecture was given by Mr.
Mawson on "Athens: Past, Present, and
Future." In a very interesting talk accom-
panied by excellent lantern slides, he ren-
dered a graphic account of plans now under
way for the re-planning of the ancient city
of Athens. The project promises to be on
a very large scale, and when completed, the
city cannot fail to become a Mecca for
beauty seekers. The undertaking includes
the razing of the large number of unsightly
structures at present surrounding the Acro-
polis. For these will be substituted beau-
tiful boulevards and naturalistic groups of
planting made up of trees and shrubs native
to that vicinity. If all is carried out as out-
lined by Mr. Mawson, the tourist of the
future will be able to view the monuments
of the ancient city with a much greater
feeling of satisfaction and appreciation than
is possible under present conditions.

ALUMXUS INVESTIGATES DE-
TROIT'S WATER SUPPLY.
A report for the City of Detroit on Sew-
age Disposal has recently been published by
Clarence W. Hubbell, '93E, consulting engi-
neer, of Detroit. The pollution of the Oc-
curence W. Hlbheli., '93E
troit river is subject to the provisions of
the Waterways treaty of 1909 between the
United States and Great Britain in which it
is agreed that boundary waters shall not be
polluted on either side to the injury of
health or property of the other.
Complaints were made some time ago
which resulted in an investigation by an
International Joint Commission which de-
termined that among other boundary waters,
the Detroit river was grossly polluted.
The City of Detroit being the chief of-
fender, felt that it ought to know the facts
in the case. Mr. Hubbell was therefore em-
ployed by the city and the three following
problems were submitted to him.
1. That a review be made of the data
and conclusions of the International Joint
Commission for the purpose of enlarging
on any phase of the matter that might be
necessary in order to determine what pre-
ventive or remedial measures are required
with reference to Canadian waters.
2. To what extent does the City of De-
troit's sewage pollute American waters so
as to render them unfit as a source of raw
water supply for filtration purposes?
3. By what means, if any, should the
City of Detroit undertake to purify the
sewage, and what expense would be justifi-
able for that purpose?


285
Reply to First Problem.
In specific reply to the first problem,—
1. From a study of the report and find-
ings of the International Joint Commission
and of the additional data collected in the
course of this investigation, it is evident
that pollution may, and at times undoubted-
ly does, cross the boundary line from either
side in such degree as to render the waters
on the other unsafe for drinking or do-
mestic uses without some sort of treat-
ment or purification.
2. The pollution crossing the boundary
line from either side has not yet reached
such a degree as to render the waters on
the other unfit as a source of raw water
supply for a water purification plant. This
conclusion is based on the reasonableness
of the 500 Bacillus Coli per 100 c. c. limit
and on the tests made on all samples of
water collected at or near the center line
of the main channel of the Detroit River.
3. The unpreventable and inevitable pol-
lution from surface drainage, street wash
and other incidental sources is of such
degree and character that even the treat-
ment of all sanitary sewage entering the
river on both sides of the boundary and
the complete sterilization of all pollution
from vessels would not obviate the neces-
sity for purification of Detroit River water
used for drinking and domestic purposes.
4. It therefore follows that preventive
or remedial measures required with refer-
ence to pollution crossing the boundary line
from either side should logically be limited
to such sewage treatment as may be neces-
sary to prevent an undue burden being
placed on any water purification plant hav-
ing an intake suitably located in the best
raw water obtainable within a reasonable
distance from the plant. In our judgment
such results can best be insured for all
future conditions likely to occur, by sterili-
zation of all sewage discharged from ves-
sels, and by eventually collecting all urban
sanitary sewage at convenient points where
it may be treated either by means of fine
screens or settling tanks, followed by ster-
ilization.
Detroit should anticipate such a system
for other reasons than that of preventing
pollution from crossing the boundary line.
Reply to Second Problem.
In specific reply to the second problem,
"To what extent does the City of Detroit's
sewage pollute American waters so as to
render them unfit as a source of raw water
for filtration purposes?"
1. It is difficult to separate the pollution
in American waters caused by Detroit's
sewage from that which comes from sur-
face wash and from the sewage of other
cities and villages both above and below the
city of Detroit. The pollution in the De-
troit River hugs the short lines with re-
markable persistence. Adjacent to the
American shore a zone of grossly polluted
water containing from 500 to 100,000 B.
coli per 100 c.c, extends the entire length
of the river from Lake St. Clair to Lake
Erie. The pollution is greatest near the
shore and rapidly decreases toward the
outer edge of the zone. The width of this
polluted shore zone varies somewhat with
the seasons and with local weather condi-
tions. Opposite Detroit, from Belle Isle to
Fighting Island, it occupies approximately
one-third of the width of the river and
varies from 900 to 1,400 feet in width. Be-
low a point opposite the head of Fighting
Island it gradually widens, entirely sur-
rounding Grosse Isle, Elba, Sugar, Hickory
and Celeron Islands. Below Grosse Isle it
extends practically to the edge of the Liv-
ingstone Channel. At any point in this
zone the pollution is such as to render the
water unfit as a source of raw water for
filtration purposes. The pollution extends
into Lake Erie for 20 or 30 miles in gradu-
ally decreasing intensity, until it finally dis-
appears or becomes negligible, due to sedi-
mentation and the efficient purification pro-
cesses of nature.
2. The public water supplies most af-
fected are those of Ford, Wyandotte, Tren-
ton and Monroe. The pollution reaching
Monroe from Detroit's sewage may at times
reach 1,000 B. Coli per 100 c.c. but the
sewage pollution from this source is not
such as to render the raw water unsuitable
for filtration purposes. Ford and Wyan-
dotte can obtain a water suitable for filtra-
tion by extending an intake about 3,000 feet
into the river. Trenton cannot obtain a


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
suitable supply within reasonable distance
or cost, but could do so were Detroit's
sewage treated as recommended in this re-
port. It would be cheaper for the towns
of Ford, Wyandotte and Trenton to obtain
a filtered supply taken directly from the
river than for them to buy the water from
Detroit. The difference in favor of the
filtration idea is estimated as approximately
$225,000.
3. Treatment of sewage would afford a
measure of protection to numerous private
users of water and would greatly improve
the conditions surrounding the summer
homes, pleasure resorts and bathing beaches
patronized by thousands of Detroit's citi-
zens during the summer months. The re-
moval of solids and objectional floating
matter from the sewage would improve the
appearance of the entire river along De-
troit's water front, and would in a measure
restore cleanly conditions.
4. Under ordinary conditions, Detroit's
sewage does not reach the intake crib of
the Detroit water works. However, it is
not at all certain that it may not do so
under extraordinary conditions. On Feb. 5,
1909, strong easterly winds raised the level
of the westerly end of Lake Erie above the
level of Lake St. Clair, and for a period
of over seven hours the slope of the river
was backward. During this period the flow
of the river was undoubtedly reversed, al-
though the velocity of the current could not
have been great. Similar conditions oc-
curred on Jan. 31, 1914, when back flow
probably took place for four or five hours.
Back flow in the river may be expected at
irregular intervals of about four to five
years. Back flow is most likely to occur
when there are ice gorges in the St. Clair
River, and these conditions must be ac-
companied by a strong easterly wind on
Lake Erie.
Reply to Third Problem.
The third problem may be divided into
two parts: (1) By what means, if any,
should the City of Detroit undertake to
purify its sewage, and (2) What expense
would be justified for that purpose?
In specific reply to the first part of the
problem,—
1. Oxidation methods are not required
for Detroit conditions on account of the
large dilution available in the Detroit River.
This eliminates the necessity for contact
bed, sprinkling filter, sand filter, activated
sludge, or other expensive methods of treat-
ment for the oxidation of solids in solution,
colloidal matter, or solids in finely divided
and suspended form.
2. The removal of oil, grease, faeces and
other floating matter obnoxious to sight is
desirable, and the removal of most of the
settleable solids in suspension should also
be accomplished in any method of treatment
adopted.
3. The most important requirement in
the treatment of Detroit sewage is the re-
moval of pathogenic or disease producing
organisms. Studies indicate that a re-
moval of from 90 to 95 per cent of the total
bacteria in the sewage will be necesssary to
reduct the pollution in the river below De-
troit to a standard of 500 B. coli per 100
cubic centimeters for average conditions.
This can best be done by the use of a dis-
infectant, such as hypochlorite of lime.
4. Several general projects of sewage
treatment have been considered and it is
recommended that treatment by sedimenta-
tion combined with disinfection be adopted.
This project would consist of a treatment
works at Fort Wayne and Fairview on the
river front and a future plant on Connors
Creek, consisting of Imhoff tanks combined
with disinfection. Sludge would be dis-
posed of for filling in low lands or it would
be dried and sold for use as a fertilizer
filler.
5. Although more expensive in first cost,
this plan appears to be the most desirable,
and considering the annual cost for fixed
charges and for operation and maintenance,
it is also the most economical. The first
cost of a complete installation adequate for
a population of 950,000, comprising works
at Fort Wayne and at Fairview, together
with the necessary systems of collecting
sewers, is estimated at $6,091,060. The total
annual charge, including interest at 4^2%,
amortization, operating costs and mainte-
nance, is estimated at $517,430, or 54.5 cents
per capita.


287
6. In regard to the second part of the
problem as to what expense would be
justified for sewage treatment, it is diffi-
cult to formulate an answer in terms of
money alone. However, it is believed that,
aside from the international features of the
problem, the combined benefits which would
accrue from a more cleanly water front,
purer water at the bathing beaches and
summer playgrounds; reduction in typhoid
and other water borne diseases due to the
use of sewage laden water along the river
front; betterment of raw water supplies
for the municipalities below the city, and
the protection of Detroit's water supply
from gross sewage pollution at times when
the Detroit River flows backward; amply
justify the expenditure required for sew-
age treatment works as above outlined. In
round figures, the cost would be about
$6,000,000, and in the judgment of Mr. Hub-
bell this expenditure would be justifiable.
The matter is now awaiting the action of
the Common Council of the City of Detroit.
ENGINEERS ORGANIZE AT PITTS-
BURG.
The Michigan Engineers' Club of Pitts-
burg was formed last summer in a meeting
at which a large percentage of Michigan
engineering graduates living in the Pitts-
burg district attended. This club is pro-
moting good fellowship among our boys
and is influential in getting the new gradu-
ates who come to Pittsburg acquainted. We
heartily commend their purpose. Each year
several graduates go to the various plants
in Pittsburg which bear the name of West-
inghouse, to the Pittsburg-DesMoines Steel
Company and many others. To these men
as well as to the older graduates, periodical
get-togethers in an atmosphere of Michigan
spirit should prove to be very pleasant and
profitable occasions.
The club is carrying on a campaign to
induce the Regents to allow the publica-
tion of the complete register of alumni in
the Engineering College Announcement to
be continued and it is hoped that other
engineers will use their influence to the
same end.
The officers of the club are, Richard
Kheun, Jr.. '89E, president; Daniel C.
Walser, '10E, treasurer; and Howard C.
Wickes, '14E, secretary. Address, 801 Curry
Bldg., Pittsburg, Pa.
ALUMNI AND THE UNION.
The contract for the basement of the
new Michigan Union building has been let
to Hauser, Owen &amp; Ames Co., of Grand
Rapids, and the work is now well under
way. George M. Ames, '85E, and Dan W.
Kimball, '05E, are members of the firm.
Harry J. Palmer, '07E, has been engaged
by the building committee of the Union to
act as Master of Construction. The Col-
lege of Engineering is represented on the
building committee by Prof. Joseph A.
Bursley, '99E, chairman. Gardner S. Wil-
liams, '88E, former professor of civil engi-
neering, is also a member of this com-
mittee. With these men at work, we be-
lieve the completed building will come up
to all expectations.
YEA, TEAM!
A delegation of graduates of the Engi-
neering college from the Ingersoll-Rand
plant at Painted Post, N. Y., attended the
Cornell-Michigan game at Ithaca, Novem-
ber nth. Each member of the party
showed true Michigan spirit by wearing on
his hat a post painted yellow and blue.

A recent issue of Power contains an
account of the splendid work done by Prof.
John R. Allen, of the mechanical engineer-
ing department on the Oxbow Bend power
house of the Idaho-Oregon Light and
Power Co.
The Snake river has a natural fall of 21
feet around this bend and the original
power company built a 1,300 foot delivery
tunnel through the peninsula formed by
the bend in the river. While this made a
head of about 21 feet available, it was the
plan to increase the head to 42 feet by
means of a dam and with this idea two
generators and two turbines were brought.
Before the dam was started, however, the
company was forced to go into the hands
of receivers by a rival company. Owing to
financial difficulties the receivers could not
go ahead with the building of the dam and*
likewise could not afford to discard ma-
chinery which had been designed for a 42-
foot head and buy new turbines and gen-
erators for the 21 foot head. Besides the
water rights would expire before new ma-
chinery could have been obtained.
At the head available, the speed of the
turbines was 117 r. p. in., while the gen-
erator was resigned for a speed of 225 r.
p. 111. Prof. Allen solved this difficulty by-
discarding one generator and connecting a
turbine to each end of the other generator.
This was done by means of two huge
silent chains, the sprockets being designed
with the proper ratio to run the generator
at its rated speed.
The chains are the largest in existence
and transmit approximately 2.500 h. p.
apiece. They have been tn almost constant
operation since September, 1914, and are
very satisfactory.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS
(By Mile. Mamcyellade Taurusi)
Dear Ed.: I am much puzzled by a sign
that I saw on State street. It read,
"LOVE'S CALCULUS." Can you inter-
pret it?
Answer: We've heard of love's donation,
of love's young dream and other sundry
and useful things connected with the Pla-
tonic affection, but what aid the calculus
can give in the process is quite beyond our
feeble imagination. Perhaps it is necessary
to differentiate between the fussable and the
unfussable, and to integrate your bank ac-
count after you get through.
Dear Ed.: My corduroy trousers have
one distinctive disadvantage; they are so
thick that I can't scratch myself through
them. What shall I do?—Senior.
Answer: Line them with sandpaper.
Dear Ed.: Do you think that it is good
policy for a class to make itself so dis-
tinctive, as the 'i7E's have done?—Inquisi-
tive.
Answer: Like our co-worker, The Daily,
we feel it our duty to put a stop to exces-
sive communication. Your question is a
rather frivolous one in comparison with
others we have been obliged to treat in this
issue, and therefore we cannot give it space
here.
Sold at All Good Bars—
Roomer: What is a cafe-de-luxe?
Boarder: About ten per cent cafe, and
about ninety per cent looks.
Afore Fudge-
She.: Is Michigan in Ypsilanti?
He: Yes—most of the time.
Your Point of View, of Course—
Student (in Aeronautics): Professor,
did you hear Billy Sunday? He mentioned
aerial transportation.
Professor: No, I dont waste my valu-
able time. What did he say?
Stud.: That the whiskey bunch were so
low that they would have to take aero-
planes to get to Hell.
Prof.: Ummm! 150,000 making whiskey.
Some business for us!
O Missus, it Shows—
A clergyman out walking with two beau-
tiful young women, had paused to admire
the charm of woodland brook. A young lad
approaching took him for a fisherman and
inquired, "Having any luck?''
"My boy," profoundly replied the clergy-
man, "I am a fisher of men."
"Well," said the boy, taking in the girls
at a glance, "you certainly have the right
kind of bait."


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
And Her Name Was Mud—
"I have just invested in a sound propo-
sition."
"Fine; what was it?"
"Phonograph."
Pass the Mustard—
Passenger (on a Mississippi steamboat):
Why is it that you always stop to blow the
whistle?
Deckhand: Case of necessity, sor. We've
a ten-horse-po'er biler an' a ten horse-
po'er whistle.
Skipts Tops—
Frosh: Our landlady has a slide rule.
Junior: So,—what use can she have for
it?
Frosh: She aims to prevent descent via
the banister.
Well, Why Not?—
Frosh (meeting his Zoology Prof, in the
woods): What are you doing, professor?
Prof.: Looking for the traces of my an-
cestors.
Frosh: I didn't know they wore traces.
And the Cat Came Back—
Math. Prof, (finishing a long proof):
And now, gentlemen, we have X equal to O.
From Behind the Tan Shoes: My word,
all that work for nothing.
LATEST DEFINITIONS
A Pessimist: One who fletcherizes his
quinine pills.
An Optimist: One who, although blind,
thanks God he isn't bowlegged.
Accuracy—
Prof, (erasing the evidence of a vain
endeavor to prove a proposition in Me-
chanics): I made a bally ass of myself.
Occupant of the Rear Seat: Checkl
SAD, BUT TRUE
The hen that cackles loudest may not lay
the largest eggs;
The mule that kicks the hardest may not
have the longest legs;
The tree that is the tallest may not bear
the sweetest fruit,
And the girl that is fairest may not wear
the smallest boot.
The man whose brow is highest may not
always know the most;
The hero who is bravest may not make the
loudest boast;
The arm that is the strongest may not have
the farthest reach,
And the man who talks the longest may not
make the finest speech.
The rose that is the reddest may not have
the sweetest scent;
The man whose strut is proudest may not
be most prominent;
The woman who has jewels that she can
measure by the peck,
May not have the slimmest fingers or the
most delightful neck.
The man who works the hardest may not
not draw the highest pay;
The one with deepest knowledge may not
have the most to say;
But the man who is most modest gets the
last seat in the rear,
And the one who blows his bugle is the
one whom people hear.
Over the Fence is Out—
Pat, a cavalry recruit, had just been
thrown from his spirited mount.
"Didn't I tell you not to dismount with-
out orders?" shouted the irate captain,
rushing up to Pat as he hastily scrambled
to his feet.
"And orders Oi had sir," said Pat, with
a snap in his eye.
"From headquarters, I suppose," said the
officer sarcastically.
"No, begorra," retorted Pat, "from hind-
quarters."
For Wisawks—
Exx.: What is mineral soap?
Wyy.: Castile.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Prof, (in French class, after hearing a
second-rate bluff): Have you been over
your lesson, sir?
Frosh: Yes, sir.
Prof.: At what altitude?
He: I went to a wooden wedding the
other day.
She: Really?
He: Yes; two Poles were married.
Jenks: There are hard times coming for
this country. One paper predicts that all
the banks will close four months after
Wilson is inaugurated.
Jinks: You don't say. How do they
arrive at that conclusion?
Jenks: Yes. That will be July 4th.
Lit.: I see by The Daily that a work-
man was electrocuted in the bakery down
town.
Electrical: So.—he got the juice, eh?
Lit.: Why, he stepped on a cookie with
a current in it.
Bochepoilu—
Iky (to box office manager): Do I have
to pay for my little Iky?
B. O. M.: Yes, sir.
Iky: Oh, Meester, just let him go in
with me; I promise he won't look.
Pat: Can't my little girl go in on half
fare? She's only got one eye and can only
see half the show.
B. O. M.: No; she will have to pay
twice as much—takes her twice as long to
see it.
"Bein" Pulling—
An English militant crusader strolled in-
to a barn where a young man was milking
a cow. With a snort she asked, "How is it
that you are not at the front, young man?"
"Because, ma'am," answered the milker,
"There ain't no milk at that end."
O. B.:
ribly.
N. G.
open.
They say that Oakum snores hor-
Yes, he sleeps with his cut-out
Corduroys Got 'cm Whistling—
"Why call me the consumer?" questioned
the guy who pays the bills. "All I do is
produce."
What Did Mother Mean?—
"Gladys,"' said her mother, "you stood
on the porch quite a while with that young
man last night."
"Why, mother," replied Gladys, "I only
stood there for a second."
"Yes," said mother, "but I'm sure I heard
the third and fourth."
WANTED—A JOB
"What line did you say you were in?"
"I manufacture a face powder that can't
be kissed off.''
"Who has charge of your testing
grounds?"
Jugged-
Judge: You can take your choice, ten
dollars or ten days.
Prisoner (still in a foggy condition):
I'll take (hie) the money, y'r Honor.
Time hung heavy on his hands all right.
How's sat?
He wore an Ingcrsoll wrist watch.
Her (at the piano)—Do you like Bach?
Ilim (somewhere else)—If it's in season.
"Sir, your daughter has promised to be-
come my wife."
"Well, don't come to me for sympathy;
you might know something would happen
to you, hanging around here five nights a
week."

NIPPLE JOINTS cut by machin-
ery designed and built by ma-
chinery experts for the factories
of this Company.
PUSH NIPPLE JOINTS require
no packing or gaskets of rubber,
asbestos or manila paper to
cushion the contact of the sec-
tions or keep the joints tight.
PUSH NIPPLE JOINTS do not
have to rust tight—they are tight
when they leave our factories,
and stay tight—permanently
tight.

"STROH PROCESS"
The Stroh Process is a method of applying Stroh Alloy, the
greatest wear resistant known, to such surfaces only of
carbon steel castings as will be subjected to severe wear:
thus combining in one integral casting the wear resisting
qualities of alloy steel and the resilience and machinability
of soft steel. It is particularly adapted for heavy duty
gears and pinions, wearing parts for cement mill machinery,
gearing, spindles, coupling boxes, etc., for rolling mill
equipment, mine car and crane track wheels, and street
railway special work.

The Wickes Vertical Water-Tube Boiler
Very high thermal efficiency is obtained'from this boiler and
setting, because:—
ist—High furnace temperature results from Dutch oven.
2nd—Gases entirely surround and closely scrub heating sur-
face from entrance to release.
3rd—The gases cannot leave the heating surface. There is
no possible chance for short-circuiting.
4th—Boiler heating surface absorbs the heat—empty pockets
in setting lose heat. There are no empty pockets in this
boiler.
5th—The steel-cased settings are always tight. No cracked,
warped, leaky, defective and unsightly settings exist with
this setting.
6th—A steel-cased setting is a simple and sure cure for air
infiltration losses. The largest preventable losses we have
to contend with in boiler efficiency are excess air losses.
7th—A very long gas travel—hence long contact with heating
surface fs provided—hence heat absorption is assured.
The "WICKES" boilers are boilers that engineers and
business men are, more and more, not merely thinking about
and considering—but, Purchasing—for good and profitable
reasons!
Let us send you intensely vital reasons and facts—they will
interest you.

"Square D" Steel Enclosed Switches
Safeguard Operators of
Electrically Driven Machinery
A recognized important factor in industrial accident preven-
tion is the enclosing of all live current-carrying parts used in the
transmission of electric power and lighting.
Complete accident prevention is being daily demonstrated as good
factory practice, increasing the efficiency of employees and producing
maximum output.
The trained and valuable employee who as a rule operates expensive
machinery should be protected from the accident hazards of the open knife
electrical switch—a "Square D" Steel Enclosed Switch gives fullest protec-
tion and reduces the "human" equation in industrial accidents of this kind
to a minimum.
The "Square D" Steel Enclosed Switch is enclosed in a sheet-steel box
and operates from the outside by a crank handle, insuring an employee
positive safety from accidental contact with live parts of the switch. The
switch may be "locked off," preventing current from being "thrown on"
accidentally.
Industrial safety is a big problem—the
most prominent engineers are giving
their time and thought to the advance-
ment of Safety First principles. Send
for Bulletin 37 on "Square D" Steel
Enclosed Switches—it's full of practical
information.
