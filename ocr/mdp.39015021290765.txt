the Industries of the State
MANUFACTURING errors
are costly because under
quantity production methods they
are often duplicated thousands of
times before discovery.
Adequate research facilities, such
as those provided by the Depart-
ment of Engineering Research of
the University of Michigan, may
be the means of saving your own
business from expensive and avoid'
able mistakes.
A few*-, hundred dollars spent on
investigation, aided by the splen-

the University, may return its cost
a hundred-fold.
The Department of Engineering
Research does not compete with
commercial laboratories. It is
operated as a genuine helpful
service to Michigan industries.
The University places at the dis-
posal of interested companies and
individuals: The services of trained
workers, special laboratories, com-
plete testing equipment and ex-
ceptional library facilities.
Actual cost of labor and material
plus a nominal service fee, con-
stitutes the only charge. The
University undertakes only such
problems as require fundamental
research and give promise of defin-
ite solution.

Does Business Want Scholars?
By Walter S. Gifford
President of the American Telephone and Telegraph Co.
THE other day a gentleman said to a New York
friend of his who is a lawyer, "My son is go-
ing to graduate from the law school this year
and is looking around for a place. Could I send him
to see you?"
The lawyer replied, "Certain-
ly, I'd be glad to see him," but
there was no great enthusiasm
in his tone.
The father continued, "He is
on the Law Review, and sever-
al offices have spoken to him;
but if you will tell me who
in your office sees . . . ." He
got no farther. "You send him
right in to see me," answered
the lawyer. "I'd like to talk to
him."
The change had come over
the lawyer when the father
said, "He is on the Law Re-
view." That means he is a high-
mark man.
The big law firms seek the
high-mark men from the law-
schools. The profession be-
lieves that the man who stands
well in his law studies will
make a better lawyer than one who does not.
The hospitals take the same attitude toward med-
ical students. A man with low marks in the medical
school is not likely to get an appointment in the best
hospitals, for it is the experience of the medical pro-
fession that those who stand well in the professional
WALTER S. GIFFORD
school are most likely to stand well in their profes-
sion later on.
But business, on the other hand, does not as a
rule select men on the basis of their marks in col-
lege. Perhaps for this reason the undergraduate
who intends to go into busi-
ness does not always consider
his scholastic standing in re-
lation to his business career.
He is somewhat apt to think
of his college course as an era
in itself, without influence on
his life after graduation. If he
does connect his college course
with a business future at all, he
is likely to think that his ath-
letic or social activities, his
work on college papers or in
dramatic clubs, or similar ex-
tracurricular efforts, are better
training for the future than his
academic work. Some do the
academic work merely in order
that they may stay in college
to do the other things. And in
taking this attitude the boys
reflect fairly accurately the
opinion of many of their elders,
under whom they are going to begin their working
career.
I believe that this attitude of business toward the
scholarship of college graduates differs from the at-
titude of the legal and medical professions toward
scholarship in the graduate schools for one main

reason: Business believes that a law school teaches
a boy law but that a college does not teach a boy
business. Consequently, a boy who stands high in
the law school will possess knowledge more immedi-
ately useful than one who doesn't, while no matter
how high a boy stands in college he will not have
much, if any, knowledge immediately useful in
business.
This, of course, flies counter to the theory of the
educators. They maintain that the courses in col-
lege are so conducted that a boy who gets high
marks will have had to use his brains, and that the
habit of ability to use his brains will make him
valuable and successful in whatever he tries to do.
The legal and medical professions rather sustain this
contention, for they say that it is not so much what
the men of high standing know that makes them
valuable when they leave the professional schools,
but the fact that they have the habit of successful
mental accomplishment. The academic folk believe
that, while a knowledge of history or philosophy
may not be immeditely applicable to the shoe busi-
ness, a boy who did good work in history and phil-
osophy is more likely to do well in the shoe business
than one who did poorly in those subjects.
The educators believe that the process of educa-
tion is a continuous interrelated process beginning
early in school and ending late in life. They have
figures to prove that thojjoys who do well in school
generally do well in college, and that those who do
well in college generally rank high in the profes-
sional schools, and that those who rank high in the
professional schools generally succeed in the pro-
fessions—law, medicine, and teaching. In fact, a
high-grade man in school has much the best chance
of being a high-grade man in college, in professional
school, in practice, and all through life.
A very high percentage of the membership of the
Phi Beta Kappa Society are mentioned in Who's
Who. This does not necessarily bear directly upon
the relationship between scholarship and business,
because Who's Who is not intended as a guide to
business distinction, but it does indicate that the
high-mark men who chose the activities favored by
Who's Who gained more distinction in those activ-
ities than the low-mark man.
Phi Beta Kappa claims 40 per cent of the Justices
of the Supreme Court between 1800 and 1922, and
40 per cent of the Secretaries of State. Considering
the small numbers of the Society, that is an amazing
showing.
In 1911, President A. Lawrence Lowell of Har-
vard published an article on "College Studies and
Professional Training" which showed that men
who ranked high in their college studies were apt to
rank high in the law and medical schools and that,
in spite of exceptions, those who ranked lower in
college ranked on the average lower in the profes-
sional schools. This deduction might reasonably
make business wonder whether in preparing for
business it makes much difference what subjects are
mainly pursued in college—if these subjects, what-
ever they are, are pursued with sufficient success.
A study of the statistics he presented must make
any business man at least wonder whether, if high-
rank men are so certain to do better in the profes-
sional schools and in the professions, it might not
be that they are more likely to do better than the
average in business.
In 1917 Dr. William Trufant Foster, then Presi-
dent of Reed College, published a book under the
arresting title Should Students Study? In the chap-
ter "Success in Studies and in Life" he presents
material concerning graduates of West Point, of the
Yale School of Forestry, of an engineering school,
and of several colleges. In the case of each insti-
tution the high-scholarship men were mainly those
who attained later eminence. Doctor Foster con-
cludes, "Indeed it is likely that the first quarter in
scholarship of any school or college class will give
to the world as many distinguished men as the other
three-quarters."
Last year Professor Hugh A. Smith of the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin published the results of a test
based on eighteen hundred alumni of a large univer-
sity. These men had received their bachelor's de-
grees over a period of forty-five years, and all of
them were at least fifteen years out of college when
the study was made. As it progressed, the commit-
tee compiling the information became more and
more convinced of an almost invariable consistency
between scholarship and success in life. To quote
Professor Smith:
A few representative figures will show the reason for
these convictions. For the first two classes of fifty-four
graduates, a number of persons were asked opinions con-
cerning the career and success of the members, and eight
of these alumni were quite generally agreed on, and one
other was suggested by at least two correspondents, as the
most worthy. The college marks showed that the eight uni-
versally approved had the highest averages in the two
classes, six being over 91 and two being 89. The other one,
who won partial approval, had a mark of 85, which was no
higher than that of four or five not suggested as eminent.
From a later class of seventy-five members, a final list
was submitted to a number of people; eleven won general
approval as to their eminence in life, and five others re-
ceived two or more votes. Ten of the eleven were the first
ten in the class in grades, all averaging above 90.
These data indicate that in many fields college
scholarship is a significant index of later success.
But even they include relatively few cases of men
in business.
II
Clearly, to tell whether high scholarship has a
direct relationship to success in business, more com-
prehensive and more rigorous evidence is needed.
Business itself can most easily collect that evidence.
Furthermore, it can hardly afford not to do so. Each
year at least half of the 40,000 young men graduat-

The Development Of The Electric Arc
Welding Process*
By A. R. Allabd
Works Department, Westinghouse Electric and Mfg. Co.
IX these days of accomplishment by both science
and invention we are being surprised by startling
achievements with such regularity and frequency
as to tend to blur the perceptions to equally impor-
tant developments in equipment, processes and
methods which are the result of slowly acquired
knowledge and painstaking investigation. Our per-
ceptions are also somewhat
dulled by the regular announce-
ment of inventions or innova-
tions of a spectacular nature
which are often of greater news
or advertising value than
utility.
The slow evolutionary devel-
opment of one familiar process
has been gradually going on for
the better part of the last two
decades without attracting
more than passing notice. At
this time the evolution has at-
tained such gigantic importance
as to amount to an industrial
process revolution -— a revolu-
tion in the art of joining metals.
Those who have not been in
touch with the growth of elec-
tric arc-welding have suddenly discovered an unsus-
pected giant in their midst. During the last few
years this new-old industrial giant has attained the
prominence of front page headlines and the distinc-
tion of the pictorial section. This has not. however,
entirely convinced all the intelligent, matter-of-fact
conservatives of the superiority of the process of
arc-welding, even though it is at times described by
lurid and intriguing word pictures. This is not sur-
prising in view of the fact that many engaged in
lines directly affected by the prowess of the invad-
ing giant look upon the present accomplishments,
such as are shown in the accompanying illustrations,
merely as experiments. Nothing could be farther
from the actual fact. Arc-welding and the joining
of fabricated structures by arc-welding are here to
stay.
The fabrication of structures such as are shown
in the illustrations is not stunt welding, nor is it part
of an attempt to sell arc-welding equipment. It is

ONE of the greatest and
most far - reaching ad-
vances in present-day building
design has been brought about
by the advent of electric arc-
welding into the field of struc-
tural fabrication. The advance
of this method in the face of
adverse opinions serves as an
excellent example of the prog-
ress of engineering methods.
Mr. Allard, in his treatment of
the subject, has left little to the
imagination as regards the al-
most romantic development of
the process.—The Editor.
the result of a long period of research which has
culminated in the establishment of the fundamental
facts of the process, as well as a knowledge of the
possibilities and limitations of the process as it is
carried out today.
The growth of this knowledge of the process of
arc-welding has been slow, like the proverbial grind-
ing of the mills of the gods.
The grist produced has, how-
ever, been not unlike that pro-
duced by the mills of the gods
in that it too has been exceed-
ingly fine.
All along the line of its de-
velopment, arc-welding has
been continually under the
most critical and exacting ob-
servation and tests. It has sur-
vived the over-optimistic efforts
of its protagonists, as well as
the attacks of its antagonists.
Only worth and merit could
have survived the opposition,
unfair restraint and biased con-
demnation with which it was
continually beset at every for-
ward step of its evolutionary
growth and upward advancement.
The young industrial giant, electric arc-welding,
sits today securely enthroned as a major process in
the art of joining metals. This security is based
upon a foundation of knowledge of the fundamental
principles and laws which apply to every phase of
the process application. The giant has grown in
power only as rapidly as we have accumulated
knowledge of these fundamentals, and future growth
in power will be in direct proportion to the accumu-
lation of that knowledge. "Knowledge is power,"
and because of this, arc-welding has risen from ob-
curity to prominence and importance.
In the use of many industrial processes—and arc-
welding is no exception-—we have had to learn, as
in real life, to creep before we could walk. In its in-
fancy or creeping stage, arc-welding was first done
with the carbon arc. By means of this process sur-
face defects, which merely marred the appearance
of steel castings, could be repaired; and occasionally
two parts were joined by fusing them together.

Later developments gave the modification of this
process known as metallic arc-welding. It was the
development of this process that made the struc-
tures shown in the illustrations possible.
In the beginning any source of direct current
available was used to do welding. The facilities for
current regulation often consisting of nothing more
elaborate than a water rheostat of home manufac-
ture. In many cases the current regulation was
without a break, and the electrode manipulation
must be such that the molten filler material will be
deposited only in this molten pool or arc crater.
After the discovery of these, and a few other
principles, good arc-welds were secured when the
other conditions, such as cleanliness, correct prepa-
ration, good wire and reasonable regulation of cur-
rent, all occurred at the same time. As a result of
these better welds, confidence increased in the proc-
A MOTOR-GENERATOR BEDPLATE BUILT OF STRUCTURAL STEEL ARC WELDED
seriously interfered with by other loads on the same
line. In the light of this and other conditions known
to have existed, it would seem at this distance that
the good welds were the accidental ones.
Because of the fact that Norway iron had proven
its worth as a material for welding purposes with
other processes, and because it really did work a
little better than other filler wire material then
available, it was adopted quite generally as the right
welding wire to use in making metallic arc-welds.
After a time, and with better results than we would
predict today in the light of our increased knowl-
edge of the requirements for making a good arc-
weld, various operators of an inquiring turn of mind
began a haphazard investigation or trial of other
kinds of wire. At times very good results were ob-
tained by using cold-rolled steel, telegraph wire and
hoops from barrels. These all had their champions
who relied on them for the execution of their most
difficult welds. Line fences, which were rapidly
coming into popularity at the time, lost a lot of
their attractiveness as well as effectiveness if it be-
came known that the material could be counted on
to make a good arc-weld. Practically all the wire
available gave very uneven fusion and melted in
such a way as to deposit the filler material in large
globules.
The subject of fusion in arc-welding began to
attract the interest of the welder and sometimes his
superior. Facts which stood out more prominently
than others began to take shape and were gradually
crystallized into principles. For instance, it was
found that any and all wire worked better with the
correct arc length. It was discovered also, that
molten filler material deposited onto cold parent
metal did not result in a weld. After a time there
was formulated the most important principle of
electric arc-welding. This is that the molten pool in
the parent metal must be carried along continuously
ess and it began to emerge from the creeping stage-
to the learning, or what might be called boyhood
stage. Old jobs began to gravitate to the arc-weld-
ing booth with more frequency and regularity. Im-
portant repairs, and castings with defects or alter-
ations requiring welding for strength, began to be
successfully done by the arc process.
At about this stage of the development of the
process, the electrical manufacturing companies be-
gan to take the development seriously, and because
of the fact that they had at hand the facilities for
investigation and development on a scientific basis,
they rapidly became the leaders in the process ap-
plication. Investigation of the process by the re-
search engineers resulted in the gradual accumu-
lation of fundamental facts and principles, and the
elimination of the haphazard and trust - to - luck

methods of application and manipulation which had
prevailed.
One of the greatest boons to the process resulting
from these investigations was the correction of the
faulty current supply by the development of gene-
rators designed especially for welding service. After
extensive experimenting and investigation, the fact


Page 9

was established that generators of the constant-
current type gave excellent results in the design of
single-operator welding outfits; and that generators
of the multiple-operator type could be wound in
such a way as to insure positively that there would
be no interference between operators, unless the
generator was operated far beyond its rated ca-
pacity.
In addition to determining the best means of cur-
rent regulation and the best types of generator
windings, and analyzing current stabilization by
means of reactance coils, etc., exhaustive tests were
made to determine other necessary characteristics
of a good welding generator. These efforts resulted
in means of arc length control, ease of starting or
striking the arc, stability or tenacity in continuous
operation as long as approximately the right length
arc is held, and the characteristic of developing a
hot arc terminal in the parent metal, or what is
known as penetration.
The next important development in connection
with metallic arc welding was the production of a
satisfactory welding wire and the formulation of the
requirements which a good wire should meet. It
was found that a mild steel of certain approximate
analysis was the most satisfactory arc-welding wire
for general welding work. It was also found that
the wire must have the characteristic of concentrat-
ing the arc terminal at the face of the wire end; and
that the rate of fusion or consumption should be
constant. This was found necessary in order to con-
centrate the arc terminal properly in the parent
metal, as well as at the wire terminal, and to avoid
the deposition of large globules of metal at one time
from the electrode filler rod. Concentration of the
arc terminal in the parent metal was found to be
necessary in order to secure the necessary penetra-
tion and to provide the necessary fused or molten
pool in which to deposit the filler rod material. It
was also found necessary to require that the weld-
ing wire deposit a material of dense structure with-
out porosity, blow holes or slag inclusions.
In an effort to produce a wire of this kind, many
manufacturers entered the field and there was soon
available wire in rolls, bundles and boxes, some of
which were coated, some covered, some fluxed and
some bare. It was all advertised to be the last word
in welding wire. For a long time there was really
only one maker of a truly good wire. Other makers
flourished because of the fact that a standard of
comparison was lacking. Few operators and far
fewer supervisors knew just what to expect of a
wire. After a time, however, the better wires be-
came more favorably known and eYen better wires
were produced. In addition to this, the American
Welding Society, after considerable research, did a
very commendable piece of constructive work by
establishing standard specifications for the welding
wire.
The more skillful operators soon proved the ad-
vantages to be gained with the new generators and
better welding wire by the frequency which they
executed welds in the vertical and overhead hori-
zontal planes. Welding of this kind never could
have been done on a commercial basis without these
developments.
The railway shops were perhaps the leaders in
taking advantage of the process at this stage of its
development. A few of the more progressive led
the way. Others followed and still others lacked
A TURBOGENERATOR FRAME DURING THE PROCESS

the initiative or confidence to apply the process to
making maximum economies.
While the developments in generators, wire, etc.,
were being made, other engineers with the aid of the
most expert operators, were formulating definite
principles of welding procedure, manipulation and
process application.
At about this stage, which might well be called
the age of youth in electric arc-welding, we were
plunged into the great World War. No youth, of
all those enlisted, entered the service with more en-
thusiasm, and no more spectacular or crushing vic-
tory was won than that won by arc-welding in the
repair of the purposely damaged, interned enemy
vessels which lay in our ports. It was the intention
to damage these vessels to such an extent that they
would be out of service for at least a year. By the
use of electric arc-welding they were put in trans-
port service in the incredibly short time of a few
months.
The exigency of war necessities did more to place
arc-welding on its relatively proper plane than pos-
sibly any other agency. In an effort to keep their

motive power in service, railroad officials who had
been previously antagonistic toward the application
of the process began to look upon it with favor, and
before long many became enthusiastic converts to
the new process. Among other things, tires, driving
boxes, couplers, switches and most important'of all,
boiler repairs and the welding of Hues became stand-
ard practice. This latter has probably saved the
railway companies more money than any other oper-
AN ALL ARC WELDED RAILWAY BRIDGE BUILT TO

ation or process development of the last two
decades.
The work done by the Navy Department and the
various ship-building companies in the application
of the electric arc to ship construction is another
outstanding pioneering accomplishment.
The fabrication of all sorts of steel structures by
use of the electric arc received greater impetus dur-
ing the war than even its most enthusiastic pro-
moter would have had the courage to predict. Many
manufacturers rushed to the use of the process with
little or no experience or knowledge of the funda-
mental principles involved. It was not surprising
that some were over enthusiastic, and that their
results were comparable with the amount of knowl-
edge and experience invested.
This increased interest in the arc-welding process
brought about a correspondingly increased activity
along investigation and research lines. This in turn
resulted in the accumulation of additional knowl-
edge which led to a wider application of the process
in the industrial field, and brought arc-welding into
what we may term its manhood. This advance was
greatly aided by the strides which had been made
during the war period in the field of training oper-
ators so as to fit them properly to observe and apply
the fundamental principles of the process.
This period in the history of arc-welding was
really that of another war, a war of attrition be-
tween processes of production. On the basis of the
accumulated knowledge of the process, arc-welding
now contested with the rivet, the bolt, the screw and
with the other more expensive processes of welding
or joining metals. By right of the conquests made
during this period, arc-welding lay claim to the join-
ing of the metal of the greater percentage of all steel
tanks, containers, pressure vessels and fabricated
structures other than buildings and bridges.
Investigation, research and improvements of the
generator, the wire and the process application and
training methods for both operators and supervisors
continued throughout this period until the accumu-
lated information or knowledge of the process be-
gan to approach more nearly the state of an exact
science. This ushered in the present stage or the
age of the giant. It might well be called "the en-
gineering age in electric arc-welding."
Standards have been established by which struc-
tures can be designed for welding. The strength of

plication. Welded structures need no longer be
precariously designed because of lack of information.
Accurate control of the process application can now
be accomplished, thanks to standarized practices
and the formulation of the principles of preparation,
procedure, manipulation and inspection.
The necessary knowledge is available for the use

Electrical Prospecting
By J. J. Jakosky
Consulting Engineer, The Radiore Company
MINING supplies raw materials for many
manufactures of great total value. Unlike
vegetable and animal raw materials, ores
cannot be grown. Man simply can hunt for the ore
bodies which exist in the earth. Surface indications
have been the principal dependence for centuries,
but necessity is spur-
ring the development
of new methods of
prospecting which will
carry the search be-
neath the surface. They
must be reliable, rapid
and inexpensive. Mag-
netic, gravitational,
seismic and electrical
methods have been de-
veloped as the intelli-
gence of modern min-
ing has turned from
divining rods and doo-
dle bugs to physical
science.
Research in connec-
tion with low and high
frequency electromag-
netic induction and
radio amplifying de-
vices has resulted in
obtaining n e w means
for geophysical pros-
pecting. Electro - mag-
netic induction has
been made the basis of
a method to which the
name Radiore has been
given. Development of the Radiore process began
with an investigation by A. B. Menefee and H. E.
Olund, mining engineers, of a so-called "radio"
method for locating ores. These original tests were
conducted at Darwin, Cal., near the famous Death
Valley. The characteristics of the ore occurrence
in this locality were well known to Menefee and
Olund, who were in charge of the mining operations
for large interests. The results of the radio method
were encouraging, but many of the data could not
be interpreted to agree with known ore occurrence
in tunnels and other mine workings.
A program of research and development was then
formulated. E. H. Guilford, Captain in Radio Com-
munication of the U. S. Army, and J. J. Jakosky,
Consulting Electrical Engineer, were added to the
technical staff. The original radio "antenna" sys-
tem for energizing the ore was replaced, as a result
of the research, by a loop or coil system, which to-
gether with a decrease in the frequency and the
development of a new direction-finding equipment
has resulted in the present Radiore method, having
many possibilities.

This m e t h o d has
functioned practically
as well in swampy coun-
try as in deserts. Snow
and ice are no bar to
efficient work and the
character of the surface
soil is unimportant.
Territory covered with
lava or float, or where
no outcrops occur, can
be as readily surveyed
as other kinds,—all be-
cause no contact with
the ground or ore-body
is employed.
An alternating cur-
rent is caused to flow
in an "energizer" on
the surface, similar to
a small radio transmit-
ter with a coil antenna.
This current creates an
electromagnetic "field,"
as electrical people say,
which causes currents
to flow by induction in
conductors under-
ground. The induction
principle has become familiar by use for many years
in a variety of electrical equipment.
Many ores of metals are better conductors than
other rocks and earths. The quantity and character
of the current induced are markedly affected, there-

upon the type of ore, the "frequency" of the current
in the energizer, the relative conductivity of the
substances at and below the surface of the ground,
and the current distribution.
Frequency is of especial importance when the ore
encountered is disseminated, broken or faulted,—to
use the geologist's words. High frequencies are
employed, 40,000 cycles a second being common,
because an appreciable current can be caused to flow

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Newton's Approximation
By Burtis L. Robertson, '24E, '26 Grad.
THE solutions of many problems in mathe-
matics, physics, and engineering involve the
determination of the roots of a power series
equation given by the form (1)
aQ xn + a, x"—1 +
+ a , x + a = 0
n—1
This is said to be the general equation of the n,h
degree in one unknown, n is a positive integer, and
denotes the exact number of roots of the equation.
The coefficients a .a .... a , are any numbers
—o ' —l —n''
independent of the variable x. Such an equation
may be of any degree but those met with in prac-
tice are usually not greater than the fourth, that
is, biquadratic equations.
The roots of an equation may be real, imaginary,
complex, or any combination of these quantities.
Imaginary and complex roots always occur in pairs
so that if one such root is obtained it is known that
its conjugate must then also be present. This treat-
ment concerns itself only with real roots, either
positive or negative, and illustrates a simple method
for determining them. The process is particularly
applicable to equations of the third degree or
greater.
The linear equation (2)
ax + b = 0
and the quadratic (3)
ax2 + bx + c — 0
can be readily dismissed. The solution of the first
is obvious, and the solution of the second is given
by the well-known general formula (4)
2a — 2a
b2 — 4ac
which is obtained by the method understood as
"completing the square."
The cubic equation, however, is somewhat dif-
ferent and its solution compared with the quadratic
is generally more involved. One root must always
be real for, as just mentioned, complex roots occur
only in pairs. To obtain one root of the cubic equa-
tion is to have solved the whole equation because
this one root may be quickly factored out, leaving
a quadratic whose solution is then known.
If a root is integral, as can usually be observed
from inspection, the expression is readily reduced
by factoring. But if a root contains a decimal quan-
tity, and happens to be the first one sought, it is
usually obtained by approximate steps, although it
can be exactly determined by methods of algebra.
Most text books on college algebra give a complete
discussion on the cubic equation and show the exact
solution.
The biquadratic equation is also easily reducible
if it has integral roots which can be noted by in-
spection. However, if the roots are real and not
integral, or are complex, the process of obtaining
them is longer. The scheme usually employed is
one of substitution, the biquadratic equation being
first reduced to a cubic of which one root is de-
termined. This root allows a further reduction of
the biquadratic to two quadratics whose solutions
are then known.
Equations of the form (1) and greater than the
fourth degree do not have algebraic solutions, but
their roots can be obtained by other methods. Real
roots can ordinarily be secured to a fair degree of
accuracy by any of several approximate methods.
Newton's approximation, which incidentally is
very little known, is one of these schemes. It is
readily applicable to equations containing real roots
and it has the further advantages that it is rapid and
will yield values as exact as desired. A discussion
of the method is now given.
Consider the simple cubic equation (5)
f (x) = x3 + ax + b = y
which is known to have at least one real root. If
this equation is plotted as in the figure, a root will
be determined by the point a on the graph at which
the curve of the function crosses the x-axis.
Let Xj = ob be the nearest initial guess to this
root of f = o the approximation falling in error
by the value ab. If, now, a tangent is drawn to the
curve at c, which is directly above b, it will inter-
sect the x-axis at d, a value more accurate than ob.
From the figure, the following relations become


Page 13
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
apparent: (6)
and, (7)
whence, (8)
be
'{ l) db "db
.11.
"f'(xj
As seen from the figure, a closer approximation to
the root of f (x) = 0 will thus be made by sub-
tracting db from the originally assumed value.
Hence, (9)
x2 = ob—db
i (xt)
The root x can now be taken as an initial guess
and a still closer value x obtained in like manner
to that for x , that is, (10)
f'(x2)
The process can be continued until the required
accuracy is reached but very seldom are more than
three approximations necessary. One or two will
usually suffice.
Any method or application will hold only insofar
as its limitations are known. Therefore, it should
be mentioned at this point that in many cases it is
necessary to apply the method more than once in
order to determine whether the value obtained is
apprcaching the exact root. For instance, if a tan-
gent were drawn to the curve at point e it would
intersect the x-axis so far from a its significance
would be meaningless. In short, the initial figure
should be chosen with some care so that it is reason-
ably close to the true value. There will then be no
trouble, in the calculations.
Exponential and transcendental equations are
typical of the kind to which Xewton's Approxima-
tion is best applied. An example will be given to
illustrate the method.
Example: Determine, to four significant figures,
the value of time required to satisfy the relation
(H)
£-2&lt; + 2c-^ — 2 = 0
Preliminary steps indicate that the time t, is
somewhere near 0.16 sec, hence this is used at the
start. The derivative of f (t) =0 is,
—2«-2t — 6t-3t
and the exponential values which can be quickly
read from tables are: (12)
e-2t = 0.7261
= 0.6188
Thus,
t, = tt —
= .16 —
P (t,)
0.0363
5.1650
= .1530 sec.
This illustration purposely called for only four
significant figures because the exponential tables
used contained only four places. Where tables hav-
ing a greater number of places are available the
approximation can correspondingly be corrected. o

of the designer, supervisor, inspector, instructor and
the operator. This knowledge has grown from that
conveyed from operator to operator by word of
mouth, to many volumes of useful, exact informa-
tion. With this knowledge there have been designed
and built pressure vessels and containers, many
large buildings, several railway bridges, many miles
of welded pipe lines and last but not least, the many
and varied fabricated structures to be used as ma-
chine frames, bases and parts.
The use of fabricated machine structures offers
the designer the opportunity to proportion the sec-
tions or members of a machine to the exact dimen-
sions necessary to perform the functions for which
they are intended. Due to the limitations of the
casting process this has never been possible before.
In addition to this, members of a structure can be
so proportioned and located as to have the stresses
transmitted to other parts of the structure, thus di-
viding the load to which a member need be
subjected.
These structures offer another advantage in that
changes or variations from standard can be more
easily and rapidly made. These changes consist of
additions to or omissions from the standard, such
as change in location of parts, change in foot height,
omission of exciter supports, addition of brackets
or pads on which to mount auxiliary equipment, and
changes which might be found necessary in the
field.
Fabricated structures occupy less space than cast
structures and are of less weight. These features
are of considerable importance in making shipment
and in handling and installation. The rating of ma-
chines of a particular type which can now be built,
tested or shipped assembled has taken a consider-
able jump. It is not hard to visualize the extent to
which the fabricated structure can be adapted, in
meeting conditions which require that the particular
machine be built in sections having a maximum
fixed permissible weight on account of limited trans-
portation facilities in remote places. The weight
factor is also often a major consideration where
there are building or foundation limitations.
The ability to make and keep shorter delivery
dates and thus render to the customer the best pos-
sible service is sufficient reason without any other
for changing from cast to the fabricated structure.
In these days the ability to deliver the goods enters
into most all contracts.

EDITORIALS
THE TECHNIC—A MONTHLY
This issue marks the beginning of the new policy
of the Technic, that of a monthly engineering col-
lege magazine. Several years ago an attempt was
made to publish the magazine on a monthly basis,
but on account of financial difficulties, reverted to
a quarterly the following year. As a quarterly the
Technic has enjoyed great success, both editorially
and financially. The staff, after thoroughly investi-
gating every conceivable aspect of the requirements
of a monthly magazine as compared to a quarterly,
both from a business and an editorial standpoint,
cpme to the conclusion that a monthly magazine has
nothing to offer but advantages. After permission
to go ahead was granted by the faculty advisory
board, plans were completed.
In order to maintain its position as one of Ameri-
ca's foremost engineering college magazines, it was
almost imperative that the Technic become a
monthly. Ry decreasing by half the period of pub-
lication, the value of the local news items in the
Technic is increased a hundred-fold. Topics of cur-
rent interest in the engineering world are brought
to the attention of the readers of the Technic in
half the time formerly required, thus adding greatly
to their value. The staff of the publication is in
much closer touch with its work, since the work
has become almost continuous, where it was for-
merly more or less intermittent. The bearing of
editorials is greatly increased due to their more
timely appearance. In short, the Technic will be
able to serve its readers in a larger capacity than
ever before.

TO THE CLASS OF '32
The other day as we were sitting comfortably in
our swivel chair on the third floor of the East Engi-
neering Building, watching the maze of students
pass to and fro, the appearance of gray pots with
yellow buttons took us back to the days when we
too were looking forward to four years in a great
university, looking forward to many struggles with
things then only anticipated, to the day when we
would meet calculus on an even field and come
away victorious. That day, for us, is far removed
and is obscured by a haze of experiences many and
varied; in its place we find ourselves looking at the
last year of residence at Michigan, our ideas tem-
pered by three years of college experience.
As we gazed at those yellow buttons, we envied
those whose privilege it was to wear them. Those
were the days we thought, and, no doubt, we were
right. As it occurs to us, it is indeed a privilege to
be a freshman, just now starting a college career;
more, indeed, of a privilege than to be a senior now
finishing his career of college activity. The begin-
ner has his future all before him and is free to
shape it as he sees fit. He may at his own discretion
place himself in almost any of the many categories
in which college students are eventually placed.
To give advice to freshmen is a thing which, in
many respects, is difficult to do. We feel, however,
that there are some things which we might say in
the matter.
We believe that one of the most important and
beneficial parts of an engineer's training is a liberal
education outside the technical field. Such a liberal
education is meant to include literature, political
science, philosophy, psychology, etc. The import-
ance of obtaining an insight into these subjects has
been so often expounded that we shall say nothing
more than to urge that they be made, as much as
possible, a part of the plans of beginning engineers.
That one cannot acquire all these and at the same
time meet all the technical requirements is true, yet
every effort should be made to obtain as much as
possible in these various fields by taking advantage
of every opportunity which offers itself.
The above, we will say, is the most important
advice that we can offer and if well heeded will
bring more satisfactory results than any other
course which might be pursued during the college
career.
We will finish as we began. We remember the
glad and hearty welcome that was accorded us when
we first wore the gray symbol. We extend the same
welcome to you and hope that you will always
strive to prove yourselves worthy of the name which
you will take with you at your departure from
Michigan.

AERONAUTICAL ENGINEERING
One of the youngest of engineering branches
causes our attention to be focused upon it. That
branch is aeronautical engineering. It is astounding
how rapidly this department of engineering is de-
veloping throughout the country. New valuable
uses are daily found for the heavier-than-air ma-
chine. The speed of this form of transportation
makes it of inconceivable value in mail service,
freight service and in cases of emergency. A great
demand has sprung up for speedy, dependable air-

craft that will carry larger and heavier loads. Ma-
chines are especially desirable for future spanning
of the oceans.
Radical developments are to be expected in the
industry of plane manufacture. But now we must
first develop a corps of engineers to take care of the
problems at present facing these developments. The
work has to be done by experts. That the young
men are aware of this need can be ascertained by
the increased enrollment in aeronautical schools
throughout the country. Last year, here at Michi-
gan, there were enrolled, a total of 127. The enroll-
ment now is 168, a total increase of about 32 per
cent. It is with pleasure that we acknowledge the
fact that the University of Michigan has one of the
best aeronautical departments in the country.

ALUMNI, THIS IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY
Always the staff of the Technic is on the lookout
for articles which will prove interesting to you and
to our other readers. Many of our letters are never
answered, but never do we fail to strike someone
who is glad to make his worth-while contribution.
We cannot, however, always send our requests to
the best sources and sometimes our very best ma-
terial is overlooked through lack of information.
All of us feel at times that we would like to write-
something about the work that we are doing and
yet we do not always get the opportunity. We
are offering that opportunity. If you have any-
thing to write about that you feel your fellow
alumni would be interested in do not hesitate to
send it to us at once. The Technic is your maga-
zine and it is at your disposal as well as that
of students here on the campus. So send us your
account of what the engineering world has offered
you, or what you are doing for it. Your contribu-
tions will not only be a benefit to you but they will
help to make the Technic a better magazine.

EXTRA-CURRICULA ACTIVITIES
American universities are often compared to those
of Europe from the standpoint of interest taken in
studies compared to that expressed for extra-cur-
ricula activities. The point is always made that the
characteristic of the American university is its many
activities in which the students interest themselves
while their studies wait for their spare moments.
This condition is not a result of the American
student's distaste for study, but is a result of meth-
ods used in our universities. The condition may be
thought of as a fault of the American system or may
be considered an advantage depending on what
stand we wish to take in the matter.
To go deeper into the subject, we find the student
in an European university has much greater free-
dom than is found in our own colleges. We find
ourselves, here, under a more or less advance sys-
tem of discipline, not unlike that devised to handle
high school students. Under such conditions it is
natural for us to seek a place where we can work
unhindered by rules of procedure and class disci-
pline which we were exposed to in high school. The
outlet is found in extra-curricula activities. Campus
publications, athletics, clubs and societies all offer
opportunities to show our own initiative. Those
who wish to put their initiative to work at once
seize these opportunities, for no matter under what
conditions we are placed, we will always find an
outlet for this natural desire for freedom to exercise
our various abilities.
The fact that the students in European universi-
ties are given more freedom in their pursuit of
knowledge accounts for the lack of interest in other
activities there. The American student is no dif-
ferent from any other. If there is any lack of schol-
arly interest in our universities it is because of our
own system and not because of the type of student.

A NEW COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING
Because of the demand for engineering education
and the need of industries in southern California for
centralized and adequately - equipped engineering
laboratories the board of trustees of the University
of Southern California has authorized the creation
of a college of engineering, of which Philip S. Bieg-
ler, professor of electrical engineering at the Uni-
versity for the past five years, has been appointed
acting dean by President Rufus B. von KleinSmid.
The new college, which opened September, 1928,
is made up of five major divisions with separate
chairmen as follows: Chemical engineering, Pro-
fessor Wilfred W. Scott; civil engineering. Profes-
sor Robert M. Fox; electrical engineering, Professor
Philip S. Biegler; mechanical engineering. Professor
Thomas T. Eyre; petroleum engineering, Professor
Allan E. Sedgwick.
In addition to the four-year courses leading to a
B. S. degree in any of the divisions of engineering,
and a Master's degree for graduate work, a degree
of C. E. has been established for distinction in the
practice of engineering.
Professor Biegler came to Southern California
five years ago after 13 years of teaching at the Uni-
versities of Iowa, Illinois, Purdue and Washington
State College, and a number of years with the Com-
monwealth Edison Company in Chicago and the
Washington Water Power Company in an engi-
neering capacity.
He is also a member of the Society for the
Promotion of Engineering Education, the American
Association of University Professors and the Engi-
neers' Club of Los Angeles. He is a graduate of the
Universitv of Wisconsin with the degree of B. S.
in E. E. (1905), and E. E. (1915), and M. S. in E. E.
by the University of Illinois (1916).

Hark to the Blessings of Smoke!
There seems to be much agitation these days in
American cities in favor of smoke abatement, but
I believe that we should consider this matter with-
out emotion. We should see the facts on the other
side of the question. If we are able to consider the
subject impartially and for the good of our cities, I
feel sure that this movement will cease at once.
First of all, smoke means prosperity. Every chim-
ney that pours forth these rich, luscious black
clouds of smoke is an advertisement of the pros-
perity of our factories and institutions. No matter
how modest a plume of smoke waves heavenward,
we know that the humble home beneath it has a
full coal bin and is able to use it generously and
unintelligently.
Little do our cities realize the far-reaching pros-
perity which this production of smoke causes. Con-
sider not only the doctors who are general prac-
titioners but the eye, ear, nose and throat doctors.
It is painful to think of what would become of them
if there were no more smoke. They would probably
starve. No more throats to be sprayed, cut and op-
crated upon; no more noses to be explored and
excavated. No, let us offer our throats a willing sac-
rifice to our prosperity and stand by our doctors.
Then our hospitals would also suffer seriously if
there were no more smoke. They themselves pro-
duce clouds of it. Colds, bronchitis and pneumonia,
all due to smoke, furnish hundreds of patients for
these institutions.
Again, think of the predicament of our cleaning
industries if smoke were really abated. Our clothes
and household furnishings might last a lifetime, as
they did in the good old days. Our laundries are
now bountifully and generously covering our cities
with the choicest soot crystals of modern times.
Under smoke abatement these industries could
hardly survive.
What would we women do without our beauty
parlors? Our manicuring, massaging, oiling, scrub-
bing, soaking and shampooing processes are devel-
oping upon us a rich brown color and complexion.
These lovely shades of brown not only give us char-
acter but conversation. Abate smoke and you abate
the beauty parlors. We women must stand together
on this matter of beauty parlors.
Then there are the paper cleaners and house
painters who every year clean our walls and paint
our houses. What would they do if there were
smoke abatement? We must drop this agitation at
once.
Above all, consider the moral effect upon the
housewife. Now she is always scrubbing and clean-
ing. She is kept out of mischief. Her husband
knows where she is. Take away her soot and give
her any more leisure and the American home will
disappear.
Soot has also educational advantages. Children
with colds and illnesses arising from soot are forced
to stay at home from school. This makes some
children very happy. At school there are smaller
classes, more teaching and more thorough work.
The teacher is less nervous in having fewer chil-
dren. Her own colds give her frecjuent vacations
and her absences afford employment for substitutes.
We all appreciate the wonderful night air of our
smoky cities. Small particles of carbon intensify
the restful darkness. The night air, like molasses,
envelops our evening gayety, calms our exuberant
spirts and smothers us quickly in our nightly slum-
bers to blissful unconsciousness.
Soot has also its architectural advantages. The
blackness of our buildings gives age and dignity
to our cities. The falling soot is converting them
rapidly to the semblance of some ancient or me-
dieval settlements. Thus do we acquire the appear-
ance of age and culture without the pangs of his-
tory.
When I consider this mass of evidence in favor
of smoke I become weak, and words fail me. Can
we have any doubts now upon the merits of the
smoke abatement question?

Electricity and the Hitman Body
If electricity can have performed so many re-
markable services in lightening labor, if it can have
raised the standard of living throughout the world,
must we continue to say that it is impotent in re-
pairing bodies and in keeping them in repair?
Not for long, certainly. Electrotherapeutics has
passed the stage of charlatanism and magic and has
settled down to sober and honest progress. The
alluring but entirely fictitious powers of "electronic
reactions" and all their breed have been exploded

and electricity has at last taken an active hand.
Chemistry, once the only reliance of medicine, has
a new and powerful ally whose purpose, like that of
its colleague, is sound investigation and reproduci-
ble results. Ultra-violet light from electrical sources,
far more powerful than sunlight and yet more con-
trollable, has already gained a substantial reputa-
tion in medicine. It is conceded to be a cure for
rickets, a powerful assistant in the treatment of
tuberculosis and a bactericidal agent of great value
in surface infections. It is also receiving much at-
tention as an active force in the production of the
still mysterious vitamins in foods. X-rays, thanks
to the intensive developmental work done by sci-
ence, are now under effectual control and with each
new advance in the art of their production they are
finding new applications in the war against disease
and disability. At first their value lay principally
in their great assistance in medical diagnosis, but
they are now the basis of a complete new therapy,
having well established uses in the treatment of
certain kinds of cancer and kindred ailments.
These two—ultra-violet light and X-rays—are al-
ready firmly established. But there are other elec-
trical phenomena that may soon serve the doctor
in his fight for men's bodies. High-frequency cur-
rents, whose curative power has been in dispute for
years, are now suggested in medical circles as a
possible means of aiding natural convalescence by
producing artificial fevers. And recently has come
the announcement of the cathode-ray tube, which
can produce many hundred times more radiation
than is given off by all the radium in the world and,
unlike that rare metal, is under perfect control.
Neither doctor nor scientist can say at present what
the cathode ray may do for medicine, but it is quite
possible that great benefits may come from it.
These are a few of the contributions and the
promises which electricty, turning from the remod-
eling of industry, has made to man himself. Re-
search in its unending perseverance, supported by
an open public mind, may turn these promises to
realities, and it may reasonably be hoped that pain
and suffering will steadily decrease throughout the
world.

Mammoth Tramway to Span Western Canyon
A mammoth electric tramway, by far the largest
of its type to be built in this country, has been re-
cently erected by the Michigan-California Lumber
Co. at Camino, Cal. The tramway will be used to
carry lumber a distance of a half mile across a can-
yon and it is expected that the installation will be
very spectacular in operation because of the heavy
weights, high speeds, and distances involved.
A single tram carrier, carrying a rail car loaded
with a maximum of 24,000 pounds of sawed lumber
(a maximum gross weight of 29 tons) will pass be-
tween two loading terminals on opposite sides of
the canyon. The distance between terminals is ap-
proximately 2,700 feet, the depth of the canyon is
1.200 feet, and the maximum speed of operation will
be 1,800 feet per minute, or a little over 20 miles
per hour. The carrier will make a round trip in a
little over six minutes, including the 200 second:,
required for loading and unloading. The equipment
will be capable of handling this cycle continuously.
Four steel cables each two inches in diameter will
support the tram carrier, which will run on 3Z
wheels. The traction rope will be endless and will
be one inch in diameter.
The electrical equipment consists principally of
two 225-hp. wound-rotor intermittent-duty hoist
motors operating mechanically and electrically in
parallel, and controlled through suitable primary
and secondary magnetic-contactor panels. A single
manually operated master controller will govern
both motors. The two motors are geared to two
large sheaves each eight feet in diameter, which
will engage the traction rope. Each motor is
equipped with a motor-mounted brake. Momen-
tarily, the two motors will be able to exert a com-
bined output of 800-hp. and, for short periods, most
of this capacity will be required.
Stopping the carrier at either terminal will nor-
mally be accomplished automatically, in four graded
steps, by means of a geared limit switch. After be-
ing so stopped at either end, the carrier will be
brought to the final position. This will require ac-
curate spotting in order to roll off the loaded rail
car, and the final spotting will be done by an op-
erator located at each terminal, using an "inching"
push-button.
The motors and power plant are located at one
side of the canyon, and the carrier will be started
and accelerated by the operator handling the master
switch located on the motor or power side of the
canyon. The necessity for "inching" the load to the
final position on either side of the canyon 2,700 feet
apart made it necessary to provide for the transfer
of the control back and forth across the canyon,
with a red and green signal light system and proper
interlocking of the control circuits for safety rea-
sons.
The entire equipment will operate under both
overhauling and motoring loads at different times
during the cycles of operation. For example, as the
29-ton loaded carrier descends into the sag of the
supporting cables — approximately 135 feet at the
middle of the span — the motors will act as generat-
ors for the purpose of limiting the speed. At other
times, when ascending into the terminals, maximum
motoring power will be required. For this reason
special provision is made in the control equipment

Camp Davis
Once more the silence of Camp Davis was broken
for eight weeks by an industrious group of 24 rising
and hopeful future engineers. (Rising at 6:00 a. m.
and hoping that it wouldn't rain as blue books are
given on such days.)
Camp organization for the session was completed
early with "Bill" Senkpiel, '29E, as Camp Manager;
"Whipper" Will, '30E, as Editor of "The Black
Flag"; "Scottie" Richardson, '30E, as Business
Manager; "Squirt" Grunow, '30E, as Athletic Di-
rector, and "Dick" Felix, '30E as Sanitary Engi-
neer. It was up to these fellows to see that the camp
functioned in a 100 per cent fashion. If this degree
of perfection wasn't reached, it is our belief that the
camp came out 99 and 44/100 per cent pure al-
though it didn't float.
Camp work was both extremely interesting and
profitable. Measurement of the base-line, sounding
on Douglas Lake, laying out roads and bridge lo-
cations were but a few of the exercises that were
well liked by the fellows. It may be said here, how-
ever, that Azimuth ran the above exercises a close
race for popularity and it is extremely regretful that
more of it could not be given. Those in doubt as
to the truth of this statement kindly ask "Mac".
"All work and no play makes the money." No,
that's not right as George would say. But regard-
less of proverbs, a soft ball league was formed.
After an exciting race the Felix Cats finished on
top with Hapke's Jackrabbits just a notch in the
rear, while the Ringworms and the Faculty were
tied for the cellar. Trips were made to Cheboygan
and Mackinac Island where entertainment (???)
was given by camp songs. The Bug Camp, Bry-
ant's, and Northwood also saw frequent migrations
from camp and the call of "Hi, Roy" was known for
many miles around and now can daily be heard on
the campus.
Although some of the fellows were forced to
change their names temporarily to Endicott, Shaw,
Sullivan Brothers, etc., all had lots of enjoyment
and a wonderful summer with but one regret. All
parted with the sorrowful feeling that fried potatoes
were gone forever from their lives, and after all,
what is life without Frank's fried potatoes?

Engineers Out for Football
For the next two months football will be the
principal diversion available or desirable to the uni-
versity population. The air will be literally filled
with teams, games, plays, and players. This year,
as usual, there are quite a number of engineers out
for football. The following is a list of them ob-
tained near the last of September:
Carl J. Bawer, *30E Chas. W. Schurrer, '29E
Frank F. Brown, '31E John Widman, '30E
Isadore Grodsky, '30E Richard Williams, *29E
Otto Pommerening, '29E Clare J. Wheeler, '31E
These men represent the Engineering College on
the football team and as such deserve our hearty
support.

A. S. M. E.
The Student Branch of the A. S. M. E. under the
leadership of a new corps of officers is planning a
varied and interesting program for the coming year.
A meeting was held early in October and plans for
a membership drive were laid. An informal "Get
Acquainted" smoker will be held soon. During the
year various inspection trips will be taken. These
include trips to Detroit to several large plants there,
and a trip to Selfridge Field to view the flying of
the First Pursuit Group. Motion pictures and in-
teresting speakers have been arranged for and the
society is looking forward to a very active year.
The officers are Jack Gray, President; Jerome Che-
ney, Vice-President, and Frank Wilson, Secretary-
Treasurer.
* * *
Scabbard and Blade
The year 1928-29 promises to be a most active
one for Scabbard and Blade. Besides the regular
meetings, monthly dinners will be held which, it is
hoped, will prove to be a distinct aid in making a
successful year. In addition prominent speakers
are being arranged for who will address the society.
The organization is also laving plans for a program
to be put on during Freshman Week next year. The
active chapter requests that faculty members from
other chapters and alumni on the campus get in
touch with the organization as soon as possible.
During the first semester the society will be under

Phi Eta Sigma
The Honorary Scholastic Society for Freshmen,
Phi Eta Sigma, this Fall continued the program it
began last Spring. If this program is accomplished,
it will mean that the Honor System, now in suc-
cessful operation in the Engineering School, will be
put into operation in the new University College,
which will begin next Fall. Efforts have been made
to educate this year's Freshman Class to an under-
standing of the system through the Upper Class
Advisors, who talked with them during Freshman
Week. President Little in his Freshman Week ad-
Tlhe Spotlight
Otto Pommebening
To the average spectator cozily
seated within fifty or sixty yards of
the goal posts, the great American
game of football cannot but seem a
vague and distant myth. And to
most of us football is just a myth.
For every one of the twenty-two
men hard at it on the floor of the
bowl there are some three thousand
of us straining every muscle of our
—eyes, trying to find satisfaction or
fault with the efforts of our squad. But to each of those
twenty-two football gods, football is a tangible, concrete
thing which has been acquired only through many hours
of muscular and mental effort. They are those in the
three thousand who have not only admired football as we
all do, but have had the ambition and determination to
spend the time and effort necessary to learn the game.
Among these followers of the bounding pigskin is one
who is especially noteworthy, both because of his ability
and because of his being an engineer. Needless to say, he
is the smiling Dutchman, Otto Pommerening. Otto is one
of those fellows who believe in supplementing words to
action rather than action to words. Consequently, he has
been one of the most active engineers on the campus.
This is Otto*s third year of varsity football. Last year
he was one of the mainstays of the Michigan line and this
year he is expected to do even more to make the team a
success.
Besides being a football letter man, Otto is a member
of several honorary societies. During his Junior year he
was elected to Triangles, and later to Vulcans.
If any of you engineers get near enough to the gridiron
to distinguish the numbers on the backs of the players, keep
an eye on Number 50 and watch the holes he tears in the
opponent's line. And don't forget to let him know that
we as engineers are with him in every play.
dress also spoke highly of the plan. The officers
for this year most earnestly request the active co-
operation of all members of the Society in carrying
out this program. These officers are: President,
Harold B. Palmer; Vice-Presdent, Clevoe D. Jones,
and Secretary-Treasurer, Douglas Edwards.

Transportation Club
Beginning the second year of its existence with a
most interesting pro-
gram planned, the
Transportation Club
looks forward to a very
successful year. Under
the leadership of Clark
Harris, the President,
and Jack Gray, the Sec-
retary-Treasurer, a
most imposing list of
speakers h a s been ar-
ranged for. It includes
Horatio S. Earl of De-
troit, C. A. Morse of
the Chicago, Rock-
Island &amp; Pacific Rail-
road, Col. J. P. Nelson,
Roy D. Chapin, chair-
man of the Hudson
Motor Car Co.; A. A.
Schantz, president of
the Detroit &amp; Cleve-
land Navigation Co.,
and Mr. Stout of the
Stout Aircraft Corp.
Trips to inspect the
Toledo, Detroit &amp; Jack-
son Railroad facilities,
the Detroit River Ter-
minal, and the Detroit
air ports have all been
planned. At the regu-
lar meetings, more stu-
dent papers will be
read than were last year. With such a varied pro-
gram, the club looks forward to even a more suc-
cessful year than last year, which was marked by
such salient features as the All-Engineering Smoker
at which Mr. John F. Stephens was the principal
speaker.
This club is serving an important purpose in the
Engineering College. It is the link between the
railway, the aeronautical, the highway, and the ma-
rine engineers. It is symbolical of the unions which
are taking place in the practical field where recent
bus transportation and similar combines have been
formed. Such combines will soon create a network
to cover the entire world.

Engineering Council
The present Engineering Council, the organiza-
tion of which was started in the spring of 1928 to
supercede the inadequate Engineering Society of
previous years, has not as yet completely formu-
lated all of its organization. The exact scope of its
application and its executive powers have not been
determined. However, most of its members for the
school year of 1928-'29, have been elected and are
working to bring the Council into some definite
form. These men who have been elected are:
Seniors W. C. Senkpiel
R. J. Williams H. M. Harrison
F. J. DeWitt
Juniors Phillip S. Cochran
Robert S. McCoy George E. Holbrook
Sophomore: Pres. Student Branches
A. S. C. E. Richard H. Shakelton
A. S. M. E Jack T. Gray
A. I. E. E William H. Hough
A. S. Ch. E R. C. Adams
Pres. Senior Class Eugene Easterly
Editor of Technic Bernard M. Cain
Pres. of Transportation Club Clarke E. Harris
Some of the activities that the Engineering Coun-
cil hopes to bring under a more centralized control
are: All-Engineering Smokers, All-Engineering Con-
vocations, the Engineering Open House, and other
things that demand a well organized executive com-
mittee in charge of them.

ELECTRIC ARC-WELDING
(Continued from page 13)
From the standpoint of design features, the cus-
tomer who buys the new fabricated machines gets
all the better of it, and it is the designers delight
to give it to him. When a line of machines is
changed from the cast to the fabricated construc-
tion, an opportunity is had to incorporate the very
latest discoveries and the best known engineering
practice. All those points which have been con-
sidered for improvement and development are taken
care of at the time the design is revamped. Special
consideration is also given to such features as the
incorporation of the latest and best practice in ven-
tilation and lubrication. Bearing sizes and bearing
design, about which much has been learned in re-
cent times, are given special attention. Provision
for balancing rotating parts is given more thought
today than ever before, and the fabrication of rotat-
ing parts offers an opportunity to meet the newer
and more exacting demands.
Up to the present time, electric arc-welding has
not been hard pressed to meet any great public de-
mand because it has had to supplant other highly
developed methods of joining metals. The gains
made by arc-welding have been made on merit and
at the expense of some other method. Every gain
registered was the result of a successful attack on
inertia and at times on unreasonable prejudice. This
is the opposite of the reception accorded such de-
velopments as the radio, the auto and the airplane.
With welding the converts were made in the reverse
direction. First there was the operator who could
weld anything, IF . . . His supervisor next came
under the spell, and he in turn proceeded to co-
operate with the engineer, who was at first skep-
tical, but willing to be shown. It is to the everlast-
ing credit of the engineer that he not only developed
the facilities and the process, but sold the process
THE UNDER FRAME CONSTRUCTION OF AN ALL
WELDED ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVE CAB
to the managing executives. It is characteristic of
these men that they made their decision to adopt a
program of welding, even after due consideration of
the metallurgists' reports that under the microscope
they had been able to detect the horrible nitride
needles, and that laboratory tests had revealed only
a small degree of ductility or malleability. The
orders given required only that the applications be
kept within bounds of the exact knowledge of the
process. This has been done. Nothing has been left
to guess work and nothing need be to secure the
full benefits of the process. We need only be
guided by the accumulated knowledge which is
available. That there are limitations to the appli-
cation of the process in a wholesale and haphazard
manner, goes without question. To refuse to make
sensible use of a material or process merely because
it does not measure one hundred per cent in every
detail would be about as sensible as incarcerating a
man because he happened to bruise his finger.

To meet the energy demands of modern high-
power broadcasting, an audion of colossal dimen-
sions has been built. It stands 7l/i feet high, and is
thicker than a man's arm. The grid, with its brac-
ing resembling that of a steel bridge, is 3 feet 5
inches long. Such a huge tube requires 11 horse-
power to heat the filament, and will deliver energy
enough to light 2500 lamps of 40-watt capacity.

Echoes from the Graduates
James MacNaughton
IN Upper Peninsular Michigan is a large group
of copper-mining towns known as Calumet, in
which resides James MacNaughton, one of the
University of Michigan's most famous, yet least
generally known alumni. A great pioneer in the
Michigan copper mining field and a philanthropist
of great note; his life story is truly worthy of note.
James MacNaughton was
horn in Canada on March 4,
1864. After he had obtained his
elementary education in Can-
ada, he entered the University
of Michigan in 1886. He
&gt;tudied civil engineering for
two years and left to join the
multitude of adventurers who
w'ere at that time flocking to
the newly-discovered northern
Michigan copper fields. This
great opportunity was not lost
on him. He started in at the
bottom and after years of hard
work reached the top. Through
the years that he spent in the
copper fields he constantly
called on the engineering
knowledge he had obtained
while a student, and on that he
was able to glean from books
after hours. The seemingly in-
surmountable difficulties e n -
countered in mining, transporting and refining cop-
per were, in a large measure, removed by the un-
stinting efforts of James MacNaughton. Later, he
did much toward the development and installation
of mine safety devices, which, while common today,
were unheard of in the early days. After he had
been chief mining engineer of the Calumet &amp; Hecla
Consolidated Copper Company for a number of
years, he entered the executive division, and for the
last twenty years he has been vice-president and
general manager. He is spoken of in one of Wil-
liam E. Curtis' letters to the Chicago Record-Herald
as the absolute, yet benevolent despot by whom the
city of Calumet, Mich., is very efficiently governed.
The city has no organization or charter, no common
council or other officials, but is simply a community
of mine employees controlled by the manager of
the mines. Mr. MacNaughton practically controls
the 45,000 inhabitants of the township as he suc-
ceeds himself as supervisor each year and names the
candidate for town clerk and
justice. The city is orderly and
has an excellent hospital,
nurses' training school, gym-
nasium, line library, and a bath
house, all maintained by the
Calumet &amp; Hecla Co.
During the" hard early years
James M a c N a u g h t o n was
greatly comforted by his wife,
Mary E. Morrison of Calumet,
whom he married in 1892.
They have two children, Mary
M.. and Mary E.
J a m e s MacNaughton is a
member of the American In-
stitute of Mining Engineers
and also a member of the In-
stitution of Mining Engineers
(Eondon). He is a member of
the Tennis and Racquet Club
of Boston, and a member of the
Links Club of New York. He
belongs to the University Club
of Chicago and was recently elected to the Ameri-
can Society of Mechanical Engineers.
Mr. MacNaughton was given the honorary degree
of Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering at the
1907 Commencement by the University of Michi-
gan.
James MacNaughton is a true engineer, the
singleness of purpose which has marked his life
from the beginning, and the unerring ability to
carry it out have made him not only a great engi-
neer, but a great man. More men of his calibre are
needed to pioneer in a great number of new fields.

ing from our colleges are entering its ranks. Their
selection and training require an extremely large
investment. One of the most readily available ob-
jective measures of their past achievement is their
college scholastic record. It measures the results in
what, after all, has been their major task for four
years. Its value for indicating further achievement
is surely worth determining.

YCARS SINCE C«AOuATiON
I—MEDIAN SALARIES BY COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIP RANK
The median salary of the entire group studied is shown
by the horizontal 100 per cent line. Thirty years after grad-
uation, the median salary of the men in the first tenth of
their college classes is 155 per cent, that of the men in the
lowest third of their classes is 79 per cent of this median.
With this point in view, the personnel department
of the American Telephone and Telegraph Com-
pany, under the direction of Mr. E. K. Hall, for the
past two years has been making such a study of the
relation of college scholarship to success in the Bell
System. A large part of the study, covering the
record of 4,125 of the college graduates in the Bell
System from 104 colleges is completed. Additional
records from a number of other colleges are ex-
pected, but there is no reason to believe that these
additional cases will alter materially the general re-
sults already obtained.
When this study of the relation of college scholar-
ship to progress in the business has been completed
it is proposed, if the necessary data are obtainable,
to make a somewhat similar study of the relation
between school record and progress in the business.
A great many of the higher positions in the System
are held by men who did not go to college, and the
real picture of the relationship between scholarship
and subsequent progress cannot be completed with-
out some data as to the scholarship records of the
men who did not have a college education. The
scholastic records of the college men were studied
first.
Of the 4,125 graduates, 319 were at once elimi-
nated from the study because more than half of
their business careers had been outside the Bell
System. Of the 3.806 included, 1,662 were less than
five years out of college, 2144 wrere from live to
thirty years out. In obtaining these men's reco.cl.;
we asked the colleges to classify them in four
groups:
1. Those graduating in the first tenth of their class:
2. Those graduating in the first third but not the first
tenth;
3. Those graduating in the middle third of their class;
4. Those graduating in the lower third of their class.
Chart I shows the median salaries of these men
grouped in accordance with their scholarship rank
at college. Each group's median is expressed as :i
percentage of the median of all the men included in
the study. Median salaries, which show the salary
of the man in the middle of his group, for example
the fiftieth man in a group of ninety-nine, have been
used instead of average salaries, which are some-
times greatly affected by one or twTo especially high
salaries.
As is indicated on Chart II, of the 3,806 men
studied, 498 had graduated in the first tenth of their
respective classes. By about the fifth year of their
employment this group began to earn more than the
other college men. They continued to increase their
advantage little by little until they were twenty-five
years out of college. Then they began to go ahead
still more rapidly. The line in the chart represents,
of course, the median man in the group. Many
individuals did better and many poorer than this
man, but the group as a whole averaged substantial-
ly higher earnings than the rest of the 3,800.
Next to the men who graduated in the first tenth
of their classes come those who were in the first
third of their classes, including the first tenth, 1,554

In general, men in the first third of their college classes
are most likely to be found in the highest third of their
group in salary, those of the middle third in scholarship to
be in the middle third in salary, and those in the lowest
third in scholarship to be in the lowest third in salary.

are also in relation to their scholarship in college.
They are lower than the earnings of the men in the
first tenth of their classes, but better than any other
group.
Of the 3,806 men studied, 1,468 graduated in the
middle third of their classes and the median man's

earnings in this group by the time they are thirty
years out of college is somewhat less than two-
thirds that of the median man among those in the
first tenth of their classes.
The 784 men who graduated in the lowest third
cf their classes have earned the least, and the curve
of the earnings of the median man in this group has
exactly the opposite trend to that of the median man
in the upper tenth of their classes: the longer the
best students are in business, the more rapidly their
earnings rise. The longer the poorer students arc
in business, the slower their earnings rise.
It cannot be stated too emphatically that these
lines on the charts represent the averages of the

performances cf the men in the different groups and
that the records of individuals in each group vary
very widely from the averages. It is clear, however,
that in the Bell System, on the average, men who
were good students have done better than those who
were not. There are, of course, exceptions—men
who were poor students who are succeeding well and
men who were good students succeeding less well-
but on the whole the evidence is very striking that
there is a direct relation between high marks in col-
lege and salaries afterward in the Bell System.
In general the normal expectation is that any col-
lege graduate entering business has one chance in
three of standing in salary among the highest third
of all the college graduates in his company. From
this study, as illustrated by the chart, it appears that
the man in the first third in scholarship at college
five years or more after graduation, has not merely
one chance in three, but about one in two of stand-
ing in the first third in salary. On the other hand,
the man in the lowest third in scholarship has, in-
stead of one chance in three, only about one in five
of standing in the highest third in salary. There is
also nearly one chance in two that he will stand in
the lowest third in salary.
In the same way, as shown by Chart III, the man
in the highest tenth in scholarship at college has
not one chance in ten, but nearly two chances in ten
of standing in the highest tenth in salary. The man
in the lowest third in salary, on the other hand, has
instead of one chance in ten, only one in twenty-two
of standing in the first tenth in salary.
Strikingly enough, almost exactly the same results
as those just given were obtained separately for the
engineering graduates and the graduates in arts and
business who together make up the whole group
united.
This analysis may not answer Doctor Foster's
academic question, "Should Students Study?" but
it has some bearing upon whether industry should
seek students who had studied. I hope it has bear-
ing enough on the subject to lead other companies,
associations, trades, and industries to make studies
along similar lines. It would undoubtedly be help-
ful if such studies could cover men who did not go
to college as well as college graduates.
In this particular study made by the Bell System
salary has been used as a measure of success. While
I do not believe that success in life can be rated by
income, I do believe that as between one man and
another working in the same business organization,
success and salary—while not the same thing—will,
generally speaking, parallel each other.
In studying the relationship between success in
scholarship and in business it is necessary, therefore,
to study the results of good and poor scholars in the
same line of work, or perhaps even within one com-
pany; for general comparisons of men under differ-
ent conditions in different businesses will not pro-
duce very valuable results. For instance, if scholar-
ship were an exact measure of business ability, it
would not mean that a fine scholar who had entered
the cotton mill business recently would have made
as much money as if he had been in the automobile
business. He might have been as great a success,
however. He might achieve what he set out to do
equally well. At certain times some businesses
make more money than others and, as Mr. Julius
Rosenwald has said, luck has a great deal to do with
the making of money.
By organizations, by the power to use nature
which science has provided, industry has shortened
the hours and eased the burden of making a living.
Men work eight hours where they used to work
twelve and fourteen. Vacations are longer and
more frequent. Success in life, both for the indi-
vidual and for the nation, depends on the use of this
leisure time just as it does on the use of the business
time. Perhaps a mind trained to scholarship in
vouth may more easily find success and happiness
in that leisure than one untrained.
If studies by others corroborate the results of this
study in the Bell System and it becomes clear that
the mind well trained in youth has the best chance

to succeed in any business it may choose, then schol-
arship as a measure of mental equipment is of im-
portance both to business and to business men.
Business will have a surer guide to the selection of
able young men than it has used in the past, and the
young men who train the muscle of their brains can
feel reasonably certain that such training will add
to their success in business and, in all probability, to
the fruitful and happy use of the leisure which suc-
cess in business will give them.

through such ores merely by using a sufficiently
high frequency.
Unless the ore is about one hundred times as good
a conductor as the surrounding earth no electrical
method gives clear indications. Such a degree of
difference is common, and it is not uncommon to
find ores 10,000 times as good conductors as the
earth. When a current is flowing in a conductor, the
conductor is surrounded by an electromagnetic
"field," a most important characteristic of which is
that unlike an electric current it readily passes
through very poor conductors such as rock and
earth. The chief operation is locating the conductor
(the ore) by determining upon the surface, the
direction from which this field comes. A vacuum-
tube detecting and amplifying apparatus and a "di-
rection-finding" coil of special design are used, not
dissimilar to equipment in shore radio stations for
determining positions of ships at sea, but the coil
is pivoted on a horizontal axis, and works in a ver-
tical plane. By moving the coil and noting the
changes of the "signal" in the receiver the direction
of the ore body from the apparatus can be deter-
mined. The differences of speed of the electromag-
netic waves through air, earth and ore, and other
electric and magnetic effects, however, cause com-
plications, demanding experience in operating.
Research for additional fundamental data is being
continued and with the aid of new facts improve-
ments are being made. Points on the surface of the
ground directly above the ore body can now be
located with considerable accuracy. Accuracy of
depth indications for ores whose depths do not ex-
ceed 250 feet is generally within ten per cent, which
is sufficient for ordinary mining purposes.
Results in the United States and Canada for two
years have proved the general utility of the induc-
tive, or electromagnetic, process of prospecting, but
it will not render the professional mining engineer
or geologist of minor importance. On the contrary,
it is a highly scientific tool for him and may event-
ually greatly decrease the speculation in prospecting
and mining.—A research narrative of the Engineer-
ing Foundation.

Engineers Seek Accurate Gauges as Protection
to Life and Property
Because the safety of human life often depends
upon the accuracy of the pressure gauge on a steam
boiler or other pressure equipment which can ex-
plode, the American Engineers' Standards Commit-
tee has been asked by the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers to approve the establishment
of national standards for pressure gauges. The stan-
dards might provide, for example, for such construc-
tion that the gauge could not indicate a zero pres-
sure when there is actually sufficient pressure to
constitute a grave hazard if a workman should open
a boiler or tank—a cause of loss of life in the past.
Standardization of vacuum gauges is also requested.
Grant of the request by the Standards Committee
will be followed by the formation of a committee of
technical experts to undertake the work of gauge
standardization. Besides decreasing the accident
hazard, it will benefit manufacturers and purchasers
of gauges by replacing the great number of sizes
and types now being manufactured by a compara-
tively small number of standard sizes and types
based upon the findings of the committee of tech-
nical experts.
The U. S. Navy Department has done much im-
portant work in establishing gauge standards for the
use of the Navy, and several private concerns, such
as the Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., the General
Electric Co., and the Pennsylvania Railroad Co.,
have established specifications for their own use. It
is expected that these and other specifications will
be studied and co-ordinated in a national way.
The standardization of pressure and vacuum
gauges may inelude, in addition to specifications for
accuracy and temperature of calibration such items
as rating of capacity; arrangement of graduations,
numerals, indicator hand, and certain features of
the interior mechanism, and the position of the stop
pins. Establishment of standards for test equipment
and standard methods for testing gauges have also
been recommended to the American Engineering
Standards Committee.

There is no sharp dividing line between the respon-

absorption. The performance of individual elements
is secondary to the performance of the combination
—as a unit. The ultimate goal sought is to produce
a dependable supply of steam at minimum cost.
The operation of the Laundry is dependent upon
the performance of this 70 h.p. boiler, while thou-
sands of New Yorkers rely upon the East River Sta-
tion for light, power, transportation and the many
material comforts of life which electricity has made
available.

The Development Of Alternating
Current Substations
By W. F. Wetmore, '20E
Engineering Division, Detroit Edison Co.
AMODERN power system for the supply of elec-
trical energy to a large community is, of neces-
sity, rather complicated. It can, however, be di-
vided roughly into three general groups—genera-
tion, transmission and distribu-
tion. Most of the present large
systems at one time consisted
only of generation and distribu-
tion, as the areas to be covered
were small and transmission, in
the modern sense of the word,
had not become necessary.
The system of The Detroit
Edison Company in particular
consisted, 20 years ago, of gen-
eration at 4800 volts and direct
distribution from the power
station and a few sub-stations
at the same voltage. As the
load increased and the area be-
came greater it was found nec-
essary to adopt a higher volt-
age to give adequate service
and the present 24,000 volt
transmission system was initiated. This 24,000 volt
system developed rapidly into an extensive cable
network feeding the metropolitan area of Detroit
and many miles of overhead lines in the outlying dis-
tricts and suburban communities. As a matter of
interest there are approximately one thousand miles
of cable alone installed at the present time.
The employment of this higher voltage gave rise
to the necessity of transformer stations to step the
AS electricity has advanced
in its position as a public
utility the centralization of power
stations has become more and
more advantageous. Centraliza-
tion required the development of
large distribution systems which
in turn brought about the substa-
tion. How these substations have
developed from the unsightly
group of transformers in a fenced
enclosure to the sightly structures
of today is an example of well
done engineering, modern devel-
opments in substation work form
a very interesting subject. The
whole is nicely discussed by Mr.
Wetmore in this article.

voltage down to 4800 volts for supply to the dis-
tribution system. Such stations were the first of the
present alternating current sub-stations.
In about 1920 it was found that desirable loca-
tions for new generating sta-
tions were at such a distance
from Detroit that 24,000 volts
would be inadequate for the
transmission of the power in-
volved. Accordingly the 120,-
000 volt system was adopted in
connection with the building of
two generating stations north
and south of the city. This sys-
tem gave rise to a second type
of sub-station used for 120,000
volt to 24,000 volt step-down
service. Other sub-stations at
both voltages are required for
sectionalizing the system in
such a way that satisfactory
operation can be obtained un-
der both normal and emergen-
cy conditions. In many stations
this function is combined with the step-down serv-
ice previously mentioned.
The various conditions to be met gave rise to four
general types of sub-stations designated by The De-
troit Edison Company as Classes A, B, C, and D.
Of these, only brief mention will be made of the
Classes B and D as they are the older and better
known types of stations. The Class D sub-stations
are all on the 120 Kv. system and include both high

tension switching and step-down equipment. The
Class B sub-stations are primarily 24 Kv. switching
stations but usually include transformers and 4800
volt feeder equipment as well. This latter class has
many forms as it is the oldest and has gone through-
many stages of development.
The Class A and Class C sub-stations are more

OF ARCHITECTURE BEING USED FOR SUCH STRUCTURES.
UNSIGHTLINESS IS COMPLETELY DONE AWAY WITH
recent types which are becoming of greater import-
ance as supply points to the 4800 volt distribution
system. As the maintenance of service to this sys-
tem is of prime importance to the consumer it is
felt that a description of the design and operation
of these two classes would be of more interest in
general than of those having a more
obscure purpose in the operation of the
system.
Class A Sub-Station
A Class A sub-station is one de-
signed for operation in a district in
which the load is of such a character
that an interruption of a second or two
will have no serious consequences.
This type of load includes residential
and business lighting, and industries
which can endure such an interruption.
In most industrial districts there are
some manufacturing plants requiring
continuous power so that this type of
sub-station is confined principally to
residential districts.
It will be noted from the one line
wiring diagram of a Class A sub-sta-
tion, Figure 1, that the transformers are fed by a
24 Kv. oil circuit breaker. This avoids the building
of a high voltage swiich room or structure as the
cable and transformer operate as a unit with a 24
Kv. switch only at the supply end of the cable.
Each unit is supplied from either a generating sta-
tion or a 24 Kv. switching station and the several
units of any one sub-station do not usually receive
energy from the same source. This latter point is
advantageous in that a failure of one source will not
affect, ordinarily, the supply to the remaining trans-
formers in the sub-station.
The principle of operation is that each trans-
former will supply the load connected to its par-
ticular bus section with the bus tie
switch open. Then, in the event of a
failure in a transformer, cable, or
source of supply, the low voltage trans-
former switch of the unit affected will
be opened and the corresponding bus
tie switch closed, thereby restoring
service to that bus section. This
"throw-over" feature is entirely auto-
matic and takes but a second or two to
accomplish. There is, however, a
momentary loss of voltage on the feed-
ers from the section of bus affected
which, while not serious for lighting,
would be troublesome for certain man-
ufacturing processes.
Most of the Class A sub-stations
have automatic reclosing 4800 volt
feeders with automatic voltage regu-
lators so that they may be unattended except for
routine inspection and maintenance.
The physical arrangement of the newer sub-sta-
tions of this type is rather simple as the electrical
conditions to be met are not very complicated. The
second floor equipment consists principally of the

4800 volt bus and oil circuit breakers. The first floor
is arranged with the voltage regulators in rooms
adjacent to the outside walls to facilitate ventilation
and installation or removal. The center aisle is
used as a control switchboard room and has provi-
sion for transferring circuit during inspection and
maintenance on the various pieces of equipment.

One end of the building is devoted to stairways, a
hoist, battery charging set and miscellaneous equip-
ment.
The transformers are located outdoors and. being
of what is known as a pothead type, require no
structure. Both the high tension and low tension
cables are carried directly into compartments
mounted on the transformer which are filled with
oil and take the place of the more conventional pot-
head. This arrangement avoids the use of exposed
connections and their rather unsightly supporting
framework.
Inasmuch as this type of sub-station is usually
located in a residential district the matter of ex-
ternal appearances is of prime importance. Accord-
ingly, considerable care is taken in designing a
building that will harmonize with its surroundings.
The photograph of I'ingree Sub-station, Figure 2,
illustrates the type of architecture used for the more
recent sub-stations.
The transformers are rated (&gt;000 Kv-a. and, for a
station having a wiring diagram similar to Figure 1,

the maximum load which can be carried on any
group of two bus sections is 9000 Kv-a. This is due
to the fact that any one unit is subject to the load
of two sections upon the operation of the automatic
throwover equipment. While these transformers
have a continuous rating of 6000 Kv-a. they are de-
signed to carry 50 per cent overload for four hours
under winter conditions.
This reserve capacity would mean excessive in-
vestment for a sub-station having a large number of
transformers and, to avoid this condition, an ar-
rangement shown by the wiring diagram. Figure 3,
is employed. One transformer is used as a spare for
any number of units so that the total capacity of the
sub-station is equal to the total number of trans-
formers minus one. The larger the station the less
the percentage of spare capacity required.
The automatic throwover feature is provided but
it operates between each circuit bus and the transfer
bus instead of between two circuit bus sections as is
the case in the smaller sub-stations.
Class C Sub-Station
A Class C sub-station is somewhat more compli-
cated than one of the Class A type due to the fact
that it must be designed to give the uninterrupted
type of service required by the majority of indus-
tries. Briefly, this requirement means that the loss
of a cable or transformer supplying any one bus sec-
tion must not interrupt the feed to this section.
FIG. 3: DIAGRAM OF A CLASS C SUB-STATION
This requirement is met by tying all bus sections
to a common bus through reactors. Such an ar-
rangement allows the use of a large number of
transformers without the necessity of installing oil
circuit breakers of unreasonably high interrupting
capacity. If all buses were to be tied directly to-
Each transformer and its 24 Kv. cable are treated
gether, the short circuit current would be excessive,
as a unit, just as in a Class A sub-station, except
that the units are of greater capacity. However, all
transformers must be fed from a common supply
point due to the fact that they are all tied together
on the 4800 volt side through the "linkage" bus. To
feed them from other than a common supply point
makes the proper division of load between cables
difficult, if not impossible.
In the event of the loss of a transformer, the feed
to the corresponding bus section is maintained
through the linkage bus. There is a drop in voltage
but this is compensated by changes in regulator ad-

justments. If desired, this load can be thrown over
to the transfer bus and this bus fed from the re-
maining transformers through a tie to one of the
transformer buses.

Automobile Air Cleaners
By C. S. Kegerreis
Chief Engineer, The Tillolson Manufacturing Co.
THE air cleaner has been used for years on
tractors. Trucks have more recently adopted
them and industrial power plants have also
used this device for quite some time. The tractor,
probably has the most severe operating condition
because its daily life is usually spent in the broken
field. In this line extreme care is exercised to use
gaskets at all joints of the carburetor intake to stop
air leaks wherever possible, in fact, extremes are
used in different types of air cleaners to get positive
cleaning of the dust particles. With the advent of
the small garden tractor, it has been found that

these power cultivators last only a period of six
weeks or two months before the necessity of re-
grinding and replacing pistons is apparent. With
the use of good air cleaners this overhaul period has
been extended to at least a year or over. Many other
instances could be cited showing wear on various
vehicles including the automobile but it is believed
that this is unnecessary as this information is read-
ily available.2
It is true that each year brings more paved roads,
yet the larger percentage still lies with the dirt,
gravel and stone roads. These secondary roads, par-
ticularly where reasonable travel is found, necessi-
tates cleaners just as much as in tractor operation.

pavement is unknown and from surveys made, the
grit and sand cause extreme piston and cylinder
wear.3 From various sources of information, the
composition of carbon in the engine cylinder has
been found to contain a large amount of silica.4 It
is understood this acts as a nucleus to which the
carbon particles will cling and thus accelerate the
carbon formation. Be that as it may, the air cleaner
is important and should form a part of the standard
equipment.
Writh the use of well designed cleaners, the dirt
caught in driving under various road conditions is
shown in the following micrographs. Fig. 1 shows
the type of common road dirt caught in a cleaner
driving on gravel roads. This material was caught
by a centrifugal cleaner and illustrates that not only
the extremely large particles but the small, almost
microscopic portions are present. Particles are
shown as large as .003 or .004 inches in diameter
and as small as .0001. The driving on sand roads
which is illustrated in micrograph 2 shows the ab-
sence of the very small particles and only the col-
lection of rather uniform grain; the car was driven
on lake shore roads. Many engineers state that
when driving on pavement or in city traffic, no
dirt is encountered. Fig. 3 shows a portion of dirt
caught in thirty-six miles of city driving, all on
paved streets and at twenty-five miles per hour or
below. A closer inspection of this cut will at once
prove that not all of the larger particles are coal
dust, cinders, but many of the particles are sand

grains with sharp corners and compare favorably
with the larger size grains found on the sandy roads.
The absence of extremely fine particles prove, how-
ever, that at slower driving speeds fewer micro-
scopic particles are caught, and, as will be explained

later, the centrifugal type of cleaner cannot remove
these at the extremely slow speeds. Considering all
these micrographs, the sharpness of the particles can
be compared to the valve grinding compound illus-
trated in Fig. 4. The result is self-explanatory.
Without the use of air cleaners, the contamination
of crankcase oil is illustrated very well in the fol-
lowing two cuts (Fig. 5 and 6): Fig. 5 shows the
new oil as entering the engine. This car was op-

erated under average every-day driving for 1200
miles, the oil drained and a specimen photographed
as shown. The larger particles of dirt enter the
combustion chamber, become absorbed in the oil
film, exact their toll at the cylinder wall and piston
and then find their way to the sump as the condition
illustrated. The particles are reduced to an infini-
tesimal size as shown by a magnification of 150
diameters.
Types of Cleaners
There are two general types of air cleaners used
in the automobile industry, filters and centrifugal
cleaners. The pure filtering type of cleaner must, of
necessity, be more efficient at low speeds than at
high. Given a homogeneous filtering element, the
impinging velocity of the dirt in the air stream is
low, hence the filtering element readily arrests the
particle and allows the air to pass through nearly
100 per cent pure. As the car speed or air flow rate
increases, the dirt particles have greater momentum
and tend to bombard their way through the filtering
element, with the result of lowered efficiency. As
is inherent with every filter, the element in time
becomes filled and the restriction across the filter is
increased. This, it appears, is the greatest defect of
this type of cleaner. Given proper care ,a filter can
be made extremely efficient and not affect the car-
buretor metering or the top speed of the car. Many
filters, however, are designed to eliminate the plug-

ging condition by utilizing more open elements.
This, of course, lowers the cleaning efficiency and
is then merely a compromise of the original prob-
lem.
The centrifugal cleaners show the rev erse type of
curve, as regards cleaning efficiency in that at idle
or low car speeds, the efficiency is lower. As fifteen
to twenty-five miles per hour the air flow is suf-
ficiently great to cause ample centrifugal action,
hence the curve rises abruptly with the result—high
cleaning efficiency throughout the driving and
higher ranges. It was originally thought the cen-
trifugal cleaner is of necessity restricted; that is, in
order to obtain the proper cleaning at the lower
velocities, the centrifugal action causes undue re-
striction at the top speeds. It is believed that this
is not necessarily the case as is proved later.
Air Cleaner Testing Plant
Before reporting any data, a short description of
the methods of obtaining cleaning efficiency and re-
sistance to flow may be of interest. Considerable
technical information is already available."'
Comparing different authorities' work, certain
portions are accepted as basic. For instance, dust
density on different types of roads is rather well
established. The specific gravity of the dust itself
was also found to be satisfactory. The main prob-
lem was the design of a plant to duplicate car con-
ditions of the road in the laboratory. This is illus-
trated in Fig. 7. Consequently, a dust chamber was
built of sheet metal, provided with a glass door, the
size being sufficiently large that air cleaners would

Road Books And Road Maps
By John S. Worley
Professor of Transportation
BY Road Books and Road Maps we mean a
book having individual maps for the principal
highways of a state similar to the Automobile
Blue Book with which everyone is familiar, and the
various Highway Maps as issued by the Highway
Commissions of the states, or similar publications.
It may seem strange to us
that three thousand to thirty-
five hundred years prior to the
publication of any such road
book or map, there were exten-
sive hard surfaced road sys-
tems. These hard surfaced road
systems were inferior, in no re-
spect, to our most modern
roads of today. In many things
they were superior. Today
near Cnossos, on the island of
Crete, there remains a hard
surfaced road in such a state
of preservation that the mod-
ern automobile can be operated
thereover at a high rate of
speed. This highway was con-
structed about 1500 B. C.
Two hundred years before
the beginning of the Christian
Era, Rome began to construct
a system of hard-surfaced
roads which eventually reached from Rome to prac-
tically every Roman province and the principal
parts of every Roman province—from Great Britain
and the North Sea to southern India and the Indian
Ocean. By 200 A. D. the Roman road system ap-
proximated 150,000 miles of hard surfaced roads
with tunnels, arch bridges and other structures

Our first road map1 is of this vast system of high-
ways constructed by the Roman Empire. This map
was made in the third century A. D. by a Roman,
name unknown, and later cop-
ied and incorporated by Nico-
las Bergier in his two volume
work, Histoire des Grands Che-
mins de L'Empire Roman,
Brussels, 1728.2 The map as
drawn is badly out of propor-
tion. The roads as shown con-

Ventilating Vehicular Tunnels
By A. C. FlELDNER
Chief Engineer, Experiment Stations Division, U. S. Bureau of Mines
THOUSANDS of persons motor daily between
New Jersey and New York through the fam-
ous Holland Tunnels under the Hudson River.
When these tunnels were proposed, many engineers
doubted whether it would be possible to render them
safe for passenger traffic. Research has solved the
problems. Exhaust gases from automobiles contain
from one to fifteen per cent of carbon monoxide,
varying with operating conditions. This gas, a
deadly poison, has no color, taste or smell, and is
nearly of the same weight as air. The commissions
of the States of New York and New Jersey co-oper-
ated with the U. S. Bureau of Mines in research on:
1, quantity and composition of exhaust gases from
motor vehicles under tunnel conditions; 2, maxi-
mum percentage of carbon monoxide permissible in
tunnel atmosphere; 3, power required to move the
air demanded for adequate ventilation; 4, best
method of introducing and removing the ventilating
air; 5, sizes and positions of the ventilating ducts.
To obtain information on quantity and compo-
sition, the Bureaus, at its Pittsburgh Experiment
Station, made tests on 101 passenger cars and trucks
of various capacities taken from service, without
adjustment, so that the gases were representative
of actual operating conditions. An accurately gradu-
ated tube containing the gasoline to be used was
attached to each carburetor.
Apparatus for collecting the gas sample was at-
tached to each exhaust pipe. Each car was run over
a one-mile course at speeds of 6, 10 and 15 miles
per hour. Another course having a 3 per cent grade
was also used. Tests were made with engines rac-
ing, idling and accelerating, imitating conditions in
the tunnel when crowded with cars starting after a
blockade.
Research to determine the maximum allowable
percentage of carbon monoxide was conducted by
Professor Yandell Henderson, consulting physiolo-
gist, Bureau of Mines, at the Physiological Labora-
tory of Yale Medical School. Animals were sub-
jected to synthetic atmospheres containing 1 to 10
parts per 10.000 parts of air, and later Dr. Hender-
son and his associates subjected themselves and
students at Yale University to these tests. The
physiologists concluded that if the carbon monoxide
were not allowed to exceed 4 parts to 10.000 parts
of air, there would be no noticeable effects from
exposures not exceeding one hour. With knowledge
of the quantity given off by various types of auto-
mobiles and trucks and an estimate of the maximum
vehicular capacity of the tunnel, it was possible for
the engineers to compute how much carbon monox-
ide must be removed to maintain the required
standard.
To determine the flow of air and the power re-
quired to move the air in ducts and openings such
as would be used in the tunnel, a half-sized duct
300 feet long, and full-sized elbows of several pat-
terns were built at the University of Illinois Engi-
neering Experiment Station.
The final check was obtained by building a model
tunnel at the experimental mine of the Bureau of
Mines, at Bruceton, near Pittsburgh, having ducts
similar to those proposed for the Holland Tunnels,
and an axial length of 400 feet; it was approximately
9 feet wide and 8 feet high. Above the ceiling was
an air duct 3 feet high, and below the floor another
2^2 feet high. Either duct could be used for intro-
ducing fresh air, or for exhausting contaminated air.
The tunnel was sufficiently large to accommodate
small five passenger cars. It was equipped with sen-
sitive apparatus for measuring temperature, humid-
ity, quantity, velocity and pressure of the air; 48
air-sampling tubes were installed on eight cross-
sections, to obtain samples for chemical analysis,
and to determine the diffusion and concentration
of the exhaust gases with different methods of ven-
tilation.
In these tests 10 cars were spaced at 40-foot in-
tervals and operated at a speed of 10 miles. Tests
were made with various methods of introducing
fresh air and removing the contaminated air. Each
driver and observer was subjected to physiological
examinations before and after the tests. The actual
quantity of carbon monoxide absorbed by each per-
son was determined by examining a few drops of
blood drawn immediately after the test. Introduc-
tion of fresh air at the bottom of the tunnel and
removal of foul air at the top was more efficient
than the reverse. The chemical and engineering
sciences enabled the designing engineers to calcu-
late their ventilating system with great accuracy.
After its completion, tests of tunnel atmosphere
showed results exactly as predicted.
Important factors in maintaining adequate ven-
tilation are automatic carbon monoxide recording
machines invented by the staff of the Pittsburgh
Experiment Station for the Holland Tunnels. They

EDITORIALS
TALKS FROM THE DEAN
'Co-operation
The Editor of "The Technic" has suggested an
innovation, namely that instead of calling upon the
Dean for one or possibly two lengthy articles dur-
ing the year, he would place at his disposal a part
of the space in each issue. As a dutiful servant of
the college I have agreed to conform to his desire,
and, I may add, with a great deal of pleasure.
A newcomer to an executive position in any or-
ganization has a number of worries and cares thrust
upon him, and I feel that one which probably
causes the most concern is: "Will he have the
hearty co-operation of all those associated with
him?" One of our greatest leaders of industry,
Charles M. Schwab, realized the fact that co-opera-
tion was the keynote to success, when he made the
statement that he wanted "everyone to work with
him and not for him." W hile a university or more
specifically a professional school has problems some-
what different from an industrial concern, it is nev-
ertheless true that a sympathetic co-operation be-
tween officers, faculty and students, can do much
towards the ultimate success, not only of the in-
stitution but of the students themselves.
As this is the first of a series of what might be
termed "talks," rather than what an editor might
call "articles," I would like it to be considered in
the nature of an introduction which I hope may lead
in time to a real friendship between the students
and myself. I want you to feel that any success that
may come to the college is primarily connected
most intimately with your success. After all the
reputation of any university does not rest solely
upon its faculty and equipment, important though
these may be. The type of man which it has mould-
ed, and the success to which he may attain in the
great world outside, are the real proof upon which
such reputation must ultimately rest. You perhaps
do not realize what it means to a member of the
faculty when, in after years an alumnus who has
made a real success in life, comes back to greet his
old professor, and to tell him what their early asso-
ciation has meant to him. The point I wish to em-
phasize is this: we of the faculty are not anxious
or desirous of having you turn out failures, but of
doing what we can to make your successes.
This leads me to emphasize one thought which
has an important bearing upon the question of co-
operation to which I have referred. From time to
time you will be faced with certain rules and regu-
lations of the institution which you may consider
irksome. You as engineers, must realize that in our
profession experience is absolutely and fundamen-
tally the factor upon which success must ultimately
depend. Through years of experience certain gen-
eral methods of operation of any organization have
been proved to be the most beneficial, and those
which make for success. While real constructive
criticism should always be welcome, it is well to
keep in mind that one should first be thoroughly
informed of all the facts before jumping to a hasty
conclusion.
When you go out into the world you will have to
conform to the general rules and regulations of any
organization to which you may be attached, and if
you don't—well, you know what will happen. Why
not begin now to get this attitude of mind as part of
your education? A chronic "knocker" never gets
anywhere, mainly because in nine cases out of ten
he has not troubled to find out all the facts.
Let me pass on to you, in conclusion, a piece of
advice which w7as given to me by a very shrewd
and successful engineer, when, as a youngster, I
entered the university: "Young man, if you want
to be a success in life, don't be too fussy about
your rights."

Largest Steam Turbine Under Construction
A turbo-generator now under construction by the
General Electric Company for the New York Edi-
son Company is believed to be the largest single-
shaft, single-unit electric generator in the world.
It will be located in the new East River generating
station of the New York Edison Company at Four-
teenth St. The machine will develop 160,000 kw.,
or 215,000 hp.
The steam-generating units to be used in connect-
ion with the new turbo-generator will also be of
unprecedented size. Four units will be installed,
having an aggregate heating surface of 45,120 sq.
ft. each. Each of the four will produce 550,000 lbs.
of steam per hour.
In addition, the generating station will contain
the largest pumping station in the world, with a
total capacity or the circulating pumps of the con-
densers of 1,400,000 gal. of water a minute. This is
double the quantity of water used by the New York
City water supply. It will be taken directly from
the East River and returned as rapidly as used.

More Powerful Cathode Rays
Remarkable and rapid advances in synthetic
chemistry are promised through the use of high-
speed electronic bombardment, which is made avail-
able by the Coolidge cathode-ray tube. High-speed
electron bombardment provides a new and powerful
instrument for upsetting the stability of many types
of molecule and atom, transforming them to other
types of stable compound, thus providing a rapid
and efficient process, for replacing old and expensive
methods, and in many cases offering a means for
transformation hitherto unknown or thought to be
impossible. High-velocity cathode rays have long
been available within the confines of the vacuum
tube, but these conditions do not lend themselves
readily to the chemical transformations referred to.
The Coolidge high-voltage tube provides a means
for bringing the cathode rays through a window
into the open, where different materials may be
readily subjected to their influence. Announcement
now comes from Germany that Prof. H. Plauson has
effected such improvements in the Coolidge tube as
to make possible a very great intensification of ionic
activity. The improvements consist of the use of
the metal beryllium instead of nickel for the window
in the tube and of a rotating magnetic field for con-
trolling the electron stream. The new tube is said
to convert quickly the waste products of petroleum
stills and coke ovens into rubber, alcohol, acetic acid
and valuable drugs and perfumes. It is also stated
that moist air is converted directly into nitric acid,
that synthetic rubber may be made with astonishing
rapidity, and that with cold water and air as raw-
materials it is possible to make alcohol, methanol,
acetic acid, ether and other such products. In fact,
the claims that are made for this new agent are so
remarkable that, if they are substantiated, it would
appear that an entirely new era in synthetic chem-
istry is opening. It is to be hoped that these claims,
which appear at present almost extravagant, will be
duly substantiated by repetition and scientific re-
port. Accounts of such further studies will be
awaited with the keenest interest.

hope soon began to rise. For, is it to be expected
that Michigan shall have always a winning team
and never a losing team That is not natural. We
must expect an off year now and then, just as we,
the major complainers, expect to flunk blue books
once or twice during our four years of college.
As long as we have a fighting team which can take
a defeat, then train and fight harder to take a
lesser defeat the next time from a stronger op-
ponent, we have a team of which we can be justly
proud.
That is just what the team has done so far. The
first game was not a very excellent display of foot-
ball tactics. It was loose and the team did not
seem to be fighting its hardest. The Indiana game
was much better in all respects. The line was bet-
ter co-ordinated and fought hard to hold on the
defense and make holes on the offense. The back-
field worked smoother and quicker. The Ohio
game was even better than the Indiana game.
Every player was in there playing his hardest and
best trying to overcome a more experienced and
a stronger team.
All that the team needs is more experience un-
der fire and the practice which will come as the
season progresses. It needs too the loyalty of the
student body and of the alumni, and of those hold-
ers of the choice fifty yard seats so many qf which
were vacant during the first two games. At the
present rate of progress the team will be as good
as ever by the end of the season with a bright out-
look for next year.

Department of Mechanical Engineering
The Department of Mechanical Engineering has
made no changes either in its teaching or its execu-
tive personnel but retains the entire staff of last
year.
The department has been quite actively engaged
in research work during the last school year. Some
of the projects undertaken by the department are
nearly completed while others are just begun. Prof.
Fessenden has been investigating the effect of paint-
ing radiators on heat transmission and radiation.
This project has been in progress for nearly a
year and is in a stage of near completion. Prof.
Emswiler has been working on a project the pur-
pose of which is to determine the flow of air and
the loss of heat through the middle sash of win-
dows. Prof. Keeler has just started a research
for the Consolidated Gas Company of Chicago.
The Buick Motor Car Company gave the Auto-
motive Department a new chassis to be put on ex-
hibition.
o
Department of Civil Engineering
The Department of Civil Engineering has se-
cured the services of Arne A. Jakkula who is a
graduate of Civil Engineering at the University
of Minnesota. He is teaching structural engineer-
ing.
Several changes have been made in the organi-
zation of the department incident to Prof. Riggs'
retirement on leave of absence. Prof. Gram has
been promoted from Professor of Structural Engi-
neering to Professor of Civil Engineering in charge
of the department. Prof. Cissel has been promoted
to full professorship in charge of his department.
Prof. Morrison has been advanced from Assist-
ant Professor to Professor of Highway Engineering
and Highway Transportation.
o
Aeronautical Department
Due to the large increase in the enrollment of
students in the Aeronautical Department several
new appointments have been made to increase the
teaching staff. Asst. Prof. Brown is taking the
place of Prof. Kerber who is on a one year leave
of absence. Grey, Konecznoc. Blaylock, and Elli-
cock are four teaching assistants added to the
staff. The department now has an enrollment of
about one hundred and eighty students and is the

In the Spotlight
Richard J. Williams
Department of
Geodesy and
Surveying
There has been for
some time considerable
agitation concerning the possibility of securing a
summer surveying camp in a country more adequate
for the type of work undertaken by the Depart-
ment of Geodesy and Surveying. Camp Davis has
many limitations set upon it due to the country
surrounding it. Although it may be good training
to meet the most adverse conditions possible when
a student is studying surveying it is better to have
a location in which most of the available time may
be spent in solving surveying problems and in ob-
taining practice in the use of instruments rather
than in learning how to clear away brush and other
things which are not conducive to learning the
theory of surveying. For this reason it has been
contemplated to change the location of Camp Davis.
So during the past summer four members of the
faculty made a trip to Wyoming to inspect the
Jackson Hole Country which has been pronounced
If perchance you have never
heard of Richard J. Williams don't
be alarmed—most people haven't.
Hut if you have never heard of one
"Jamie" Williams, engineer, athlete,
and scholar, you haven't been
around the campus even enough to
know that the only angels of Angel
Hall are those that can be found
smoking cigarettes in Crippen's
Subway.
"Jamie" came over from Detroit a few years ago and
entered the Engineering College and having never found
it necessary to retreat to the Lit. school he is still an engi-
neer. During his freshman year he tried a hand at politics
and was elected to the office of vice-president of his class.
The next year he gave up politics in favor of athletics, try-
ing out for both football and track. He made the varsity
reserve team and in the spring he showed considerable
promise as a hammer thrower. As a junior he became a
member of Triangles Honorary Society of which he later
became president. This year fie is at it harder than ever,
playing right tackle on the varsity football squad, filling
the office of treasurer of the senior class, and as vice-presi-
dent of Tau Reta Pi. He is also a member of Vulcans
Honorary Society. Although we are not aiming to give a
catalogue of "Jamie's" activities, we might just as well add
also that "Jamie" is president of his fraternity, which is no
small job unless Beta Thcta Pi is much different from most
fraternities and that he has managed to maintain a schol-
astic average of 3.4. Perhaps after all he is worthy of the
more pretentious name of Richard J.
ideal for the purposes of a surveying camp. The
following are extracts from the log of the trip made
by Professors Johnson, Brodie, Carey and Bouchard.
Written by Prof. Johnson.
Prof. Johnson was the only one of the party who
was acquainted with the country previous to trip.
"One of the most important secondary advan-
tages to the student, should a western camp be
established, is the op-
portunity for travel in
a beautiful valley and
to be able to visit the
Yellowstone Park ana1
to inspect some im-
portant engineering
works. These advan-
tages were brought to
the attention of Presi-
dent Little and Dean
Cooley during the past
year. Upon their rec-
ommendation to the
Board of Regents, a
sum of $875.00 was ap-
propriated last spring
to enable the staff of
the Department of Geo-
desy and Surveying to
investigate possible
camp sites in Wyom-
ing."
"The writer was anx-
ious that other mem-
bers of the staff have an
opportunity to see the
Jackson Hole Country
and neighboring locali-
ties. He left Camp
Davis one week early
and departed for Wyoming on the following Mon-
day accompanied by Professor Brodie. The railroad
journey ended at Cheyenne. Professor Brodie pro-
ceeded from there by highway bus to Moran, which
is located at the northern margin of the Jackson
Hole Country. The writer found Dr. Elwood Mead,
Commissioner of Reclamation Service, Governor
Frank C. Emerson and Mr. John A. Whiting, State
Engineer, awaiting him. Both Mr. Emerson and
Mr. Whiting are Michigan Engineers of the class
of 1904. Dr. Elwood Mead received his Doctor's
Degree at Michigan in 1925. They had planned
an automobile trip to Yellowstone Park and the
Jackson Hole Country.
On Thursday morning, August 16, we drove to
Cody, Wyoming, which is about 90 miles cast of
Yellowstone Park. This is one of the most inter-
esting localities in the country, from the stand-

point of engineering works and natural forma-
tions."
"Professors Carey and Bouchard left Ann Arbor
on Sunday, August 19, and reached Cheyenne the
following Monday evening."
State Engineer Whiting, Professor Brodie and
the writer began an examination of Snake River
Valley for possible camp sites. The upper half of
the valley was fairly well explored by the time
Professors Carey and Bouchard arrived. But one
site that could be considered favorably was found
in these two days. We returned to this site after
Professors Carey and Bouchard arrived in order
that they might pass judgment on it. It is sit-
uated about five miles north of Jackson Lake on
Pilgrim Creek. The site has enough defects so
that a final decision regarding it was suspended
until other parts of the valley could be visited.
By Thursday afternoon of the same week, we had
inspected both sides of the valley as far south as
the town of Jackson, 32 miles from Moran. The
exploration extended below Jackson on Friday
morning, when we were accompanied by Mr. A. C.
McCain, Forest Supervisor and by Mr. O. M. Wil-
liams, a local surveyor. When we reached the
Hoback River, twenty miles south of Jackson, we
found a site which seemed to offer every advantage
that we sought. This was carefully inspected
during the day and on Saturday morning we re-
turned to make a more detailed survey. Our first
impressions have been supported by data obtained
by actual measurements. We are satisfied that
we have found a splendid site for such a camp as
ours. Professors Carey and Bouchard remained
to complete the preliminary survey while Mr. Whit-
ing, Professor Brodie and the writer departed at
noon for Rock Springs on the Union Pacific Railway
and the Lincoln Highway."
o
Department of Naval Architecture
The Department of Naval Architecture has se-
cured the services of a man who has had consider-
able experience in the construction and recondition-
ing of various types of naval craft. He is quite well
acquainted with Ann Arbor and the University hav-
ing been born here and having received the degrees
of A. B. and M. S. in the University. He received
his M. S. in 1915 after which he started to work
for the New York Shipbuilding Corporation as a
ship fitter. After a few months of illness he was
transferred to the Hull Scientific Department of the
same corporation where he worked in the Naval
Architect's Office. From 1919 to 1922 he was in
charge of the hull scientific work in connection with
the reconditioning of several ships among which
was the Leviathan. Since 1922 he has been in
charge of the hull scientific work for Gibbs Broth-
ers, Incorporated. He made several round trips
with the Leviathan acting as a consulting engineer
in regards to the fueling of the ship. Prof. Adams
has written several papers on different phases of
Naval Architecture among which is one entitled
"Methods of Finding the Metacentric Height of
Vessels for Operating Purposes and the Application
of Graphics to the Solution of the Problem."
o
The Aero Club
The year 1928-29 gives promise of being a most
memorable one in the history of the Aero Club.
Due to falacies in the old constitution, it has been
considerably revised and this year will mark the
beginning of a new era in the Club's existence.
Instead of limiting the membership to Upperclass-
men, the society has become All-Campus in nature.
Anyone who is. interested in Aeronautics is eligible
for membership. In addition to this important
change, Underclassmen will be given a share in its
administration. The direction of the club under
this new plan will be carried on by W. E. Koneczny,
President; L. M. Ball, Vice-President; J. T. Elliott,
Secretary, and S. B. Chadman, Treasurer.
In keeping with such a radical and beneficial
change, a most varied and active program is being
arranged. The activities of the club will be di-
vided into two parts, the Balloon section under
the Chairmanship of F. D. Kaufmann and the
Glider section with R. Evans as Chairman. The
Balloon section conducts trips at various intervals,
one of which was completed a few weeks ago when
a party of students took off from Ann Arbor and
landed in Canada. It is planned to obtain a new
balloon for the society which will be entered in
the Gordon Bennett Races. The Glider section is
a rather recent development and will begin its activi-
ties this winter. A training glider will be purchased
and used on a site near Ann Arbor.
In addition to the two sections, the club has reg-
ular meetings and already has some very excellent
speakers arranged for. These include Mr. Walker
of the Evans Gliders Company, Eddie Rickenbacker,
Mr. Stout of the Stout Aircraft Corporation, Brock
and Schlee, and Mr. E. Evans, a record Around the
World Flyer. Inspection trips to the Stout Aircraft
Corporation and also to the Aircraft Development
Company, have been planned.
It is hoped that with such a varied program, con-
siderable interest will be evidenced by the Student
Body and that the Club may prosper as never be-
fore.
o
The Ohio Game
We hate to recall old rankling sores, nevertheless
we feel that the part played by the representatives
of the Engineering School in that most undesired
defeat at the hands of Ohio State is worthy of most
hearty commendation. Along with the rest of the

team they fought to the last and their work can
make us truly proud of them. Many of our number
journeyed down to Columbus to see the game and,
even though we lost, still felt proud of their school
and its team. Ohio made the most of its long sought
victory and Saturday night marked a celebration
such as has not been seen on our Campus for many
a day. We're afraid that a student body, such as
our own, so long under such a paternal atmosphere
as we now exist in, would scarcely know how to
conduct an appropriate celebration, if one of our
teams should stage a brilliant victory. At least,
we hope not. But for all of that, we are proud of
our team and especially of those from the "engine
school" who played so hard and well.

A. S. M. E.
The Student Branch of the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers held their second meeting
on Tuesday, October 23rd. At that time about
fifty men signed up for the coming year. The Club
hopes to attain a membership of around a hundred
members.
A number of the members plan to take a trip
with Prof. Lay of the Automotive Department to
the General Motors Proving Grounds some time in
the near future.
At the last meeting a new idea was inaugurated
which promises to be one of the outstanding features
of the meetings provided that the members take it
upon themselves to put it across. At each meeting
one or two of the members will deliver an address
or read a paper on some subject in the field of
engineering. At the last meeting a couple of the
fellows told of their experiences on a balloon trip
which they took from Detroit. Cookson. Kaufman,
Babcock and Gale, were the fellows who made the
trip. They left the Detroit Aircraft Development
Grounds around midnight with a balloon and a
pilot furnished by the Detroit Aircraft Develop-
ment Company. About eight hours later they
came down north of London, Ontario. Being quite
considerably hungry they tied their balloon to a
tree as one would tie a horse to a hitching post and
made their way to the nearest lunch stand for the
much needed Pep, coffee and doughnuts. After ob-
taining adequate ballast they returned to their ship
and again took to the air. They landed again about
three hours later and then returned to Detroit by
train.
o
Transportation Club
At the last meeting of the Transportation Club
there were about twenty men present. Some new
officers were elected for the present year. Clark
Harris was elected President, Claude Gage, Vice
President, and Martin Fritter, Secretary and Treas-
urer. Plans for trips, speakers, etc., were discussed
but no definite arrangements were made. The Club
meets twice a month on Wednesday nights in Room
1213 of the East Engineering Building. Anyone
interested in any phase of transportation engineer-
ing is urged to attend.
o
Technic Delegation Invades Mid-West
The first we knew about it was when Bill Wil-
liams, with his air of mystery, began pouring over
road maps which appeared to center their attention
about the great midwest, the principal goal being
the city of Lincoln, Nebraska, somewhere beyond
the state where the tall corn grows. It was then
that we discovered that the Nebraska Blue Print
was entertaining the E. C. M. A. at its annual con-
vcnti( n, and, of course, we knew that "Barney"
would never consent to go all the way to Lincoln
alone on the train when a flying trip could be made
by five sturdy Michiganders in a matter of some 24
hours with/'Bill's" able piloting. It was only log-
ical that J.a'ck Congo, whom all will recall as one of
TechnicVgreatest editors, should be taken along by
the expedition, having never attended a convention
of E. C. M. A. before. Also Ted Will, known to
some as "Whipper", must necessarily be along to
properly represent the business staff. "Bill's"
brother, "Ken", who helped furnish the Graham-
Page in which the expedition was accomplished
added a fifth to the party.
That was all we knew about it at first, but Sunday
morning when the quintet arrived back in Ann
Arbor with the spoils from five states decorating
their chariot, we knew that the expedition had been
successful. Since that time reports have been cir-
culating and it seems that the Technic did invade
the middle west in fact as well as fiction, and was
next in number to the highest representation at the
convention. Whether it was from force of numbers
or not, we arc not sure, but we do know that the
expedition came back brimming over with ideas
which, they say, are going to make the Technic
a magazine that will be hard to beat. There are
also rumors that the delegates all enjoyed them-
selves immensely during their stay at Lincoln,
aside from what they saw and heard at the conven-
tion.
We are not sure, but we thought we heard some
mention of the Tri-Delts, at the University of Ne-
braska, and what they had to do with a convention
of engineers we cannot conjecture, but there must
be some reason why the expedition did not leave
Lincoln until two o'clock Saturday morning. After
the quintet recover some of their lost sleep they
may be able to tell us more about it, but at the pres-
ent we are rushed off to press with the above.

Echoes from the Graduates
Howard Earle Coffin
ON the afternoon of May 21, 1925, a very select
group of America's foremost capitalists and
bankers met in Chicago to complete plans
for the nation's greatest aircraft transportation
organization. Howard Earle Coffin, of Detroit, was
named as president. As a man who has done much
toward the advancement of great undertakings in
Detroit during the past twenty-
five years, and as a man who
has long been a prominent fig-
ure in the country's great en-
gineering undertakings, Mr.
Coffin is, indeed, the man to
head the National Air Trans-
port, Inc.
Mr. Coffin, president and one
of the founders of the Hudson
Motor Car Company, attained
nation wide prominence in 1916
when, as chairman of the Naval
Consulting Board's industrial
preparedness program, he took
charge of the country's first se-
rious preparation for its en-
trance into the World War. In
this connection, Secretary of
War Newton D. Baker, de-
clared that he had rendered
"perhaps the greatest service
that has been done for America
by any private citizen in the last fifty years."
For 10 years he was a figure in national defense.
Appointed a member of the Naval Consulting
Board in 1915, the following year a member of the
Advisory Committee of the Council of National
Defense, and as chairman of the Aircraft Board of
the United States from May, 1917, to April, 1918,
he brought about the standardization of industry in
the manufacture of war supplies, such as even he
himself had never before dreamed of, although
standardization had been his endeavor in his work
in the automobile industry.
At the close of hostilities he was sent to Europe,
where he remained until 1919. Upon his return, he
HOWARD EARLE COFFIN
was named a member of the American Aviation
Mission, and was sent back to investigate activities
and methods of organization in effect or contem-
plated in England, France, Italy, and Germany. In
recognition of his services in national defense, in
1925 President Coolidge appointed him a member
of the President's Board of Aircraft Inquiry, in
which the views of Col. Wil-
liam Mitchell figured prom-
inently.
As a "dollar-a-year man,"
when chairman of the Aircraft
Production Board, one of the
most important subsidiaries of
the Council of National De-
fense, he tackled the job of
turning out 20,000 planes a
year. Before Congress had
provided anything but a small
appropriation for the council,
Mr. Coffin rented offices in
Washington at his own ex-
pense, and paid the salaries of
a staff of workers who were
helping him in his work of
standardizing the industrial
plants throughout the country
in the manufacture of war mu-
nitions. Upon the entrance of
the United States into the
war, he dropped munitions, which he had started
making in his own automobile plant, and turned
his attention to the standardization of an engine
for airplanes. As the direct result of this, the Lib-
erty motor came into being. As in munitions, so
in planes, his creed was standardization, in order
that the thousands of industrial plants throughout
the country could turn out the same product,
whether engines, wings, or bodies of planes.
He was the first civilian called into aircraft work,
and aroused the Government to the need of co-
ordination of its industries with a view to their
effective production during the war. In 1916 the
Government was able to secure just 54 planes,

all of which werfe types of little value in a war emer-
gency. Under his leadership this same industry
produced training planes running into the thou-
sands. The Liberty motor was brought through its
initial development, and the ground work laid for
the production of battle planes. Approximately
100.000 men were trained for actual service as flyers
and ground workers in the aircraft service, and
another 150,000 were set to work manufacturing
plants on the production of airplanes.
In 1918, when he was crit-
icized in connection with air-
craft production, specifically in
connection with Government
contracts with the Packard
Motor Car Company, for pre-
liminary work on the Liberty
motor, he was completely ex-
onerated of blame in the report
of Attorney-General Thomas
W. Gregory and Charles Evans
Hughes, which showed that he
never acted in anything but an
advisory capacity, and that his
acts were always subject to ap-
proval or disapproval of the
military authorities. He ten-
dered his resignation as chair-
man of the Aircraft Board in
1918.
In 1922 he helped to organize
the National Aeronautical As-
sociation, and served as presi-
dent for one year. This organ-
ization was affiliated with the
Federal Aeronautique Interna-
tionale, and was America's only
official contact with aviation af-
fairs in Europe.
As a delegate to the Inter-
national Chamber of Commerce
meeting in Rome, Italy, in
1923, he obtained the adoption of a resolution re-
questing governments to give first place to civil
aviation and providing for the establishment by
Chambers of Commerce of a permanent interna-
tional advisory committee to promote commercial
aviation.
In 1925 he organized the National Air Transport,
Inc., running a line from New York City to Dallas,
Texas, and became its first president. He resigned
Nov. 19, 1927, owing to pressure of other interests,
but was elected chairman of the board of directors.
He was one of the pioneers of the automobile in-
dustry, and was responsible for the successful ap-
plication of industrial co-operation and engineering
standardization which brought the automobile man-
ufacturing business to the highest place among the

As one of the organizers, and later president of

among automobile manufacturers.
Back of Howard Coffin was an emigrant ancestor,
Tristam Coffin, who came from England in 1642
and settled in Nantucket, Massachusetts. The
Coffin family figured promi-
nently in the early history of
New England, having high
ideals of patriotism and citi-
zenship. On Howard's moth-
er's side the line of descent was
from John Jay, also a promi-
nent figure in American his-
tory. Howard was born on the
homestead farm of his parents,
Julius Cestal and Sarah E.
Jones Coffin near the village of
West Milton, Ohio, September
6, 1873. His marriage to Ma-
tilda Vary Allen, daughter of
Edwin A. Allen of Battle Creek,
Michigan, October 30, 1907,
united two families which de-
scended from illustrious ances-
tors. Her father was a direct
descendant of a brother of
Ethan Allen, the patriot, the
family having come to America
from Dorchester, England, in
1630.
His boyhood was spent on
the farm homestead, where he
learned to do the work that
usually falls to the lot of the
farm boy. He attended the dis-
trict schools and then the West
Milton High School until 1888,
when his parents moved to Ann Arbor. He was
graduated from the Ann Arbor High School in
1893.
He withdrew twice from the Engineering De-
partment of the University of Michigan to go into
other work. He entered the Mechanical Engineer-
ing Department in 1893, but withdrew in 1896 to
enter the United States Civil Service. In this he
was actively engaged until 1901, when he resumed
his studies at the University. Six months prior
to his graduation, he again left, this time to go into
his chosen held, the automobile industry, as an
employee of the Olds Motor Works in Detroit and
Lansing. However, in recognition of his practical
accomplishment and marked ability in hs profes-
sion, the University conferred the degree of B. S.


November, 1928
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
in Mechanical Engineering upon him in 1911, and
an honorary degree of Doctor of Engineering in
1917.
From the first his work with the Olds Company
was outstanding. In 1903 he was advanced to
engineer in charge of the experimental shops, and
he became chief engineer in 1905. In the spring of
1906 he left the Olds Company to assist in the or-
ganization of the E. R. Thomas-Detroit Company,
manufacturers of automobiles, serving as chief en-
gineer and vice-president of the new organization.
The next year, in addition to these duties, he became
Consulting Engineer to the E. R. Thomas Motor
Company of Buffalo, New York. In 1908 the De-
troit concern reorganized as the Chalmers Motor
Company, and he continued with them until 1909,
when he became vice-president and consulting en-
gineer of the Hudson Motor Car Company, of which
he was one of the organizers.
He has been a member of the executive commit-
tee of the American Automobile Association for
many years, having been first elected in 1909. In
1910 he was elected president of the Society of
Automotive Engineers, and in 1911 was chairman
of the rules committee of the Automobile Manu-
facturers' Contest Association, and for five years
was chairman of the committee on tests of the As-
sociation of Licensed Automobile Manufacturers.
He holds memberships in the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers, the Detroit Engineering So-
ciety, the National Automobile Chamber of Com-
merce, the National Aeronautical Association of the
U. S. A., and in several prominent social clubs. In
politics he is a Republican, and he is also an emi-
nent Mason.
In 1923 Governor Clifford Walker of Georgia, ap-
pointed him to his staff. Mr. Coffin maintains a
residence on Sapelo Island, a part of Georgia, as
well as in Grosse Pointe Shores, a suburb of De-
troit. He acquired a large acreage of swamp land
and experimented in the growing of rice.
In 1922, in company with William E. Metzger,
Harold H. Emmons, Dr. James W. Inches, Inglis
M. Uppercu, and Charles F. Redden, he made a
flight in the Santa Maria to the Hudson Bay region
on a hunting expedition. He utilizes airplanes in
travel wherever possible, and has shown his in-
terest in exploratory ventures by means of air travel
by coming forward as one of the backers of the
Detroit Aviation Society Artie Expedition, in
charge of Captain George Hubert Wilkins, which
first took off from Alaska in 1925.
Perhaps the most interesting of Mr. Coffin's nu-
merous enterprises is the National Air Transport,
Inc. A brief account of the rapid growth of this
great organization follows:
After incorporation in May, 1925, on a ten mil-
lion dollar basis, the original plans were to establish
freight express service between New York City and
Dallas, Texas. Curtiss "Carrier-Pigeon" planes
were used. These planes employed a single 400
horse power Liberty motor, had a speed of 116 miles
per hour, a ceiling of 16,000 feet, a landing speed
of less than 50 miles per hour, and a cargo capacity
of 1,000 pounds of package freight or mail.
The Allegheny Mountains have always offered
difficulty in navigation to airplane pilots. The N. A.
T. established emergency landing fields in these
mountains and many test landings were made on
these fields previous to the beginning of service on
the line. In short, every conceivable precaution
was taken to insure safety and efficiency in opera-
tion.
Since its inauguration the N. A. T. has greatly
increased the number of planes used on the line,
and has enlarged its scope of service by opening
auxiliary lines which make connections with the
main line. Detroit was given the service beginning
March 15, 1928, consisting of nightly trunk line air
service to Toledo, where it connects with the main
line to eight principal industrial cities of the United
States. At present it is using the Ford airport until
the completion of the Detroit Municipal Airport.
It is now Mr. Coffin's certain conviction that within
a comparatively short time any air mail letter or ex-
press package dispatched from Detroit before six
o'clock in the evening will be delivered at any other
important point within the confines of the conti-
nental United States within 24 hours afterward.
The success of the N. A. T. is now a matter of
historical record and recognized throughout the
aeronautical world. This company is the largest
privately operated air transport enterprise either in
this country or in Europe. During its three year
history the N. A. T. has completed 90 per cent of
its trips on schedule. The N. A. T. planes have
flown 1,500,000 miles without a fatality, which is
the greatest proof which can be offered to demon-
strate the constant care and vigilant safety which
are the keynotes of the organization.
On June 11, 1928, passenger service between New
York City and San Francisco was inaugurated. So
great was the increase in air mail due to the recently
reduced rates that this passenger service has been
temporarily suspended during the last two months.
New tri-motored planes are soon to be installed
with a passenger capacity of 10 to 12, in addition
to the mail and express cargo. These planes will
run from New York City to Chicago in 8 hours,
with stops at Cleveland and Toledo. A buffet lunch
will be served en route.
The efforts of "Howard Earlc Coffin have been
crowned with great success, and will long serve
as an inspiration to every ambitious engineer. May
his success continue in the future, may he accomplish

What makes this
marvelous speed possible?
In this age of speed, "mile a minute" has become commonplace. Machines that
reduce distances by land, air, and water travel excite today only casual interest and
little thought of the mechanism that makes this tremendous speed possible.
Behind the scenes, inventors and mechanics have worked untiringly to build today's
marvelous engines of travel. Great manufactories produce them in quantities, each
capable of its high speed accomplishments because hundreds of parts have been
fashioned to accuracy by grinding.
In the old days of hand and semi-machine operations, high production with accur-
acy was of course limited. Today, grinding machines produce precision parts, one
after another, mechanically perfect, day in and day out, in tremendous quantities.

was properly equipped, or even undertaken without
the indispensable Automobile Blue Book in which
were carefully delineated the route which it was
proposed to traverse.
These books were looked upon as being achieve-
ments of their compilers, being composed with such
completeness and accuracy. They were the charts
whereby many an unknown sea was safely navi-
gated, returning the travelers to their home port
with certainty and safety.
Our pride is somewhat shocked when we learn
that ours were not the first road books published
but that road books were issued for England and
Scotland beginning about the middle of the seven-
teenth century. They were made only after careful
surveys to determine the direction and length of
the road and taking elaborate notes of all the prin-
cipal topographical features such as streams, vil-
lages, crossroads, estates, tilled land, forests, game
preserves, schools, churches, and such with the
names of these. From these survey notes accurate
strip maps were made. The first of these books,
Britannia: Or, The Kingdom of England and Do-
minion of Wales Actually Surveyed: With a Geo-
graphical and Historical Description of the Principal
Roads, was published in 1675 in folio size consisting
of 100 plates, six plots to the plate, or a total of
600 individual maps. A second edition was issued
in 1698.3 Following this during the next two cen-
turies there were issued in Great Britain a hundred
or more publications which frequently ran into
many editions.
In 1789 Christopher Colles published a Survey of
the Roads of America which pertained largely to
the roads in the vicinity of New York and Phila-
delphia.
In 1802 there was published by S. S. Moore and
T. W. Jones The Traveler's Directory: Or, A
Pocket Companion, Shewing the Course of the Main
Road from Philadelphia to New York; and from
Philadelphia to Washington: With Descriptions of
the Places Through Which It Passes, and the In-
tersections of the Cross Roads, Philadelphia, 1802.4
These American Road Books are no less complete
than those published in England. A second edition
was issued in 1804"' following which it was one hun-
dred years until road books again came into general
vogue.

distance of some 240 feet. Because of the limited
right-of-way, the ditch was dug close to the road,
thereby endangering the roadbed and creating a
hazard to traffic. Provisions were, therefore, made
as soon as possible to make the highway safe at this
point.
Here is the way it was done:
The method adopted was to enclose the stream
in a corrugated pipe. For this purpose 42-inch
Arrhco pipe was used, including one 90-degree elbow
where the stream crossed under the road and two
45-degree bends where the ditch left the road. A
15-inch inlet was provided for the water from the
shallower side-ditch near each end of the larger
pipe. It so happened that the existing culvert that
crossed the road at this point was much too low
when the described improvement was made. It was
blown out with dynamite and replaced by 50 feet
of 42-inch Armco pipe and joined onto the 90-degree
elbow.
Backfilling over the pipe completed the job and
made the highway safe and stable.-—Engineering

Fritz Medal Awarded to Hoover
Announcement was made October 22 of the
award of the John Fritz gold medal to Herbert C.
Hoover by the Engineering Foundation. The recipi-
ent was selected by an unanimous vote of a com-
mittee composed of sixteen past presidents of the
four national societies of civil, mechanical, electrical
and mining and metallurgical engineers. The medal
will be presented to Mr. Hoover next February at
the annual meeting of the American Institute of
Mining and Metallurgical Engineers in New York
City.
The statement issued by the Engineering Foun-
dation is as follows:
By this award, which was unanimous, the board
sought to express the high appreciation of Mr. Hoov-
er's professional brethren for his distinguished attain-
ments as an engineer, particularly in mining operation
in this and other countries, and his great services as a
man to his fellows.
Notable among his engineering achievements are the
successful introduction into other countries of improved
American mining methods. His scholarly accomplish-
ments also are worthy of mention, especially his trans-
lation into readable English from difficult medieval
Latin of Agricola's famous book, "De Re Metallica."

AIR CLEANERS
(Continued from page 9)
through the cleaner, passed through an absolute
cleaner composed of various filters ranging from
hard finish vacuum cleaner drill to good quality
flannel and eiderdown. Following the proper cali-
bration with the use of two absolute cleaners, a
satisfactory single filter was developed. The air
stream then passed into a diaphragm meter, either
manually or electrically controlled, from thence to
the Root's type blower, providing the air flow. Pie-
zometer rings were provided at suitable points for
measuring pressure losses.
The dust, instead of being of uniform material
such as fullers earth, cement, etc., was an actual
dust taken from various state highways. This dust
was made standard by sifting through 200 mesh
screen, after thoroughly mixing each specimen from
stone, gravel and dirt roads. As the dust was col-
lected from the wheel track it contained an exceed-
ingly large number of infinitesimal as well as larger
particles. This standard dust.was then mixed into
the air stream by a screw feeding device of the
proper lead and rotational speed. A variable speed
motor was used to drive the mechanism. The dust
was first mixed with a portion of the air stream and
then remixed as this primary entered the annular
main air stream. By controlling the mechanism,
proper dust to air ratios were maintained.
In order to eliminate the humidity effect of the
atmosphere, both the dust recovered in the cleaners
and that of the absolute filter were heated according
to certain schedules and then accurately weighed in
the oven with the proper sensitive chemist's scale.
With this arrangement, tests can be duplicated to a
reasonable degree of accuracy. It was with the use
of this plant that every available cleaner was tested
to determine the status of this industry.
Centrifugal Cleaners
As was stated before, the centrifugal cleaner in-
herently embodied many features essential to auto-
mobile use. A few paragraphs will illustrate inter-
esting information as to the design of the various
parts. Centrifugal action was usually imparted to
the air stream by means of deflectors or vanes. A
very important question is the type and number of
vanes resulting in the maximum cleaning efficiency
and the lowest restriction.
In all cases, it was found, the larger number of
fins, the greater cleaning efficiency. Evidently
smaller streams of air will allow the centrifugal
force to more efficiently separate the particles.
Changing the angle of the fin gave results as might
be expected, i.e., the greater the angle of deflection
of the air stream the more centrifugal force, con-
sequently better cleaning ability.
From the pressure loss viewpoint, increasing the
fin number decreased the resistance, and again as
might be analyzed, the greater fin angle resulted in
a higher restriction. Thus the conclusion may be
drawn that by placing the proper limit on pressure
loss, cleaning efficiency may be varied from 60 to
90 per cent by design of fin alone. These values are
of course illustrated with a given cleaner shell. A
second important factor is the contour of the cleaner
shell. Unless the centrifugal action provided is used
efficiently, the final result will suffer. After con-
siderable effort was evolved with the result that the
cleaning efficiency of the fin was increased and a
certain amount of velocity head of the air stream
recovered. This leads to a third project in which we
now have high cleaning efficiency but not the ideal
pressure recovery. With the addition of the proper
diffuser vane, the capacity of this cleaner with the
same restriction, was absolutely doubled, or at the
original rate of capacity—75 cu. ft., the resistance
was lowered from 3 inches of water to .6 inches.
I believe it may thus be stated that cleaning effi-
ciency is independent of frictional resistance in the
centrifugal cleaner. This cleaner need not affect
carburetor metering or top speed appreciably. This
allows centrifugal cleaners to be used with air valve
carburetors as well as plain tubes.0
The centrifugal cleaner may have high efficiency
and high pressure loss or the same type cleaner may
have high efficiency at a minimum loss. The filter
will initially show low loss and high cleaning ef-
ficiency, yet after considerable use, low cleaning ef-
ficiency with the resulting higher loss.

"* * * demand high efficiency, preferably above 90 per cent and
with a low restriction, or vacuum effect, preferably measured by
less than 3 inches of water when the engine is developing its rated
load."

BEFORE the elevator removed this limitation, five
stories was the height limit of buildings. Upper
floors were undesirable—people didn't enjoy the
long, hard climb to roof-tree quarters.
Today there is no restriction. Upper floors are preferred
for their light, ventilation and splendid view. Elevators
have made buildings of any height practicable. The
only limit is in the construction of the building itself.

A Wandering Engineer
By Alfred H. Lovell
Professor of Electrical Engineering
WHEN I went to Europe I expected to find
much to interest me in modern engineer-
ing, in art, and in music, but I had not
realized how great the engineering past has been.
Before we had gone far I found traces of those
marvelous engineers, the
Romans. As we entered
Orange, in the south of France,
a beautiful Arc de Triomphe
spanned the road, its lovely
proportions and rich sculptures
paying splendid tribute to the
taste and skill of its builders.
Its construction dates from the
time of Tiberius. But sur-
passing even the triumphal
arch is the great theatre at
Orange which used to hold
40.000 people in the reign of
the Emperor Hadrian. Al-
though 1,600 years old, the
theatre is used for perform-
ances of the Comedie Franchise
in August of each year. A
little farther to the west at
Ximes there is also a perfect temple, the Maison
Carree, and a great arena where bull fights arc still
held three or four times every year. Unfortunately
we arrived just the day after one had been held.
One must marvel at the great strength of these
structures—quite apart from their beauty which is
gTeat—they have endured the use of centuries and
stand to show us the designs of the Romans in Gaul.
It is, however, on the road through Italy leading
TO know that in some respects
European engineering is
equal to our own is perhaps sur-
prising to some. To learn also
that one engaged in that profes-
sion reputed to be quite devoid of
classic appreciations can meet
these same with enthusiasm gives
confidence to the engineer.
Prof. Lovell found the above
quite universally true throughout
a seven months' automobile tour
of Europe with his family. For
the benefit of our readers he has
herein noted a few of the high-
lights of that trip.

to Rome that wc gain the greatest respect for the
ancient builders. How, with only the strength of
slaves, could they have got those huge blocks of
stone and marble from the mountain quarries up
onto such imposing sites? One marvels at the roads
—not only the great Appian
Way where the stone block
pavement after 2,000 years is
no worse than certain bits of
road between here and New
York—but also at the straight
graded military roads. Some
of these still bear such thrilling
old names as Via Claudia
(Rome to Bracciano), Via
Cassia (Rome to Monterosi),
and Via Flaminia (Rome to
the North). It is surprising to
find that ancient Rome had a
bountiful supply of water
brought in from the hills over
a system of graded aqueducts
sometimes forty miles in
length. With very commend-
able thrift the water brought in
13 miles from Colonna in the Alban Hills by Pope
Sixtus V is still used to supply the Fontanone dell
Acqua Felice. The Romans also had a form of cen-
tral heating system using hollow brick walls and
ducts in the construction of their warm baths or
tepidaria.
Of all the marvels of city planning can any ever
compare with that of Venice? Here on a group of
117 islands, 2 miles from the mainland, some 185,000

people built their city, utilizing a scheme of a cen-
tral dividing Grand Canal and ISO subordinate
canals for their transportation system. Until re-
cently the romantic song of the gondolier and the
sweep of his long oar was the only sound on these
water streets. Now ocean liners anchor at the
mouth of the Grand Canal and fast motor boats vie
for trade with the gondolas on the "Main Street".

BUILDINGS VISITED BY PROF. LOWELL
The motor boats are not allowed to run in the nar-
row auxiliary canals because their wash would
damage the foundations of the houses which line
the canals.
It is perhaps in medieval times that the engineer
constructed his best known works in Italy. The
tremendous domes of Brunelleschi on the Duoma at
Florence and of Michael Angelo on St. Peter's at
Rome probably mark the summit of achievement in
building with stone. Who could surpass the daring
skill of the builders of that exquisite gem, the Lean-
ing Tower of Pisa? When Gerardo had it up to a
height of 35 feet the foundation soil settled, throw-
ing it out of perpendicular. In spite of this he car-
ried it up to the third tier, correcting somewhat for
the inclination. As finally completed by Tomaso
Pisano it is 13 feet out of plumb in its height of 179
feet. Today engineers are offering plans to prevent
any further settling of the foundation material.
Still later Napoleon's engineers performed some
miracles of road building in constructing the Grand
Cornichc road over the Mairtime Alps from Nice
eastward toward the Italian border. Following
somewhat the rough track left of the old Aurelian
Way the road climbs out of Xice on the sides of
the mountain and swings along the heights some
COO metres above the ocean. From this elevation it
affords magnificent views of the bays and shore
towns.
Modern Italy is proving quite worthy of her his-
toric past. The monument of Victor Emmanuel II,
who unified Italy, designed by Sacconi and placed
in the heart of Rome backed up against the Capi-
toline Hill, gives us an idea of what the ancient city
must have looked like in imperial times. It is built
of gleaming white Rotticino marble and gilded
bronze. Its great size and height are entirely in
keeping with Roman tradition. In the center of the
front stairway is the Altare della Patria and here
sleeps Italy's Unknown Soldier.
Italy is also making great progress in the electrifi-
cation of her railway systems. The mountain pass
roads have long been electrified, the Valtellina line
along the east shore of Lake Como having been the
first in Europe to use three phase power at 3,000
volts, but the more level sections have been steam
operated. Now the great impetus to hydro-electric
development in the Alps and connecting transmis-
sion systems have permitted several sections to be
electrified with a consequent improvement in opera-
tion and saving in the use of high priced coal. Plans
are already developed for a new electric railway
along the Brenner Pass and for converting the
service in large areas of the country, particularly
around Milan, from three-phase equipment to that
for 3,000 volts direct current.
As a typical example of the newer hydro-electric
stations the plant of the Societa Elettrica Inter-
regional Cisalpina at Mese in the Splugen Pass
may be cited. Here seven turbines of 35.000
horsepower each operate under 800 metres head.
The output from the seven 30,000 K. V. A.
alternators at three-phase, 8,000 volts, 42 to 50
cycles, is stepped up in the adjoining transformer
house to 150,000 volts for transmission to the load
centers. The architecture of the station is very
notable and particularly suited to its setting among
the rugged masses of the mountains. Differing from
American practice, the high tension equipment is
enclosed in a reinforced concrete building instead of
being out in the open and the transmission lines
leaving the station are not protected with lightning

The Early Salt Industry
By Walter L. Badger
Professor of Chemical Engineering
ALTHOUGH salt has been used since before
the beginnings of civilization, the method by
• which it was first obtained are not clearly
known. Rock salt was known at a very early period,
and there is a record of the manufacture of salt in
China in about the year 2200 B. C. In the countries
bordering on the Mediterranean, salt was usually
made by the solar evaporation of sea water, al-
though the Egyptians had access to deposits of rock
salt. Tacitus, writing in the
first century A. D., describes
the manufacture of salt in Ger-
many by a method which was
still in use several centuries
later. A wood fire was built
and when it was a mass of red
hot coals, brines from salt
springs were poured over these
coals. The ashes from this fire
were then used for their salt
content.
It is not known when the
first attempts were made to
make salt by boiling the brine
in a vessel. The first definite
account we have of this is
Agricolas' "De Re Metallica,"
which was published in 1556.
Figure 1 shows the pans used
for boiling the salt. Agricola says that they are
8 feet long, 7 feet wide, and 6 inches high. These
pans were made of sheets of iron or lead, fastened
together with rivets, and the joints were made tight
with a cement made of pounded ox liver, ox blood,
and ashes. It is interesting to note in Figure 1 the
small size of the individual pieces of metal of which
the pans were made. It must be remembered that
until the invention of the Bessemer process in the
middle of the 19th century it was not possible to
produce iron sheets of any appreciable size. Before
that time the only workable iron available was
wrought iron made by the puddling process, and
the size of one puddle-ball limited the size of the
sheet wrhich could be hammered from it. Even in
the early days of the railroad in the 1800's, loco-
motive boilers were made of a large number of very
small sheets riveted together.
These early salt pans were so weak that they
were not self-supporting and consequently, as
Figure 1 shows, the bottom was provided with a
number of staples, and by these staples the pan was
hung frc
iron bars bv means of iron hooks. The
WITH our modern methods
for producing everyday
necessities we seldom give
thought to what situations may
have existed in the past. A look
into history reveals much that is
of keen interest. Not infrequently
do we find ourselves surprised by
the discovery of ideas which long
lay unused.
Prof. Badger has in the present
article looked back into the past
of one of the oldest of industries.
He has brought to light a great
deal that is of interest technically
as well as historically.

front of the pan was supported on the walls of the
fireplace, while the back of the pan was supported
by 2 special hooks hung from the bars IT, which
went over the back support and under the front
support. It is especially stated that the pan should
be so set that if a dipper full of brine was poured
into it. it should run to all 4 corners at the same
time.
The fireplace was construct-
ed of blocks of rock salt ce-
mented with a mixture of wood
ashes and brine. No chimney
was provided, and consequent-
ly the smoke from the fire,
together with the steam from
the boiling brine, escaped di-
rectly into the room where the
boiling was carried on. Out-
lets were provided in the roof,
but these apparently did very
little good. The fuel used was
either wood or straw; and
Agricola expressly states that
if straw is used the color of the
salt will be poor because of the
cinders and ashes which will
fall into the pan. Most of the
German salt plants which Agricola had in mind
operated on salt brines, but apparently had a supply
of rock salt available, because he states that if the
brines are weak they are poured into a tub which
contains rock salt and thus brought up to strength.
In any case, as near as can be determined from
Agricola's description, the brines were never fully
saturated.
The brine was ladled into the pan with dippers
and as soon as this process was begun the fire was
lighted. As soon as the caldron was filled, about
Vt, of a pint of bullock's blood was mixed with the
brine and the whole was quickly brought to boiling.
The coagulation of the albumens in the blood
formed a scum which contained most of the floating
impurities, and was then skimmed off. Agricola
states that this scum was thrown into the furnace
under the pan. The boiling and skimming took half
an hour, and a further quarter of an hour's boiling
brought the brine to the point where crystallization
commenced. The brine was then boiled for an hour

with vigorous stirring, apparently to keep the grain
fine. At this time a small amount of beer was
stirred into the brine; most of the surface of the pan
was covered with wooden boards, and then the salt
was raked out with wooden rakes and paddles, and

placed in conical wicker baskets. It took half an
hour to harvest the first crop of salt, and then the
brine was boiled for another three-quarters of an
hour and still more salt removed. Agricola says
that 37 dippers-full of brine made 2 basket-fulls of
salt. The dipper is described as holding 10 Roman
sextarii; 1 sextarius is nearly a pint, so that 10
sextarii are approximately equal to 1.25 gallons, or
about 93 lbs. of brine. The 37 dippers-full would
contain about 345 lbs. of brine, which, if the brine
were saturated, should contain 138 lbs. of salt. If
the brine was never fully saturated it follows that
each basketful of salt would weigh between 50 and
60 lbs.
These baskets were then carried to the back of
the salt house into a separate room, which was near
the end of the fireplace where the stack should have
been. Much of the smoke and heat found its way
into this room, and thus the baskets of salt were
dried. The resulting conical hard lump was the
form in which salt found its way into commerce.
Agricola states: "In the manner I have described
a master and his helper continue one after the other
alternately boiling the brine and molding the salt,
day and night, with the exception only of the annual
feast days. No caldron is able to stand the fire for
more than half a year. The master pours in water
and washes it out every week. When it is washed
out he puts straw under it and pounds it. New
caldrons he washes 3 times in the first 2 weeks, and
afterwards twice. In this manner the incrustations
fall from the bottom. If they are not cleared off
the salt would have to be made more slowly over
a fiercer fire which requires more brine and burns
the plates of the caldron. If any cracks make their
appearance in the caldron they are filled up with
cement. The salt made during the first 2 weeks is
not so good, being usually stained by the rust of
the bottom where incrustations have not yet ad-
hered." Evidently, in 1500 it had been learned that
scale interfered with heat transfer and increased the
temperature gradient to the point where destructive
temperatures would be reached in the metal.
This general method of boiling brine in a small
rectangular pan over a wood fire, removing suspend-
ed impurities by the addition of some coagulant,
ladling out the salt as it formed, draining it in wicker

baskets and drying it in cone-shaped pieces, was
the common procedure, both in Germany and in
England. Agricola describes methods in which
brines were boiled in round iron pots set over a fire,
but this was apparently less common than the flat

iron pans. He also describes a procedure in which
earthenware bowls were floated in the water of hot
springs and the brine in the bowls evaporated at
temperatures below its boiling point. This is illus-
trated in Figure 3.
Although our information on the technology of
salt manufacture is very limited, we have consider-
able information on certain economic features in
the salt industry. It appears that very early salt
was subjected to taxes by the overlords of the locali-
ties in which it was made, and it also appears that
the methods of manufacture, the size of the pans,
the rate at which salt could be made, and every
detail connected with the manufacture of salt was
Aery carefully regulated. This was the result of a
compromise between the desire of the overlord to
have as large a salt production as possible, thereby
increasing his own income, and the desire of the
burghers to limit the production as far as possible,
so as to keep up the price. This took the form, both
in Germany and in England, of the most exact regu-
lation and control of the industry. The oldest docu-
ment bearing on this is a contract between Hein-
rich, Landgrave of Hesse, and the burghers who
held the salt works at Sodcn near Allendorf. The
contract reads as follows:
"We, Heinrich, by God's grace Landgrave, Lord
of the land of Hesse, Mechtild, our wife, and Johan
our son, and our heirs, make known by this present
letter to all who may see or hear it, that we had
wished to build more pans at Soden in the salt
works, but that we have agreed with the burghers
of Scden, who have inherited these salt works, that
we shall build no more pans. Because of this, they
and their heirs shall furnish to us and to our heirs,
every year for 14 days before St. Johan's day, 25
furnace loads of salt. This salt they shall deliver
at our city of Cassell at their cost and under our
safe conduct in the presence of those who represent
us. That this contract may be permanent and bind-
ing, we have given this letter, sealed with our privy
seal, and our wife also, although Johan our son has
not sealed this. This letter is given in the year after
God's birth 1300, on St. Walpurg's day."
Thus, it appears that even in the year 1300 the
hereditary rights of the burghers to control the
output of salt were so firmly fixed that the Land-
grave did not have the power to increase production
in order to increase his own taxes, but had to con-
tent himself with a yearly gift of a certain amount
of free salt, which supposedly was for the use of his
own establishment.
Other instances of this attempt by the overlords
to increase production which was met by deter-
mined resistance on the part of the burghers appear
very frequently in the literature. In 1332, another
Heinrich, Landgrave of Hesse, had a similar dis-
cussion with the burghers. As a result a committee,
consisting of Heinrich von Eisenbach, Berthold
Eselskopf, and Walter von Hunoldshuffen, was ap-
pointed to measure all the pans in the salt works.
The results of these measurements were inscribed
on the wall of the church in Allendorf, and the
Landgrave decreed that the measurements of the
pans "should be so fixed forever." It would be

interesting to know just how short a time elapsed
between this decree fixing these dimensions forever
and the first changes which were made. Probably
it was relatively few years.
Salt was made in Cheshire, in England, long
before the Norman conquest. In 816Kenulph, King
of the Mercians, gave Hamilton in Droitwich and
10 houses with their salt furnaces, to the church in
Worcester. In the Domesday Book, which was pre-
pared between 1084 and 1086, there are many men-
tions of salt manufacture. The Domesday Book was
prepared for the information of William the Con-
queror, and its purpose was to give him a record of
all the taxes, tolls, levies, and rents in England, so

New Developments In Sewage
Pumps
By H. M. Potter, '23E
THE pumping (if unscreened sewage has
always been one of the most difficult of
pumping problems due to the presence of
solids and material of fibrous or stringy character.
Heretofore it has been common practice to use open-

AGE DISPOSAL PLANT, SHOWING THE SEWAGE PUMP
MOTORS IN THE BACKGROUND AND THE ROTATING
SCREENS IN THE FOREGROUND
impeller centrifugal pumps in situations where the
handling of sluids containing appreciable amounts
of solid material are involved. This practice un-
doubtedly resulted from the ability of the open
impeller pump to disintegrate foreign matter by
grinding it against the stationary side plates of the
pump until the particles were worn small enough to
be discharged. The disadvantage in this process,
however, is that wedging of large masses of solids
between the impeller blades necessitates shutting
the pump down at frequent intervals and opening
it for cleaning. Furthermore, the process of grind-
ing the foreign matter against the side plates of the
pump causes rapid wear, a very heavy power loss
and results in low efficiency.
The advent of the closed impeller type of sewage
pump has had a marked effect on the solution of
this pumping problem. The accompanying illus-
trations show an impeller and a sectional cut
through an impeller of one of these non-clogging
sewage pumps.
The impeller is of the enclosed type and has two
blades and two ports. It has very open waterways
with smoothed well filleted corners that will pass
any materials that enter, regardless of shape and
texture.
In outward appearance the sewage pump re-
sembles the ordinary clear water, side suction cen-
trifugal pump intended for heavy duty. It is manu-
factured in horizontal and vertical types with the
essential features identical in each case. All the
units are designed for side suction, and the smaller
sizes will discharge at almost any position, as pro-
vision is made for revolving the volute to the
desired position before bolting it to the pedestal or
body of the pump.
The pump has a wide water passage and blades
that are rounded where the water first enters the
impeller. The rounded blade prevents tenacious
trash from catching and clogging the water
passages. The wide water passages allows any
solid which will enter through the eye of the im-
peller to be discharged from the pump without
danger of clogging.
The blades are tapered gradually toward the
outer edge. This tapering of the impeller blade
causes a steep characteristic which produces extra
pressure built up with the rising curve and results
in a flushing action in the lines when there is a
tendency for the lines to clog. This is of vital
importance in sewage work.
The pumping of raw, unscreened sewage in many
cases simplifies the layout of treatment plants, out
fall pumping plants and relift stations. An example
of simplification which is possible is shown by the

new treatment plant at St. Petersburg, Florida. This
plant was originally laid out along the generally
accepted lines as to what constitutes good screen-
ing plan design. It was arranged to use gravity
How to both the Brunotte coarse bar screen with

a flow from this screen to the Tark fine screens
from when the effluent passed to a wet well where
it was to be picked up by vertical centrifugal pumps
and discharged. The depth below ground amounted
to 30 ft. 6 in. and that the diameter of this huge well-
like concrete structure was to be 55 ft. The layout
also called for a rather complex concrete construc-
tion in order to have the raw sewage flow over both
In addition to this there is a check valve in the
discharge line of each pump so either pump can run
without interfering with the other. In this way the
float tubes can be set at such a position that one
pump will start when the water is three or four feet
higher than the level required to start the first pump.
Then if the sewage comes to the first pump faster
than it can be handled, the second pump will cut in

the coarse and the fine screens and then to the
wet well.
After a study of the problem the plant was re-
designed. Instead of placing all of the screens and
the pumps at the level of the incoming sewer, the
building was laid out so that the sewage pumps
would be housed in a pump pit and the raw sewage
would be pumped up to the fine screens which were
placed at practically ground level. It was at once
evident that the amount of excavating would be
considerably reduced and that the concrete con-
struction would be considerably simplified. In fact,
the difference in construction costs on this job
actually paid for the sewage pumps.
Another important use of the closed impeller type
of sewage pump is in connection with steel tank
relitt stations. The accompanying illustration shows
a steel tank station recently developed.
These stations, which are completely automatic in
operation, are equipped with two vertical sewage
pumps direct connected to ball bearing motors. The
starting and stopping is controlled by means of float
operated switches.
Each station contains a small blower which keeps
the station ventilated so that it is safe to enter and
also it keeps the air in the station changed often
enough to prevent overheating and sweating of the
motors. Each motor is controlled by a separate float
switch and each switch has its own float enclosed
in a smooth cast iron float tube. These float tubes
are accessible for cleaning and for the adjustment
of the float. There is a gate valve in the discharge
line and in the suction line of each pump so that
either pump can be removed for repairs without
interfering with the service given by the other
pump.
and operate in parallel with the first pump.
With this kind of operation it is highly probable
that one pump will do most of the work and receive
most of the wear. The wear may be equalized by
installing double throw switches which will allow
the operation of the two pumps to be interchanged.
This can be done at periods of, say, every six
months.
There is a small valve in the suction connection
of each pump which is used to keep the tank dry.

Beryllium—Hardest Oe Light Metals
By Hugh S. Cooper
Lab. Director Beryllium Corp. of America and Kernel Lab. Co., Inc.
WHO can measure the impetus given to
intellectual and spiritual progress and the
wealth created by chemist, physicist, metal-
lurgist and engineer through discovery and develop-
ment of a new metal? Recall aluminum, familiar
in every household, and tungsten, glowing in every
Mazda lamp and adding to the toughness of steel.
Beryllium may soon be as commonly known,
although its progress has been very slow. In 1922
it sold at the rate of $5,000 per pound, but only a
few grams could have been purchased, even at this
super-platinum price—witness to the difficulties of
purifying it by any means available to chemists and
metallurgists until recently. The high cost, indeed,
seemed a metaphysical corollary to the close rela-
tionship of beryllium to the gems, aquamarine and
emerald, special forms of beryl, long prized. Cleo-
patra's emerald mines in upper Egypt were worked
as early as 1650 B. C. Beryl was one of the gems
in the breastplate of the Hebrew high priest and
one of the beautiful stones the Apostle John beheld
in the foundation of new Jerusalem in his vision
recorded in the Book of Revelation.
In its less beautiful forms beryl, which is the best
source of the metal, is still sent to waste heaps of
feldspar mines of New Hampshire. Large deposits
are known also in other states and several foreign
countries. Beryllium oxide, the starting point for
making the metal, constitutes about 14 per cent of
beryl, chemically a double meta-silicate of aluminum
and berlliyum.
Pliny, the Roman historian, A. D. 23-79, expressed
the opinion that beryl and emeralds were the same
kind of mineral. Seventeen centuries passed before
Vauquelin, a French chemist, established their
chemical identity, and in the process discovered in
them a new oxide. He was unable to reduce this
oxide and thereby obtain the metal, to which the
name, beryllium, from the Greek, was later given.
Possibly "beryl" is derived from a Sanskrit word
meaning crystal ,and is the forefather of "brilliant."
Specimens of beryl free from coloring matter and
flaws are transparent. Another name suggested was
glucinum, or glucinium (still used by some chem-
ists, particularly in France) because its salts are
sweet. Its nitrate is used for impregnating mantles
for gas lights.
In 1828, Wohler, the German scientist, separated
a little of the metal in an impure state, as did others
about the same time. The total quantity in the
world until recently was hardly sufficient for
determinations of its physical characteristics and its
industrial possibilities.
In 1916, the author, believing that beryllium could
be obtained in large quantities, that its price could
be brought to levels that would permit use and that
its characteristics would help to solve many prob-
lems of industry, undertook researches that reached
a successful conclusion and led to the establishment
of a small pilot plant producing metallic beryllium
of 99.5 per cent purity at the rate of about 150
pounds per month, refined methods permitting sale
at $50 a pound. There are good prospects that by
1931 the metal may be marketed in large quantities,
perhaps at $10. Reductions will come gradually;
they will depend upon further refinements of tech-
nique of operation, upon economical utilization of
the large quantities of valuable by-products, and
upon development of more stable sources of ore.
When all these problems have met their solutions,
the cost of this hitherto rare metal may well fall
as low as some of those frequently considered
"common".
New processes had to be evolved, new types of
apparatus devised—and always that engineering
challenge: Economically. One irritating and time-
consuming factor was the glaring inaccuracies that
well-nigh saturate the technical literature. One
man claimed to have made the metal on a com-
mercial scale by electrolyzing a compound which
does not conduct current; another patented a
process which, when tested, resulted in the isolation
of an entirely different metal.
What is there about beryllium to make it worth
this long endeavor? Its remarkable properties. In
weight, only two-thirds as much as aluminum and
but a little more than magnesium, it is the lightest
known inert metal, being considerably less than
twice as heavy as water. Scratching glass easily,
it is one of the hardest of metals, differing sharply
from both aluminum and magnesium. Its expansion
and contraction with changes of temperature are
almost the same as those of iron—again diverging
from the other light metals. It takes a high polish,
remains untarnished in the air, and is only slightly
attacked by influences which takes heavy toll of
aluminum and magnesium. In color it is grey, re-
sembling steel closely, and its melting point, 1285°

TALKS FROM THE DEAN
Tradition
Probably all of us, consciously or unconsciously,
are somewhat influenced by tradition. Even though
it is somewhat the fashion of the present age to
disregard some of the older traditions that do not
seem to fit in with the present order of things, still
it is interesting to note that others frequently seem
to hang on with a tenaciousness that cannot be
explained, except from the hypothesis of the sur-
vival of the "unfittest".
Among the finest things which University or
College can possess are traditions that are really
worth while. They may leave a stamp upon a man
that may help to mold his character, and often-
times mean much towards his success in life: but
only those which are based upon the higher and
finer things can have such an influence. Unfortu-
nately it often happens that certain undesirable
views or actions persist for a long enough time,
usually kept alive by an equally undesirable
minority, so that they become dignified by the name
"tradition".
Every University or College is bound in the
course of years to accumulate both kinds, but is it
not worth while to examine these occasionally and
see if it is not time to discard some of the less
desirable and concentrate on the better or even start
new ones? Just because a savage tribe has a tradi-
tion of eating the hearts of its enemies so as to
improve its fighting qualities, or use an illustration
nearer home, because a certain small minority think
they will gain great renown by getting drunk at
Swingout, it does not necessarily follow that such
traditions are worthy of immortality.
The Engineering Profession, like every other, has
certain traditions, which notwithstanding its ever
changing development have remained practically
unchanged through the ages. From the very nature
of his work, if success is to be achieved, it has ever
been a primary condition that an Engineer should
think straight. He cannot and must not be insincere
to his work and do things which he knows from
the start are unsafe. True, he may sometimes, in
the spirit of adventure into new realms, take cer-
tain chances due to unknown factors, but only after
the careful thinking out of all possibilities has con-
vinced him that he is justified. His responsibilites
are such that he must, not only think straight, but
act straight and live straight.
As an early part of his training, such as is hap-
pening to all students of the Engineering College,
is it not an essential, or even common sense, that
this should include the recognition and practice of
such traditions as mentioned above?
We, in the College, have one tradition of which
we are all proud, and which illustrates the point—■
the Honor System. Cannot we carry the same idea
into all our activities—campus, social, and conduct
in general, and drop others that are in conflict with
the same? In other words, cannot we enlarge this
tradition already started, so that in all our doings
in the classroom, on the campus, in student activi-
ties, in social matters, and conduct, the members of
the Engineering College as a group are men who
think straight, act straight, and live straight?
o
THE ENGINEERING COUNCIL
Last spring, when, through the efforts of Perry
Shoemaker, the first plans for an Engineering
Council were put under way, the outcome of the
whole idea was rather vague. Those on the Council
held a great many ideas as to what the organiza-
tion could and should do, yet just what it would do
was another question. This fall the Council has
made immense steps forward. It has made itself
felt and recognized throughout the Engineering Col-
lege. From attention to a great many minor inci-
dents it has passed to the point of attacking larger
things. Its latest and most valuable contribution to
the Engineering College is the Faculty-Student Co-
operation Plan.
Such a system as this which has been instituted
by the Council has long been needed and it is a
great credit to the Engineering Council to have been
able to put such a program across. Now it is pos-
sible for any student or group of students, when
confronted with any difficulty, to go directly to a
student group organized for the purpose, and have
their plans considered from the student viewpoint
before they are sent to the faculty. Such a system
is a great boon to student government and to stu-
dent affairs in general.
There is no reason to believe that the work of the
Council will stop with this one achievement. Be-
yond a doubt it is destined to do much for the Engi-
neering College.

The Faculty Student Co-operation Plan
AT A recent meeting of the faculty of the Col-
lege of Engineering a plan presented by the
L Engineering Council for the promotion of co-
operation and co - operative spirit between the
faculty and students of the College of Engineering
was discussed and passed by that group. The plan
originated from a long felt need, and its whole-
hearted acceptance by the faculty proved its feasi-
bility.
The fact that the students above the rank of fresh-
man in the Engineering College have been more or
less isolated so far as voicing opinions of their own
is concerned has long been a matter of some concern
to a large number of students. Freshmen have for a
long time had available the privilege of voicing their
ideas through their mentors and likewise the faculty
have had better access to the freshmen classes, al-
though this latter is not believed to be so important,
inasmuch as the efficient organization of the faculty
makes possible the promotion of any ideas concern-
ing the students. The reverse is, however, decidedly
not true and it has remained for the Engineering
Council to bring about a plan which will provide for
almost any circumstances wherein the students are
desirous of expressing an opinion in a matter di-
rectly affecting themselves.
Immediately after the organization of the Council
early in October this need for the means of a better
co-operation and mutual understanding was brought
before the group and it was definitely concluded
that such a plan was necessary and feasible. A com-
mittee was at that time appointed, which presented
the plan in its present form. After being considered
and approved by Dean Sadler the plan was pre-
sented to the faculty of the Engineering College
and accepted, making it at once effective.
In drawing up the plan it was considered para-
mount that it should not be allowed to create the
impression that the entire idea in mind was to en-
able the students to make complaints of undesirable
situations. That particular phase of the plan is only
incidental and should be used to no greater extent
than are the other phases of the idea which make
possible the giving of credit wherever credit is due
and also a better understanding between faculty and
students in any matter where differences of opinion
may exist. It was also important that the plan be so
carried out that its free use by the students would
be by no means impaired and at the same time it
must be so exercised that abuse of the privilege thus
provided would be discouraged. It was therefore
decided that all suggestions, ideas, expressions of
opinion or complaints of undesirable situations be
presented in written form to the Council as out-
lined in the draft of the plan which follows. The
ideas which may thus be presented are by no means
restricted and may include anything from personal
dissensions with any faculty member to any gen-
eral grievance, or from individual plans and ideas
to those fostered by any group. The outline of the
plan as adopted by the faculty in faculty meeting
follows:
Article 1. Any suggestions or complaints from a
specific class or course, or from any organization,
must be presented in written form to the Engineer-
ing Council. (Exceptions in Article 5.)
Article 2. Any material submitted must bear the
signatures of at least fifty per cent of the class or
organization from which the material originates.
(Exception in Article 5.)
Article 3. Following the signature of each indi-
vidual there shall be written his university scholas-
tic average.
Article 4. In case the material submitted has to
do with some particular class in some course, each
individual shall write after his name his grades on
all examinations in that course up to the date of his
signature.
Article 5. Any individual or minority group sug-
gestions will be gladly accepted, but will not be
given the same consideration granted to those com-
plying with Articles 2, 3, and 4, unless the Council
believes that they are of real merit and of particular
value.
Article 6. After considering the material sub-
mitted the Council will make a detailed report to


Page 15
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
the Dean.
Article 7. The office of the Dean shall make a
report to the Council in regard to the action of the
faculty on each specific subject submitted as soon
after the final decision of the faculty is reached as is
possible.
Article 8. The student body will be urged by the
Council to take advantage of this opportunity to
express itself in a frank
and conscientious man-
ner.
Article 9. Any sug-
gestions or criticisms in
regard to any engineer-
ing student activities,
in class rooms or in stu-
dent organizations, pre-
sented to the Council
by the faculty will be
greatly appreciated.
Article 10. A m a -
jority expression of ap-
preciation presented by
a student group in re-
gard to the work of
some faculty member
is in the opinion of the
Council the most pro-
gressive form of real
co-operation.
Article 11. It is ex-
pected that the reports
from the Council and
copies of the reports
and decisions of the
faculty will be filed in
the office of the Dean,
because the Council be-
lieves that this data
may be quite valuable

George E. Hubbeix
Sometime when you happen to be
at the Union drop into the pool (not
literally, of course, unless you are
fortunate enough to be the proud
possessor of an all wool suit) and
take a look around. If perchance
you are lucky, that is to say, if co-
incidence and you are friends, you
will sec a rather handsome looking
young man paddling about with no
apparent effort. And if you are
luckier still he may give you a demonstration of his ability
in the backstroke with which he can attain more speed than
the average person can in using the free style. Swimming
has been George Hubbell's avocation and hobby for quite
some time. When he came to Michigan four years ago he
tried out for the Freshman swimming team and made it.
The next year he became a member of the varsity squad.
He is a good swimmer to the extent of holding the con-
ference record in the 150 yard backstroke. He is also a
water polo enthusiast.
Besides being one of Michigan's best swimmers, George
has been an excellent student and has participated in several
other campus activities. During his Junior year he was
made a member of Triangles and was also elected to the
J-Hop Committee. He is now a member of Web and Flang.
Vulcans, and the A. S. C. E. Last spring he was elected
president of Tau Beta Pi.
We assume that this will be read mostly by men and,
since it is not the ordinary thing for girls to be casual
spectators at the Union pool, that no flighty co-ed will be-
come enamored to George on reading this article. But if
such should happen to be the case we will say further that
George has not as yet developed a Mormon complex. As a
matter of fact he seems very well satisfied with his present
wife, nor could we expect him to do better.
for reference and sta-
tistical purposes. The above explains quite de-
finitely the working of the new plan. The main
point gained by the system is that the material
under discussion is first heard by a student group,
i.e., the Council, before it comes to the hands of the
faculty. In this way the field is left more free and
open to the students themselves since it is easier
to put an idea before a group of fellow-students than
to appeal to the faculty directly.
The council also makes this added statement in
regard to the plan, which it urges should be care-
fully noted, that all names or signatures in connec-
tion with any material submitted to the Council will
be considered very strictly confidential.
The above outlined plan constitutes the first work
of major importance that has been carried to a suc-
cessful completion by the Engineering Council.
Other minor businesses have been adequately taken
care of and much future business is at present be-
ing planned.

very high honor since
only a small percentage

ALUMNI NEWS
Echoes from the Graduates
Mason P. Rumney
and the University Dormitory Program
TWENTY years ago every student on the
Michigan campus knew who Mason P. Rum-
ney was. If you had asked one of them, he
would have replied that Mason Rumney was left
end on the varsity football team. Today those
students who make it a point to keep well informed
about the affairs of the University would tell you
that Mason Rumney is chair-
man of the Alumni Dormitory
Committee and that he is really
accomplishing something in
that direction.
It is probably just as well for
the University of Michigan that
the motion picture industry
was in its infancy when Mason
P. Rumney was in the same
stage of development. Other-
wise our loss might have been
Hollywood's gain, for it is
known that Mr. Rumney was
a cowboy at the tender age of
thirteen years, and he surely
would have adhered to that
picturesque calling had there
been any such profitable out-
let for cowpunching talent as
the movies now afford. Fortu-
nately, however, when Mason
was thirteen the cavaliers of the plains had to be
content with chaperoning beeves about the great
open spaces for a wage that averaged about $30 a
month and "found". For this reason, Mr. Rumney
laid aside the big-roweled spurs, the wide-brimmed
Stetson, the bandana handkerchief, the six-gun, and
all the other accessories of the cowpunching trade,
and returned to the affete East to take up an indus-
trial career.
After he had decided that Swift, Armour, and the
rest of the packers could get along without him, he
returned to Michigan and settled in Kalamazoo.
His next bid for fame came as a member of the
champion Kalamazoo High School football team of
1901. This was, indeed, a great team, for among its
MASON P. RUMNEY
members were "Shorty" Longman, later one of
Michigan's great backs, and Rufus Gilbert, father
of Louis Gilbert, lately a Maize and Blue star.
Mason was captain of the Kalamazoo team in 1902,
and the following year he went to Michigan, where
he made the All-Fresh Team. He was eligible for
the Varsity in 1904, but he did not advance beyond
the "scrubs" for various rea-
sons, chief among which was
the fact that the team of that
season was one of the best that
Yost ever produced, and its
members were seasoned vet-
erans who could not be dis-
lodged.
Mason was promoted from
scrub to substitute in 1905, the
ability of the old guard still
keeping him on the bench. He
made the grade in 1906, how-
ever, playing on a team that did
not quite measure up to the
standard of the team that pre-
ceded it. In 1907 the Wol-
verines were better and Mason
as left end helped to bring
about the improvement.
After four and a half years
at Michigan and five seasons of
football, Mason Rumney was graduated from the
University with the degree of B. S. in Mechanical
Engineering. He went to Detroit and entered the
firm which his father had just started, the Detroit
Steel Products Co. Before settling down in that
business he went to Europe for the firm and spent
several months studying foreign processes of manu-
facture. He has worked continuously for his father's
firm, and is now President.
At the outset of the World War, Mason Rumney
received the commission of Captain in the Produc-
tion Division of the Ordnance Department, and later
was promoted to the rank of Major and became an
attache to the office of the Chief of Ordnance, with
supervision over the production of all artillery


Page 17
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
vehicles. One of his duties was to assemble the field
artillery program in battery units for shipment
overseas.
A few years ago Mason became President of the
Detroit Railway Harbor Terminals Co., succeeding
William J. Hogan, who became Chairman of the
Board of Directors. This company has a very ex-
tensive plant at the foot of Clark Avenue for
handling shipments of various kinds. It is modeled
somewhat similarly to the Bush Terminals of New
York City, and it has already taken a very promi-
nent place in the transportation set-up of Detroit.
Some of its shipments are being received direct from
Europe, and more of its business will be of this
nature as time goes on. Mr. Rumney has been giv-
ing practically all his time to this enterprise, but
has retained his connection with the Detroit Steel
American Society for Steel Treating and the So-
ciety of Automotive Engineers of which he was a
member of the Council for two years.
Alumni Dormitory Program
In a recent issue of the Michigan Alumnus ap-
peared a sketch of the dormitory programs, por-
tions of which are reprinted here below.
Michigan's dormitory program, officially approved
at the Triennial last May on the part of the alumni,
may now be considered definitely under way. At
the September meeting of the Regents on the 21st,
plans for a women's dormitory to house five hun-
dred girls, originally outlined by an alumni com-
mittee of which Mason P. Rumney, '07e, was chair-
man, were adopted by the Board, a scheme of
financing its construction approved and immediate
bids from contractors authorized.

ENTRANCE BRIDGES OVER THE SUNKEN GARDENS INDICATED
Products Co. as President and member of the Board
of Directors.
Even five years of football at Michigan did not
satisfy Mr. Rumney's craving for amateur sport.
As soon as he went to Detroit he entered the yacht-
ing game. He was a member of the crew of F. H.
Walker's 21-footer Sainte Claire when that boat won
the Lipton Cup at Chicago in 1904 and 1905. The
next season he became skipper of the Otsiketa,
another 21-footer owned by a Country Club syndi-
cate. He won a good share of the races held when
the Otsiketa was in her prime, and a few years later
at the helm of his own boat, Camilla, outsailed all
rivals so consistently that he practically ruined
competition in the 21-foot class. He ranks with the
best Corinthian sailors who ever sailed a boat on
fresh water.
Mr. Rumney was President of the Alumni Asso-
ciation for three years and had much to do with
the incorporation of all the separate Michigan clubs
and other organizations of Michigan alumni into
the present National Alumni Association. He is a
director of the Morris Plan Bank of Detroit, mem-
ber of the American Society for Testing Materials,
The building, sketches for which had already been
prepared by the architects, Malcolmson &amp; Higgin-
botham, of Detroit, under the direction of Mr.
Alexander L. Trout, '10e, '24arch, is to stand on the
high land just east of the Women's Athletic Field
and near the Observatory along Observatory Street.
Alumni will perhaps better remember this site as
lying just south of the old Sleepy Hollow, which
will still remain as a grove between the new dormi-
tory and the Observatory. The sharp slope, in some
places as much as thirty feet from the street to the
level of Palmer Field, affords an unusual oppor-
tunity for terraces and other features in the design
of the building which will add greatly to its general
attractiveness.
A very illuminating report on dormitories in other
universities, together with a special plan for financ-
ing their construction in a state institution as it is
worked out at Michigan State College, was made
by Mr. Trout and Henry Hart, '14L, vice-president
of the Detroit Trust and Security Company. After
seeing it, the committee, under the leadership of
Mr. Rumney, former president of the Alumni Asso-
ciation, approved the project enthusiastically. When


December, 1928
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
the plan was submitted to the Directors of the
Alumni Association and to the Class Officers' Coun-
cil in March it was voted that the establishment
of dormitories be made the main objective of alumni
effort during the next few years. When the matter
was submitted to the Regents at their meeting of
April 24th they at once approved the plan.
Last May the question was presented to the
official representatives of the whole body of the
alumni at the Triennial in Chicago and received
there a whole-hearted endorsement. Meanwhile the
project assumed such a definite shape that the
Regents, at their meeting of June 15th, approved
the preparation of plans for a dormitory for five
hundred women students and directed the Secretary
and Business Manager of the University, Shirley
W. Smith, '97, to make a study and report on the
feasibility of the plan, including estimates of costs,
financing and operation, on a basis which would
bring the property into the hands of the University
within a period of from twenty to thirty years.
The plan assumes that the land is to be owned
by the University before any dormitories are built.
In the case of this first dormitory, part of the land
was already owned by the University and other
portions of it have been purchased by the alumni
through the Dormitory Committee. In brief, the
project contemplates the leasing of this land to the
Guardian Trust Company of Detroit, which will
finance the erection of the building and, in turn,
release the completed property to the University at
an annual rental of eight per cent of the construc-
tion costs, issuing debenture bonds covering the cost
of the building. It is calculated that if these bonds
are issued at five per cent the building will be paid
for and become the property of the University in
twenty-one years; if the rates are lower a larger
proportion of the income can be devoted to the
retirement of the obligations.
This charge on the University, during this period
of approximately twenty years, is to be borne by
the income from the building itself. Careful esti-
mates of the cost of the building, including archi-
tect's fee, furniture and financing the project, shows
a total of $800,000, making the annual cost to the
University $64,000. Equally careful estimates of the
income show an operative surplus of $64,254.54, at
the lowest, with a contingent fund of $3,500 included
as well as charges for depreciation.
The building is, in effect, two complete units or
wings of a larger dormitory group to occupy
eventually all of the land available east of the
women's athletic field. The completed dormitory
will house four hundred and ninety-two students,
eight social directors, representing the women's
governing body of the University, and the regular
administrative staff and servants necessary for the
maintenance of the building.
Each of the two units will house two hundred and
fifty girls, though one kitchen will serve both
groups. Both wings will have their separate en-
trance lobby, reception room, large living room,
book nook, and enclosed porch, as well as two dining
rooms, each with a capacity of one hundred and
twenty-five. The large living rooms, 37 feet wide
by 70 feet long, will form the social centers of each
group with the reception room, elevated by three
steps, so planned that it can be used as a stage for
amateur dramatics or musicales. There will be room
enough to seat each girl in the group, or to give
dance room for a hundred couples or more. The
beautiful enclosed porch looking over the athletic
field, the book nook and small parlors all afford an
opportunity for a measure of privacy—yet open in
friendly fashion on the living room.
The two dining rooms on the first floor in the
central portion of the building will be similar to
the Union summer porch, opening on a terrace over-
looking Palmer Field, while the other two dining
rooms in the projecting pavilions will be lighted
from three sides. During the football season seven
hundred can be cared for at a sitting in these four
dining rooms.
Each wing will have five floors, served by separate
elevators. Most of the rooms will be fifteen feet
nine inches long by eleven feet wide and will con-
tain two cots, two large closets, two study desks
with chairs and one easy chair. Ample base plugs
for study lamps and chiffoniers will supplement the
general ceiling lighting. Several pairs of single
rooms with connecting baths will be available for
chaperones and guests. Sixty-one showers and
twenty-four bath tubs will furnish approximately
one bath or shower for every six girls.
The site on which the building is to stand, be-
cause of its sharp drop to the west, has afforded a
problem which the architects have met with great
success. The usual approach for the residents of
the dormitory will be a short cut across Palmer
Field, with the entrance from this side about five
hundred yards from Barbour Gymnasium. The
main entrance, however, will be from the east on
wrhat is really the second floor, since the first floor
of the building will actually be below the street
level, with sunken gardens filling the space between
the building and the street. Spanning this sunken
garden will be two entrance bridges forming one
of the picturesque features of the building. On the
first, or ground floor, the rooms used by the students,
as well as the more direct entrance from the campus,
will be on the west side, overlooking a terrace which
will still be at a considerable elevation above the
level of the athletic field. The building will be of
red brick with stone trimmings, simple in outline
but attractive in detail. Construction throughout
will, of course, be rigidly fireproof.

Aside form the work of Mr. Rumney, Mr. Hart,
Mr. Trout and officers of the Alumni Association
and the University, several alumni on the staff of
Malcolmson and Higginbotham are also intimately
associated with the design of the building. Ralph
Calder, '22arch, a former Booth fellowship man, is
responsible for the design and for the pencil draw-
ings reproduced herewith. George L. Gerard, '12e,
will be in charge of the structural design, assisted
by Maurice Hammond, '21arch, while Albert E.
Schocrger. '21arch, will be largely responsible for
the specifications. Harold Beam, '22arch, will have
charge of the working drawings, with Charles
Sestok, '29arch, as one of his assistants. Malcolm
Wetzell, '25arch. whose thesis on college dormi-
tories prepared for the College of Architecture two
years ago proved a valuable contribution to the
research connected with the plans, is also assisting
Mr. Calder. While members of the architects' staff
from other colleges will be working on the project,
it is largely a Michigan affair, and illustrates the
growing influence of the College of Architecture.

A. S. M. E.
The month of December will mark the inaugura-
tion of the new plan of meetings of the A. S. M. E.
In the future all talks will be given by students and
whatever papers are read will be student papers. It
is hoped that this new plan will arouse additional
interest in the activities of the society and bring
many valuable results.
At a rather recent meeting of the society, Prof.
A. H. Lovell gave an illustrated talk on "Motoring
Through Europe," which was very interesting and
instructive. Plans are being laid for a Faculty-
Student Banquet to be held in the middle of Decem-
ber at Joe Parker's at which time one of the officials
of the Bell Telephone Co. will speak.
o
A. I. E. E.
At a meeting held in the auditorium of the Detroit
Edison Building, Mr. McEachron of the General
Electric Co. gave a talk on "Lightning and Its Effect
on Transmission Lines." Slides were shown of the
cathode ray oscillograph which is a new instrument
designed by the General Electric engineers. The
meeting was attended by about twenty-five students
and Faculty members.
The Detroit-Ann Arbor Section of the society
held a banquet meeting on November 13 at the
Hayes Hotel at Jackson. After the dinner there
was given a symposium of measurements of extra
high voltage transients. The meeting was opened
by Chairman A. H. Lovell. The first speaker was
Mr. William W. Tefft, vice president and chief engi-
neer of Commonwealth Power Corporation of Mich-
igan. His speech was an introduction to the subject
under discussion. The second speaker, Prof. Fran-
cis C. Harding of Purdue University, spoke on "The
Relative Merits of Various Methods of Measuring
Extra High Voltages." The third speaker, Mr. R.
H. George, also of Purdue University, gave a talk
on "The Design, Construction, and Demonstration
of a New Automatic Recording Cathode-ray Oscil-
lograph." The last speaker on the program w-as
Mr. J. R. Eaton of Consumers Power Company. o

At a recent meeting of the Aero Club, various
members of the Faculty were chosen as honorary
members of the society. They include:
Dean H. C. Sadler Prof. E. A. Stalker
Dean M. E. Cooley Prof. R. E. Franklin
Prof. F. W. Pawlowski Prof. R. T. Liddicoat
Mr. D. K. Kazarinoff
The society is also continuing its most active
program. The recently formed Glider Section has
already ordered the material for the first glider
which is to be built by students during the holidays
in the Wood Working Shops. They have also se-
cured a site on the Potawotamie Trail, about three
miles from the campus, where the gliding will be
done. A great deal of interest has been evidenced
by students in this branch of the society. Already
51 men have joined the section and with such a good
foundation, it would appear that the society will
really make great strides during the coming year. o —
A. I. Ch. E.
Beginning the year 1928-29 with a new aim in
view, the A. I. Ch. E. is looking forward to a most
active and prosperous year. Instead of being merely
a technical society, it is trying to become more and
more social in its nature. Due to the fact that many
of the students who go into the Ch. E. Department
do not do so until their Junior year, the opportuni-
ties for making acquaintanceships in the department
necessarily become limited. In addition to this fact
there are a great many graduate students who have
no opportunity of meeting the undergraduates. The
graduate students of the Ch. E. Department greatly
outnumber those of any other department on the
campus and thus make this need even more crying.
It is therefore the purpose of the A. I. Ch. E. this
year to furnish the means of making the desired
contacts and friendships. The meetings planned in-
clude not only occasional technical talks, but talks
of a more general nature and also "Get-Togethers".
It is hoped that more of the Ch. E. students will
take advantage of the opportunities offered by the
society and affiliate themselves with it.
The leaders for the coming year are:
President R. C. Adams, Jr.
Vice-Pres K. L. Rohrbach
Secretary O. T. Zimmerman
Treasurer Edwin Ravenscraft

IN MEMORIAM
Professor Emeritus Alexander Ziwet
In the death on November 18th of Alexander
Ziwet, Professor Emeritus of Mathematics in the
College of Engineering of the University of Michi-
gan, the American Mathematical Society lost one of
its most distinguished scholars.
Professor Ziwet was born in Breslau, Germany,


December, 1928
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
February 8, 1853, of a Polish father and a German
mother. His father was a landed proprietor, and
his early education was at home under private
tutors. At the age of twelve he entered the gym-
nasium at Glogau, German Silesia, and after five
years attendance was graduated in 1870. His father
having died in the meantime, he joined his mother
and sisters who had gone to Warsaw and there he
learned Polish and Russian and entered the uni-
versity. In 1873 he transferred to the University
of Moscow, which he left in 1874 to study engineer-
ing in Germany. After some time in an architect's
office, he entered the Polytechnic School at Karls-
ruhe, Baden, and in 1880 was graduated as a civil
engineer. He meanwhile had served the required
year in the army and had passed his examination for
a commission as a lieutenant in the reserve artillery
corps.
In the fall of 1880 he came to Detroit, and, after
about two years in the Lake Survey and five years
in the computing division of the United States Coast
and Geodetic Survey, he was appointed an instruc-
tor in mathematics at the University of Michigan.
After several promotions in rank, he became profes-
sor of mathematics and head of the Mathematics
Department in the College of Engineering. He was
also head of the Department of Modern Languages
in the College of Engineering for several years. He
had a command of seven modern languages. He re-
tired in 1925, becoming Professor Emeritus of
Mathematics. The University conferred on him the
honorary degree of Doctor of Science in 1927.
Professor Ziwet has been prominently connected
with the development of mathematics in the United
States. He was a member of the editorial board of
the "Bulletin" from 1892 to 1920 and served as vice
president of the American Mathematical Society
during 1903. The older members of the Society un-
doubtedly remember his book reviews which
showed not only a broad knowledge of mathematics,
but also a keen critical sense. He helped in the
establishment of the Chicago section of the Society
in 1897, was a member of its first program commit-
tee and gave it his unqualified support from the be-
ginning by regular attendance and discussion. He
took a keen interest in the Mathematical Congress
at Chicago and the first colloquium of the Society
at Evanston, in the latter to the extent of writing
up for publication by the society the lectures of
Klein delivered at that time. He was vice president
and chairman of Section A of the American Asso-
ciation for the Advancement of Science during 1905.
His retiring address on "The Relation of Mechanics
to Physics" was published in "Science," January 12,
1906. He was also a member of the executive coun-
cil which organized the Mathematical Association
of America in 1916.
To his colleagues and to serious students Profes-
sor Ziwet gave most generously of his time and
thought. His familiarity with the literature of
mathematics was amazing, covering long periods of
time and journals in half a dozen languages. He
was one of the founders of the University of Michi-
gan Mathematical Club. For many years the club
met at his rooms. To the scholarly activities of the
club, he devoted much time and attention. He was
also active in promoting the general scholarly in-
terests of the university, being one of the influential
members of the University of Michigan Research
Club.
Professor Ziwet left a library of over 5,000 vol-
umes which he presented to the University of
Michigan. In the collection there were about 400
volumes on the history of mechanics, including
many notable works such as a first edition of New-
ton's Principia. The library owes much to Pro-
fessor Ziwet for constant attention over a long
period of years. Professor Ziwet's library, together
with Professor Beman's, which was also large and
which was presented to the university at the time
of Professor Beman's death, are valuable additions
to the Mathematical Library of the university. o
Hoiv the Department of Engineering Research
of the U. of M. Serves Industry
Research is recognized as a necessary part of all
industry. All of the major industries in the country
had their beginnings from the findings of research.
Continued industrial development faces the same
cycle.
No industry or engineering activity can afford to
neglect the services which research can render.
The University of Michigan through its Depart-
ment of Engineering Research places at the dis-
posal of interested companies and individuals the
facilities of the university. These include a trained
personnel, excellent laboratories, equipment of a
high and diversified order and outstanding library
facilties.

Manless Power Plant
An electric distributing station, said to be the
largest in the world to be operated without an at-
tendant, has been completed near New York.
Behind the locked doors of a large one-story brick
building, machines start and stop, circuit breakers
go on and off and lights flash and go out again as
if under the control of numerous attendants. But
the nearest human control is three miles away.
The only time the building will be entered will
be for inspection of the apparatus once each week.
The new distributing plant, handling power suf-
ficient to supply approximately 300,000 families, is
a part of the system of the New York Edison Com-
pany. The control system was devised for the

In the new station, which receives current from
the generating stations at 13,200 volts and dis-
tributes it at 2,300 volts, the control is exercised
through impulses sent over telephone wires leased
from the New York Telephone Company.
The pressing of a key only once automatically
flashes over the wire a telegraphic code composed
of 25 dots and dashes. If anything prevents the
switches from responding to this code when the
operator presses a key, the impulses continue until
the service is performed.
Each key has its own arrangement of dots and
dashes, or code, w-hich controls a particular piece
of apparatus or kind of service.
The flash of a signal light tells the operators when
a switch has operated. He can also press keys to
ascertain whether the various lines are operating
properly.
Another key will cause meters to record for the
operator the amount of current flowing over the
different lines and also their voltage. If any of the

Beryllium will probably first come into com-
mercialization in alloys, of which the aluminum,
copper, nickel, iron and silver have received most
study. To aluminum, beryllium adds strength and
resistance to corrosion; in iron, it acts as a powerful
hardening agent; and its stiffening effect on copper
is unequalled. Whatever the element to which it
is added, beryllium seems invariably to transfer at
least part of its own non-corrodibility.
New uses arc continually being developed. One
of the most interesting is pure beryllium plates for
emergence windows in X-ray tubes. The lower the
atomic weight of an element, the more readily will
it permit the passage of X-rays; beryllium will
transmit the rays seventeen times as well as the
aluminum generally used hitherto.—A Research
Narrative of the Engineering Foundation.

Diesel Engine on Plane
The Packard Motor Company has announced the
successful testing of an oil burning airplane motor,
the first of its kind ever developed.
The motor, which company officials claim marks
a revolutionary step in the development of airplane
power, is a radial air-cooled type and develops 200
horsepower. It involves use of the Diesel principle
of oil for fuel and eliminates gasoline, ignition sys-
tems, carburetors, spark plugs and other parts usu-
ally regarded as troublemakers.
The engine derives power by firing from com-
pression in the cylinders, the Diesel action that
heretofore has been applied only in extremely heavy
engines for power plants and boats. Aside from the
simplicity and ruggedness of design, the engine has
fewer parts than the lightest gasoline engines now
i nuse.
The three cardinal improvements over the gaso-
line motor, claimed by its designer, are:
Elimination of the danger of fire from gasoline.
Reduction of fuel consumption and cost. It is
claimed the motor will carry a plane 25 per cent
farther with the same weight in oil fuel as compared
with gasoline.
Making possible of radio communication with air-
craft on a broad scale, due to elimination of inter-
ference by electrical ignition systems and gasoline
engines.
From the engineering standpoint, the most bril-
liant achievement is claimed in the weight reduc-
tion of such a Diesel engine.—Professional Engi-

manhole covers can be bolted into place, in cases

Every tank is heavily coated inside and out with

is used a ring of angle iron is riveted to the outside
of the tank.
There is a small manhole just above the ladder
and there are two large manholes, one above each
pump and motor for the purpose of removing the
machinery when necessary. The tanks are usually
shipped in sections and it is advisable to erect all
of the machinery before the top section is added,
as this is perhaps more convenient than trying to
align the machinery through the manholes which
are provided for the purpose. However, the man-
holes are so large that it would be possible to erect
the machinery through them in case any condition
should arise where this would be necessary. The
various sections of the tank are furnished with a
ring of angle iron closely riveted to the shell and
the adjacent angle irons are bolted together in erec-
tion with gaskets.
The selection of a tank type of lift plant is com-
paratively simple and involves consideration of the
quantity of sewage to be pumped and the head
against which it will be pumped. The size of the
pumps and the rating and speed of the motors can
easily be selected from data which is available. As
a general rule the elevations of both the incoming
and outgoing sewer lines are established by existing
conditions and these usually come within the limits
of standard tank stations. These elevations deter-
mine the depth of tank required. Often the depth is
so great that a guide bearing is needed in the
intermediate shaft.
Recently two stations have been installed here in
Michigan, one at Jackson, which is equipped with
two 4 in. vertical pumps in a tank 7 ft. 6 in. in
diameter by 12 ft. in depth. The station at Muske-
gon Heights has the same size pumps but is 10 ft.
8 in. in depth. Among other recent interesting
installations are the ones at Beech Grove, Indiana,
consisting of two 3 in. pumps installed in a tank
7 ft. 6 in. in diameter by 24 ft. 9 in. in depth and
at the city of La Junta, Colorado, consisting of two
8 in. pumps installed in a tank 11 ft. 6 in. in diameter
by 28 ft. 7 in. in depth.
The tank type of relift station has a number of
very important advantages. At the very start the
standardized station does away with much of the
engineering which is necessary in planning an in-
dividual installation; furthermore, there are no
costly changes during or after construction due to
inexperienced designing. When sewage pumps are
used, no screening equipment is required; thus
simplified, the station will often cost for construc-
tion and operation less than half what one for the
same service with ordinary pumps would cost. All
expense for land and buildings is eliminated by the
use of underground construction. The entire unit
may be installed below the street surface on prop-
erty already owned by the city, whereas the con-
ventional design calls for the purchase of a location
and erection of a building. Installation costs are
also very small with the steel tank unit because
the cribbing, form work, reinforcing and pumping
not infrequently necessary during construction of
a concrete station of this character are eliminated.
Mechanical work is reduced to a minimum because
all equipment and fittings are supplied read}' to be
put in place.
Municipalities often find underground sewage
pumping stations highly satisfactory for extending
sewer lines in changing the city limits or opening
new subdivisions where the ground surface is so low
that it is impractical to connect with existing sewers
directly. Such stations are almost invariably less
expensive than laying new lines or relocating old
ones. They may be relied upon when placed in re-
mote localities where they can receive only occa-
sional inspection or they may be installed beneath
the busiest streets with the very least interruption
of traffic during construction.

the west shore of Lake Como and then took the
famous Auto Strada from Como to Milan. This is a
wide paved road reserved exclusively for auto
traffic between Milan and the Italian lakes. All
cross traffic crosses the Strada on overhead bridges
and cars are admitted to side entry on the road only
w hen an attendant opens guard gates and signals
there is a clear space in traffic permitting entry.
The special toll was 75 cents for a one-way trip.

ONWARD AND UPWARD
TODAY Civilization marches onward and upward. The development
of a city requires tall buildings which increase land values by giving
added income from costly real estate.
The elevator by making the skyscraper possible has in this way added
untold wealth to the cities of the world.
Developed step by step from the crudest early apparatus, the modern
elevator is' a marvel of mechanical genius—speedy, safe, dependable.
Since Elisha Graves Otis produced the first safe elevator in 1852, Otis
has been the "World's Word for Elevator Safety".

phone cables, high tension transformers, motors,
etc. The Pirelli factory was making a large three
single-conductor cable, spiralled, leaded and armor-
ed, with an outside diameter of almost 6 inches.
According to European practice this cable is laid in
the earth in a shallow trench where, unlike Amer-
ican conditions, it seems to operate undisturbed by
other construction forces.
The steam-electric power stations near Paris are
of almost the same design as we would use in
America. An older station at Gennvilliers is stoker
fired and of 340,000 k.w. capacity. It was here that
one of the 40,000 k.w. turbo units ran for 135 hours
in 1925 with the steam at a temperature of 775-914
degrees F. The Usine de Nord of 400,000 k.w.
capacity is quite modern, using pulverized fuel, and
its 35,000 k.w. units transmit their output at two-
phase, 12.000 volts direct to the Paris lighting sub-
stations.

that he could determine the possible income avail-
able for himself or the lords to whom various lands
might be granted. Some of these entries are quite
interesting.
"In Middlewich there is a wich [this term 'wich'
comes from the Anglo-Saxon and means a place
where salt was made] which was held by the King
and the Earl. There, however, the salt houses are
not the Lord's fi. e., they were held independent of
the overlord by the burghers], and the customs were
divided between the King and the Earl. The King
had 2 parts and the Earl the 3rd. From these wiches,
whoever carried away bought salt in a wain drawn
by 4 oxen or more, paid 4 pence for the toll, but
if by 2 oxen, 2 pence. A man from another hundred
gave 2 pence for a horse load, but a man from the
same hundred gave only Vi penny for a horse load.
Whoever loaded his wain so that the axle broke
within a league of either wich, gave 2 shillings to
the King's or the Earl's officers if he were over-
taken within the league. In a like manner, he who
loaded his horse so heavily as to .break its back
gave 2 shillings if overtaken within the league, but
nothing if overtaken beyond it."
The first private record mentioning salt is in the
foundation deed of Combermere Abbey, dated 1132,
in which Hugh Malbane states: "And I also grant
to the said monks the 4th part of the town of Wich,
and a tithe of my salt, and all of the salt pits that
are mine, and salt of Blessed Mary, the Virgin, and
salt on Friday, and salt for the Abbott's table, as
freely as I have it at my table."
The methods of boiling in the Saxon and Norman
wiches were apparently much the same as described
by Agricola. One of the old salt pans has been re-
covered and measures 3 feet 8 inches long on one
side, 3 feet 4}4 inches long on the other side, 2 feet
8 inches wide, and 4 inches deep. It is apparently
made of cast lead about inch thick, and weighs
about 240 lbs. The earliest description of the opera-
tion dates from 1605, and is not especially detailed.
In 1669 a description was printed regarding the
method of working these pans which reads as
follows:
"They use for their fuel pitcoals brought out of
Staffordshire. These pans are set upon iron bars,
bricked in very close. They first fill their pans with
brine out of the pit: which comes to them in several
wooden gutters; then they put into their pans
amongst the brine a certain mixture, made of about
20 gallons of brine, and 2 quarts of calves', cows'
and, chiefly, sheep's blood. Of this mixture they
put about 2 quarts into a pan that holds about 360
quarts of brine: this bloody brine at the first boiling
of the pan brings up a scum which they are careful
to skim off; they continue their fire as quick as they
can till half the brine be wasted, and this they call
boiling upon the fresh. But when it is half boiled
away, they fill their pans again with new brine out
of the ship (so they call a great cistern by their
pan sides, into which their brine runs through the
wooden gutters from the pump, that stands in the
pit) then they put into the pan two quarts of the
mixture following: they take a quart of white of
eggs, beat them with as much brine, as before was
done with the blood; and thus that which they call
the whites is made. As soon as this is in, they boil
sharply till the second scum arise; then scum it off
as before, and boil very gently till it corne; to pro-
cure which, when part of the brine is wasted they
put into each pan of the size aforesaid about a
quarter of a pint of the best and strongest ale they
can get; this makes a momentary abullition, which
is soon over, and then they abate their fires yet
not so but that they keep it boiling all over though
gently: for the workmen say that if they boil fast
here, it wastes their salt. After all their leach brine
is in, they boil gently till a kind of scum comes on
it like a thin ice: which is the first appearance of •
the salt; then that sinks and the brine everywhere
gathers into comes at the bottom to it, which they
gently rake together with their loots, this they con-
tinue till there is but very little brine left in the pan:
then with their loots they take it up, the brine
dropping from it, and throw it into their barrows,
which are cases made with flat cleft wickers, in the
shape almost of a sugar loaf, the bottom uppermost.
When the barrow is full they let it stand so for an
hour and a half in the trough, where it drains out
all the leach brine, then they remove it into their
hothouse behind their works made there by two
tunnels under their pans, carried back for that pur-
pose. The leach brine that runs from the barrows
they put into the next boiling, for it is to their


NEW
PROCESSES
MEAN PROGRESS
THE Dow Chemical Company has been
noted for the development of many
new processes in the manufacture of chemi-
cal products.
During wartime came the need for indigo
and the development by this company of
the first commercial manufacture of
Synthetic Indigo in America.
Dow chemists and engineers have devel-
oped new processes for the manufacture of
Aniline Oil. Another Dow origination is
the new Phenol process described in the
February, 1928 issue of Industrial and Engi-
neering Chemistry. This company leads in
the production of magnesium
and its alloys which combine the _^^~w^.
lightness of the metal with &lt;C^JjO"Vir
mechanical strength required
for use in aviation. These are but a few
of the newer methods applied in the Dow
organization.
They serve to indicate the spirit of progress
that lies back of Dow policy—that has been
responsible for the growth of this company.
They are a testimonial to the technically
trained minds that have played such a big
part in the development of this institution.
Located, as we are, directly above our raw
material supply, this company has unique
natural advantages. Most of our raw ma-
terial is drawn from the brine wells directly
under
or adjacent to the plant. These
advantages are of benefit to our
personnel and our customers as
well as to The Dow Chemical
Company.

advantage being salt melted and wanting only
hardening.
"This work is performed in two hours in the
smaller pans, which are shallower, and generally
boil their brine more away: wherefore their salt will
last better, though it does not granulate so well,
because when the brine is wasted the fire and
stirring breaks the comes. But this salt weights
heavier and melts not so soon: and therefore is
bought for man\p sales to a distance. But in the
greater pans, which are usually deeper, they are
above half an hour longer in boiling; but because
they take their salt out of their brine, and only
harden it in their hothouse, it is apter to melt away
in a moist air; yet of this sort of salt the longer
the grain is, the longer it endures; and generally
this is the better granulated and the clearer, though
the other be the whiter. And I think it is rather
the taking of the salt out of the brine before it is-
wasted that causes the granulating of it, than the
ale, to which the workmen impute it.
"They never cover their pans at all, during the
whole time of boiling. They have their houses like
barns open up to the thatch with a cover-hole or
two to vent the steam of the pans." The similarity
of this operation to the operation described by
Agricola is quite obvious.
The English salt industry was very carefully
regulated, and an enormous amount of such in-
formation is found in the Walling book of North-
wich. The boiling of salt brine was called "walling",
and those wdio tended the pans were called "wallers".
There are over 80 regulations on record, and these
regulations were enforced by the following officials:
Constable, Lead-Looker, Overseer, Salt-Viewer,
Assessor, Killer, of Salt. Market-Looker, Sealer of
Leather, Ale-Taster, Scavinger, Gutter-Viewer,
Wood-Tender, and Pan-Cutter. Each of these im-
portant officials must swear in the prescribed form,
"by the holy contents of this book, to spare no man
for any love, favor, or affection, in the fulfillment of
your several duties, but of all the defaults and
defects that you shall find in the execution of your
office you shall present at every single court to be
held after such default made—So help you God."
Many of the regulations are interesting, not only
for the light they throw on the manufacture of salt,
but on the customs of the time and the conditions
in the town. For instance, one regulation forbids
"scolding or chiding to the trouble or disquietness
of good and honest neighbors." "Item No. 22: No
person shall deliver any brine to be carried out of
this town, either in hogsheads or barrels (except on
women's heads) upon pain of forfeit to the Lord for
ever)- such offence, 20 shillings. Item No. 24: That
there should be left at every pile made at the end
of any wich-house or wood room, a yard and a half
between the said pile and the crest of the pavement,
with the intent that wains may have a better
passage, upon pain of 6 shillings, 8 pence, present-
able at any single court." This indicates that there
were traffic difficulties even in those days, though
they were not due to the parking of wains along
the pavement. That the various officers had con-
siderable trouble with arithmetic is shown by the
following item: "Item No. 26: It is ordered that
no person from henceforth shall be suffered to wall
or occupy any odd lead, as 3, 5, or 7, but only 2, 4
or 6 leads, for the avoiding of trouble to the officers,
except as in such case as cannot be remedied, upon
pain of 10 shillings." Other regulations prescribe
the size and shape of leads, and the amount of brine
that can be boiled in each. Part of the Lead-
Lookers' duties were to see that the leads were of
the prescribed size, and he was provided with a
pair of shears so that if the leads were larger than
standard he could cut them down.
Not only was production controlled, but quality
was also controlled. "Item No. 40: It is ordered
that if any waller be found making of coarse salt
when they might make it better if they would, the
Lead-Lookers or Salt-Viewers so finding them and
making presentment thereof, every such waller so
offending shall fine to their Lord for every offence
therein 2 pence." A predecessor of our modern
boiler inspection service is found in the following:
"Item No. 43: We do also order that every occu-
piers' leads of this town shall henceforth be made
10 stone weight a piece to the pan before they be
cast, upon paid of the lead caster's forfeiture to the
Lord of this town for every default in casting any
leads contrary to this order, the sum of 10 shillings."
The study of the regulation, control, and taxation
of the salt industry in these times is a most interest-
ing one, but space does not permit following the
subject further here. Enough has been given to
show how closely the industry was controlled, and
to illustrate that four or five hundred years ago
such subjects as restriction of outputs, suppression
of competition, artificial price fixing, and attempts
to nullify the law of supply and demand were just
as common as they are in any present day industry.
As a matter of fact, the salt industry was probably
one of the most closely controlled of any of the
manufacturing industries of its time. This was
possible because it was centralized in relatively few
locations, and the chances of manufacturing "boot-
leg" salt were practically zero.
So far as the technology of salt making was con-
cerned, the procedure of boiling the brine in flat
pans, coagulating the impurities with blood, white
of eggs, or beer, and removing the salt with wooden
shovels, continued in Germany, England, and the
United States until well after 1800. With the later
developments of the salt industry this article is not
concerned.

The Need For Broader Engineering
Education
By George W. Patterson
Associate Dean of the College of Engineering
IX THE century of engineering education in this
country since the founding in 182d of the Rens-
selaer Polytechnic Institute, which was the first
American institution devot-
ed to the education of civil
(as distinguished from mili-
tary) engineers, there has
been great growth both in
the number of institutions
and their scope.
There had already been
founded in France, by decree
of the Convention March 11.
1794, the Ecole Polytech-
nif|ue of Paris for the train-
ing of both military and civil
engineers. This school lays
a broad foundation for the
more advanced training of
its students in military engi-
neering at the Ecole d'Ap-
plication at Met/. ; and for its
students in civil engineering
at one of a group of profes-
sional schools in Paris, the
Ecole des Ponts et Chaus-
sees, the Ecole Speciale des Mines, etc., which have
curricula in the various branches of civil engineer-
ing. The ficole Polytechnique and its associated
advanced schools undoubtedly have profoundly in-
fluenced engineering education throughout the
western world.
In this country engineering education has taken
PROF. GEORGE W. PATTERSON
various courses. We may classify the schools into
four groups: First, there are the purely technical
schools, such as the Rensselaer Polytechnic Insti-
tute or the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology;
second, the universities, such
as Michigan or Yale, which
include colleges of engineer-
ing; third, the land grant
colleges of agriculture and
mechanic arts, such as the
Michigan State College at
Lansing; and fourth, the
multitude of technical
schools of lower rank includ-
ing the manual training high
schools.
In their evolution the en-
gineering colleges of the uni-
versities and the indepen-
dent technical schools have
kept closely abreast, and the
land grant colleges of agri-
culture and mechanic arts
have left their old position
and now approximate that of
the engineering colleges and the independent
schools.
The University of Michigan, so far as I know,
was the first university to offer an engineering cur-
riculum. The legislative act under which the uni-
versity was organized in 1837 provided for instruc-
tion in engineering; the first professor of civil engi-

neering, Alexander Winchell, was appointed in 1853.
Professor Winchell was also professor of physics.
In 1855, he was transferred to the chairs of geology,
zoology and botany, and was succeeded in civil en-
gineering and physics by William Gay 1'eck, who
served until 1857 when he resigned to become pro-
fessor of mathematics and astronomy in Columbia
College, l'rofessor Peck was succeeded in turn in
1857 by De Volson Wood, the great engineer.
The catalogue of 1856, which
I have before me, shows the
curriculum of the School of
Engineering, in the Depart-
ment of Science, Literature and
the Arts. The courses of study
include mathematics, graphics,
physics, natural science (in-
cluding chemistry, mineralogy,
geology and meteorology), as-
tronomy, English and either
French or German, philosophy
and engineering.
The engineering studies in-
cluded plane, geodesic, rail-
road, and mining surveying;
leveling; nature and strength
of materials; theory of con-
structions; architecture; ma-
chines, particularly the steam
engine and locomotive; motors,
particularly steam and water.
W ith the exception of plane surveying, geodesy and
leveling, all the engineering studies were in the
fourth year.
Practically all universities of this country now
have schools or colleges of engineering; but in
Europe, higher engineering education is given in
separate institutions, such as the German technical
high schools. The German high school is not to be
confused with the high school as we know it here;
there it ranks with the university.
Professional education in law and medicine in
this country has in the last generation advanced
greatly, both in admission requirements and in
length and scope of its curriculum. Engineering
education, on the other hand, which formerly had
higher admission requirements and twice as long a
curriculum, has practically stood still as to admis-
sion requirements and length of course.
With the great growth of engineering knowledge
we have seen the introduction of more and more
technical courses and the dropping of almost all the
elective courses which made the graduate of a gen-
eration ago a more broadly trained man than is our
graduate now.
How many of our students are able to use our
wonderful physics laboratory with its great offer-
ing of opportunity in the study of electricity, mag-
netism, heat and light? How many get more than
MUCH has already been said
concerning the broadening
of Engineering Education, but
there still remains much unsaid.
Many have voiced their opinions,
but there are still others yet to be
heard. Prof. Patterson has ex-
pressed himself quite fully in the
matter and has in doing so added
materially to what has already
appeared in these pages on this
same subject. Those who have
had the privilege of knowing
Prof. Patterson will understand
the sincerity and well-grounded-
ness of his statements, and also
the wealth of experience from
which he draws.

the most elementary and condensed course in chem-
istry? But wrorst of all. how many have time to
devote to a really broad human education to help
them (ill their place in society? This opportunity
will never return for many; and their life will have
less joy of living than need be, though they may
be richly paid in all the things which money will
buy. We may grant that after graduation these men
may fill in the gap in their education. But with the
struggle to earn a living for
themselves and theirs, how-
many will do so? It is more
probable that they will devote
their educational efforts to a
narrower and narrower part of
the engineering field.
Ann Arbor knows a remark-
able exception, a man who by
his own efforts has not only
become an outstanding engi-
neer, but has become also a
widely educated human being.
He never even went to college.
There probably are others, but
they are few.
The Society for the Promo-
tion of Engineering Education
has completed a study of engi-
neering education ; it has all the
pertinent facts, but its eyes
seem blind to the situation. It
would tinker our curricula in a few details, but it is
hopelessly lacking in vision as to what a human edu-
cation requires. If engineering is a profession, and
not a trade, something radical should be done and
now.
The University is about to transfer the first two
years of the curriculum of engineering students to
the University College. The transfer should mean
more than an administrative change in the routine
of the work, as in a factory. If the pre-engineering
student is not given an opportunity for a broader
basic training in that college before he is trans-
ferred to the College of Engineering there will be
no gain.
The education of the engineer, if he is to live a
full life, should not be so narrow as to leave him ig-
norant of history, philosophy, political economy,
sociology, modern languages, natural science, or
even music and art. While it is evident that the
young student of the University College may be
too immature to appreciate certain of these subjects
while in that college, he undoubtedly could elect
some with advantage if given an opportunity, and
he could elect others during his professional years.
I suggest that the normal period of residence in
the University College and the College of Engineer-
ing be extended one year, and that enough of the

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
The Mechanical Engineering
Laboratory
By Harry J. Watson
Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering
THE function of the Mechanical Engineering
Laboratory is threefold in character. First,
it provides actual experience for the student
in the testing of steam engines, boilers, internal
combustion engines, steam turbines, fans, air com-
pressors, pumps, water wheels, refrigeration plants,
and other machinery. Second, it affords an oppor-
tunity for advanced students, and members of the
faculty, to engage in research covering a great va-
riety of problems. Third, it
provides a place for demonstra-
tion for various class room
courses.
The work in the laboratory
may be divided into two kinds,
depending upon its character;
viz., commercial testing, and
research. The term "commer-
cial testing" is applied to such
work as determining the steam
consumption of a steam tur-
bine, the fuel consumption of
an internal combustion engine,
or perhaps the efficiency of a
steam boiler. Such tests are
conducted according to test
codes adopted by the American
Society of Mechanical Engi-
neers. To explain term "com-
mercial testing" further, suppose that a manufac-
turer purchases a 500 KW. turbo-generator on a
contract which guarantees the steam consumption
of the unit at say J4» V*, Va, and full load; and
under certain specified initial steam pressure, qual-
ity of steam or superheat, and exhaust, or back
pressure. The purpose of the commercial test is
to determine whether or not the unit meets the
guarantee after it has been installed. Such tests are
also conducted where no guarantee is to be consid-
ered; that is, tests to determine the coct of opera-
tion of units which have been in service for some
time.
For such tests the unit is put into operation and
runs are made with loads of say 125, 250, 375, and
500 KW. Each run, in practice, is at least one hour
long; but for lack of time and other educational
reasons, the runs arc somewhat shorter in the regu-
lar laboratory courses.
The load is usually provided by a water rheostat
and is kept absolutely constant during each run.
THE underclassman who wan-
ders about the engineering
laboratories gazing sometimes be-
wilderedly at the many pieces of
apparatus will find in the accom-
panying article a great deal which
will be of interest. Others who
may be better acquainted with the
laboratory will value the oppor-
tunity to learn some of the history
of the present installations. None
could be more fitted to tell in an
interesting way what is to be
found inside the red brick walls
than Assistant Professor Watson,
who has stood by through much
of its development.

at say five-minute intervals. In such a test the load
is measured with precision electrical instruments;
the steam pressure vacuum at exhaust, and a num-
ber of other pressures and temperatures are de-
termined from previously calibrated thermometers
and pressure gauges. The quantity of steam is ar-
rived at by pumping the condensed steam from the
condenser into tanks on platform scales, so that it
may be weighed. Most of the tests in the regular
laboratory courses are commer-
cial in character in order to
provide some experience in op-
erating such machinery and
practice in calibrating and us-
ing v a r i o u s instruments, so
that the student may be
equipped for both commercial
testing and research work.
Perhaps a more or less de-
tailed description of the work
in the two regular courses in
the laboratory will be of inter-
est. The first course embodies
the following: A test of a
steam engine to determine me-
chanical efficiency for a num-
ber of loads; valve setting both
on the plain slide valve engine,
and the Corliss engine; the test
of a power pump; a steam consumption test of an
engine; a combined mechanical efficiency and fuel
consumption test of a gas engine; a steam consump-
tion test of a turbo-generator, using four methods
to determine the steam quantity: and a test of a
steam boiler.
This work covers a period of ten weeks, with
two 4'S hour periods per week. The other five
weeks of the semester are devoted to fuel analyses,
etc., in the Chemical Engineering Laboratory.
For most of the tests a preliminary period is pro-
vided for a thorough study of the test, calibration
of instruments, etc. To promote the study of the
equipment and manner of conducting the test, a list
of questions is handed to the squad, and they (four
or five men) arc directed to find the answers to
them. Following this the instructor conducts a quiz
from the questions, explains the purpose of the test,
and answers all questions. The necessary instru-
ments are then procured from the instrument room,
and under the direction of the instructor, a sort of
Readings on all of the various instruments are taken preliminary test is made. Following this some of


January. 1929

the instruments arc calibrated. At the next meeting
of the class, the test is run, and other instruments
calibrated. At the third meeting of the class the
calibrations of the instruments are worked up, and
the results of the test computed, all of which is
under the personal supervision of the instructor.
THE AMMONIA COMPRESSOR UNIT OF THE CREAMERY
PACKAGE REFRIGERATING PLANT
The second course in the laboratory is conducted
along the same lines as the first, with the exception
that there are more tests, and these are more elabo-
rate. In this latter course the work consists of a
steam consumption test of a steam turbine; a com-
plete test of a Unaflow steam engine, a test of an
air compressor, a test of a fan, a test of an oil engine,
a test of an hydro-electric unit, a test of an impulse
water wheel, a test of a centrifugal pump, and a
test of a refrigeration plant. All of the above are
commercial in character, but also include some ad-
ditional features of an investigative nature.
In addition to the abov e, a few short tests in the
nature of investigations are provided, such as the
performance of the steam injector, calibration of a
Weir, etc.
This course requires two A) 2 hour periods per
week during the entire semester.
Brief reports, including computed results, per-
formance curves, computation and original data, are
submitted for each test, and for three of the tests
in each course a full written report is required.
Some three hundred and sixty complete tests are
conducted each year in these two courses.
In addition to the courses of instruction just out-
lined, the laboratory provides facilities for research.
Some of this work is carried on by students in elec-
tive courses under the direction of v arious members
of the staff. In these courses the student is encour-
aged to take up an investigation in which he is
particularly interested, and is given all necessary
assistance.
Another function of the laboratory is to carry on
some of the inv estigations brought to the University
through the Department of Engineering Research.
This work comes from the many industries of the
country. Much of it is conducted by members of
the faculty themselves, and some by men in the
employ of the firms interested, or by graduate stu-
dents on the scholarship plan, but all under the
direction of some responsible member of the faculty.
An example of this is the research work on natural
ventilation by Professor J. E. Emswiler, covering a
period of several years.
Again, various members of the faculty have "pet"
problems of their own which are worked out in the
laboratory, for the benefit of the University, its fac-
ulty, and its students.
Still another function of the laboratory is the use
of its equipment to demonstrate parts of the sub-
ject matter in some courses involving classroom and
lecture work only. Eor instance, a class in heat en-
gines may inspect the engines and boilers, and actu-
ally use the steam engine indicator. They may in-
spect the Lansing engine, which is "cut open," to
see just how it is made, and how the parts do their
bit. Taking it by and large, the Mechanical Engi-
neering laboratory and the University power plant,
enable them to become more or less familiar with
machinery, even before they reach the courses in-
volving its study.
The laboratory equipment must of necessity be
of considerable variety. Perhaps the best way to
divide it would be into three groups: viz., (a) the
engines, turbines, pumps, etc., or machinery found
in power plants and the industries; (b) instruments
necessary for carrying on the work, such as pressure
gauges, thermometers, indicators, and a multitude
of other instruments; (c) such equipment as prony

brakes, water rheostats, tanks, portable electric mo-
tors, equipment for calibrating thermometers, pres-
sure gauges, etc.
Like all mechanical engineering laboratories, the
one here at Michigan has some "old timers," and

sonic new equipment. Scattered about in the vari-
ous nooks and corners is to be found a great variety
of equipment which has been put aside temporarily.
Such equipment may he put aside until those in-
terested have sufficient time to continue the work
for which it was huilt. Again, this equipment is
often dismantled, and the various parts used on a
new "set-up." Other parts of equipment are left
lving about lor educational reasons. The visitor
should, therefore, not judge the appearance of the
laboratory in the same manner as the engine room
&lt;&gt;f a power plant, such as the University operates
on W ashington Street, for instance.
Perhaps it would be well if we make .a rather
hurried trip through the laboratory and point out
some of the most important pieces of equipment.
Entering on the second floor, at our right we see
a large tank used for hydraulic testing, and just be-
yond this the Doble hydro-electric unit. This equip-
ment consists of a Doble impulse water wheel of
150 h.p. when supplied with water under (()!) ft.
head. The turbine is directly connected to a 100
k.v.a.—60 cycle 250 v.—3-phase A. C. generator.
To our right is a Xash vacuum pump used in
connection with vacuum heating in large buildings.
This equipment was presented to the University.
Passing along we observe on our right a number
of small internal combustion engines of various
types. They are. a 5 h.p. Economy gasoline engine,
an 8 h.p. Olds gasoline engine, a Mietz and Weiss
kerosene engine, a Fairbanks-Morse gas engine, and
what is known as the Brayton engine, which was
presented to the University by the late Col. Dean
of Ann Arbor.
On our left, we see two steam engines used for
valve setting, and a small triplex pump with the
necessary tanks for testing purposes.
Here we also find the old "Lansing" engine built
by the students, back in 1X87. It was retired from
active service several years ago and has been "cut
open" for demonstration purposes.
Next to it are the two steam turbines. One is
a 20 K.W. Del.aval operating at 20,000 revolutions
per minute and the other is a 25 KAV. Curtis oper-
ating at 3,600 revolutions per minute.
The table next to the turbines holds equipment
for calibrating thermometers, pressure gauges, and
steam engine indicators.
Passing on to the 1 &gt;oiler room gallery we find the
feed water heater, the induced draft equipment for
the boilers below and the pipe shop for the labora-
tory. The table just in front of the door contains
an automatic carbon dioxide apparatus, and a place
for stack gas analysis during boiler tests.
Passing down the west stairway to the first floor
we see in front of us the Corliss engine, used for
many years to provide power in the old engineering
shops, and now serving as a unit with which
students learn the technique of valve setting.
To our right is a 25 h.p. Ball steam engine and
beyond this the 90 h.p. Harrisburgh Una-flow en-
gine. This latter engine was installed in 1922 along
with a C. fl. Wheeler surface condenser. The con-
denser is equipped with a Kadojet air pump.
The older condenser, huilt by the Wheeler Con-
denser and Engineering Co., is equipped with an
Edwards wet vacuum pump.
Turning to the left we see a 15 h. p. Hornsby-
Akyroyd oil engine, and a 36 h. p. Ridgway steam
engine. This latter engine was installed in 1924 to
take the place of the Lansing engine.
Passing into the boiler room we encounter the 40
h. p. Stirling boiler used tor testing purposes, and
THE HARRISBURGH UNA-FLOW ENGINE ON THE
LOWER FLOOR OF THE LABORATORY
the necessary boiler feed pump, other auxiliaries
and accessories.
In the boiler room we also find one or two
cast iron heating boilers, these being presented or
loaned to the University.
Retracing our steps, we see next the Fairbanks-
Morse low compression oil engine. This engine
was installed in 1920.
Moving on to the hydraulic part of the laboratory
we find what appears to be a confusion of pipes,
pumps, tanks, etc.
This part of the laboratory contains a 50 h. p.
Sprague electric dynameter for testing centrifugal
pumps, a motor-driven Davton-Dowd centrifugal
pump of about 40 G. P. M. capacity, a Blake du-
plex steam driven hire Underwriters pump of about
600 G. P. M. capacity, and a Hies Koto-turbo pump
of 1250 G. P. M. for fire service and testing
purposes.
Recently the Civil Engineering Department in-
stalled a motor-driven Worthington Centrifugal
pump of 5400 G. P. M. and 50 ft. head. This latter
unit is used to supply water for research work with
flumes, weirs, etc.
The two large tanks on the first floor are sit-

Tresaguet—Father Of Modern
roadbuilding
By Roger L. Morrison
Professor of Highway Engineering and Highway Transport
~T T is commonly assumed that the two Scotch-
« men, Macadam and Telford, were responsible
for the development of the broken stone road
which was the standard of high class construction
for more than a century, but the fact is that this
type of surface was devised by the French engineer,
Tresaguet, when Macadam and Telford were boys.
By a queer trick of Fate the names of these two
men have been preserved in
the designation of this type of
construction, even in France,
while that of Tresaguet, the
real inventor, is practically un-
known to present day engi-
neers.
The Tresaguet Family
Pierre Marie Jerome Tresa-
guet was born at Nevers,
France, in 1716 and came from
a family of engineers. His
father. Octave Tresaguet. was
an engineer in the service of
the king, and we know only
that he lived in Moulins, was
retired in 1735, and died at
Nevers May 1, 1743 at the age
of 69 years.
Octave Tresaguet had three
sons, all of whom were engi-
neers. The oldest, Jacques
Henry, was born February 13,
1713, at Nevers. Like his father, he was a royal
engineer and was chief engineer of the District of
Berry in 1755 and 1761. Me was retired because of
illness in 1765 with a pension of 1,000 livres (about
$200). The second son. Octave Jean Francois, was
engineer of bridges and roads of the District of
Moulines in 1748 and died January 13, 1785.
Unfortunately, little is known of the early life
of P. M. J. Tresaguet. He was Assistant Engineer,
or Assistant Inspector, of the District of Paris and
was made Chief Engineer of the District of
Limoges on July 22, 1764, his appointment read-
ing as follows:
"Louis, by the grace of God . . . being informed
that Marie-Jerome Tresaguet, Assistant Inspector
of Bridges and Roads of the District of Paris, has
performed the functions of that position with a dis-
tinction which merits recompense, we have resolved
PIERRE MARIE JfiROME TRSSAGUET
Froin Les Voics Terrestrca by H. H. Heude
to give him the title and the salary of Engineer of
the said Bridges and Roads in the place of Mr.
Jean-Francois Marmillot, to have in the future the
management and inspection of works of Bridges and
Roads and to make the estimates and purchases."
The salary was 2,400 livres (about $480) per year.
Marmillot. whom Tresaguet succeeded in this po-
sition, was called by the king of Denmark in 1764
to establish the first system of
main roads in that country.
The natural assumption is that
he resigned as Chief Engineer
at Limoges to accept the Dan-
ish appointment.
Tresaguet was 48 years old
when he went to Limoges and
he occupied the position of
Chief Engineer of this district
for eleven years. The archives
of Limoges contain correspon-
dence and other memoranda
which gives considerable in-
formation as to his work dur-
ing this period.
In 1767 he had charge of the
construction of such works as
were necessary to establish
navigation on the Charentc
above Cognac to Civray. Some
of these works which he built
are still in existence. On Sep-
temper 30, 1772, he wrote a discussion on the
advantages and disadvantages of lift-locks, and his
great power of vision is shown in a postcript to
this discussion, outlining a system of navigable
rivers which would "traverse the whole kingdom
without interruption" and be of inestimable ad-
vantage to commerce in general, and in particular
to the transportation of building materials and war
supplies from the foundries of Ruelle (near
Angouteme) and Hormeau.
Early French Roads
It is because of his development of a new system
for the construction and maintenance of broken
stone roads that Tresaguet deserves a place among
the great engineers of the world, and perhaps the
greatest of highway engineers. In order to have
the proper background for the consideration of his
work along these lines it may be well, at this point.


Page 11
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
to trace briefly the previous history of highways
in France.
During their occupation of Gaul from 58 B. C. to
300 A.I), the Romans had built many excellent roads
in that province, but in the latter year they were
forced by the barbarians, to withdraw, and road-
building was stopped. After the fall of Rome in
476 the light of civilization was dimmed for nearly
1.000 years, and during these dark ages the art of
road building was practically lost. The great Ro-
man roads, connecting all important parts of the
civilized world, were neglected and fell into a state
of decay verging upon ruin. Charlemagne, about
800 A. D., built a few roads, but after his death this
work ceased and even the renaissance of the 15th
and 16th centuries brought only a slight and tem-
porary awakening of interest in highway construc-
tion. In the 17th century, Colbert, an energetic
and far-sighted Minister of Finance of France, was
active in the improvement of road conditions, but
little material progress was made, and at the be-
ginning of the 18th century the roads were, to quote
an early writer, "in a state of nature or worse."
In 1716, the year of Tresaguet's birth, the famous
national Corps of Bridges and Roads was estab-
lished and for 200 years it was probably the world's
finest highway organization. It may still hold that
distinction, but with the many excellent highway
departments in Europe and America at the present
time, it is difficult to determine which one is the
best. The Marquis of Beringhen was the first Di-
rector of the Corps of Bridges and Roads.
Laws intended to improve highway conditions
had been passed in 1705 and 1706 and these were
revived in 1720, but limited funds, poor construc-
tion and lack of maintenance prevented any exten-
sive or lasting improvements. At the time of the
marriage to Louis XV to Marie Leczinsha in 1725
traveling was very difficult and conditions were des-
cribed by d'Argcnson as follows:
"I shall never forget the horror and calamities en-
dured in France, at the time of the queen's arrival
there. Continual rain had brought famine and things
were made worse by a poor government. Who can
describe the unheard of misery of the country! At
this time they were concerned with the harvest
which they could not reap. The poor laborer sought
for a moment in which to do it but all the province
was 'beaten with rods'; they had made the peasants
work on the roads so that the queen might pass, but
they only made them worse, so much so that her
majesty thought that she would drown. They took
her from her coach and carried her as best they
could."
Statute labor, or the "corvee" as it was called, had
been in use in some parts of the country for many
years and it was made general throughout France
in 1838. The peasants were forced to work from
6 to 50 days each year and were called out usually
in the spring and fall. Such labor has practically
always been inefficient and ineffectual wherever it
has been used, and results obtained in France were
no exception. Trugot, comptroler general of France,

OF ROAD CONSTRUCTION LEADING UP TO THE
MODERN SYSTEMS
realized that this system was unjust as well as
inefficient, and finally succeeded in having Louis
XVI issue an edict abolishing it in 1776. He was
supported by the king but was opposed by the
queen Marie Antionette, and was forced to resign
in 1777, narrowly escaping impisonment in the Bas-
tile. The corvee was abolished in the District of
Limoges in 1764, but the edict of 1776 was not gen-
erally effective until 1789, and even then the corvee
was retained in Brittany.
The Roman roads were built with slave labor and
with no regard for cost. For the most important
roads a trench was first dug deep enough to give a
firm foundation and then the trench was partly filled
with sand. On this sand bed the road was con-
structed in four layers or courses. The first course,
called the statumen, was composed of large flat
stones with the interstices filled with mortar or
clay, this course being 10 to 20 inches thick. The
second course was the rudus, a layer of rubble ma-
sonry about 8 inches thick. Xext came the nucleus
which was similar to concrete and about 8 inches
in thickness. The forth course, summa crusta, was
composed of hard stones bedded in lime mortar.
The completed road was about four feet thick and


January, 1929
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
this paved portion was usually 12 to 16 feet wide,
the total width of the road being 36 to 40 feet.
Under the corvee in France labor cost nothing
and where road construction was done the main
roads were usually built according to what was
called the Roman method, although they were not
as substantially built as those just described.
An excavation was made forming a flat subgrade
and on this was placed the foundation of the road,
which consisted of two or more layers of large flat
stones. This foundation was 18 feet wide and about
10 inches deep, and was covered with a layer of
small stones which were spread and then beaten
down and broken with hammers. This surface was
finished with a thin layer of stones smaller than the
underlying material and consolidated by traffic.
The total thickness of the road was usually 18 to 20
inches at the center and about 12 inches at the sides.
While these roads when completed contained more
or less broken stone, it was not an essential feature
of their construction.
The large amount of material used made these
roads very expensive to build, and owing to the
lack of proper maintenance they were soon cut by
deep ruts.
When repairs were made at intervals large quan-
tities of stone were required.
Tresaguet's Methods
This was the situation when Tresaguet became
C hief Engineer of the District of Limoges in 1764.
As the corvee was abolished in that district the same
year a cheaper method of construction and main-
tenance became necessary and this necessity was
met by Tresaguet with the broken stone road.
The new method of construction was described
before the Assembly of Bridges and Roads by the
originator in 1775 as follows:
"That bottom of the foundation is to be made
parallel to the surface of the road. The first bed
on the foundation is to be placed on edge, and not
on the flat, in the form of a rough pavement, and
consolidated by beating with a large hammer, but
is is unnecessary that the stones should be even
one with another. The second bed is to be likewise
arranged by hand, layer by layer, and beaten and
broken coursely with a large hammer, so that the
stones may wedge together and no empty space may
remain. The last bed, three inches in thickness,
is to be broken to about the size of a walnut, with
a small hammer, on one side of a sort of anvil, and
thrown upon the road with a shovel to form the
curved surface. Great attention must be given to
choose the hardest stone for the last bed, even if
one is required to go to more distant quarries than
those which furnish stone for the body of the road;
the solidity of the road depending on this latter bed.
one cannot be too scrupulous as to the quality of
materials which are used for it."
It is of interest to note that at this time, when
Tresaguet had been building broken stone roads
for several years, Macadam was only 19 years old
and Telford was 18.
Tresaguet was also the first to propose a system
of continuous patrol maintenance and strenuously
opposed the old method of intermittent repairs. In
regards to this he wrote: "It does not cost much
to repair a road by day as need when the damage
first appears, and to stop, for instance, the forming
of pot holes and ruts in the beginning. This system,
carried on during all seasons, would keep all the
roads in the best of condition. The supervisor then,
ami the public as well, are interested in this system.
"The supervisor divides the road for w hich he is
responsible into several districts—from one town
to another unless that distance is too great for a
man to get to the end of it and home again that
same day. He should appoint someone to supervise
the district from such a place to such another place.
It would be cheap by the year or at the usual rate.
This man could himself look after the pot holes
which appear after a short time and stop their pro-
gress either getting rid of the water or lilting in the
holes and ruts. It should be easy to find a man for
this work. There is hardly any farmer who would
not welcome a regular and assured addition to his
income the year round without his leaving home
and above all he would enjoy doing the work at his
own time and in his own way."
The patrol system of maintenance became general
in France and has been used there ever since.
Last Years
On April 19, 1775, the same day that Paul Revere
took his famous ride and the first battles of the
American Revolution were fought at Lexington and
Concord, Tresaguet, then 59 years of age, was made
Inspector General of the Corps of Bridges and
Roads. His appointment was made by the follow-
ing decree:
"Louis . . . having had laid before us the decree
and letters patent of July 7th and August 17th.
1750. bearing on the appointment of a Chief En-
gineer, of 4 Inspectors General of 25 Highway En-
gineers and being informed that one of the 4 In-
spectors General's positions is unfilled, owing to
the resignation of Air. Querret—wishing to appoint
to this office someone able to fulfill its duties, by
decrees of our council of March 31, 1775, we hereby
appoint Mr. Pierre-Marie Jerome Tresaguet to serve
in the capacity of Inspector General of Bridges and
Roads."
The remuneration of this office consisted of 3,600
livres salary and 2,400 livres for traveling expenses,
a total of 6,000 livres (about $1,200).
After about two years he went to Paris and, in
spite of illness which developed at that time, he con-
tinued his work and introduced his methods of con-

Patents And Indentions
By Burtis L. Robertson, '21 E, '26 grad.
Asst. Professor of Electrical Engineering, Pennsylvania State College
STRANGE as it may sound t&lt;&gt; some student
engineers at this time, many of the graduates
of engineering schools will find themselves
very interested in patents and in patent law within
a short time after leaving college, and will he look-
ing upon this new field as the choice of their future
work. Patent law has the need of technically trained
men who have been grounded in and are conversant
to some extent with the elements of mathematics
and mechanics, and with the fundamental physical
laws. In this respect the engi-
neer usually finds himself well
fitted, and if he has a liking for
the study of law and its rela-
tion to patents and inventions,
he will find the work most at-
tracting.
It is the purpose-of the pres-
ent article to bring this field to
the attention of those student
engineers who may have an in-
clination toward patent law.
Such is done mostly by a gen-
eral discussion of patents and
their associated points of con-
cern in which all student engi-
neers will be interested.
Patent Departments in
Industry
The larger electrical manu-
facturing companies have small organizations with-
in themselves which comprise what is called the
patent department. The department may have a
personnel of as many as sixty or seventy persons,
including patent attorneys, clerks, stenographers,
and draftsmen. The first group may be twenty-five
to thirty in number and are mostly graduates of
engineering colleges. They have also taken up
studies in night law schools. Many have been pat-
ent examiners. All are lawyers in good standing,
having been admitted to the bar.
Of interest to the student is the fact that these
larger manufacturing organizations have a training
program whereby their young engineers may obtain
a practical experience in patent law. After spending
an initial year or so in testing apparatus or doing
general engineering work at the factory, the student
engineer, if he is interested in patents, is given the
opportunity of going to W ashington, D. C., where
he spends the next four years. During the day he
works in the law offices of the patent department
AT a time when all seniors are
seeking the position which
they are to hold after graduation
the discussion of a line of work
quite unheard of by most engi-
neering students is most oppor-
tune.
The possibility of patent law as
a field for men of engineering
training has been already thor-
oughly established. It remains
for those interested to fit them-
selves for this particular line of
work. Mr. Robertson has gone
into the subject quite extensively
in the accompanying article and
has brought out many points of
interest in regard to it.

which the company has in that city. By this means
he observes the procedure necessary in the various
cases which arise at the government offices. At
night he attends one of the law colleges of the large
universities at Washington, finally passing an ex-
amination and becoming admitted to the bar. At
the end of the training period he usually returns to
take up duties in the home office of the company.
Duties of the Department
It is the duty of the patent department
(a) To investigate the ad-
visability of taking out patents
by its employees,
(b) To determine whether
or not a thing may be patented,
(c) To protect its own
rights from the infringement
of others in regards to patent-
ed processes or articles,
(d) To prevent outside in-
terference from other patent
holders, and in general,
(e) To promote the com-
pany interests along lines of
research and investigation
when any question of legality
arises concerning inventions or
methods of manufacture of ar-
ticles.
The work of the individual
within the department is varied. The younger mem-
bers are usually assigned to the routine duties of
the office but as they obtain experience their posi-
tion may entail such work as discussing the details
of a new piece of apparatus with the originator,
helping him obtain a patent for his invention, de-
termining whether or not a supposed invention has
had a similar precedent, and doing court and legal
work. In fact, the individual is both an engineer
and patent lawyer, and his field bridges the gap be-
tween the engineer and the field of law required to
help the engineer, inventor, and investigator with
their new ideas.
If the invention is an entirely new and useful
piece of apparatus and meets with both company
and government approval, it is patented. The in-
ventor of course transfers his rights to the company
in consideration of a nominal sum of money. If the
invention is not new, but has been patented by some
other person, the patent department then

(a) Advises the originator t&lt;&gt; alter his invention
or design a new piece of apparatus, or if im-
practicable
(b) Tries to buy the existing patent, or if not
successful in obtaining a price they are will-
ing Vo pay will, after consulting the engineer.
(c) Try to obtain a license under the outside pat-
ent, or
(d) Try to tight the patent, if it seems worth
while.
It should be remarked here that any engineer or
inventor should consult the patent department of his
company, if he is so situated, whenever he devises
some new apparatus or radically changes an old
piece of apparatus. This prevents outside interfer-
ence with his product. It requires about two months
to thoroughly check up on a patent and for this
reason the patent department should be advised
when the conception is in its early stages. Other-
wise, it may be necessary to take a chance on out-
side patents, which may involve expensive law suits
and the payment of large damages.
Patent History
The granting of patents to individuals or guilds
was of very early origin and reached its greatest
abuse under the reigns of Elizabeth and James.
Two kinds of patents, legal and illegal, were granted
in order to help fill the royal exchequer. Legal pat-
ents included rights to manufacture or sell luxuries,
the second to manufacture or sell commodities
which were necessary to life. This monopoly was
finally abolished by a statute against monopolies.
In the United States the law of patents rests upon
statuary provision, the statement in the Constitu-
tion regarding patents reading: "The Congress
shall have power * * * to promote the progress
of science and the useful arts, by securing for lim-
ited times to authors and inventors the exclusive
right to their respective writings and discoveries."
It is by virtue of this clause that Congress has
granted patents and has formed agreements with
foreign countries regarding them.
The first patent laws of the United States were
enacted in 1790 and three patents were granted in
that year, all signed by W ashington. For quite a
time common prejudice was antagonistic to patents
but by helpful laws and clearer thinking the atti-
tude changed and the inventor was more willing to
disclose his work-. The present laws of the United
States are those of 1870 when the preceding acts,
numbering over twenty, were revised and the time
limit of a patent lengthened from fourteen years to
seventeen years. Theoretically a patent can be ex-
tended but this is not often done in practice. The
patent law as revised is issued to those interested.
United States patents include tide waters and
ships but not foreign vessels in United States ports
unless those on board trv to manufacture and sell
patented article- in those ports in defiance of the
United States patent laws. These laws cover the
island possesssions of this country, and also Cuba,
if certain formalities are made.
What Is a Patent?
The term "patent," or "letters patent," is derived
from a Latin word signifying that which is open or
disclosed. Primarily, the patent is to make known
the new invention and its use and advantages; sec-
ondly, it confers upon the patentee for a limited
time the exclusive manufacture, use, and sale of the
patented article. In other words, the government
allows the inventor a monopoly of his invention, but
it is a beneficial monopoly and in distinct contrast
to the illegal type just mentioned which formerly
was given for necessities of life.
The patent itself is a document given by the Pat-
ent Office at Washington, D. C, and consists of a
grant, a drawing, a description or specification, and
a set of itemized claims. An exclusive right only is
granted. Hence, the reward to the inventor is auto-
matically proportioned to the value of his invention.
The keynote of the entire principle is that the dis-
closure must be honest, absolute, and unreserved.
Failure to live up to the contract of complete dis-
closures means forfeiture of the patent.
The patent merely conveys the right to exclude
people other than the patentee from using an inven-
tion. It does not necessarily give the inventor the
right to use his invention, because he cannot do so
if its use would be unlawful, or if in using it he
would infringe on some previous patent.
Who May Obtain a Patent
The applicant for a patent must declare upon
oath
(a) That he believes himself to be the true and
original inventor and discoverer of the thing
for which he solicits a patent,
(b) That he does not know and does not believe
that the same was ever before known or used.
(c) That the invention has not been in public use
or on sale in the United States for more than
two years before application was filed, and
(d) That the invention has not been described in
any printed publication for longer than two
years prior to filing the application.
Anyone who can subscribe to the above conditions
may obtain a patent. This holds irrespective of race,
color, nationality, or age—minors, women, and even
convicts being capable of obtaining patents. The
patent is forfeited if the time of lapse between the
application and the completion of the invention is
greater than a year. The rights of the invention arc
not lost by death since the executor or administrator
of the estate of the deceased may file application,
the patent becoming subject to the estate. If a for-
eign patent has been filed twelve months before the
application of a L'nited States citizen for a patent,

TALKS FROM THE DEAN
Playing the Game
An interest in sport of various kinds has been in-
herent in the human race almost from time im-
memorial. In these latter days practically every
nation has its distinctively national game or games;
and the same thing is evident even in some of the
less civilized peoples.
To such a degree has this idea of sport entered
into the life of mankind in general, that even in
language itself we find terms, primarily related to
sports or games, gradually receiving recognition
in other fields. Such expressions as "the game of
life," "the war game," "a good sport," "with cards
on the table," act as illustrations. Wherein lies the
reason, why when we wish to convey a certain at-
titude of mind or a method of conduct, we feel
hound to adopt the language of the game or sport?
We need not seek far for' the answer.
Through the ages there has gradually arisen a
certain recognized code and attitude of mind to-
ward games, which in time have amounted to tra-
dition, and become an actual part of the indiv idual
who engages in any sport. The same feeling is
oftentimes displayed, unfortunately not always,
even by audiences or non-participants in the actual
contest.
What, then, are some of these fundamentals?
First and foremost, to play the game squarely and
live up to the spirit as well as the letter of the rules;
and, in this connection, no matter how outstanding
a particular participant may be, he cannot consider
himself personally as one to whom the rules do
not apply. In other words, if he should transgress
the rules he is expected to take his medicine like
"a good sport."
Second; the game is played by all fair means to
win if possible, but if defeated, to take defeat in
the proper spirit. The desire to win will, in all cases,
lead a contestant to put up the best that is in him,
and this in itself must have a beneficial effect and
leave a certain feeling of satisfaction in those who
play the game.
Third; the training and its accompanying disci-
pline and self-denial, the desire to improve and be-
come a more effective unit in the game, all tend
to bring out those things which are oftentimes
called "the finer qualities" in men. In many sports
co-operation with one's teammates, even to the ex-
tent of a certain amount of self effacement is an im-
portant factor in success.
If the great game of life be played according
to the same rules, while sometimes there may be
defeats, on the whole the successes will predomi-
nate. Even in defeat there is always a certain gain
if a good fight has been made, and the desire to win
in the future stimulated.
You, as students, are all taking part in the big
game of preparation for your life's work. While
you are here for this short span of four years, try
to "play the game" of getting all there is out of
your education and develop the spirit that the whole
world admires in a "good sport."' Follow the gen-
eral rules and spirit of the game and I have no fear
for vour success.
THE RETIRING STAFF
With this issue of the Technic another staff
finishes its work and turns over its duties to those
who follow. The successful completion of the past
year's work has meant much to the Technic. Under
the regime of the present staff the Technic has been
changed from a quarterly to a monthly and it has
been proven definitely that such a change could be
handled successfully.
The problem confronted by college publications
is a difficult one and one which requires much will
power and determination to make a magazine suc-
cessful. It is almost impossible in a year's time
for an editor to build up a definite program and
at the same time put his ideas into effect. No sooner
are his plans well under way than he finds that he
must move on to make room for those who follow.
Thus it is difficult in the short time alloted to each
one at the helm to build a sturdy structure which
will fend off all impending dangers. It becomes a
question of sacrificing, in many cases, one's own
ideas for the promotion of those already in the field.
The whole is a test of judgment which should bring
out one's best.
The retiring staff withdraws with the one hope
that it has done its duty well and has in so doing
added a stepping stone to the pathway of those who
follow. It wishes the greatest success to all whose
privilege it may be in the future to further improv e
the Michigan Technic over what it has ever been in
the past and to arrive finally at that goal which has
been the ideal of everv staff. .-"

given the distinction of membership:
1). W. Richardson Albert G. Nygord
James Smith Joseph T. Elliott
R. B. Herbert George Beard
Robert McCoy Isadore Grodski
Dwight Lewis Harry Coll
After having thoroughly satisfied those active in
the initiation that the Engineering Arch was suf-
ficiently well cleaned to last until it might be
scrubbed again next Spring, the neophites were
guests at a banquet held at the Union. George Hol-
brook, '30E, welcomed the newly initiated men to
the organization and Robert McCoy responded for
the vi'itiates.
A. S. M. E.
On December 12 the Student Branch of the A. S.
M. E. held its annual banquet at Joe Parker's, pro-
viding a very fitting conclusion for the year. The
banquet was attended by about sixty-five students
and Faculty members and was a decided success due
to a great extent to the efforts of the committee in
charge of which R. L. Johnson was chairman.
The speakers of the evening included W. W right
as toastmaster, S. Chancy, vice-president of the
Student Branch; Prof. H. C. Anderson, Prof. R. S.
Hawley, Dean J. W. Patterson, and Mr. J. T. Shea-
for, the assistant to the president of the Bell Tele-
phone Company, who was the principal speaker. In
addition to these men, Mr. Alexander Dow, who
has been president of the National A. S. M. E. for
the past year, gave a short talk, and Prof. Keeler
gave an interesting account of the national conven-
tion at which Prof. Mickle seemed to have evi-
denced a most overwhelming and all powering taste
for melodrama. But all in all the banquet was thor-
oughly enjoyed by those present and proved in-
structive as well as entertaining.
A. 1. Ch. E.
The December meeting of the Student Branch of
the A. I. Ch. E. was addressed by Dr. W. H. Morse,
who has been working with Prof. Badger of the
Ch. E. Department on the crystallization of a spe-
cial type of salt obtained from certain mines in
California. His talk dealt with the engineering
problems and difficulties encountered in this work.
On December 29, a dinner-dance was held by
those of the organization who were in Ann Arbor
or vicinity during the holidays.
Chemical Engineering Department
An educational development, which, although not
comparatively new in itself, is yet still untried on
the Michigan Campus, has been inaugurated recent-
ly in the Ch. E. Department. It consists of a joint
program with the Detroit City Gas Co. Under this
arrangement a student will attend the University
for the first year, work with the gas company (lur-
ing the Summer, attend school the next year, and
then drop out of school for a semester and work

seven months with the company. At the end of that
time he will return to the University for the second
semester. Summer school, and the first semester of
the next year. The beginning of the second semes-
ter of that year will be marked by his return to the
gas company for another seven months period and
then the entire fifth year will he spent in school. It
is believed by Prof. A. II. White of the Ch. E. De-
partment and by those actively connected with the
project that it will prove successful in its operation.
Variations of the plan
have been tried at other
schools with varying
degrees of success, but
it is believed that this
plan will ]&gt; r o v e the
most efficient of all and
that students interested
in gas engineering will
take advantage of it
since it offers such a
great deal of practical
work interspersed with
t h e regular technical
training.
The close of the year
1928 was marked b\
t h e publication of a
new book on "Inorgan-
ic Chemical Technolo-
gy" by Prof. \V. L.
Badger and Prof. E. M.
Baker of the Ch. E. De-
partment. The book
has attracted consider-
able attention due to
the fact that it contains
much new material and
is also very well writ-
ten.
At the national con-
vention of the A. I. Ch.
K.. held in December.
Michigan was particu-
larly honored in t h c
fact that Prof. A. H.
W hite was chosen as national president and Prof.
Badger as director. We should feel particularly
honored in having these men chosen to fill such
important positions.

During the week of December 3, 1928. the Na-
tional A. S. M. E. Convention was held in New-
York City. Profs. Fesscnden, Mickle, and Keeler
represented Michigan at this convention and Profs.
Fessenden and Keeler also attended the convention
of the American Society of Refrigerating Engineers.
The close of the year also marked the presenta-
tion of several gifts to the M. E. Department.
Through the kindness of a former Michigan man,
Mr. F. A. DeWaters, chief engineer of the Buick
Motor Co., the department was presented with a
complete Buick chassis and also a new Buick motor.
This is a rotating gift; that is. each time a new
model comes out, the one in possession of the Uni-
versity will be replaced by this new model.
In addition to this, Mr. P. R. Greenman, the Chi-
cago representative of

The one referred to is none other
than Richard Spindle.
Members of the senior class will
recall quite clearly the figure of a stocky individual with
dark hair who seemed to carry about with him an air of
sunshine back in the Fall of 1925, when all were trying to
find their place in the University. Always ready to lend a
hand and do his best to help anyone who found circum-
stances trying, it was no wonder that he should come to
be admired by all who knew him.
Since the time above mentioned, "Dick" has made for
himself in the University a place well worth striving for.
His ability as a swimmer has not only given him the dis-
tinction of becoming captain of the swimming team, but
has brought honor to himself and to his alma mater
through the records made by him. He counts among his
"coups" the breaking of a world's record in the 400 meter
and 500 yard backstroke, also the establishment of a new
collegiate record in the 220 yard backstroke.
"Dick" did not begin, however, with swimming, and that
alone does not serve to distinguish him. His first triumph
was election to the Engineering Honor Committee. Eater
he was elected as student member of the Board in Control
of Athletics and is also ex-officio member of the Student
Council. Last Spring he was given the further distinction
of election to Michigaumua. He is also a member of Theta
Chi Fraternity.
It would be hard to predict what new records will be
broken this season, but we do know that whenever "Dick"
starts after something he has the habit of achieving that
something and it is safe to say that whatever happens in
his particular sport he is sure to have a hand in it.

Echoes from the Graduates
Johnny Ga reels, 07, E
Turning Back the Pages
IF" we wore to awake some day and find our-
selves upon the campus of 1904, we should
rub our eyes with wonderment and immedi-
ately speculate upon the probability of our where-
abouts. So great is the difference between campus
life twenty-five years ago and what it is today, that
we should truly believe our-
selves transported to some re-
mote section of our country
where the mode of living is en-
tirely different. Yet, upon ex-
amination, the unbelievable
differences are almost superfi-
cial. Dress, perhaps, is the
greatest offender. No longer
do we see college men wearing
great umbrella-like tweed caps,
high stiff collars with their
rather indifferent-looking black
neckties, "sack suits" with their
trousers which taper sharply to
the cuff to meet a pair of large
bulgy angular brogans, in
short, their mode of dress
seems as queer to us as ours
probably would have seemed
to them. Slowly, but surely,
fashion has changed to the
"freedom of dress" we know
today. Conventions, too, have altered greatly;
it is no longer an outrage to stand talking to one
of the feminine contingent of our University with-
out removing one's hat. By far the greater part
of the cumbersome, yet romantic, old formalities
have gradually faded out of existence to allow
the personal freedom which is so casually accepted
today.
There are few undergraduates who have not
heard some alumnus refer to "the days of Billy
Heston" with a lump in his throat and a distant
look in his eyes. Actual facts, however, are usu-
ally omitted in the tales of "the good old days" that
are usually heard during the fireside gatherings fol-

lowing football games. The following is an account
of the football seasons during the time when
"Johnny" Garrels was a student engineer.
In 1904 the University of .Michigan was the larg-
est university in the United States. Her football
team as well as other athletic teams were feared
from the Atlantic to the Paci-
fic. To beat a Michigan team
was everywhere considered
just cause to break all rules of
personal conduct and was the
signal for unrestrained cele-
bration in any college.
Intra-mural athletics were
very highly organized among
the classes in the various col-
leges on the campus. The foot-
ball games, especially, were
very bitterly contested. The
Engineers and Eawvers usually
fought it out for the champion-
ship. The games were very
well attended by the student
body, and rivalry was keen.
It was the custom then for
all of the feminine contingent
who attended the football
games to carry pennants
mounted on small canes and
to wave them vigorously whenever the team per-
formed in a manner which demanded applause. The
singing of songs was much more prevalent then
than it is now. Our present system of organized
cheers has displaced this to a large extent.
Back in 1906, one of the most popular and one
of the best known men on the Campus was Tohn
C. Garrels, everywhere known as "Johnny." In the
present vernacular of the Campus he would be
called a "B. M. O. C." He made every possible hon-
orary society and was a good student in addition
to his prowess as a football player, and track man.
Garrels entered the University in the fall of 1903,
and decided upon Mechanical Engineering as his

course of study. He went out for football and made
the All-Fresh football team. The following Fall he
went out for the Varsity and was made a member
of the squad.
On Oct. 1, 1904, Case School of Applied Science
sent their football team to Ann Arbor to play Mich-
igan and were beaten 33-0. The following Satur-
day the team beat the W estern State Teachers' Col-
lege 95-0. On October 15 the team went to Colum-
bus to play Ohio State . . . (iarrcls played end in
both games.
At this time Johnny Carrels
and "Bullhead" Weeks were
staging what was called "The
Fight for an End." During the
game with West Virginia on
()ctober 22nd, Weeks dis-
placed Carrels during the first
half, but Johnny went in at the
half and played a brilliant
game. The score was Michi-
gan 130. West Virginia 0.
The team went to Madison
on October 29th to face the
Wisconsin team, their hard-
est opponents. They won the
game 28-0. Coach Yost be-
came very excited during the
game and offered advice from
the sidelines, for which the
team was penalized 20 yards.
Upon their return to Ann Ar-
bor on the following Sunday
night, they were met at the
station by 8,000 supporters—a
mad, shouting, exultant crowd
that put the team into a bus, stolen from somewhere,
and hundreds of willing hands hauled them up State
Street. The bus was finally wrecked, and the team
was spirited away and no trace could be found of
them. A very pretentious fireworks display was set
off. Rockets were sent up on State Street, and red
fires burned everywhere. The celebration lasted
well into the wee hours of the morning—Joe Park-
ers being the scene of the latter part of the cele-
bration.
On November 5th the Drake (Iowa) team went
back beaten 36-4. The Michigan Daily -ommcnted
on Carrel's game . . . "Carrels at end was a
frost. He started out by making two fine tackles,
but couldn't stand prosperity, and time after time
allowed himself to be boxed in while Main went
by for long gains . . ."
On November 12th the team met Chicago in the
game which was to decide the championship. They
turned back the Maroon warriors by a 22-12 score,
gaining the fourth consecutive championship for
Michigan. Walter Fckersall, now a famous sports
writer, played a star game for Chicago. The stu-

amazoo was beaten 44-0, and
were allowed only one first
down. The Daily declared Car-
rels "the greatest all-around
man now in athletics." On the
next Saturday. October 7th,
Case School of Applied Science-
was beaten 36-0, Carrels ran
forty yards for a touchdown
and played an all-around game.
On the following Wednesday.
October 11th, Ohio Northern
was beaten 23-0. Carrels ran
sixty-five yards for , a touch-
down through a broken field,
and his defensive work stood
out brilliantly. On Saturday,
October 14th, Carrels starred
in a hard fought game to beat
Vanderbilt U. 18-0. It was
during this period of his coach-
ing career that Coach Yost had
the moniker "Hurry-Up" at-
tached to him permanently.
The game with the Nebraska "Cornhuskers" on
Saturday. October 22, marked the first big game
of the season. They were beaten 31-0. The Daily
sports writer said that "Carrels work merely served
to strengthen the impression that he is the find of
the year ..." On the next Wednesday Carrels
continued his brilliant performance and Michigan
beat Albion 70-0. On Saturday October 28th, Drake
came to Ann Arbor and was beaten 48-0. "The
Great Billy Heston" had graduated the previous
June and was engaged in coaching the Drake foot-
ball team. Carrels returned a punt for a touchdown
and made another run of fifty yards for another.
The team went to Illinois on November 4th and
beat them 33-0. The Illini were not able to gain
a single first down against Michigan's brilliant team
play, which wras backed up by Carrels plunging
and punting. The following Saturday Ohio State
was beaten 40-0. Carrels made two forty yard runs
for touchdown and Barlow ran a hundred and fif-
teen for another. On Saturday, November 18th,
Wisconsin was beaten 12-0, Garrels' punts averaged
well ox er 50 yards each. On the following Saturday

Oberlin was beaten 75-0, Garrcls' kicking and run-
ning stood out brilliantly. On Monday, December
4th Michigan lost the Championship to Chicago in
one of the hardest fought games ever played in the
Big Ten. The score was Chicago 2, Michigan 0.
In the fall of 1900 Carrels changed from his left
"JOHNNY" GARRELS IN TRACK UNIFORM
end position to that of fullback. In the first game
Case was beaten 28-0. To quote the Daily again:
". . . a contest in which Johnny Carrels was easily
the hero . . ." On Saturday, October 21st, Michigan
beat Ohio State 6-0. After numerous attempts,
Carrels finally kicked a field goal late in the game
(which then counted four points) and followed it
soon after with a safety to bring the score to 6-0.
On the following Saturday Illinois was beaten 28-9.
It rained and blew a veritable gale, but Illinois was
allowed only two first downs. Carrels got off sev-
eral seventy and eighty yard punts. Vanderbilt was
beaten 10-4 on Saturday, November 3rd, in a thril-
ling game. Carrels ran fifty-five yards for a touch-
down the last quarter to win the game. The team
went to Pennsylvania for the game on Saturday,
November 17, but was severely handicapped by the
loss of Captain Curtis who had broken his leg in a
scrimmage a week before the game. Michigan lost
17-0 in a bitterly fought game.
Garrels, in addition to being a stellar football
player was a great track man. He was presented
writh a medal by the Pittsburg Alumni at a ban-
quet in the old Michigan Union on Friday, Novem-
ber 7, 1905, for his unusual ability.
At the present time Mr. Garrels is the manager
of the Oxford Sand and Gravel Co.. of Oxford.

many years he has managed to drop in on Prof.
"Harry" Anderson of the Mechanical Engineering
Dept.. at least annually, to talk over things as they

present state of things. We can forgive him, how-
ever, for in after years, we too, will look back upon
our Michigan of today with the same tender feeling
of the oldest grad.

Modern Engineering Gives Electricity
to the plains of West Texas
WITH the discovery of oil, West Texas
needed electric power. And now, in the
heart of the mesquite plains around Del Rio—
the first hydro-electric dam has been completed.
It is 900 feet long, and 45 feet wide, and will
harness the waters of Devil's River.
In building the dam, modern engineering over-
came one after another of nature's obstacles.
Sullivan Diamond Drills took 2 -in. cores 50 feet
deep in the bedrock to determine its safety for the
dam; and to reveal seams, which later were filled
with cement to prevent seepage, underneath.
No sand for concrete was available—so lime-
stone blocks were chiselled from the river bank,
to form the dam. Line drilling with Sullivan
Rock Drills and quarry bars, removed the
blocks from the quarry. Eight of these rigs
drilled 28 miles of hole in one month.
When the limestone blocks were in position,
the Diamond Drills bored holes through which
cement grout was pumped, to fill up cavities
and crevices.

neering have helped in the realization of

terprises, both public and commercial.

Thirty miles of this system is to be completely

Such a momentous task has demanded a man of
genius and ability and so Michigan was greatly hon-
ored in having Mr. Mottier speak to this gathering
which was held under the auspices of the Trans-

PATENTS AND INVENTIONS
(Continued from page 14)
it may be refused to the citizen. If several persons
work conjointly on an invention they should apply
jointly, if merely partners the sole originator ap-
plies. Each man in a joint patent is not accountable
to any other person for what he does with his own
rights.
What May Be Patented
Any new and useful art, machine, manufacture
or composition of matter, or any new and useful im-
provements upon an old or already patented article
may be patented. The patent for improvement does
not affect the earlier patent. A patent may be
granted for the new combination of old appliances,
upon new designs, and upon new compounds for
useful purposes.
The thing to be patented must be new and useful,
the former being the more important. For the in-
vention to be new it must conform to the discussion
given under the caption of "Who May Obtain a
Patent," "Useful" means "not harmful or contrary
to public morals or policy". The degree of useful-
ness does not matter so long as the article is not
absolutely useless. The burden of proof to show
that a thing is not new rests upon the Patent Office
and their work is to search through old records of
patents and any literature bearing upon the sub-
ject. If any old records are found which tend to
disprove the patentee's claims he is informed and
allowed to narrow or restrict his claims, if possible
to still have the thing patentable.
An art is defined as a process, a machine usually
as something which has moving parts, a manufac-
ture as something which has no moving parts, and
a composition of matter to include such things as
patent medicines, hair restorers, etc.
Nature of An Invention
Generally the thing to be patented is an inven-
tion, and since an invention cannot be straightfor-
wardly defined it is described by telling what it is
not. There are sixteen or twenty tests used by the
courts in determining whether or not a thing is an
invention and many of those rules are given here.
Any article or conception falling under the follow-
ing classes is not considered to be an invention:
1. Anything requiring only mechanical skill.
2. Mere excellence of workmanship.
3. Substitution of materials.
4. Mere changes in degree (smaller, heavier,
etc.).
5. Aggregation of juxtaposition of various de-
vices.
(&gt;. Mere duplication or doubling up of ideas.
7. Mere omission of parts.
8. Substitution of an equivalent (spring for a
weight).
9. Mere double use of an article.

AT Ocean City, New Jersey, a new board-
l walk — one of the finest of its kind in the
world — was recently completed. The entire
structure is of concrete with the exception of
the decking and rails which saved the name,
rdwalk, from becoming concrete walk.
Supporting this sea shore promenade are 780
concrete piles, each 18 inches square, 32 feet in
length and sunk 24 feet in the sandy beach.
Each pile, which weighed more than six tons,
was lifted and located with a Koehring Heavy
Duty Crane.
Another feature of this construction was the
speed and adaptability of the Koehring Crane
in setting the piling. The last pile was sunk
four days ahead of the specified schedule. The
entire contract was completed and accepted one
day before the time limit.
Again a Koehring product is identified with the
successful completion of an unusual project!

10. Merc change of form only.
11. Discovery of a new property of matter.
12. Application of a known device to a new ap-
paratus.
The application of an existing device to new pur-
poses, if it produces new and unexpected results, or
if it produces a result that had formerly been tried
to/produce and failed, may involve an invention and
thus patent rights. The question to he asked is
whether or not the thing produced has a benefit for
the human race.
Tests of Inventions
Tn the eyes of the court, a satisfactory demon-
stration of an invention is a demonstration of the
device under the conditions which are to be met in
practice. Shop tests should, therefore, be made as
nearly as possible under those circumstances. The
tests should be carried on so as not to expose the
inventor to having credit stolen. In case of a law
suit, the inventor must be able to prove that he
tried out his invention as it is actually to lie used.
As an example of the failure to observe this, the
inventor of a rubber vacuum cup which was to be
attached to the windshield of an automobile, lost
in a law suit because he had tried the device on
the window pane in his office rather than on his car.
TRESAGUET
(Continued from page 12)
struction and maintenance in that district. In 1785,
still handicapped by illness, he was so successful in
his labors that he was granted a retiring pension of
3,000 livres (about $600). It was only four years
later that France was plunged into the Revolution
and during this trouble period Tresaguet's pension
was reduced. His entire fortune consisted of a house
worth about $8,500.
At the age of 80 years he became so ill that he
could eat only soup, but had no funds with which
to buy even that, and the Assembly of Bridges and
Roads petitioned the Minister of the Interior for
food in his behalf. In answer to this petition the
Commune of Paris granted to this famous engineer
a dole of three pounds of meat daily. Only eleven
days after being granted this munificient reward by
a grateful public, Tresaguet died. Childless and pov-
erty stricken, he passed awaj in his house, whicli
is now 73 Rue d'Anjou, I'aris, on the 21 Ventose in
the year IV of the Republic (March 11, 17%).
Results of His Work
During the Revolution and the first republic there
was little activity in road construction and, although
many roads were built under Xapolcon, the methods
of Tresaguet were more or less forgotten, as was
their originator. Between 1815 and 1825 Macadam
developed his system in England which differed
from Tresaguet's mainly in the omission of the
large stones from the foundation, even on the worst
soils. Telford used large stones at the bottom but
laid them horizontally instead of parallel to the
surface of the pavement. Wide publicity was given
to Macadam's work, both in Europe and America,
and his name was given to noun, adjective and verb
used in connection with broken stone roads of all
types, even in France. W here large stones are used
for the foundation, much as Tresaguet used them,
it is called a Telford foundation.
Thus it is seen that Tresaguet has never re-
ceived proper credit anywhere for his work and his
development of the broken-stone road apparently
was unknown outside of France, as Macadam found
the same conditions in England that Tresaguet had
overcome 35 or 40 years earlier.
The patrol system of maintenance was possibly
a more important contribution to the science of
highway engineering, at least so far as lasting re-
sults are concerned, then the first broken-stone road,
but it was many years before that was adopted in
England, and nearly 150 years after Tresaguet's
time the ancient, inefficient, intermittent corvee
system of statute labor was still in general use
throughout the United States. It is still used in
some states, particularly in connection with town-
ship roads.
The automobile is fast pushing the plain broken-
stone road into the pages of history along with
the stage-coach and the carriage which it served so
well, but fortunately, the system of patrol main-
tenance Inaugurated by Tresaguet in Limoges in
1764 has finally been almost universally adopted and
every well-maintained road throughout the world is
really a monument to this great, but little-appreci-
ated engineer.

A NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION
We had heard so main New Year's greetings

INSTINCT in the beaver taught it to back up the streams with brush and mud dams, to store the water
in still ponds in which to live and preserve its food. Reason and experience of man has taught him
to dam the streams for the storage of water for power, for irrigation, and for other purposes.
In the present day the use of water for hydro-electric development has directed the interest of industry
toward harnessing all available streams where power can be distributed to industrial centers. The desire
of the farmer to reclaim the arid waste spaces and make them fertile has brought about the storage of
water and its directed distribution to these spaces. Flood control by the storage of the waters, to prevent
destruction of life and property, is receiving constantly increasing attention. These purposes are being ac-
complished by the construction of stable dams securely founded.
The Foundation Company, in the building of these various types of dams, has been serving the public
over a period of years.

everyone stops just for a moment to consider what
the past year has meant. It just happened that we
were again seated in that old swivel chair looking
out across the red tiled roofs on the other side of
East I ., only this time it was night and the moon
was lending a feeble hand to light the picture. As
on such an occasion before our thoughts turned
back to the day not far removed when we were en-
tering upon a new and untried field and the future
lured us with its ever beckoning hand toward the
goal now fast approaching. There did not seem to
occur to us the many rewards and happinesses that
had come to us in the years spent thus far so freely,
but we thought of the times when we had been
tried and, although not failing, had not given to
the occasion all that might have been given. These
ghosts of the past, although perhaps not teeming
in majority, rose darkly over much that might have
been. We found ourselves confronted with the
problem ; when shall we put our utmost to the task
before us? Is there a time when we can put aside
some passing trifle? Our question was no sooner
formed than answered by the past which had con-
jured it. Never can we be satisfied until we have
done our best. Never can we know the real joy of
living until we feel the sense of duty done and to
the best of our ability.
This, then, is our one and only New Year's reso-
lution which we can pass to you: To always put
our best into the task before us, success or failure
then will hold the same reward.

BROADER ENGINEERING EDUCATION
(Continued from page 6)
work of the first two years be postponed to make
room in these years for history, English Literature,
a second foreign language, natural science, or other
broadening studies which it is well for a student to
take in the early years.
If the length of course is extended to five years
there should be time for slightly enlarged technical
curricula or the addition of courses in business ad-
ministration and the relation of employer to em-
ployee. To enlarge the technical curricula material-
ly would require a sixth year.
Half a century ago Michigan was the undoubted
leader of the state universities, now she is at most
primus inter pares. She now has the opportunity
to take the lead in engineering if she only will. I
hope that others may join in the venture, but I
would not fear to have her venture alone.
It is for the universities to recognize that our
country's well-being requires a group of engineers
broadly trained not only technically but humanly.
The University of Michigan has the facilities now
largely unused by its engineers. W ill it perform
this service for our country?

uated on scales so that large quantities of water
may be weighed. Their capacity is about 20 tons
each. The water is discharged from them through
large air operated gate valves in the bottom. The
scale beams are located on the mezzanine floor
above.
Passing around the tanks toward the north we
find some small pumps for research work, and the
air compressors.
The large one next to the east wall was built
many years ago to service air motored street cars.
The idea was to till large air cylinders to a pres-
sure of 3,000 lbs. per sq. in. place the cylinders on
the cars and use the air in air motors. The com-
pressor was presented to the University.
The small "wheezing" machine on the column
next to it is an 8-inch Westinghouse air brake com-
pressor used for air service in the laboratory.
The large cross compound, two stage air com-
pressor on the test block next to the window is
used for testing purposes. This equipment was
presented to the University in 1919.
Passing on we come to the refrigeration plant.
This plant was installed some fifteen years ago and
is of the compression type using ammonia as a re-
frigerant. It is a Creamery- Package Co. plant, hav-
ing a DeKalb compressor driven by a Murray Cor-
liss engine. Its capacity is 13 tons of refrigeration
per 24 hours.
Xo attempt has been made to point out all of
the equipment, for instance in addition to what has
been mentioned there are a number of fans, de-
vices for measuring power, and special apparatus.
The automotive laboratory has also been omitted.
This latter department covers considerable floor
space in the West Engineering building annex and
contains a great variety of equipment.
The mechanical engineering laboratory also con-
tains several small laboratories, devoted to research
work, such as the Heat Laboratory in the West
Engineering Building.
All of these laboratories are served from one in-
strument room, the instruments, tools, etc., being
"checked" out in the same manner as in tool rooms
of most industrial plants.
Two small machine shops, one in the West En-
gineering Building adjacent to the Main Laboratory
and one in the Automotive laboratory in the an-
nex, are provided for repair work, building of special
apparatus, etc.

GAS '"Industry
modernizes time-worn methods
It is surprising how the application of gas
in industry sometimes brings about com-
plete changes in time-worn methods. . • .
An example (which may have its counter-
part in your own plant) is found in var-
nish making. Varnish must be heated to
a definite pre-determined temperature,
and removed from the heat at the precise,
critical moment. Failure to observe these
requirements means that the entire kettle
of varnish is spoiled.
Since the industry's origin,varnish kettles
have always been mounted on wheels to
facilitate quick removal from the fire.
But gas today is changing aP that. Gas
can be turned off more quickly than it
would be possible to wheel the kettle
away!
Positive temperature control, made pos-
sible by gas, insures better varnish. Man-
power is conserved through the use of
gas. And the danger of fire—ever present
by the old method—is averted.
.... Now consider gas for your own
plant. Gas may or may not affect your
production in these precise ways. But
gas does hold very definite, very valuable
potential advantages for you. ... and
you should know what these advantages
are. Your local gas company will gladly
tell you about them. Write or telephone
them today.

National Concrete Convention to Be
Held in Detroit
During the week of February 12-16, 1929, the
American Concrete Institute and the American Con-
crete Pipe Associations will hold their National
Conventions at the Book Cadillac Hotel, Detroit.
These two conventions will bring together manu-
facturers, engineers and public officials interested
in Concrete and its many ramifications.
The American Concrete Pipe Association was or-
ganized for the purpose of promoting the use of
concrete ol various classifications and further for
the purpose of maintaining proper quality through
the formulation and use of adequate specifications.
This association today represents fully 85 per cent
of the productive capacity of the concrete pipe in-
dustry. During 1927 its member companies pro-
duced 2.500,000 tons of concrete pipe in the United
States and Canada.
One complete session of the Convention has been
arranged for non-members and guests. The Ameri-
can Concrete Pipe Association extends a most cor-
dial invitation to all engineers and public officials
in the Detroit District to attend this session. Stu-
dents are also extended the same invitation.
Further information pertaining to these interest-
ing conventions may be secured from Mr. Harvey
Whipple, 2970 W. Grand Blvd., Detroit, Secretary-
Treasurer of the American Concrete Institution;
R. A. Foley, 209 Transportation Bldg., Detroit,

o
Cadmium
In spite of the relatively high price of cadmium,
and the fact that the world production is only of
the order of 500,000 lb. per year, the metal is be-
ginning to find a number of important applications.
It has very recently been applied to the rust-proof-
ing of locks, hardware, automobile parts, and wire
products by a process which involves electroplat-
ing the cadmium thereon, and subsequently heat-
ing the plated articles for several hours, whereby
the cadmium coating is alloyed with the metal of
the plated article. A small proportion of cadmium
is often alloyed with silver to render the latter more
resistant to tarnishing agents.
An especially promising application of cadmium
appears to be in its addition to copper intended for
wire-drawing. These alloys have a higher tensile
strength and annealing temperature and greater re-
sistance to abrasion than hard-drawn copper, and,
since only a small portion of cadmium confers these
benefits, its addition to the copper does not seri-
ously reduce the electrical conductivity of the wire.
Cadmium is also finding limited use in jewelry,
since it gives green alloys with gold; and it is em-
ployed to some extent in fusible alloys. Its addi-
tion to almuniinum is advantageous where the alu-
minum is to be used in the manufacture of alu-
minum powder. The addition of cadmium in this
instance improves the color and luster of the pow-
der and makes it more resistant to atmospheric cor-
rosion when used in paints for lacquers.
One of the latest uses reported for metallic cad-
mium is in the manufacture of tungsten electric-
light filament. An alloy of 42 per cent cadmium.
53 per cent mercury, and 5 per cent bismuth is im-
pregnated with tungsten powder. The mixture is
made into wire by the extrusion process, and. after
passing through a die, is heated to drive off the
alloy and finished by heating in a vacuum to con-
solidate the tungsten.

Electrical Hardening and Annealing
Electric salt bath furnaces have been found to be
very useful for heating metals up to the exact tem-
perature required for hardening in the shortest pos-
sible time. They are largely employed for harden-
ing cutting tools. The tool to be hardened is placed
in the salt which is to carry the elcctic current.
W hen the salt melts it makes good thermal contact
with the metal, the required temperature being at-
tained very quickly. The salt bath also serves as
a heat accumulator. Air is not in contact with
the heated metal, and so it is not oxidized on
quenching. Owing to the excellent way they retain
their heat, salt bath furnaces are particularly suit-
able for hardening metals on a large scale. In Prog-
ress for December, a description is given of elec-
trical welding and hardening processes. The furnaces
for 800 deg. cent, are used for hardening carbon
steels, and those for 1300 deg. cent, for high alloy
steels. The salt used for temperatures from 750
deg. cent, to 1000 deg. cent, is composed of a mix-
ture of barium and potassium chlorides, and that
from 1000 deg. cent, to 1300 deg. cent, of barium
chloride only. Electric annealing furnaces are also
described. For these furnaces chrome nickel has
been found most useful for the conductor which
converts the electrical energy into heat. These fur-
naces are generally designed for tmperatures up to
950 deg. cent., and are specially useful for heating
processes which have to extend over long periods.
They are sometimes equipped with automatic tem-
perature regulators, and can be used for annealing
metals in hydrogen and other gases. The temper-
ing of hardened tools can also be effected in elec-
trical salt bath furnaces even when the temperature
required is so low as 220 deg. cent. In this case the
conducting salt is a mixture of sodium an&lt;l
potassium nitrates.

up production generally throughout the plant.
The plant view shown above is a unit of one of the largest
American corporations, where the use of Rex Sand Han-
dling Equipment, coupled with a change in the character of
the work, resulted in an increase of 300% in production.
Many similar industrial problems of handling have yielded
to Chain Belt engineering skill plus Rex equipment.
Whether you are a Student, a Manufacturer or a Graduate
Engineer, it may be well to investigate the possibilities
that Rex Handling Equipment holds for you. We will

The Metropolitan City of the West
CHICAGO is a wonder city. It has grown like the proverbial mush-
room—prairie giving place to pavement and tall buildings rising on
every side.
The Otis organization has contributed in no small degree to this amazing
record of growth. In keeping with the fact that "most of the famous build-
ings of the world are Otis-equipped" Chicago's major commercial structures
reflect the trend toward safe and speedy Vertical Transportation with maxi-
mum safety.
State Street, Broadway, Picadilly — every famous street throughout the
world — is lined with buildings wherein Otis Elevators are giving daily ser-
vice in a safe, trouble-free manner — concrete examples of this company's
determination to build nothing but the best — and the best is none too good
to bear the world-famous Otis trade mark.

The Formation Of Boiler Scale
By Everett P. Partridge, Ph. D. '28
Associate Editor, Industrial and Engineering Chemistry
The Importance of Boiler Scale
IN the early days of the steam engine, when the
then tremendous pressures of three atmospheres
were being thought of by visionary engineers,
bo'ler scale was comparatively unimportant. Steam
engine operators observed that
large amounts of solid material
were precipitated in their boil-
ers by the evaporation of ordin-
ary water supplies, but they
were not greatly bothered by
this occurrence. After the
"incrustations" became two or
three inches thick, the boilers
were cooled and drained, and a
helper crawled inside the shell
with a hammer and chisel,
knocked the adherent scale
loose, and shoveled it out, to-
gether with the mud remaining
in the bottom of the shell after
draining. After such a clean-
ing, things then went merrily
for another couple of years.
But boiler pressures increased steadily, and engi-
neers began to think in terms of economy of oper-
ation. Obviously, a deposit of scale acted as a heat
insulator and therefore cut down heat transfer to
the boiler water. Due to lack of knowledge of actual
conditions in heat transfer, the effect of scale was
greatly exaggerated up until after the beginning of
the twentieth century, it being comomn opinion that
a layer of scale 1/16 inch in thickness would reduce
heat utilization 15 per cent.
THIS article presents a new
theory of scale formation
worked out by the writer in the
course of research conducted in
the Department of Chemical En-
gineering from 1925 to 1928 while
a candidate for the doctor's de-
gree. Data on the thermal effects
of scale are also included, and the
importance of scale prevention is
stressed from the standpoint of
maintaining safe boiler tube tem-
peratures.
—The Editor.
In spite of quantitative experimental evidence to
the contrary, it is frequently stated at the present
time in semi-technical circles that scale has a great
effect on boiler efficiency. The trained engineer has,
however, shifted his attention to another effect of
scale which has rapidly over-
shadowed any importance at-
tached to it from the stand-
point of heat utilization. The
new attitude is that scale must
be prevented because its insul-
ating effect causes overheating
of the boiler tubes and plates
upon which it forms, with sub-
sequent failure under load. Just
as in the case of the effect of
scale upon efficiency, the effect
of scale overheating of boiler
metal has been greatly exag-
gerated, not without the en-
couragement of the manufac-
turers of boiler feed-water soft-
ening equipment, one suspects.
As a consequence of propaganda, interested or
otherwise, against boiler scale, it is a poor plant
today that does not have some type of treatment
intended to prevent scale in its boilers. Scale still
does occur, however, due to inefficiently conducted
softening operations, or to the use of quack rem-
edies. Even in the advanced practice of the modern
central station, which returns 95 per cent of its
steam through condensers to the feed-watef line and
makes up the remaining 5 per cent of the feed with
distilled water from evaporators, scale is likely to

occur as the result of condenser leakage or priming
from the evaporators. A study of scale formation
is therefore timely, although most intelligently
operated plants are having good success in its pre-
vention.
Some work on calcium sulphate
scale will be described in the fol-
lowing sections. This work was
carried out during the period 1925-
1928 by the writer on a fellowship
established in the Department of
Chemical Engineering by the De-
troit Edison Company. Professor
Alfred H. White directed this re-
search, and the thanks of the writer
are due him for encouragement and
valuable suggestions.
The Method of Formation of Cal-
cium Sulphate Boiler Scale
When work on boiler scale was
commenced, it was necessary to
narrow down the field of operations
and not attempt to do everything
at once. Since calcium sulphate is
the most universal and most im-
portant constituent of the scales
formed on boiler heating surfaces.
:xperimental work was started with
solutions of this one substance.
One of the first questions to be
considered was: How do the crys-
tals of calcium sulphate happen to
become attached to the boiler tube
surfaces? There have been two
opinions on this point. The first
opinion, a hang-over from the early
days of the steam boiler, held that
the evaporation of water in the
boiler caused the concentration of
the dissolved substances up to the saturation values
in the less soluble ones, whereupon any further
evaporation precipitated solid material generally
throughout the body of the boiler solution. The
precipitated particles were supposed to be carried
against the heating surfaces and to accidentally
stick to them, gradually forming a hard, dense layer
of scale. This theory of scale formation has been
strongly supported by the manufacturers of boiler
compounds and colloidal scale prevention systems

AL BOILER AFTER RUN AT LOW
PRESSURE. (PART OF THE LAYER
OF SCALE IS BROKEN OFF TO
SHOW THE TUBE SURFACE

because it was a fine theoretical basis on which to
boom their business, but it has been rather definitely
discredited by the recent investigations of Hall.
About four years ago Hall proposed the idea that
scale forms on a surface because it is less soluble at
that point than at any other place
in the boiler. He described his ex-
perimental work in various jour-
nals, among them the Michigan
Technic.1 Quoting from his article
in the latter:
"The solubility of substances
which form adherent scales de-
crease with temperature increase;
vice versa, those substances
which separate from the boiler
water as a sludge increase in
solubility with temperature in-
crease."
This general criterion is based
upon the concept that at the sur-
face of contact between a solid and
a liquid, there is an absorbed film
of the liquid. If heat transfer is
taking place from the solid to the
liquid, this fluid film must actually
be somewhat hotter than the body
of the liquid. But if the liquid is a
solution which is saturated with
some substance whose solubility
decreases with temperature in-
crease, the fluid film will tend to be
supersaturated, and therefore will
tend to deposit some of its excess
material. On the other hand, if the
liquid is a saturated solution of a
substance whose solubility in-
creases with temperature increase,
the fluid film at the heated surface
will not be supersaturated, but will rather be under-
saturated, as a result of the increase in temperature.
Calcium sulphate, which is known to decrease in
solubility as the temperature is raised, and calcium
silicate and magnesium silicate, are the main con-
stituents of the scales formed on boiler heating sur-
faces. Calcium carbonate, which increases slightly
in solubility with increase in temperature, is also
found in these scales, but Hall believes that the cyrs-

The New Fisher Building
By L. Verne Ansel, '31E
THE new Fisher Building, recently completed
in Detroit, is often referred to as "a monu-
mental example of structural beauty." This
building, an instance of architectural and engineer-
ing achievement, ranks among the most ornate com-
mercial structures of the world.
The design, a departure from the rectangular
building of the past few decades, suggests Gothic
influence; however, it is purely American. In de-
signing the building the architect endeavored to
combine utility with beauty. The building is one
of the developments of the "American Vertical"
style of architecture. The
upper stories recede from the
facades, producing an effect of
unusual architectural beauty.
The exterior is, in itself, very
distinctive. A polished gray-
green granite is used for the
first three stories. This sup-
ports the vast expanse of black-
veined, delicately clouded
white marble that composes
the balance of the upper facade.
The tower leaps upward, at-
taining a height of twenty-eight
stories and a bronze finial. The
tapering lines and snowy white-
ness of the marble contribute
greatly toward achieving a type
of beauty rare in commercial
buildings.
The building contains a the-
atre, both modern and unique, an eleven story ramp
garage, a banking office, commercial shops, a radio
broadcasting station, and professional and commer-
cial offices.
The main portion of the building is L-shapcd and
rises eleven stories. The corner, which embraces
the main entrance, is surmounted by a tower. A
grand arcade, a central corridor, extends through
the main building. It is three stories high, faced
with imported and domestic marbles, and supports
an arched ceiling.
The grand arcade is one of the most unusual fea-
tures of the Fisher building. It is a collection of
rare marbles, bronzes, and misty, colored lunettes.
This corridor has three arched entrances and the
two sections meet at right angles in the tower sec-
tion of the building. The intersection, flanked on
the south and east by balconies and pillars, forms a
rotunda which has a richly colored frescoed ceiling.
The lunettes, in the arched ceiling of the grand
MUCH comment has been
heard lately upon the new
Fisher Building, located at the
corner of West Grand Boulevard
and Second Avenue, Detroit. The
author was fortunate enough to
have actually worked on the
building during its completion
last summer. He has written a
description of this architectural
masterpiece as he saw it during
the time he spent there. The

arcade, have delicate tones of misty color interming-
led with faintly darker tones of the major color.
These frescoed lunettes bear modern designs of
symbolic nature which were created by Professor
Maroti of Budapest, Hungary, and carried out by
the Spanish artists, Antonio and Tomas de Lorenzo
of New York City. The panels and columns of the
arcade are capped by inset octagonal bronze plaques.
The floor at the center of the rotunda is enhanced
by a great bronze shield in low relief, with a semi-
nude figure of Mercury, the God of Commerce. This
shield is surrounded by select pieces of choice
marble of different colors.
The building itself does not
contain a power plant. Elec-
tricity from the Detroit Edison
cables is the source of power.
The high voltage current enters
the building directly and is car-
ried to different parts of the
building where it is trans-
formed to lower voltages. In
the office building the electri-
cal distribution is carried on
below the floor level through a
system of steel ducts. Over
twenty-seven miles of rubber
insulated wire were used in
this new and very satisfactory
type of distribution.
The garage, office building,
and theatre are heated from a
central heating plant which
also furnishes heat for the General Motors Building.
It has been estimated that the Fisher building will
require a supply of 90,000,00 to 95,000.000 pounds of
steam per annum.
The telephone installation of the Fisher Building
is equal to that of a city. According to a report in
a recent issue of the Michigan Manufacturer and
Financial Record we learn that "the Fisher Biulding
installation of telephones has had to be made in ac-
cordance with the ever increasing density of tele-
phonic use, and this is more and more nearly reach-
ing the location of an instrument for every 36 square
feet of an office building. Therefore, in the instal-
lation as a whole, provision looks forward to a pos-
sible 14,000 telephones as the ultimate service
density that may be reached in the future, with as
many as 3500 to 4000 immediate installations."
The garage, which is primarily for the use of the
tenants is accessible from all floors of the office

What Shall I Read?
By J. Raleigh Nelson
Professor of English and Rhetoric
FOREWORD: When the Editor of the Tech-
nic asked me to use a page each month as a
means of suggesting books which I thought
would appeal to students and alumni interested in
extending their reading, I imagined myself bringing
out some of my old reading lists from various dis-
orderly recesses in my office desk where they had
been accumulating for years. Such lists seemed
well fitted to answer the question which was to head
my page, for they had been pre-
pared from time to time for my
own students and always with
a careful consideration of their
interests and their point of
view. But book lists that have
outlived the occasion that
called them are not especially
appealing, and demand some
considerable comment and in-
terpretation to restore them to
their original interest. It has
seemed to me better, therefore,
to chat very informally about
books, much as I have through
these many years when my
students have come to me in
my office and asked me this
question, "What Shall I Read?"
That these calls for help have
come more and more frequently
has been one of the gratifying
fruits of the effort the English Staff has made for
the past two decades to interest engineering stu-
dents in reading. The opportunity which this page
affords me to extend the influence of our courses
in literature is one which I greatly appreciate.
LEONARDO, THE FLORENTINE
One very satisfactory way to plan a course of
reading is to choose some figure in history, science,
literature or art around whom the life of a period
has centered or who has made some significant con-
tribution in a field that interests one, and then to
acquaint oneself thoroughly with this personality.
Such a plan is bound to vivify whole ranges of
thought that would probably otherwise remain out-
side ones vision. In my own experience Horace
was such a personality. As I followed him from his
college days in Greece, through his contact with the
court of Augustus as poet laureate, to the peace and
simple joy of his little farm at Tivoli, he became as
real to me as the friends of my own time. And
MOST engineers are men
who enjoy good reading,
but usually do not do as much as
they would like to. One of the
chief reasons for this, as has been
confided to the writer upon num-
erous occasions, is that most en-
gineers do not know of any book
or books which might provide in-
teresting reading of the right sort.
Professor J. Raleigh Nelson, who
for twenty-one years has directed
the work in English in the Col-
leges of Engineering and Archi-
tecture, has consented to write a
series of articles, answering this
question for the benefit of our
readers.
—The Editor.
through my close acquaintance with this pivotal
personality, I made a vital contact with one of the
brilliant and creative eras in human history. For
both engineers and architects there is no more sig-
nificant personality that Leonardo da Vinci. Be-
cause his greatest and most enduring contribution
was in the field of art, he is apt to be thought of
only as a painter; but even the most restrained
judgment based on sane and scholarly examination
of the evidence must regard
him also as the forerunner of
the mechanical age in which
we live. There is hardly a mod-
ern science of which he did not
consider the first steps, mathe-
matics, astronomy, geology, an-
atomy, mechanics, hydrostat-
ics, aeronautics, optics, physics.
The hundreds of pages of the
notebooks he has left give first-
hand evidence of the universal
character of his mind. At the
courts of Lorenzo the Magnifi-
cent at Florence, of Ludivico
Sforza at Milan, of Pope Alex-
ander VI in Rome, and at last
of Francis, King of France, it
was rather as chief engineer
and architect than as painter
that he won his recognized
place. Clearly here is a person-
ality whom every engineer and every architect
might well know, if he would regard his own pro-
fessional work with a sense of perspective, a feeling
for its past, a humbling realization that other men
have worked and wrought before him. Moreover,
Leonardo's life touched almost every phase of the
life of the Italian Renaissance, of which, indeed, he
has become almost the perfect symbol. To know
him is to know the life of that brilliant epoch in a
new and intimate way.
Different types of mind will go about a study of
Leonardo da Vinci by various methods of approach.
Surely for one who has access to facsimiles of the
original manuscripts, the notebooks with their ex-
quisite pencil sketches are the most vivid of all
records. Those who would begin their study of
Leonardo by seeing these evidences of his genius,
will find it useful to examine two volumes of Dr.
J. P. Richter, or the much more limited selection
contained in Edward McCurdy's "Leonardo da Vin-


Page 9
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
ci's Notebooks," or his other book, "The Mind of
Leonardo da Vinci". The average mind does not,
however, readily and effectively comprehend so
complex a personality as that of Leonardo by piec-
ing together evidence so fragmentary, nor does it
easily unify into a single vivid impression all the
aspects of a period so confused, brilliant, and enig-
matic as the Italian Renaissance. I would therefore
suggest that for most of my readers it will be easier
to make their acquaintance of Leonardo through a
work of fiction, in which all the elements are fused
for them into the living texture of romance. Such
a book is "The Romance of Leonardo da Vinci" by
Merejkovvski.
Merejkowski's Leonardo may not be the greatest
of historical romances,—such a claim would be dif-
ficult to substantiate,—but it certainly is a magical
book. It is a thrilling experience to find one's self
suddenly become a contemporary of Christopher Co-
lumbus. Savanarola, Raphael, Michelangelo, Machi-
avelli, the Medici, and the Borgias. But such is the
power of this book to evoke these dim figures of the
past that they seem as real as the distinguished
figures of one's own day. To see Leonardo check-
ing over Columbus' observations of the Pole Star
newly come to hand and finding them erroneous is
to feel a new kinship to the fifteenth century. It
might be Isaiah Bowman of the National Geo-
graphic Society checking the latest report of Com
mander Byrd. Merejkowski's canvas is a vast one.
It is like the huge panoramas of historical events,
like the old Panorama of the Battle of Gettysburg I
saw as a boy, or the Panorama of the World War
I saw in Paris. In one wide sweep it presents on
a single canvas one of the most comprehensive pic-
tures of the Italian Renaissance I know,—a picture
crowded with detail, but all centering about the one
great figure of Leonardo da Vinci.
It is surprising how authentic the portrait of
Leonardo seems to be. I have checked many of the
details of Merejkowski's picture with the evidence
of such careful accounts as McCurdy's and Mrs.
Taylor's in her "Leonardo the Florentine" and have
been amazed at the agreement between the ro-
mancer and the biographers regarding many of
Leonardo's characteristics: his cold, unemotional,
intellectual curiosity, his scientific method of ap-
proach to his painting, contrasting with the ignor-
ant superstitious mysticism of other artists of his
time like the devout Fra Benedetto: his rationalism
in such antithesis to the unreasoning emotionalism
of Savanarola: his restless, tireless intellect explor-
ing always some new range of hitherto undiscovered
thought. One sees him at his work, now painting
the Last Supper in Santa Maria delle Gracie, now
his Mona Lisa, now modelling the great Colossus of
the Sforzas, and now engaged in a multitude of
technical studies. He projects a model city with
two-tiered streets for classified traffic; he is direct-
ing work on the Ducal Canal to join Sesia with
Ticinio; he is performing his dissections which made
him the greatest anatomist for three centuries; he
is discovering the law of the reflection of light and
sound, the laws of supplementary colors; the trans-
mission of power. He has the plans of a submarine,
a steamboat, and a flying machine that lacked only a
modern motor to make it a final solution of the
problem of flight. It is a dazzling picture of intel-
lectual achievement.
During the past week while I was reading "The
Romance of Leonardo" for the third time, the glider
purchased by the Aeronautical Society has been on
exhibition in the corridor outside my office door.

MUCH TO DO WITH HIS THEORY REGARDING FLIGHT.
As I have watched the throngs of young men crowd-
ing about it between classes, examining it from
every possible angle, I have thought constantly of
Leonardo, for the passion of his life was to solve the
problem of human flight. "Wings for humanity be-
came the ultimate aim of all his life." One beautiful
passage in Merejkowski's romance has come back
to me as I have seen the great yellow-winged drag-
on fly of a glider cast its magic spell over the eager
crowds of students. Leonardo has climbed a crag
of Monte Albano and has reached the edge of a
precipice that bars his further progress. "Leonardo
bent over," to quote from the passage, "glancing
into the abyss, and again, suddenly, but now with
such force as never hitherto the feeling, of the

AMERICAN RAIL.ROAD JOURNAL, AND
JEronautic Steam Car.
To the Editor of tho Mechanics' Magazine:
Sir,—Herewith I send you a proposed
plan for an jEronautic Steam Car, which, if
vou deem worthy of your attention, you may
record in your Register of Inventions and
Improvements. Of the expediency of the
project, your readers and yourself must be
the judges. For my own part I should not
have thrust it upon your attention had I the
slightest thought of its inexpediency. I am
of the opinion that, if properly constructed
it will succeed beyond a doubt in calm wea
ther. Of the elfect that would be produced,
should jEolus unpack his chariot during one
of its a-nuf flights, I nin unable to speak;
but I presume the tempest.tossed voyager
would be able to conduct his frail bark with
as much skill certainly as our modern aero,
nauts, who arc limited in their operations to
a discharge of gas and ballast. The plan
herein proposed occurred to me some years
since, but I have not availed myself of the
advantages that arise from an actual experi-
ment, because of the expense which must
necessarily be incurred in the construction
of such a machine.
The sketch represents a side view of the
car. A is a balloon; B, the car attached
thereto; C, a helm to govern its course; D,
spiral vanes; E, supports for the car when
at rest. Let two balloons, of the form re
presented in the drawing, be- made of silk,
prepared in the usual manner, both of the
same size. A silk netting is thrown over
each one, but is collected into a few cords
at a short distance from each extremity of]
tho balloon. The balloons being placed ho-
rizontally and parallel with each other, a
car is suspended a few feet below, in the
manner represented in the sketch, being at-
tached at four points. The car may be made
of any desirable form, of some material
combining in an eminent degree strength and
lightness. A light frame of wicker-work
covered with oiled silk might answer the
purpose. The car contains,
1. A simple apparatus for generating hy
drogen gas, suitablv connected with the bal.
loons by pipes. Valves are also provided
for the intromission and eduction of the gas
at the disposal of the rcronaut. If it is re-
quired to ascend, a greater quantity of gas
is introduced, the balloons being construct-
ed so as to admit of it. A contrary process
onuses a descent. The usual way of effect-
ing a rise by throwing out ballast is there-
fore wholly avoided, and the car is not on-
cumbered by unnecessary baggage.
2. A small steam engine of the simplest
construction, with gearing to move the silken
"tics or wings, of a spiral form, which are
placed on both sides of the ca.r The beil*
er may be heated by the combustion of wa
ter in combination with bituminous or olea-
ginous substances, on the principle of " Mo
rey's American Water-Burner."
3. A helm of silk stretched on rods placed
in the stern, to govern the motions of the
whole. This may be made after the man
ner represented in the drawing, where two
fans are joined together at right angles with
each other, (its action on the air will rca
dily be perceived,) or by two distinct fans,
placed so as to act vertically or laterally.
4. A barometer, thermometer, compass,
and the whole ct cetera necessary for an ae-
rial voyage.
Let us now suppose the balloons to be in-
flated, and the whole with one person buoy-
ant in the air, the balloons being of sufficient
capacity to sustain the whole, &lt;ias is no
introduced till it rises. When a sufficient
height is attained let the silken vanes be
caused to revolve with rapidity. A rapid
progressive motion is the result. Should any
of your readers think differently, or should
they discover any difficulty, theoretical orj
practical, they will please make it known
through your columns, that I may avail my
self of the same medium (with your permis
sion) to correct, acknowledge, or explain, as
the case may be, as I hold myself in readi-
ness to answer all queries respecting the
above, if possible; and I am equally rea-
dy to confess my error, if it shall be clearly
shown. Its practicability rests upon the
truth of f o points: 1. Cun balloons be
constructed of sufficient buoyancy to support
a car containing the above described appa-
ratus? 2. If supported, will a progressive
motion be caused by the action of the spiral
vanes on the air? When we reflect that bal
loons have been made capable of raising
four persons, and that the apparatus cannot
exceed the weight of two persons, the truth
of the first of these propositions becomes
sufficiently apparent.- That the air is a suffi.
cient abutment to cause progressive motion
if acted upon properly, is exemplified in the
flight of birds, where muscular action is ex-
erted tp acquire and maintain a height, as well
as to move forwards. The words of poetry
as quoted in your last will be strictly verified:
"Soon shall thy arm, unconquered steam ! afar
Drag the alow bar^e. or drive the rapid car;
Or, on wide moving wings expanded, bear
Ttie flying chariots through the fields of air."
In conclusion, Mr.'- Editor, I would beg
you to overlook the many errors that' must
occur in this article. ".I am no orator, as
Brutus is," and am. equally unskilled in
"chaining winged thoughts to the parch
ment." At some future time I purpose to
furnish you with drawings of a newly invent-
ed Portable Horse Power which I possasa.
I hev° other objects in view beside" a desire
to contribute to the advancement of mecha-
nic arts. 1 consider that yours is indeed a
"Register of Inventions and Improvements,"
and, therefore, a person unable to avail him-
self of the usual protection by patent may in
a great measure secure to himself the ere.
dit, at least, of his invention by publication.
The world may then judge of the originali-
ty of a project, and a fair copy be present for
the accommodation of those who would avail
themselves of the advantages of re-invention.
Respectfully, yours,
B. G. N.

Comment by John S. Worley
Professor of Transportation
A careful reading of the forego-
ing article discloses all of the prin-
ciples which are embodied in the
modern dirigible and if a ship of
the air were built in accordance
with the specifications set forth it
would be navigable. In light of
our present knowledge of these
matters such a ship of course would
not be considered practical.
The students of the University of
Michigan have a particular interest
in this article and illustration due
to the fact that it was written at
Dexter, Michigan Territory, 1834,
at a time when there was no white
settlement in the state west of Dex-
ter. We are further greatly inter-
ested in who "B. G. N." was, his
other achievements and his ulti-
mate interest and occupation in life.
I have been giving considerable
time to the solution of this ques-
tion. I have searched carefully the
copies of all Washtenaw papers for
the years of 1833-36 hoping to find
some reference to the genius who
wrote this article, but Washtenaw
County papers are as silent upon
the subject as were the New York
papers at the time Fulton first
sailed the Clermont from New
York to Albany. I did find the
name of B. G. Noble, who may be
the author of the foregoing article.
A search of the proceedings of the
Michigan Pioneer Historical Soci-
ety discloses that there were two
families of Nobles living in this
vicinity at that time. It is not im-
possible nor improbable that detail
drawings of this airship are still in
existence. These details would
probably add nothing to our pres-
ent knowledge of the subject, how-
ever, as a part of the early history
of aerial navigation, the University
of Michigan would be greatly in-
terested in having and preserving
them.

The New Glider
By George C. Tilley, '30
GAINING momentum under the impetus of
vigorous leadership and popular interest, the
new sport and science of gliding has devel-
oped for itself during the past semester a note-
worthy position among campus activities. With the
arrival on January 13th of the Aero Society's first
glider, a ship of the primary or schooling type built
by a Detroit firm, campus enthusiasm reached a
peak that flooded the Glider Section with applica-

tions for membership, all of which had to be re-
fused for the enrollment limit of (:0 had long since
been reached.
The Glider Section of the Aero Society had its
inception last fall as a direct outgrowth of the move-
ment to popularize gliding started by Edward S.
Evans, Detroit, founder and president of the Na-
tional Glider Association. Evans has long been in-
terested in the development of American aviation.
In 1926 he established a globe-circling record of 28
days and 14 hours, crossing Europe, Asia, and North
America by air, chiefly for the purpose of promoting
public confidence in aviation, and he is on the board
of the directors of 26 leading airplane concerns.
Recognizing in German gliding a potent influence
toward the perfection of that country's aviation, he
organized the National Glider Association to secure
for the United States the same benefits. Through
gliding he hopes to develop air-mindedness, piloting
ability, and knowledge of design and construction
among young men for whom flying experience
would otherwise be too expensive. He considers
this promotion of gliding his grandest gesture in
behalf of American aviation.
At his suggestion and through the activity of his
son, Robert B. Evans, '30, the Glider Section was
organized as an offshoot of the Aero Society already
established on the campus. To assist him in the
details of putting gliding on a practical basis at the
university, Evans' son chose as a committee Milton
Stoughton, '29E, technical expert; Dan VV. Smith,
'30E, secretary; Edward S. Evans, Jr., '30, treas-
urer, and George C. Tilley. '30, publicity manager.
The first announcement of the project awakened
more than enough interest to fill the membership
of the section. At least a hundred applicants were
turned away, and many more signified their interest
in gliding. W hen funds are secured with which to
purchase more ships, it will be the policy of the
Glider Section to add to its membership all those
who are able to glide.
The committee was next confronted with the ne-
cessity of locating a suitable terrain over which to
fly. The terrain, it should be mentioned, is even
more essential to gliding than landing fields are to
motor aviation, for hills are necessary to produce
the rising air currents which gliders utilize to gain
altitude. The terrain must also be unobstructed by
telephone poles, trees, or fences, which might play
havoc with a plane almost wholly at the mercy of
air currents. After an exhaustive examination of
Ann Arbor's environs, the committee finally chose
a tract of rolling farm land to the north of the
Huron River, near the intersection of Geddes Road
and the River Road. There they found several bare
knolls from 50 to 75 feet in height surrounded by

soft turf ideal for cushioning landing impacts. On
the property, also, were several barns that are now
being converted into hangars for the gliders.

Scientific Journalism
By Donal Hamilton Haines
THERE was a period in the history of scientific
progress—and that no great way back in the
past—when considerable intervals of time in-
variably elapsed between almost any scientific dis-
covery and any authorized account of the event
given to the public at large. The scientist himself
was mainly responsible for this, yet he had his
grounds for postponing the account of his labors.
In the first place there stood between him and any
tendency to rush into print his ingrained caution,
his habitual insistence upon
proven and absolute accuracy
of results before a whisper of
them went beyond the walls of
his laboratory. In the second
place, he had little or no con-
fidence in the channels through
which the account of his re-
searches reached the ear of the
public.
Anyone at all familiar with
the fashion in w-hich scientific
findings were mishandled by a
great many newspapers a few
years ago finds no difficulty in
understanding why the men re-
sponsible for the steps in scien-
tific progress preferred to have
the account of their accom-
plishments spread slowly
through word-of-mouth reports from one man to
another rather than belated publication in wholly
trustworthy scientific journals. Far better to have
accuracy with delay, they argued, even though it
might involve some commercial loss, than to have
the general public deluded—and ultimately disap-
pointed—by the printing and circulation of lurid
accounts which had little or no basis in fact, and
which made or implied promises which the scien-
tists knew could not possibly be kept.
This situation was perhaps at its worst during
the years when the newspapers had just begun to
realize that the scientific laboratories were a fruit-
ful source of striking news, and before they had
learned that it didn't pay in the end to sacrifice
everything for sensationalism.
But it can not with strict accuracy be said that
such mishandling of this material is at an end. There
are still newspapers which, either from a long-main-
tained policy of sensationalism, or from failure to
understand the deplorable consequences of such
journalistic rashness, are still prone to rush into type
with exciting accounts of this or that bit of scien-
tific experiment so far from the truth that they are
not merely of less than no value as news but usually
GLOWING sensationalism ac-
companied by exaggeration
in newspaper accounts of new sci-
entific achievements is one of the
difficulties the research scientist
must cope with when endeavoring
to make known any recent step
in scientific progress. Through
his connection with the publica-
tion of research bulletins, Mr.
Haines has encountered many
such unfortunate incidents. In the
accompanying article he has
shown the way in which the Uni-
versity Research Department has
evaded this difficulty.
—The Editor.
involve those concerned in the work itself in endless
and embarrassing explanations.
To give a specific example, within the past few
months such a premature account was published in
a daily paper of work being done by a University
scientist. According to the latter's subsequent as-
sertion, the account contained seventeen statements
of which all but two were incorrect, and he was un-
aware that the newspaper desired to print any
account of his work—which he had no thought of
making public at the time—un-
til he saw the matter in print.
Such cases, however, have
for some years been the excep-
tion rather than the rule. A
clearer understanding on the
part of the newspapers of the
real value of such copy and the
importance of its careful and
honest handling, coupled with
the understanding on the part
of the scientist that the ever
closer relation between the lab-
oratory and the great industrial
plant make delay in the publi-
cation of important findings
dangerous, has brought about
a very different and greatly im-
proved situation.
But even with this improve-
ment in the newspaper situation, it is best that the
scientific worker—particularly in such an institution
as the University—be provided with an organization
whose function it is to give the account of his labors
to the public in such fashion that the desired pub-
licity is not delayed, but that earlier publication in-
volves no risk of inaccuracy whatsoever.
It was to this end that in 1925, five years after the
establishment of the Department, there was added
to the staff of the Department of Engineering Re-
search a Publication Committee consisting of Pro-
fessor J. Raleigh Nelson, chairman, Professor A.
H. White and Dean (then Professor) H. C. Sadler,
Professor Nelson being appointed to serve as editor
of all publications subsequently to be issued.
Before any of the "Research Bulletins," which
have since become well known in almost every part
of the world, were issued, the committee gave very
careful consideration to the nature of the material
which was to be issued in bulletin form, and it was
decided that the bulletins would deal with the ac-
counts of only those researches whose conclusions
formed a genuine contribution to scientific knowl-
edge or literature.


Page 13
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Professor Nelson went at once to the University
of Illinois, as the bulletins which had been issued by
the Engineering Experimental Station of that insti-
tution were regarded as publications which might
well serve as models for those to be issued by the
University of Michigan. Professor Nelson spent
several days in studying the whole publications or-
ganization at the University of Illinois, and returned
with a full report for the committee. It was then
decided that all manuscripts submitted to the com-
mittee for publication in bulletin form would be
read not only by the members of the committee
but by three other men technically qualified to pass
on the material, before it was accepted for publi-
cation.
The first bulletin issued was entitled "An Inves-
tigation of Charcoal and Coke Pig Iron" by \V. E.
Jominy, investigator in the department of engineer-
ing research of the University, which came from
the shops of the Waverly Press of Baltimore, Md.,
during January. 1926. The booklet contained
twenty-seven pages.
A system of distribution was organized at the time
and has been followed since then, although some
extensions of the field have been made in response
to an increasing demand for the publications. Some
700 copies of the bulletin were distributed free to
the libraries of all those colleges and universities
which had technical schools and departments and
to all research laboratories. At the same time, in-
formation was sent to all industrial concerns likely
to be interested in the contents of the bulletins that
they had been issued and might be obtained by
writing to the Publications Office of the Depart-
ment. Copies were also sent for review to the vari-
ous technical magazines, both in this country and
abroad. All the earlier and some of the later bulle-
tins were retailed at fifty cents each; later issues,
containing from 95 to 130 pages, retailed for a
dollar.
The complete list of the bulletins is as follows:

130 pages. Price $1.00.
From the outset the publication of the bulletins
has been an unqualified success. The printing has
been done by a firm which has had wide experience
in the publication of scientific works, and careful
presswork supplemented by such editing as the
manuscripts have been given has resulted in a series
of booklets of very satisfactory appearance. The
extent to which they have been spread throughout
the scientific world is attested by the fact that re-
quests for different numbers of the series have been
received from England, France, Germany, Holland.
Norway, Japan, Persia, Irak, and Mesopotamia.
A few of the letters which have been received by
the editors of the bulletins will indicate the attitude
of American industries toward these publications.
"We are finding these bulletins of inestimable
value," wrote the American Sterilizer Co. of Erie,
Pa., referring to Bulletins No. 8 and No. 10, "and
are glad indeed that we learned of their existence.
Should you publish anything further relating to this
subject at a later date, we trust that you will let us
know."
Bulletin No. 9 drew a very flattering letter from
the offices of the Department of National Defence
of the Dominion of Canada. The letter read,—
"During a recent trip to the United States, I was
working with a Major Ralph Lockwood on the test-
ing of a wasp-engine Fairchild Monoplane for the
Department of National Defence, Canada. Major
Lockwood receommended very highly your book,
'The Manual of Performance Testing'. As I do
most of the type testing for our department, I am
very desirous of obtaining this book as I am sure it
will be very, very valuable in our work." The letter
was signed by R. S. Grandy, Squadron Leader,
Royal Canadian Air Force, Ottawa, Canada.
Another valuable comment on Bulletin No. 10
was published in "Zeitschrift fur Metallkunde" a
German scientific magazine, in April, 1928. Dr. R.
Schak, a German scientist holding both the degrees

Pugilistic Trend Noted in Engine School
It seems that "Scarface" Fletcher Carney and
"Dynamite" Harry Harrison had engaged in their
daily argument in the Aero Lab.; mounting wrath
could be observed in their eyes, fists clenched, and
jaws became rigid. Suddenly, "Scarface" pushed
"Dynamite's" face with the palm of his hand.
"Dynamite" let go a fearful right "haymaker" that
caught "Scarface" full in the eye, he reeled dizzily
and sank slowly to the floor. In desperation "Dyn-
amite" helped him to his feet and after shaking
him, helped him out-of-doors and up East U. toward
the Health Service. Suddenly it occurred to "Dyn-
amite" that his position was anything but desirable.
Rather than be observed in the company of the
dazed and battered "Scarface", he turned and fled.
That evening "Dynamite Harry" was called to the
telephone and heard the voice of his late opponent,
"How did I get to the Health Service?" "Scarface"
had managed to reach medical aid in spite of his
semi-conscious state. Which proves that an engin-
eer can do the right thing even if he is rather dazed. o
Love Will Find a Way
The large amount of mail which Barney Cain
and Whipper Will have been receiving from Uni-
versity of Nebraska co-eds is quite alarming. They,
be it known, made a trip out to Nebraska as repre-
sentatives of the Technic last fall at the annual
convention of Engineering College Magazines Asso-
ciated. It was known at the time that they dated
rather heavily at the Tri-Delt House while they
were out there, but no one foresaw Sunday Special
Delivery Letters after they returned to Ann Arbor
—to say nothing of a letter a day during the week. o
"Bread Cast Upon the Waters ..."
"Big-Shot"' Gene Easterly made a wry face last
spring when we instituted "The Spotlight" in the
Technic College Notes section. He ruefully stated
that it would not be long before "The Spotlight"
became politically corrupt. And now, in this month's
issue, we find none other than the great stogie-
smoking Gene as the noble subject for a write-up.
Student Opinion
A place in which the engineers may express their
opinions to the rest of the students in the Colleges
of Engineering and Architecture has been a long
felt want. The Technic has decided to leave a col-
umn open each issue for the use of the students who
wish to air their views upon any subject whatso-
ever.
It is asked of those students who may contribute
to this column that they refrain from expressions
involving the vernacular, and to avoid anything
which may sound like satire, unless the occasion
justifies it.
All contributions should be left at the office in
a sealed envelope addressed to the Managing Ed-
itor, or they may be mailed to the Technic at 3036
E. Engineering Building.
It is earnestly hoped that the engineers will take
full advantage of this opportunity to exchange
opinions.—The Editor.
Concerning Burlesque Shows
We wonder whether or not Professor "Horrible
Harry" Higbie is anxiously watching for announce-
ments of coming musical comedy shows at the
Whitney. During the Power Show in New York
last fall, he was observed by Profs. Kceler and
Mickle in a front row seat at one of the more risque
musical comedy shows. Upon questioning by the
above named faculty members, he replied that in
order to observe the lighting effects, it was neces-
sary for him to occupy one of the front seats. What
effects the lighting must have had upon "Horrible
Harry." However, we trust that he did not get lit
himself.
o
L'Envoi
The end of the semester marked the end of Jack
Congo's flaming career in the Engine School. He
has graduated (never mind how), and is leaving
for Buffalo where a job awaits him. We are sure
that the rather drab appearing city of Buffalo will
soon emerge from its coma of comparative social
inactivity and take on the appearance of a veritable
"Roman saturnalia" upon the arrival of the great
Congo. Best of luck, Jack, and "may the rum drip
from your pores!"
o
The Traditional Slide-Rule
We have authentic information to the effect that
the traditional Engineer's Slide-Rule is resting
peacefully somewhere in the dark recesses of the
Law Club cellar. We shall probably have to let it
stay there, though—remember what happened to
some of the boys last spring when we rather infor-
mally stepped in at the Crease dance.

TALKS FROM THE DEAN
"Taking Stock"
Every year in most organizations there occurs a
period of slowing down of production, and advan-
tage is generally taken at that time to check over
such things as inventory or stock. The closing out
of the old gives an opportunity of sizing up the
situation—the failures and successes of the past—
and applying the experience so obtained to improve-
ments and greater successes for the future.
The same kind of survey can be, and I may add,
should be, applied by an individual to himself, per-
haps, not at any regularly started periods, but at
any rate whenever the opportunity occurs. This
idea has received perhaps an undue amount of pub-
licity of late under the rather high-sounding name
of psycho - analysis. Unfortunately, however, as
usually practiced, it represents only a small part of
the larger thing involved. It is only half the prob-
lem to find out the facts; and other and more im-
portant side being the application of these facts to
the elimination of the errors of the past, and to the
constructive improvement of the future, so that a
real advance may be made.
During the war I had an opportunity to study a
wonderfully complete production chart, which
showed clearly where certain parts of the organi-
zation had not kept pace with the rest. Everybody
seemed so interested in keeping the chart going,
that when I inquired if any steps had been taken
to reduce the number of blank spaces, it appeared
that it was nobody's particular business to look
after that side of the matter.
At this time of year we have just completed the
first semester's work, and it occurred to me that
here might be a logical place for all of us to pause
in the time between semesters, and take stock. The
results of our work and activities for the past four
months are now on record, and open for inspection
and analysis; and I may say that this applies equal-
ly to students and professors.
May I suggest a few thoughts which may prove
helpful to the students at this time, as illustrating
the general ideas contained in the preliminary part
of this talk? Have I gotten the most out of the
courses I have taken, or have I been contented to
get by with the minimum amount of increased
knowledge or experience? If I have failed in any
course, is it entirely the professor's fault, or have I
neglected to do my own share? Is there anything
wrong with me personally, or with my general mode
of life, that explains why I have not taken a real in-
terest in my work; or, on the other hand, if inter-
ested, could I have got even more value out of my
various courses? Have I looked after my health, so
that I am in good shape physically? Remember the
old Latin phrase, "mens sana in corpore sano," "a
healthy mind in a healthy body."
In other words, take stock of yourself. Find out
where any weaknesses have appeared in the struc-
ture, and see what can be done to repair these be-
fore it is too late. Don't be afraid to talk to your
mentor or instructors, and get all the help you can,
so that the next period may be one of greater and
more efficient production. Even if everything has
been satisfactory as far as passing courses is con-
cerned, there may still be room for you to produce
a better human being in the future.
o
COURAGE
As we sit here in our swivel chair and watch the
falling snow placing a crystalline blanket over the
campus, we see students, blue-books in hand, hur-
rying to their final examinations. Every one of
them, we are sure, is anxious to become a great
success when he takes his place in the world after
graduation. We are sure, too, that not every one
of them will be successful in his career after he
leaves the University. What, then, determines
which ones shall emblazon their names across the
world in great shining deeds, and which ones shall
fade into oblivion without having ventured to knock
at the door of fame? Every philosopher from the
most ancient to the most modern has proclaimed
that success comes only to the man to whom work-
alone offers inspiring interest, to whom obstacles
and past errors are nothing more than a source of
incentive to fight the harder, and to whom failure
and defeat are merely signals to start again with
renewed vigor. This, the philosophers claim, is the
magic formula by means of which any man may be
successful. Upon examination, however, the for-
mula may be simplified into a single word, "cour-
age". It resolves into the watchword of the im-
mortal Peter in Hugh Walpole's "Fortitude": "'T
isn't life that matters; 'tis the courage you bring
to it."


The College Chronicle
Items of Interest to Michigan Engineers
Tau Beta Pi
The national organization of Tau Beta Pi has
recently installed three fellowships which will be
granted to three outstanding men throughout the
country who are Senior members of Tau Beta Pi
and who are interested in taking a year of graduate
work. Carrying as they do a stipend of $720.00
each, they thus become particularly attractive and
it is anticipated that a great many applications will
be received. The administration of the Fellowships
is to be carried out by the Executive Council and
Alumni Representative Frank Burton of Detroit. At
the present time the Council is located at the Uni-
versity of Michigan with Professors C. F. Johnston,
H. H. Higbie, and A. D. Moore as members.
o
College Honor Societies
Of interest to both undergraduates and graduates
is the Association of College Honor Societies which
has been in the process of formation for several
years and which within the past few months has
adopted a constitution and made plans for extending
its membership. The association as it now exists,
includes six of the major Honor Societies which in
order of founding are Phi Beta Kappa, Tau Beta Pi,
Sigma Xi, Phi Kappa Phi, Alpha Omega Alpha, and
Order of the Coif.
It is planned to extend the organization so as to
include more of the Honor Societies which cover
a broad field of learning and in which membership
is based primarily on scholastic attainment. This
extension will help to prevent and reduce duplica-
tion of effort and the present confusion existing in
the field of Honor Societies.
An application blank is being prepared by the
society and will be sent out to the various organi-
zations within the near future.
o
A. I. Ch. E.
During the Christmas holidays a dinner-dance
was held by the Student Branch of the A. I. Ch. E.
at the Fawcett House with about twenty couples
attending. The chaperones of the affair were Dr.
and Mrs. McCabe.
The next meeting of the Student Branch has been
planned for the 21st of February at which time Prof.
A. H. White, the newly elected president of the
National A. I. Ch. E. will speak.
/. E. S.
Mr. G. L. D. DeVere, University of Oxford Lec-
turer, spoke at the February meeting of the Indus-
trial Engineering Society. Previous to the meeting,
an informal dinner was given in honor of Mr. De-
Vere at the Michigan Union.
For the past two years, Mr. DeVere has been
making a study of industrial conditions in this coun-
try. At present, he is studying the automobile in-
dustry. As he has just completed his survey, he was
able to bring to us a very conclusive' picture of
American industry as seen from the outside.
Vice-President Engelfried is corresponding with
Raymond H. Sullivan, Assistant Factory Manager
of the Ternstedt Manufacturing Company of De-
troit, to have him speak at the March meeting. Mr.
Sullivan has been a consulting engineer in the In-
dustrial Engineering field for some time. As he
worked under Taylor in helping to develop scien-
tific management, he will have something of real
value for those interested in Industrial Engineering.

The Frontispiece
The frontispiece, the north entrance to Martha
Cook Dormitory, is the work of Coit Wayne Mead,
'30A. It is a dry-point etching, in which branch of
art Mr. Mead has but recently become interested.
The etching is remarkably good, considering the fact
that it represents one of Mr. Mead's first attempts.
o
Aero Club
Sunday, January 27, 1929 will long be a memor-
able date in the annals of the Aero Club for it
marked the inaugural flight of the first glider be-
longing to the Society. The ceremonies were held
at the Gliding Field which is located at the inter-
section of Geddcs Avenue and the Pottawotamie
Trail. After carefully assembling the machine,
which had been purchased from Gliders, Inc., the
machine was carried to the top of a large hill and
there Prof. Pawlowski of the Aero Department gave
a short speech after which the crowd was cleared
back and the first flight was made. After one or
two unsuccessful starts due to a defective connecting
hook, the glider was finally launched and sailed ma-
jestically over the crowd and landed several hun-
dred yards away. It was impossible to make a long-
er flight due to the lack of wind. The pilot on the


Page 17
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
first trip was F. M. Blunk of Gliders, Inc. After
bringing the machine back to the top of the hill,
another flight was attempted this time Herr Oscar
Kuhn being the pilot. The third and most success-
ful trip of all was made by Dr. Klempner who is
Number 1 Glider Pilot of Germany. He sailed high-
er and farther than either of the two men who pre-
ceded him and was very much pleased with the per-
formance of the glider.
This rather auspicious
occasion for the Aero Club
also brought to the field
Mr. E. S. Evans, Sr., the
Round the World Flyer,
and "Eddie" Stinson, for-
mer holder of the W orld's
Record Endurance Flight.
Due to the inclemencies
of the weather it was
deemed advisable not to
allow any of the students
to fly and therefore Dr.
Klempner's flight conclud-
ed the activities of the
day. The large crowd
present showed a remark-
able interest in the project
and it would therefore
seem that gliding at Mich-
igan has come to stay.
The Aero Club is to be
congratulated upon this
most enterprising endeav-
or; The Technic wishes it
the best of success.
Recent Installation of Large Airway Beacons
In addition to the new 1,000,000,000 candlepower
revolving beacon which is soon to be installed in
Chicago, a gift of Elmer A. Sperry, Pesident of the
Sperry Gyroscope Co., Brooklyn, N. Y., several
other beacons of unusual size have recently been in-
stalled in various parts of the country. Within the
past month a new airplane beacon was erected on
the roof of the St. George Hotel in Brooklyn. This
has a rating of 480,000,000 candlepower and is said
to be the largest beacon ever built for private use.
Two revolving beacons now being erected in Cal-
ifornia by the Standard Oil Company for the guid-
ance of West Coast fliers are said to develop 10.-
000,000 candlepower each. One will be placed on
top of Mount Diablo, twenty-five miles southeast of
San Francisco, at an altitude of nearly 4,000 feet,
and will be visible from points within a radius of
100 miles. The other is to be located among the
Merced Hills in Los Angeles basin, just north of
Montcbello. These two installations will be similar.

Spotlight
EufiENE Easterly, '29
If, perchance, you should
walk into Prof. Emswiler's
office (on the main floor of
the West Engineering Build-
ing), you should probably see
the back of someone before
the window, seated at his
desk, studying industriously.
The be-spectacled individual
you should thus observe should be none other than
Eugene Easterly, "big-shot" extraordinary.
Both as a student and as a gentleman, Gene has
acquitted himself remarkably well since his arrival at
the portals of this great institution sometime during
the fall of 1925. His first accomplishment of any sig-
nificance was his election to Phi Eta Sigma, at the
close of his Freshman year. During the spring of
his Sophomore year he was elected treasurer of the
coming Junior class and was pledged and initiated
into Triangles, honorary Junior Engineering Society.
During his Junior year he became a member of Tau
Beta Pi, national honorary Engineering Fraternity.
Now in his Senior year, he is president of his class,
a member of the Engineering Council, a member of
the Student Council, and is a member of Vulcans,
honorary Senior Engineering Society. He is a mem-
ber of Triangle fraternity.
Electrification in Great Britain
Out of a total of 594 installations in Great Britain
in 1925, only three had a production of over 200,-
000,000 kw-hr., with an average of 283,000,000. Only
two central stations can be considered as supersta-
tions, and more than 300 stations have a yearly pro-
duction of less than 5,000,000 kw-hr. With the ex-
ception of authorized enterprises and large indus-
trial organizations which
produce electricity for
their own use, 60 per cent
of the country may be
considered as not having
the benefits of electrifica-
tion, according to British
statistics. During 1922 to
1925 the established elec-
trical districts had a pro-
duction of 5,754,000,000
kw-hr. (without counting
the production of large in-
dustries). The per capita
production of Great Brit-
ain is approximately 140
kw-hr. Sectional plans
have been completed by
the Electricity Commis-
sion of Great Britain for
a n extensive electrifica-
tion plan to be carried out
in the near future.
An Easy Method
of Approximating
the Square Root
The following description of a novel method of
approximating square root has been contributed by
C. H. Willis, Department of Electrical Engineering,
Princeton University.
The frequent occurrence of the radial vV±&amp;2 in
electrical calculations makes the solution of this
expression a matter of importance. The method
described below for handling this expression pro-
vides a simple and easy manner of obtaining an
approximate solution. If one of the numbers be
three times as great as the other, the accuracy of
the approximation will be greater than the accur-
acy of a direct calculation on a 10-in. slide rule.
The radial Va2=*b2 may be expanded by the
binominal thereon into the infinite series;
b2 b* be
yfl2±£2=(r± T ± .
2 a 8 a" 16 a"
This series is very rapidly convergent if a be greater
than b, and under this condition we may write,
b2
W *b2=a ±

Echoes from the Graduates
William L. Clements
FORTUNATE indeed is the University of
Michigan to have a graduate think so much
of his Alma Mater that he has utilized his
spare time and expended a great deal of money to
make to the University of Michigan such a won-
derful gift as the William L. Clements library. The
financial expenditure, although
very great, amounts to very little
compared to the foresight, the
knowledge of the scholar, and the
patience necessary to obtain such
a complete library of Americana as
the William L. Clements library-
contains.
Mr. Clements was born in Ann
Arbor, Michigan, on April 1. 1861.
He attended the public schools
here and entered the Engineering
School at the University of Michi-
gan, graduating with the degree of
B. S. in Mechanical Engineering in
1882. He is probably the first
graduate from this department.
Upon graduation, he entered the
employ of the Industrial Works at
Bay City, Michigan, as engineer.
This institution was engaged in
general machine shop business
which, however, was not success-
ful, and in 1886, W. L. Clements
and an associate bought out the
interest of the stockholders and the bondholders
of the Industrial Works and re-established it on a
sound basis. He became president of the Indus-
trial Works and under his management it became
one of the most prosperous institutions in the state.
Mr. Clements, in addition to his success in busi-
ness life, has been a careful student of affairs and
has kept in touch with the broadest questions of the
time. Mr. Clements finds that an old book is quite
as good as a game of golf for getting away from
"that tired feeling." He takes a personal delight in
a good book, finding in sixteenth century crispness
of leaf, width of margin, and smoothness of yellow
vellum or polished morocco the relaxation without
REGENT WILLIAM L. CLEMENTS
which he could not carry the heavy financial and
industrial obligations which center in his office.
He has been a contributor to technical magazines,
especially upon engineering topics. He is a member
of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.
Mr. Clements wrote a book about the William L.
Clements Library of Americana de-
scribing it and telling the motives
which led to the making of his col-
lection of books.
The Industrial Works, now
called the Industrial Brownhoist
Company, with offices at Cleve-
land, Ohio, from which Mr. Clem-
ents retired in 1924, now employs
nearly two thousand men. and its
chief business is the manufacturing
of large cranes. This company
supplied numerous cranes for use
in the construction of the Panama
Canal. During the war the plant
manufactured Government muni-
tions. The plant is now making
large cranes and last year supplied
the Soviet Government. This com-
pany has produced the largest
wrecking crane in the world. It is
called the Virginian 3-19. It has a
capacity of two hundred tons at a
radius of seventeen feet and six
inches. Twenty-two Michigan men
have contributed to the development of this won-
derful piece of engineering skill. They are: W. L.
Clements, C. R. Wells, E. B. Perry, W. B. Perry,
L. G. Howlett, N. R. Crawford, W. R. Wells, W.
W. Clements, C. E. Shearer, F. I. Warren, W. R.
Bassett, H. L. Campbell, J. G. Milliken, B. E. Blan-
chard, J. Shearer, J- V. Gilbert, C. M. Ackerman,
J. C. Wheat, C. U. North, G. L. Harmon. J. S. See,
and H. H. Perry. Mr. H. H. Perry is the general
manager of the Industrial Works at Bay City, Mich.
He was graduated from the Mechanical Engineer-
ing Department in 1916. Such capable leadership
as here illustrated in the development of the In-
dustrial Works at Bay City, Mich., speaks very


Page 19
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
highly of Michigan engineers, and especially of the
foresight, good judgment, and engineering skill of
Mr. Clements in its early development.
Mr. Clements was elected to the Board of Regents
of the University of Michigan in 1909, in which
capacity he still serves. In addition to his duties
as regent, he spends much time in Europe collect-
ing rare books and maps for the William L. Clem-
ents Library of Americana.

the eleventh floor; one of which accommodates up-
traffic and the other, down-traffic. In the evening
this huge garage provides convenient parking space
for the throngs of theatre patrons. The normal
parking capacity of the garage is 1,000 automobiles.
The theatre has a seating capacity of 3,000 and
is Mayan in architecture and interior decoration.
The Maya civilization was one of the highest types
existent in pre-historic Central America. In the
Fisher Theatre the student and art lover finds a
restoration of the ancient art of the Mayan crafts-
men.
The entrance to the theatre is made through the
grand arcade into a smaller foyer. The walls of this
foyer are covered with Mayan forms and symbols
in a deluge of brilliant hue, red, vermillion and yel-
low. The foyer is indirectly illuminated. At the
right of the foyer is a stairway, leading to the bal-
cony, on either side of which are panels bearing
figures. The upper balustrades are completed by
marble heads lighted from below, giving an unusual,
but nevertheless, pleasing effect.
The theatre proper is over 100 feet from floor to
dome and the Mayan type of decoration is carried
out in a complete and lavish manner, even to the
special seats.
The equipment of the theatre is completely mod-
ern, including orchestra stage on hydraulic lift jacks
and many other structural essentials of theatre
practice.
Perhaps the most interesting feature of the the-
atre is the lighting effects. The Fisher theatre has
the greatest array of lights ever put in a theatre,
regardless of size. Although it has nearly twice as
many lights as any theatre in Detroit, yet not one
of them is visible. It has enough candle power con-
cealed behind its coves to supply illumination for a
city of 50,000 people.
The architect depended upon electricity to advan-
tageously reveal the decorative effects in the the-
atre. The vast dome in the center of the theatre is
covered entirely with silver but at no time will this
be apparent. It is bathed constantly in changing
lights which are blended perfectly through auto-
matic switches. The lighting is so arranged that the
entire auditorium can be brought into one harmon-
ious color or combination of colors to emphasize the
mood of the music or picture.

BOILER SCALE
(Continued from pase 6)
tals of this substance are accidentally included, and
are not the result of a formation at the hot surface
such as that of calcium sulphate.
So far, so good. But how, after all, do the crys-
tals of calcium sulphate start to form on the metal
of the boiler tubes and plates? If crystal nuclei are
once established by some means, it is easy to see
that they will continue to grow in size, since, due
to the flow of heat from the hot surface, they are al-
ways in contact with a fluid film which tends to be
supersaturated with calcium sulphate. The ques-
tion therefore is to determine the way in which the
first crystals become attached to the metal to pro-
vide nuclei for scale growth.
An apparatus devised by the writer has gone a
considerable way toward answering this question.
This apparatus allowed the microscopic observation
of the early stages of scale formation on a heated
surface in contact with calcium sulphate solutions.
By making this heated surface a highly-polished
metal mirror, the principle of the metallographic
microscope could be used. Light from an arc-lamp
was reflected onto the mirror surface, and then re-
flected back through a microscope. The mirror sur-
face itself was a polished deposit of chromium,
plated on the front side of a small brass box, which
was internally heated by an electrical resistance coil
and was air-jacketed on all sides except the front, in
order to increase the heat flow across the mirror
surface. This brass box was immersed in a solu-
tion of calcium sulphate contained in a brass cell
with a glass window on one side, through which the
mirror surface was illuminated and observed. Pho-
tomicrographs of different stages in the scale form-
ation were obtained with a camera attached to the
microscope.
Experiments with solutions containing dissolved
air produced the effect shown in the photomicro-
graphs of Figure 1. Bubbles formed at the hot sur-
face each left behind a ring of minute crystals which
subsequently grew in size and ultimately formed a
complete interlocking network over the whole sur-
face. No crystals were formed at the surface except
in these rings left by the bubbles, which marked the
line of contact between the solid surface, the solu-
tion, and the vapor of the bubble.
Later experiments made with solutions carefullv
de-aerated to remove dissolved air showed the form-
ation of similar ring-shaped deposits as the result
of the evolution of steam bubbles, followed by the
same growth of the original crystals to form an in-
terlacing network over the whole surface.
From the results of these experiments it is evi-
dent that the first step in the formation of calcium
sulphate boiler scale is directly dependent upon the
main function of the boiler, which is to convert
water into steam. What is true for calcium sulphate
is probably true for all other substances whose sol-
ubility decreases as the temperature is increased.
Calcium hydroxide, which belongs in this class of
substances, has been found to behave in the same
manner, and more work is now being done with
other compounds which have this property.
The formation of crystals in rings at the line of
contact of bubbles and the hot surface is probably
due to a temporary slight increase in the temper-
ature of the surface beneath each bubble and the
fact that near this line of contact the solution exists
as a very thin layer. This thin layer evaporates,
leaving a solid residue deposited directly in contact
with the surface. Such a deposition of material
might occur from a solution of a substance whose
solubility increased with temperature increase, as
well as from one whose solubility decreased, in the
former case, as soon as the bubble had left the sur-
face, the minute crystals would be exposed to the
action of a fluid film which was actually undersat-
urated, and they would thus tend to dissolve, in-
stead of growing as they would do if composed of a
substance whose solubility curve was like that of
calcium sulphate. Sodium chloride, tested in the
experimental apparatus, showed no visible forma-
tion of crystals on the hot surface, although its sol-
ubility increases only very slightly with increase in
temperature. It is possible that other substances
may be found in which the rate of re-solution is slow
enough so that it will be possible to observe the
deposition of crystals by bubbles, and their gradual
disappearance after the bubble leaves the surface.
More work is being done along this line.
Scale formation on a boiler heating surface may
be summed up in conclusion as occurring in two
steps:
1. Crystals are deposited in actual contact with
the hot surface as the result of the evolution of
bubbles from the surface.
2. The initially deposited crystals grow contin-
uously by contact with a slightly supersaturated
fluid film at the heated surface as long as heat flow
is maintained across the surface.
The Heat Effects of Calcium Sulphate Scale
A different type of research was carried out in an
experimental boiler built to operate at pressures up
to 200 pounds per square inch. In this apparatus
the increase in temperature of the heating surface,
as scale deposited upon the surface, was followed
by means of special thermocouples. These thermo-

UNTIL July, 1927. the Mountain Springs
grade was a treacherous ten miles of
rocky trail which led out of the Imperial Valley
into the mountains of San Diego, California.
At that time a concrete highway, 20 feet wide
and 7.2 miles in length, was completed. Its ele-
vation variance is approximately 1800 feet mak-
ing an average grade of 7% with super-elevated
curves and a continuous series of alternating
reverses.
Unusual conditions — preparing a grade from
solid rock formation, long haul of materials,
temperature as high as 122° — demanded rug-
ged, dependable equipment. That's one reason
why the Koehring Heavy Duty Shovel did all
the excavation work — traveling over uneven
rock formation.
At the stock pile and batcher bin a Koehring
Heavy Duty Crane handled the crushed rock
and sand while on the grade a Koehring Heavy
Duty Paver mixed the dominant strength con-
crete, — a complete Koehring-equipped job.

BOILER SCALE

couples, known as the plated-surface type, were de-
vised by D. F. Othmer and H. B. Coats in the
Chemical Engineering Laboratory of the University
of Michigan for the accurate measurement of tube
surface temperatures. They consist of thin layers
of copper and nickel plated on a tube surface, with
copper and nickel wires plated into the respective
deposits to serve as leads to the potentiometer
which measures the potential, and thus indirectly,
the temperature at the surface of content of the cop-
per and nickel plate.
Scale was formed upon a tube heated internally
by an electrical resistance coil, and equipped with a
copper-nickel surface themocouple. This tube was
maintained in contact with solutions of calcium sul-
phate in the experimental boiler, and readings of
temperature, pressure, energy input to the heating
tube, and amount of water evaporated were made at
15-minute intervals for runs at different boiler pres-
sures for periods as long as 200 hours. From the
data taken during the run, and the thickness of the
scale measured at the end of the run, it was possible
to calculate the thermal conductivity of the scale.
Table 1 shows typical values obtained:

Scale is formed much more rapidly at the lower
boiler temperatures, as shown by the figures in
Table 1, and has the appearance of velvet, due to the
radial growth of a multitude of needle crystals out-
ward from the surface of the tube. Figure 2 shows
a typical scale of this kind, partially broken away to
show the surface of the tube upon which it was pro-
duced. As the boiler pressure is increased, the rate
of scale formation becomes much slower, so that, as
shown in Table 1, a run of 200 hours at 150 pounds
gauge pressure produced a scale with a thickness of
only 0.0032 inches.
The coefficient of heat conductivity of calcium
sulphate boiler scale places it in the same class with
magnesia brick as an insulator. Some calculations
from the observed values give an approximate idea
of the overheating which might be expected to occur
in the metal of a boiler tube as the result of the
formation of scale within it. It will be assumed that
the rate of heat input to the tube remains constant
in spite of the increasing resistance to heat flow of-
fered by the growing scale. This assumption is
perfectly valid for front-row tubes or water-walls
exposed to severe radiation. Assuming a value of
2.0 for the heat conductivity coefficient, which is
probably somewhat high, the temperature increase
of the tube surface due to various thicknesses of
scale is indicated in Table 2:

y attained in part
s of a boiler
subjected to severe radiation. These parts are at
the same time the parts in which calcium sulphate
scale will form most rapidly. The temperature in-
creases calculated in Table 2 indicates that a boiler
of modern design operating at 600 pounds per square
inch gauge pressure, with a corresponding water
temperature of 488°F. would be in danger if it
formed 0.1 inch in its front-row tubes, since this
would raise the tube metal temperature to 800°F.
A boiler operating at 200 pounds gauge pressure,
with a corresponding water temperature of 388°F.
and the same thickness of scale would be approach-
ing the danger limit in its tubes exposed to severe
radiation, since its tube metal temperature would
be 700° F.
These illustrative examples must not be taken in
too strictly quantitative a manner, but they do in-
dicate the probable range of temperatures produced
by scale, and hence the importance of scale preven-
tion in modern steam engineering. With pressures
steadily increasing, the prevention of scale becomes
increasingly important from two separate view-
points. In the first place, increase in pressure means
a decrease in the temperature margin between the
boiler-water temperature, and the allowable safe
tube metal temperature of approximately 750° F. In
other words, as pressure increases, less and less scale
will suffice to cause tube overheating and failure.
On the other hand, increasing pressures means in-
creasing danger in case tubes do fail, and increasing
delay and cost in replacement.
In general, the formation of scale in a modern
boiler is not responsible for any great decrease in
efficiency, since scale forms mostly in the regions
where heat transfer is chiefly by radiation, and radi-
ant energy is converted into heat energy in the
boiler metal regardless of the insulating effect of an
internal layer of scale. The modern boiler, as has
been pointed out above, must be protected from scale
because of tube overheating. Further accurate
fundamental study of the formation and properties
of scales is the first requisite step for such protec-
tion. We must find out all we can about boiler scale
in order to know best how to prevent it.

UNCEASING SEARCH
FOR NEW PROCESSES
The consistent regularity with which
new processes are developed by the
Dow organization, is due to a firmly
established policy of continuous search
for improvement.
New processes for the manufacture
of Acetphenetidin, Aniline, Phenol,
Magnesium Metal, Calcium Chloride,
Epsom Salt—the first American com-
mercial manufacture of Synthetic In-
digo—are a few of the milestones in
Dow Progress.
This unceasing search for improve-
ment has meant opportunity to our
men, broader lines for the Dow organ-
ization, and higher standards in the
products so important to our cus-
tomers. Such progress is the surest
indication of our determination to
continue as the dependable source of
supply for chemicals which will best
serve the needs of those who use them.
Located, as we are, directly above the
brine wells which are our chief source
of supply for raw materials, we have
many advantages in manufacture.
This,combined with constant develop-
ment of new processes, has resulted in
over 150 Chemical Products which
carry the Dow trademark to all
quarters of the globe.

natural necessity, of the inevitability of flying took
possession of him.
"There shall be," he said in a whisper, "there
shall be wings! If not I, then some other,—'tis all
one — man shall fly. Those who have attained
knowledge, the winged ones, shall be even as the
gods!" He was a lonely figure, this forerunner of
our age, four centuries ahead of his time. As Merej-
kowski says:
"At times he felt that he was drawing near to a
great new world of knowledge, which, perhaps,
would be revealed only to coming ages."
"He was like to a man who has awakened in the
darkness at too early an hour, when all others are
still asleep. Lonely among those of his day he wrote
his diaries in a cryptic script for some brother in
the distant future, and for him also in the murk be-
fore the morn, a plougher of desert places, had he
gone out into the field to make mystic furrows with
his plough in persistent rigor."
Incidentally one cannot read Merejkowski's book
without a new understanding of the age in which
Leonardo lived, its confusion of paganism with
Christianity, its witchcraft, its superstition, its
cruelty, the conflict between the fanaticism of the
dark ages behind it in conflict with the new scien-
tific spirit before it. Nothing has in years so vivified
remote centures for me as to see the Milan Cathe-
dral in process of erection. I had seen it for the
first time dazzling white in the moonlight some
years ago and it had seemed to me then as eternal
as Mont Rlanc. 1 had somehow been unable to con-
ceive a time when it was not there. Hut in Merej-
kowski's romance, one sees the flat bottomed barges
from Lago Maggiore bringing the blocks of white
marble for its building; one looks up at the gigan-
tic structure surrounded with the carpenters' scaf-
foldings; one climbs among the unfinished pinnacles
with the workmen, and looks through them down on
the burning of Savanarola. The unearthing of pagan
gods,—white Venuses and Dionysios, statues now
in dull rows in our museums, and the deciphering
of ancient manuscripts,—those evidences of earlier
civilizations which quickened Italy after the lethar-
gy of the Dark Ages into the teeming life of the
Renaissance; the Inquisitor, the monstrous heathen-
ism of the Borgias, the martyrdom of Savanarola;
the picture is amazingly complete. Even if one
puzzles over the interpretation of the book, the con-
flict between faith and reason, the rational concep-
tion of Christ, as the Omniscient Word and the
mystical conception of the Suffering Servant, he is
still bound to find so stupendous a study of Renais-
sance life very stimulating.
If your reading of Merejkowski's "Romance" in-
terests you to pursue your acquaintance of Leon-
ardo further, you will find abundant material for as
exhaustive a study as you care to make. French,
German, Italian, Russian, and English writers have
contributed to the literature that has grown up
around his name. Even Freud, one of the most
modern contributors, has worked out a curious but
highly ingenious "Psychosexual Study of an Infan-
tile Reminiscence" to explain some of Leonardo's
mature psychology. Benevenuto Cellini in his auto-
biography gives us some very naive but vivid pic-
tures. Walter Pater's "Essay on Leonardo." in the
series of essays on the Renaissance, and George
Elliot's "Romola" make interesting collateral read-
ing, the latter especially because in it one sees more
of Savanarola. One feels that Merejkowski has
somehow not quite given this great heroic figure its
due.
The most recent and most satisfactory life of
Leonardo is "Leonardo theFlorentine" by Rachael
Amand Taylor. It is by all odds the best single
book to read as a supplement to the Merejkowski
romance. To be sure it gives a picture of the Ren-
aissance life surrounding Leonardo, that is almost
confusing because of its detail, and it tends to em-
phasize the artistic significance of Leonardo's work
to the minimizing of his scientific researches, but
on the whole it is the most complete life of Leon-
ardo that has been written. The style is somewhat
over-decorated, but it is interesting and often very
beautiful.
In order to put my suggestions in a concrete and
useful form, I will give the list of books I would
suggest for those who would make the acquaint-
ance of Leonardo da Vinci and his times. I give
them in the order in which I think they might most
wisely be used.

of all patents issued in any civilized country. These
are grouped according to their practical significance
and are provided with a short abstract of their con-
tent so that from the standpoint of thoroughness,
brevity and completeness this work can hardly be
improved upon ... In order to help complete
our knowledge of chromium plating it is planned
to publish a similar volume in which the scientific
literature on this subect will be summarized. May
this second volume be characterized by the same
thoroughness, completeness and judicial treatment
as the first one!"
The reception of the bulletins in both the scien-
tific and industrial worlds has been more than cor-
dial, the tone of the review in scientific magazines
being just as gratifying as the letters from industrial
concerns. One company, after ordering fifty copies
of a bulletin for their own use, informed the editors
that they had recommended the publication to every-
one in their trade—roughly 10,000 people—and the
evidence of this "broadcasting" of the information
were apparent in the office. Six thousand copies of
this particular bulletin, the largest number of any
one to date, were ultimately printed.
The success of the bulletins justified the issue of
two other groups of publications, the "Circulars"
and "Reprints". Two of the former and four of the
latter have already been put out since their publica-
tion was undertaken less than two years ago. The
complete list of these is as follows:

1928. Price 50c.
A little over a year ago the pressure of work in
connection with the bulletins and other publications
of the department made it evident that Prof. Nelson
would have to have assistance in the editing of
the manuscripts, and Assistant Professor I. H. Wal-
ton, of the department of English in the college of
engineering was appointed to the post.
Since assuming his duties, Prof. Walton has taken
over another new development of the publications
work—that of editing the "progress reports" made
at stated intervals by the members of the staff of
the department of engineering research to the var-
ious interests for which the experimental work is
being done. This undertaking involved much more
than the editing from time to time of the reports
which were turned in. A careful study was made
of the whole problem of these progress reports and
certain standards established to which the reports
now conform—a system of obvious benefits both to
the scientists making the reports and those to whom
they are sent.
P&gt;egun with no thought of the scope which its
work was to gain within a short time, the publica-
tions office has already become invaluable through
its successful efforts in keeping the scientific and
industrial worlds informed as to the outstanding
accomplishments of the University scientists in
these fields.

SQUARE ROOT APPROXIMATION
(Continued from page 17)
If we assume a circuit with a resistance of 153
ohms and a reactance of 11 ohms, we may obtain
the impedance by inspection as;
121
Z=V1532+112=153+ =153.4
306
The answer correct to three decimal places is
153.395.
It is not always so easy to obtain the solution
by inspection but the solution has been reduced to
squaring one number and dividing by twice another,
which is a considerable gain over the direct method.
If we assume a circuit whose impedance is 175
ohms and whose resistance is 14 ohms we may
obtain the reactance by inspection as;
1%
X=V1752-142=175 =174.4
350
The answer correct to three decimal places is
174.439.
The approximation here would be much closer if
the true value of the fraction were used rather than
the value obtained by inspection.
This method is also very useful in obtaining irra-
tional square roots. If we desire the square root of
190 this may be written as a perfect square plus or
minus a remainder. Thus by inspection we have;

V190= V196—6=14=—=13.8

The answer correct to three decimal places is

front of the wing, perched on an open, lattice-work
fuselage. The plane, which weighs about 200
pounds without the pilot, is controlled with a rud-
der bar and "stick" which operate rudder, ailerons,
and elevators precisely as in a power plane.
This schooling glider, according to the designers,.
has such inherent stability and ruggedness that the
possibility of serious accident to the pilot is pre-
cluded. Should a pilot become confused, the ship
will come safely to earth if he simply abandons the
controls in the neutral position. If the nose is pulled
up until the ship stalls, instead of slipping back into
a tail-spin it will nose down of its own accord and
resume its glide earthward. The worst accident that
can happen to a "tyro" is a nose-dive into the ground
which might occur if he failed to level off in land-
ing. In this case, however, he would be protected
by the sturdy nose of the ship and the triangular
extension of the fuselage above the wing that would
break the force of any somersaults the plane might
turn in hitting the ground.
In landing the glider is levelled off near the
ground and allowed to skim along until it gradually
loses momentum and settles down on an iron run-
ner beneath the fuselage. Flying speed is lost at
about 13 miles per hour, after which the ship
touches and skids to a stop, falling over on the tip
of one wing when all momentum is lost. Launch-
ing is accomplished by snapping the glider over the
brow of a hill with a long rubber cable or "shock-
cord" stretched by the ground crew. The middle of
the cord is slipped into a hook on the nose of the
plane while six or eight men stretch it in the form
of a huge "V". Several men are also necessary to
hold the tail of the plane. The pilot shouts "Walk."
"Run," and "Let go," whereupon the plane is pulled
forward with a force equivalent to 40 horsepower—
sufficient to give it an altitude of 50 feet above the
point of take-off.
In the University's aero shop a second schooling
glider, being built wholly by students, is now in the
process of completion. In design it is a copy of a
popular German model of which Evans obtained
working drawings w:hile studying German gliding
this past summer at Wasserkupper on the Rhone,
the Mecca and Medina of glider pilots. Prof. Ros-
well E. Franklin is assisting in the construction and
at the same time is building a similar ship for
himself.
Schooling gliders of relatively heavy and rugged
construction are used to teach beginners the ele-
ments of glider control and the feel of wind cur-
rents. They are designed to absorb a lot of hard
knocks without cracking up irreparably. Simple-
soaring or riding of upward wind currents is possible
with the ship now owned by the Glider section and
with the one that is being built, but it is not recom-
mended for the beginner until he masters a practical
knowledge of meteorology.
In Germany it is the practice to graduate a pilot
who has demonstrated his ability to remain aloft 30
seconds in a schooling glider, to a "B" or "Course"
plane with an enclosed cockpit, greater wing-spread,
and the ability to perform soaring feats. The stu-
dent practices with this ship until he is able to re-
main aloft one minute in the same position relative
to the earth, and to execute a right and left turn.
He is then ready for the soarer or record-plane
with which a duration of more than 15 hours, dis-
tances of more than 40 miles, and an altitude of half
a mile have been established. The soarer is a huge,
trim, bird-like plane with a wingspread equal to that
of the Ford-Stout tri-motor. With it a pilot is able
to take full advantage of the rising currents created
when wind is deflected upwards upon striking the
base of a hill, and by skillful piloting can remain
aloft as long as the breeze continues steady.
If the soarer pilot has taken off from a series of
parallel ranges across which the wind is blowing,
he may migrate from his point of take-off by swoop-
ing from range to range, using the upward currents
off each hill to gain altitude for the next swoop.
The process is repeatable to infinity, unless the suc-
cession of hills fails. For more ambitious travels,
less conditioned by geography, he must jockey into
position above a storm cloud so as to take advan-
tage of the rising current of air curling over the
windward edge. If he is then content to ride with
the cloud, he may do so as long as wind and cloud
persist.
Tentative plans have been made by the Glider
Section committee to build a soarer in the aero shop
from designs that are now being drafted by Milton
Stoughton, technical expert. Before this project is
undertaken, however, the Glider section will use its
funds to purchase or build enough schooling ships
to ground all its members in the fundamentals of
gliding.

Engineer's Ballad
Fools may sing of hearts and love
And eyes and cheeks and hair,
Write sonnets to a woman's glove,
And swear her wondrous fair.
Bah! She's an artificial thing,
All powder, paint and lipstick,
But listen to the song I sing,
And hail! My love, the slip-stick.
Women are babbling all the time
Of dates, and drinks, and dresses,
Which wouldn't help at all when I'm
Computing torques and stresses.
It conquers without fear or doubt
Whole hosts of sines and surds,
And helps me work in peace without
An avalanche of words.
Slide-rules are always accurate,
Women never so;
And though they're not affectionate
They never answer "No!"
So hence with women's wanton ways,
With eyebrows, lips and curls,
My little log-log polyphase
Is worth a dozen girls.
After Graduation
The Big Boss (looking over drafting room):
"That new fellow from Michigan seems to be tend-
ing to business. He isn't shooting off his face like
most of these other draftsmen. 1 like a close-
mouthed man."
Chief Draftsman: "Oh, he isn't close-mouthed,
boss; he's just waiting for Pete to bring back the
spitoon."
Usher (to cold, dignified lady): "Are you a
friend of the groom?"
The Lady: "Indeed, no! I am the bride's
mother."
Not In Action
"That is a skyscraper," announced the guide.
Old Lady—"Oh, my! I'd love to see it work."
Impossible
A man of the world is one who can show a co-ed
a good time without spending any money on her.
Television Troubles
Not so many years from now, with the com-
pletion of the long-anticipated television phone,
Henry Hardware walks into a public booth to call
his wife. Twenty minutes later the connection is
achieved and his mate's face appears on the slate.
"Hello, dearie; you're looking well this evening.
What a pretty dress!"
"Is that so! Tell me, what's that blond hair do-
ing on your shoulder?"
"Mr.—er—you see, Mr. Smith had his little
daughter in the office today, and—er—say, darling,
I won't be home for supper tonight. Got an awful
lot of work on hand, and—"
"Really! Then why the brand new shave? And
the oil on your hair? And the sparkling manicure!
And, Henry, what is that horribly painted woman
doing in the booth! Oh, you brute! You wretch!
Don't ever let me see vou again! Good-by, vou
dog."
When an airplane comes down, it is quite prob-
able that it will go up in smoke.

rowly escaped a collision. They took a corner at a
rate that made them careen madly.
Just before them there was a huddled group.
"John," she hissed, "be careful or you'll hit them."
On they went without slackening speed until they
hit a wall.
"John, I told you we'd hit something. Why do
you dance like that?"
Minister: "I am very sorry to hear of your mis-
fortune. I should have thought that to drown him-
self would be the last thing your husband would
do."
Mrs. Flatbush: "It was."
"The stone-cutters union got rid of Green.
"How come?"
"He took too much for granite."
Many a motorist had to have his wholesome fun:
now he rests in pieces.

"DRY-ICE"
By Hugh E. Keeler
Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering
D
DI
RY-ICE" is one of the relatively new de-
velopments in the fields of mechanical and
refrigerating engineering and it is the in-
tent of this article to describe something of its prop-
erties; methods of manufacture on a commercial
scale: fields of usefulness and
present and future commercial
possibilities. In the compila-
tion of this article the writer
has drawn heavily on data and
information furnished by the
"Dry Ice Corporation of
America," 50 East 42nd Street,
New York City. The writer
desires particularly to ac-
knowledge the assistance ren-
dered to him by Mr. J. D.
Small of the Engineering De-
partment of this Corporation.
It should he noted here that
"DRY-ICE" is the trademark
of the Dry Ice Corporation of
America for solid carbon diox-
ide, chemically designated as
CO,. As is well known, this
gas is produced in enormous
quantities daily as a waste product of the combus-
tion process in power plants, steel mills, cement
plants, blast-furnaces, etc. It is also a waste prod-
uct from lime-kilns, carbide furnaces, chemical
plants, fermentation processes, etc. It is thus evi-
dent that carbon dioxide is a substance which is
around us in enormous quantities. However, the
RY-ICE" is a term whose
meaning is obscure and
vague to most of us. In the ac-
companying article Prof. Keeler
has unfolded many of the myster-
ies surrounding the process of
manufacture of "DRY-IC E,"
which is one of the latest
developments in refrigerating
engineering and presents remark-
able practical application of many
thermodynamical principles. Pro-
fessor Keeler has given us a
picture of this remarkable indus-
trial development in his usual
clear and concise style.
—The Editor.
now be utilized for the production of "DRY-ICE."
In fact, it is the exceptional case that a by-product
source can be utilized economically. Carbon diox-
ide is produced continuously by all living human
beings as a result of our breathing process and is
always present to a greater or
lesser degree in the atmosphere
in which we are continually
immersed.
Under ordinary conditions
carbon dioxide exists as a low-
pressure, highly superheated
vapor and is odorless, colorless
and tasteless and is not in it-
self harmful in any way to per-
sons except that it will not
support combustion or life and
when present in large quanti-
ties in the air we breathe is
detrimental only because it
reduces the oxygen content of
the air. Carbon dioxide is
used as a fire extinguishing
medium in certain types of fire
extinguishing systems. At 0°
C. and 76 cm. pressure the
Smithsonian Physical Tables, Seventh Revised Edi-
tion, show that free air as compared to carbon diox-
ide—under the same conditions of temperature
and pressure, carbon dioxide is 1.5289 times as
heavy as air.
Let us now compare solid carbon dioxide or
"DRY-ICE" and water-ice as refrigerants. When
great majority of by-product sources of COa cannot a pound of ice at 32° F. passes into a pound of

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
water at 32° F., very closely 144 B. T. U. of heat
are absorbed and if the water resulting from this
ice is raised in temperature there will be 1 B. T. U.
absorbed for each 1° F. rise in temperature per
pound of the water.
Note here that with water-ice alone it is impos-
sible to produce a lower temperature than 32° F;
that the water resulting from the melted ice must
be disposed of and that if a space is cooled by ice
that the contained air has an appreciable water-
vapor content usually resulting in a damp condi-
tion.
"DRY-ICE," or solid carbon-dioxide as commer-
cially sold at the
present time is a
perfectly w bite,
opaque substance
and i:; available in
cube:; which are ten
inches square and
we'gh about 38 to
40 pounds each, or
in cylinders
3 inches in dia-
meter and about 6
to 8 inches long.
This product may
be cut up by saw-
ing into pieces of
any desired shape
and size.
One pound of
solid carbon di-
oxide as sold for
commercial use ab-
sorbs approximately 152 calories per gram in pass-
ing from the solid state to that of a highly super-
heated vapor at 0° C. In English units this means
an absorption of approximately 274 B. T. U. per
lb. under the above conditions.
It is of interest iv&gt; note several of the advantages
of "DRY-ICE" as a refrigerant. This substance
has a density approximately 50% greater than
water-ice and determinations made by the U. S.
Bureau of Standards show that it has a tempera-
ture of 114.5° F. below zero, or a temperature of
146.5° F. below the freezing point of 32° F. It is
thus evident that far lower temperatures can be
produced with "DRY-ICE" than with water-ice
and due to the greater density and heat absorbing
capacity per pound of "DRY-ICE" a much larger
refrigerating effect can be obtained per unit of vol-
ume occupied by the "DRY-ICE" than can be ob-
tained from water-ice.
As water-ice absorbs heat it passes from a solid
into a liquid; as "DRY-ICE" absorbs heat it passes
directly from the opaque, white solid into the gas-
eous state without going through any intermediary
liquid phase. This process is known as "sublima-
tion," and makes it unnecessary to dispose of any
liqu'd as in the case of water-ice. There is no
dampness resulting from putting "DRY-ICE" di-
rectly in food-compartments and the gaseous car-
bon-dioxide passes out through suitable vents to
the atmosphere. This gas on its way to the atmos-
phere is frequently used to jacket the refrigerated
space and take up heat that would otherwise find
its way into the refrigerated space.
W ith water-ice refrigeration every effort is made
to prevent any connection to the outside air from
the refrigerated space, resulting many times in a
stale, damj) atmos-
phere.
With "DRY-
ICE" there is al-
ways an open vent
to atmosphere and
there is always a
flow of carbon di-
oxide gas from the
refrigerated space
to the outside air,
resulting in a fresh-
er atmosphere and
one that is free
from any moisture
coming from the
refrigerant itself.
In some special
cases it is very de-
sirable to produce
temperatures far
below anything
possible with water-ice alone and "DRY-ICE" is
particularly suited to this service. It is possible to
maintain temperatures of 40 degrees below zero and
even lower, in any space that it is desired to refrig-
erate.
Some interesting facts about "DRY-ICE" are
worthy of mention. A forty-pound cube of this
substance when placed uncovered in a store window
in midsummer will last about 28 hours. This is
due to the extremely cold layer of gas surrounding
the solid and to the fact that CO, gas is such a
poor conductor of heat. It is also worthy of note
that when a block of "DRY-ICE" is placed on a
support of any sort that it does not actually touch
it at all or only very imperfectly, due to the blanket
of C02 gas that is continually present and main-
tained between the support and the "DRY-ICE"
itself.
"DRY-ICE" is kept in balsa-wood boxes. In
small shipping cases the loss by sublimation is
about 10% by weight per 24 hours, but in larger
boxes the loss is only 4 to 5% by weight per 24

A Chat With Mortimer E Coo ley
By Dean Emeritus
MORTIMER E. COOLEY, beloved to a host
of students and alumni of the Engineering
College, has again taken up his residence in
Ann Arbor. He has returned to dispose &lt;&gt;f the
library of his recently de-
ceased older brother, who
was Hydraulic Engineer for
the Chicago Drainage Canal.
This library contains five or
six thousand books upon
various engineering subjects.
In a short interview, the
Dean said that his greatest
ambition is to write a history
of the Engineering College
of the University, in which
he should like to include an
autobiography of himself. He
is keeping up his correspon-
dence with his many friends
among the alumni body; the
postman who delivers the
mail to the Cooley home will
testify to its large volume.
As the log fire in his study
blazed and the logs crackled,
the Dean spoke of the ex-
periment he is carrying out
on his Georgia estate. The
experiment is being directed
along scientific lines, the pur-
pose of which is to demon-
strate the possibilities of
applying engineering meth-
ods to agriculture.
The Dean plans to have a
topographic survey made of
the estate which comprises
about 1500 acres. This survey
will enable him to ascertain
flood regions .and determine
irrigation possibilities more
accurately. He has already
discovered that spring water
is procurable in abundance
75 feet below the surface.
Electric power lines pass over
the fields and these will serve
as a source of power for pump and farm machinery.
The Dean has plans for an administration building
which will house an office, drafting room, shops for
blacksmith and carpenter, chemical laboratory, and
storage space.
SAWING WOOD
The day is done and night is here;
The wood we sawed is on the fire
Its blaze and waimth our hearts inspire
With thoughts of friends afar and near.
With friends ir mind the saw sings cheer.
The crackling logs for Jiose near by.
For they can hear what I would say.
The curling smoke for those away,
To read its message in the sky.
For them the saw seems but to sigh.
The while I'm loving all my friends.
And wishing thev could sit with me
Beside the fire, and feel and see
My present mood in all its trends.
Before my saw is strained, and bends.
Before a discord in my song
Of love and friendship inks my pen
With gall, to quote from wiser men.
That might makes right, and right makes wrong;
And makes my saw a raucous gong.
One toils and moils throughout the years
To feed and clothe the human race.
By strife the world moves on apace—
So say these wiser men, the seers.
A saw at which the cynic sneers.
They know it well—that pirates bold
On sea, and rogues on land, await
The toiler's wages, small or great.
Despoiling all, both young and old.
Despite my saw the night grows cold.
In peace, they know, we have to fight
To keep what we have gained by toil
In office, shop, or from the soil;
To have some wood to bum at night.
Thus saws grow dull and fail to bite.
That we must fight for e'en a chance
To bask in love and friendship's glow;
To have the gifts the gods bestow;
That only so can man advance—
By sawing wood and jousting lance.
And this has been since time began:
First peace, then war, and "ne'er the twain"
Shall part? Alack! But why complain?
'Tis God who wrote the tale of man—
With saw and lance he wrought its span.
Nor yet would peace advance mankind.
For peace relaxes all our strife
Towards what is prized the most in life:
A metal, choice, by fire refined;
Damascus blades, both heart and mind.
So what's to do, this being true.
But keep cn sawing, sawing wood?
To do our best we can and should;
And. too. be honest through and through.
The best of saws are tempered blue.
So sit you down beside my fire;
The day is done, and night is here.
Let's think of those we hold most dear.
Then clash the cymbals, strum the lyre.
And put the bucksaw in the choir.

'Possum Poke in 'Possum Lane
Poulan. Georgia—November 20th. 1928.
A chemical engineer is to analyze all portions of
the land to determine the type of crop best suited
for the land and the fertilizer which will render it
most efficient for production of crops. Probably five
or six hundred acres will be
placed under cultivation.
At the present time there
arc about 40 acres in pecan
orchards which are just com-
ing into bearing. Some re-
search is being carried out on
the advantages of cultivating
a tree crop. The Forestry
Department in Washington,
D, C, is co-operating with
Dean Cooley in this venture
and it has been proven con-
clusively that a tree crop
properly handled is more
profitable than a cotton crop.
A creek passes through the
estate and suggests the pos-
sibility of irrigated rice fields.
A good grade of rice is raised
in Georgia and some of the
"Georgia crackers" claim that
they export this superior
grade to Japan.
A Swift's Packing house is
located within 25 miles of it—
'Possum Poke in 'Possum
Lane as the Dean terms the
experimental farm. By in-
troducing blooded bulls to
the native herd it will be pos-
sible to profitably raise cattle
for the market. Between 300
and 400 acres are devoted to
pasture.
This Spring the Dean plans
to try some tobacco, bean,
and cabbage crops. At the
present time the majority of
the farmers raise cotton, corn,
hay, or peanuts. Corn and
hay can be purchased more
cheaply in the northern states
and are, therefore, not desir-
able crops from an economic standpoint.
The Dean is planning to build a southern home
in Georgia (where the people still vote the straight
Democratic ticket), where he may entertain his

By Edward R. Nell, '30E
THE West Lecture Room of Alumni Memo-

tables and an etching press, a slightly bald man of
small stature busied himself with plates and paper
and various other accoutrements of the etching art.
The gentleman thus occupied was Samuel Cham-
berlain, whose gleaming eyes, ever-present smile,
and genial personality belie his 34 years and give
him every appearance of youth.
From the beginning, his lecture took on the inti-
mate characteristics of a confidential chat. The
straight-laced formality and oratorical decorum
that is usually found in a lecturer were completely
missing in Samuel Chamberlain. The resulting in-
terest and appreciation produced in the audience
by his method of presentation left nothing to be de-
sired.
Mr. Chamberlain is recognized as one of the fore-
most contemporary lithographers, as well as a
prominent etcher and drypoint artist.
Artistic lithographs are made on large stones of
a creamy texture which come from Hungary. The
drawing is made in reverse on the stone with a spe-
cial wax crayon. After the drawing is completed,
the stone is washed with acid, which attacks the
stone at the points which are not protected by a
covering of the wax crayon. After being washed
with water an inked roller is moved across the
surface of the stone and prints can be taken. The
actual image is raised in this process, which allows
some possibility of retouch. The number of im-
pressions which may be taken is unlimited.
Wetpoint etching is done upon copper plates of
a hard nature. To prepare the plates for etching
they are first given a thin coating of wax, and then
smoked in a carbonaceous flame. The image comes
through the black face thus produced when the
etching needle scratches the surface of the copper
plate. After the image has been drawn upon the
plate with the needles used for this purpose, it is
etched in iron perchloride which has the property


Page 9
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
of attacking the plate vertically only. Tonal quali-
ties are produced by painting out the backgrounds
and re-etching the rest of the plate. After the
etching process has been completed, the wax is
washed off with gasoline, and the plate is ready for
printing. The deeper etched lines in the plate are
wider and hold more ink. which gives a bolder line
w hen printed.
Dry-point etching is done on copper plates which
require no preparation except that the surface must
be perfectly polished: any scratches would show up
on the prints. Four types of tools are generally
used in making dry-
points; a sharp pointed
steel tool which must be
kept sharp by constant
whetting: a ruby-pointed
tool which gives a finer
line than the steel tool: a
diamond - pointed tool
which gives the finest line
of all: and a steel scraper.
The image is first
sketched on the plate (in
reverse) and then fol-
lowed up with the etching
tools. The ruby-pointed
tool is used to indicate
things in the background;
its line is "fluffy, fleecy,
and fugitive," to quote
Mr. Chamberlain. The
diamond - pointed t o o 1
gives a very clean cut line
which resembles an
etched line. The steel
tool is the most difficult
to use, since the copper
resists it with an unbe-
lievable tenacity; it is
hard to control and re-
quires much manual strength. Mr. Chamberlain
recalled an incident in Philadelphia when he and
a group of friends approached a grip-testing ma-
chine to discover which among them had the
strongest hands. Mr. Chamberlain topped them
all. His only remark was that "a glad-hand artist
must be so equipped."
The etching tools produce a furrow or burr when
the surface of the plate is scratched, which gives
an uncertain inking effect, "like an ink line left out
in the rain." This velvety effect produced by the
burr constitutes the chief charm of drypoint etch-
ings.
The paper upon which drypoints are printed has
much to do with the charm of the finished prod-
uct. Old paper is very much preferred, such as
is found in old ledgers and books. These papers
CANTERBURY
Drypoint Etching by Samuel Chamberlain
take the ink better than new ones, and will secure
good prints from lightly etched plates which are
difficult with new paper. Old linen paper is the
most desirable; it becomes either yellow or a light
blue-green with age.
Before inking, the plates are heated on a heavy
iron grid which usually has an alcohol lamp locat-
ed beneath it. After the plates have reached "ex-
actly the right temperature," they are completely
inked. The excess ink is wiped away with rags
of mosquito-netting and the plate finally hand-
wiped to remove any excess from the backgrounds.
The paper is then wetted
and the impressions taken
by means of a special
roller press which exerts
very high pressures upon
the surfaces of the plates.
After the plates have
been retouched, they are
usually steel-faced to help
their wearing qualities.
The usual number of im-
pressions which are taken
is 100.
Mr. Chamberlain ac-
companied his lecture by
an actual demonstration
of the technique of dry-
point etching and print-
ing.
A compact biography
and appreciation with a
complete list of prints
has been written by
Charles D. Childs, and is
obtainable from Charles
E. Goodspeed &amp; Co. of
Boston.
The reproduction on
the opposite page of "Ga-
bles of Colmar," a drypoint etching by Samuel
Chamberlain, demonstrates very clearly his ability
to show detail very clearly with remarkably few
lines. The reproduction does not do the etching
justice, however, since the soft, velvety tone of the
original etching is completely lost, and relative
tonal values are modified to a great extent.
The reproduction of "Canterbury" shows Mr.
Chamberlain's ability to differentiate light intensity
and transfer it to his etchings. The picture which
the etching presents seems remarkably alive and
real. One can but marvel at the power of "scratch-
es on a metal plate."
When the opportunity again presents itself to
Samuel Chamberlain to lecture in Ann Arbor, he
may be assured that he will not lack an audience.

What Shall I Read?
By J. Raleigh Nelson
Professor of English
MIDDLEMARCH, ARROWSMITH, AND THE GREAT HUNGER
FROM the multitude of books in which the
human spirit is pictured in its struggle against
circumstance, I have chosen for comment
this month three which I believe especially signfi-
cant for men who are just about to begin their pro-
fessional life, or who may already be meeting some
of its problems. Most men who have survived the
sifting process of four years or more of training for
a profession as exacting in its
requirements as Engineering,
look forward to more than dull
routine: they have had their
visions of a success based
solidly on worthy service, and
quite untarnished by compro-
mise. Certainly, in Engineer-
ing, as in the other professions,
the place one holds at the end
of his career, and the genuine
satisfactions he will enjoy are
largely determined by the cour-
age and determination with
which he maintains his intel-
lectual ideals. It is well for a
man about to make his first venture, to measure the
forces and influences that will be pitted against
him and will tend insidiously to drag him down
to the dead level of mediocrity. It is likewise not
without profit for a man in the midst of the con-
flict to stop long enough to consider how well he is
maintaining the standard of professional achieve-
ment with which he began his work. For both stu-
dents and alumni, therefore. Middlemarch, and
Arrowsmith have a real message.
My first intention was to use the title "Middle-
march and Main Street;" it had such a fine alliter-
ative sound. But Carroll Kennicott in Sinclair
Lewis's novel is a woman; she has, with all her
college background, no very definite or dynamic
ideals; she has no professional career to shape
and glorify in the face of vested interests and
the insidious temptation to lower one's ideals.
Moreover, I always find myself, at the close of a
reading of Main Street, so disgusted with her in
general, that I felt it better to compare Middle-
march with Arrowsmith instead. Here are two
books written nearly a century apart; yet both
present practically the same theme. In each, a
young physician, ambitious to make great con-
THIS is the second of a series
of talks on books which Pro-
fessor Nelson is writing for the
Technic. As he, himself, says, he
is answering for students and
alumni the question of what to
read, with the same consideration
for their particular needs that he
has used in his informal confer-
ences on books in his office dur-
ing the more than twenty years
of his service to the Colleges of
Engineering and Architecture.
—The Editor.
tributions to the development of his profession,
finds his ideals dimmed and his high standards
lowered by the ctrcumtsances of life about him.
The analogy is especially close between Dr. Lyd-
gate's conflict with the clerical influences, the
ignorance, the small-town politics, the intellectual
aridness of life in a small English town and the
experience of Martin Arrowsmith in Zenith,
Wheatsylvania, and Nautilus.
In both cases it was the smoth-
ering of the flame. Both Dr.
Lydgate and Dr. Martin Ar-
rowsmith after fruitless strug-
gle against the malign influ-
ences of their lives achieve
worldly success by compro-
mise, but the apples of joy turn
to ashes in their mouths, and
in their souls they sense the
full tragedy of defeat.
It is interesting to study in
detail the working out of this
common theme in two media
so distinct and different as
England in the nineteenth century and America in
the twentieth. Lewis Sinclair somewhere in his
novel characterizes it as "the biography of a young
man who was in no degree a hero, who regarded
himself a seeker after truth, yet who stumbled and
slid back all his life, and bogged himself in every
obvious morass." One is quite prepared, I feel, for
all the weakness with which Martin meets the
various crises in his career by the capitulation
of his ideal while he was still in college. When
the brilliant insanity of Max Gottlieb's genius
vanished from his faith, and, giving up his yearn-
ing for the laboratory as for a sanctuary, he
decided to be a practical doctor, he has given pro-
phetic evidence of ultimate failure. It is no sur-
prise to find him saying "O Lord, it is easier to be-
come a respectable citizen than to go on fighting."
One feels, I think, that the whole story might
have taken on more tragic values, had the author
had to begin with a man whose professional ideals
were really dynamic enough to have outlasted his
college days. There are some incidents in the rec-
ord that do grip one rather tensely, but on the
whole, the struggle of Martin Arrowsmith is piti-

The Electrical Engineering Laboratory
By James S. Gault
Instructor in Electrical Engineering
THE casual observer on his first visit to the
Electrical Lab is generally not very deeply
impressed by what he sees. Of course there
are quite a number of motors and generators
mounted around on the various stands, but these
look like rather harmless toys. But let a wrong
connection be made, and immediately all the force
of the University Power Plant and back of that the
whole Detroit Edison System is exerted to throw
an annihilating concentration
of power to that point. Usually
a fuse blows or a circuit
breaker opens before the anni-
hilation is accomplished, but
there may be some spattered
copper around to remind him
that things were happening
pretty fast for a short space
of time.
It is not the purpose of this
article to make an inventory of
our laboratory equipment and
facilities, but rather to touch
the high spots here and there
and to discuss briefly its pur-
pose and the uses to which it
is put. The object of our
laboratory is two fold: to supplement the students'
work in the classroom and to permit and promote
various lines of research. There are really four
parts to the Electrical laboratory and these will be
discussed more or less separately.
The largest unit is the Dynamo Lab which con-
tains about fifty motors and generators, including
most modern types of alternating and direct current
machines. In addition there are several groups of
apparatus which deserve special mention. In one
corner of the lab is the dynamometer section which
contains equipment for testing accurately a range
of machine sizes from one-eighth horsepower up
to thirty or more. In another corner is the oscillo-
graph room, and we are fortunate in owning a very
complete set of equipment. There are two General
Electric, three element oscillographs arranged
either for visual or photographic study of wave
shapes. We have also a string oscillograph, by
means of which the wave ripples may be analyzed.
In addition there are two cathode ray oscillographs
which extend the frequency range to almost any
desired limit.
Another noteworthy item is a sine wave gener-

a series on the engineering
laboratories, intended to clear up
many questions which come to
students who have wandered
about them. No one is better
equipped to explain the idiosyn-
crasies of the Electrical Engi-
neering Laboratory than Mr.
Gault, who is familiar with the
history and operation of every
piece of apparatus which may be
found there. Mr. Gault suggests
that any student who may have
any question about the labora-

ator set, which is of interest due to its practically
perfect sine wave of voltage. This is indispensable
for certain types of experimental and calibration
work. In connection with the laboratory is an
instrument room containing a large stock of excel-
lent instruments, also a small machine shop for
keeping equipment in repair and building various
types of special apparatus. The power supply for
the laboratory comes from the University Power
Plant and the Detroit Edison
Company. This is supple-
mented by a thirty kilowatt
synchronous motor generator
set and fifty kilowatt D. C.
generator set which is equip-
ped with a voltage regulator
to give a more constant supply.
This generator is also con-
nected to the car in the Xaval
Tank.
The Calibration Laboratory
is the newest unit and it is still
in the process of being assem-
bled. This laboratory is not
in connection with courses
taught in the University, but
is maintained as an indispen-
sable standardization auxiliary. Into this sanctum
of supersensitive galvanometers and accurate stand-
ards and measuring devices, very few students
come, so not many are even aware of its existence.

How To Go After A Job
By Roy S. Swinton
Assistant Prcfessor of Engineering Mechanics
THE young man occasionally finds it necessary
to hunt for a job. Even though work is
plenty, it is probable that most of us would
have better positions if we had evinced better sales-
manship in marketing our services. In this me-
chanical age of production probably fifty per cent
of the retail price represents marketing effort.
Many college graduates after an expenditure of
several thousands of dollars
fail to spend the effort and
money necessary to make a fa-
vorable presentation of their
case.
It is generally best to ar-
range for a personal interview
when applying for a position.
Employment is a contractural
relation and implies a meeting
of minds which is accom-
plished best by the direct
method.
The employer's time is usu-
ally valuable, so is your own,
and he can not afford to waste
any portion of it on useless
conversation. It is desirable
first to give some small picture
of one's qualifications and background. Having
done this it remains to ask for the position. If one
asks directly it calls for an answer which must be
either yes or no. We all have a certain vanity
which is most pleased when we can say yes, but is
equally displeased when it becomes necessary to
say no. The negative reply is apt to be abrupt
and unkind, withdrawal is embarrassing, and the
clerk at the information desk is warned to keep
job hunters out. If, therefore, one could arrange to
ask a question in such a manner as to avoid the
necessity of the negative answer, he would relieve
the prospective employer of a possible unpleasant
task and probably put him in a frame of mind more
favorable to future approach. This can be accom-
plished after having stated one's qualifications by
asking, rather, for advice as to finding a position
for which he thinks the applicant might be suit-
able. Here is a bit of flattery, for it is a human
weakness to be pleased at opportunities for offering
advice. If the vacancy exists the position will be
just as forthcoming as would result from a direct
question. Should no opportunity exist the case
SENIOR engineers are now
confronted with what seems
to be the greatest problem of
their life—that of getting their
first job. In the accompanying
article Professor Swinton has
analyzed the situation from the
viewpoint of the graduate-to-be,
and has offered some very prac-
tical suggestions upon this press-
ing subject. Senior engineers will
find in this article both a balm
for their worried countenances
and sage advice upon the subject
of securing a job. Undergradu-
ates, too, may scan these words
with a view to use in the future.
—The Editor.
has been so presented as to arouse the interest of
the employer who may become a valued friend in
the line of one's future endeavor. He is probably
better informed as to where such opportunities do
exist than almost any other individual.
The young engineer approaching a contractor is
told that the competitor was low bidder on a job
this morning and will be developing an organiza-
tion for the work. This val-
uable tip is received from a
disappointed bidder who is in
no mood for a direct "Can you
gimme a job, mister?" To the
young engineer it makes little
difference from which con-
tractor he secures immediate
employment. Each organiza-
tion watches its competitors'
as well as its own development
and modern business men are
big enough to be friendly ene-
mies, personal friends, and
keen competitors. Very gen-
erally the advice given by
these men is worth more than
any position that might be at
hand.
In approaching the second employer upon the
suggestion of the first, the applicant must be a
little careful not to convey the idea that he bears
the recommendation of the former. It is only the
truth to say that he comes upon the suggestion of
the first employer, and the entre this gains the
applicant is astonishing, in some cases so cordial as
to be embarrassing. By telling the truth, avoiding
negation, and giving opportunity for expression of
constructive suggestions, valuable contacts are ac-
quired.
It is possible to secure this advice from almost
any number of prospective employers, and having
done so one will usually find on an accidental meet-
ing that they have sustained a genuine interest in
the value of the advice contributed. They may
have further suggestions which indicate construc-
tive thought in one's favor after leaving the office.
Formal applications for positions are usually polite
devices for pigeon-holing a problem of vital impor-
tance to the applicant. The only excuse for such
a form is that it shall be made use of. It is desir-

"Fools Rush in . .
On Monday afternoon. February 18th, the Edi-
tor and the Business Manager of the Technic
reached the decision to go to Detroit and read the
page-proof for the February issue. There was no
time to be lost; it was then 3 o'clock and the train
left at 3:21. They rushed madly out of the office
and down to the corner of East and South U. to
catch a bus for the Station. As the minutes went
by without the appearance of said bus, acute im-
patience took hold of them. At last! They
jumped into the bus at 3:17 and beseeched the
driver to "step on it." He did his best, but the
"old war horse" under his control failed to respond
to the situation. The bus pulled up at the station
at 3:22. and the train had already arrived. Another
wild dash! They came through the station and
out to the tracks just as the train started for Ypsi.
Undaunted, they jumped on the entrance steps of
two adjoining cars and clung to the handles on the
sides of the doors with vise-like grips. As the
train gathered speed, their unbuttoned overcoats
streamed in the wind, and the expressions on their
faces told that the heat losses experienced due to
the extreme cold were very strongly felt. The
door above Ye Editor suddenly opened and an
anxious conductor peered forth, but before he could
speak, the frozen youth had bounded into the car
with a vehemence that almost swept the astounded
conductor off his feet. He dashed through the
coupling between the cars and admitted his frigid
comrade. Together they faced the irate conductor
who admonished them in words of unnecessary
strength. The B. M. struggled with his tin of com-
plimentary Old Golds and did his best to light one
with that "Light a Murad Air;" but his fingers
were too cold, and besides his lighter wouldn't
work. Fortunately, however, the conductor's re-
marks soon ended and our heroes left for the smok-
ing car, where the B. M. finally succeeded in light-
ing his cigarette (?).

TALKS FROM THE DEAN
Food for Thought on Hoover's Election
This month marks an event of particular interest
to our profession; viz., the inauguration of an En-
gineer, Mr. Hoover, as President of the United
States. With the exception of George Washing-
ton, who was trained as a Civil Engineer, this is the
first time in our history that the profession has been
represented at the White House.
To those of you who are going through the first
stages of preparation for your life's work in the Col-
lege of Engineering, the above fact should prove
cause for serious thought. Why was it that, in
spite of perhaps one of the strongest men politically
as an opponent, Mr. Hoover received an over-
whelming majority? There may be, and probably
were, a number of minor reasons, but I venture to
suggest that the one that stands out most promin-
ently was the fact that by training and experience,
he was the man who the majority felt was most
competent to fill the most important position that
the country has to offer. Incidentally, and please
note, he was not originally the favorite of the polit-
ical element of his party, but, in spite of this, they
were practically forced to nominate him.
The United States today is primarily an indus-
trial country, although agriculture is still an im-
portant factor; but even in this field, the applica-
tion of industrial and business methods is becoming
of increasing importance if success is to be achieved.
And as the development of industry depends, in the
ultimate analysis, largely upon men of engineering
training, so the country as a whole may be con-
sidered to be becoming "engineering minded."
The solution of the problems of the country to-
day calls primarily for the application of those prin-
ciples, or attitude of mind, which are perhaps pecu-
liar to the engineering profession, but, and here is
the point I wish to emphasize, not those of the
somewhat narrow-minded specialist in any par-
ticular branch of the profession.
One of the greatest assets of our new President
is his breadth of training and experience. Not only
his well ordered engineering mind, but also his in-
terest in, and knowledge of, other and wider fields
of human thought and world problems, have made
him the outstanding man of his time. Today, and
in the future, more men of his type will be needed
to guide the destinies of the country; not only in
the position of Chief Executive, but in all positions
of Government, both national and local.
Let me urge on each and all of you to do what
you can while here to broaden your outlook on life
generally. Start to take an interest in fields other
than those of your own immediate profession; such,
for example, as those of economics, sociology, his-
tory, philosophy, and art. Have a hobby, if you
like, in which you can indulge yourself in your mo-
ments of leisure, but let it be worthwhile, and one
which will make you a broader man.
And, above all, when you get out into the great
world, take an active interest in affairs outside your
immediate job, and give what you can to the coun-
try as befits a good citizen.

courage clear thought and interest in engineering
affairs. To date you have signified your lack of
desire to make your thoughts known by refusing to
send in a single contribution.

you thoughts in print. Remember Emerson's ad-
vice in his Essay on Self-Reliance, "Whoso would

gather immortal palms must not be hindered by the
name of goodness, but must explore if it be good-
ness. —THE EDITOR
o
Statesman or Engineer?
When he was inaugurated on March 4th, Herbert
Hoover signified his intention, with much pomp and
ceremony, to faithfuly serve the people of the
United States to the best of his ability during his
term of office. Engineering and industrial journals
have recently acclaimed our new President—not as
a statesman, but as an engineer.
The insistence with which these journals have
been singing praises of our President, solely be-
cause he is an engineer, is insidious, to say the
least. Why not adopt the viewpoint that Hoover
has become President through the precise and accu-
rate executive ability which he exemplified as an
engineer, and later when he took active part in na-
tional affairs? His knowledge and intimate under-
standing of national affairs did not come to him
through his engineering practce, but as the result of
years of careful study and work on the solution of
national and international problems.
Many say that it is quite natural that an engineer
should become President in what they have termed
"this engineering age." True enough—but let us
not lose sight of the fact that in order to prepare
for presidential duties, an engineer must obtain an
intimate and complete knowledge of many things
far out of the scope of the field of engineering.
Let us hail Hoover as a great statesman as well
as a great engineer!
—THE EDITOR
o
Engineers—Gentlemen?
For many years prominent engineers everywhere
have been struggling to obtain recognition of engi-
neering as a profession. Here, within our own Uni-
versity, this constant struggle has been very appar-
ent. Success has been achieved here on our campus,
and elsewhere, and today the engineer is every-
where honored and respected. A few days ago
several engineers, most of them Seniors, were very
r'ctive participants in one of the most unfortunate
incidents of the College year.
General comment has been vehement and varied
upon the actions of the students at the recent Michi-
gan Theatre riot. Many are prone to condemn en-
gineers as a whole as thugs, rounders, and in many
still less complimentary terms. These people who
term engineers rowdies are, as a whole, those who
have not taken the trouble to thoroughly acquaint
themselves with the facts of the case.
It is not generally known that the manager of the
Majestic Theatre told the cheering group of stu-
dents who came to his theater with a view to ob-
taining a free show, that he told them to go to the
Michigan Theatre because the doors were wide
open. Also, after the crowd had arrived at the
Michigan the police were responsible for the riot
which followed since they literally threw tear gas
in the faces of the students before any violent ac-
tions had been exhibited. Upon being gassed it was
no more than natural that the students should retal-
iate in the only way which presented itself to them.
The fact that four of the six men who were seized
by the police were Engineers, appears to us as noth-
ing more than an unfortunate coincidence for the
Engineering College. The crowd present during
the height of the riot was generally estimated at
5000; if every Engineer had been present they
would have made up only 30 per cent of the mob.
The men who were seized and apprehended for
their conduct at this unfortunate affair deserve our
sincere sympathy. Not that riotous conduct is to
be complimented, but that these men were unfor-
tunate enough to be the ones who were forced to
bear the brunt of the wrath exhibited by many
members of the faculty when they heard about the
affair.
The attitude of the Student body of the Univer-
sity of Michigan toward the management of the
Butterfield Theatres has been strained for many
years. The recent episode in the annals of our col-
lege has certainly done nothing toward making this
relation more cordial. Let us hope that in the fu-
ture more efficient co-operation will be exhibited
by both the student body and the Butterfield inter-
ests.
o
Study
Too many of us are inclined to make study
wearisome, and, at times, disagreeable. In fact,
the general impression prevails that those students
who have maintained an unusually high scholastic
average are men who can stand endless drudgery;
in the vernacular they are referred to as "grinds,"
"book-worms," and a variety of less complimentary
terms. Is it not possible that these men find gen-
uine enjoyment in study? A slight investigation
by anyone who is skeptical about this matter will
reveal that, to these men, study is at once their
hardest labor, their greatest pleasure, and their
most sincere delight.
The desirability of a high scholastic record is an
established fact, both from a practical viewpoint
and from that of enjoyment in life. Let the rest
of us try to find as much in study as our scholars
do!


The Aeronautical Society's Glider—19/2
The glider which has been recently acquired and
flown by the Aero Society is hailed all over the
campus as an innovation in student activities at
Michigan. Upon poking around in the archives of
the University, it was discovered that an Aeronau-
tical Society was in active existence in the Engi-
neering School as far hack as 1911. It was further
discovered that this Society actually constructed a
glider and made successful flights in it.
The Michigan Daily published the following ar-
ticle on December 11, 1912: "At a meeting of the
Aeronautical Society, held last evening, arrange-
ments were completed for experimentation with the
glider which the club constructed last year. The
machine is now located in the hangar, south of the
city."
"Although several attempts were made last
spring to navigate the atmosphere with the glider,
it was found difficult to raise the machine more
than a foot or so from Mother Earth. This year
the amateur aeronauts are confident that they can
obtain better results, and the initial tryout will be
held in the next few weeks."
"L. C. Wilcoxen, '16E, was chosen as experi-
mental manager for the society at the meeting last
evening. Wilcoxen has had practical experience in
THE O D GLIDER ON DISPLAY IN THE COURT IN
BACK OF THE WEST ENGINEERING BUILDING—1912
glider tests in Massachusetts, and it is expected that
under his direction the local machine can be tempt-
ed to soar on high."
"The other officers elected were: Carl Guthe.
'14E. president: H. C. Drake. '14E. vice-president:
G. F. Wickes. '13E, secretary and treasurer."
THE OLD GLIDER ON ONE OF ITS SUCCESSFUL
FLIGHTS—1912
Many successful flights were made during this
year, although the glider did "crack-up" on a few
occasions.
o
Highway Engineering Conference
February 20 to 23 marked the Fifteenth Annual
Conference on Highway Engineering which was
held at the University under the auspices of the
College of Engineering, the Michigan State High-
way Department, and the Michigan Association of
Road Commissioners and Engineers. This was the
largest Conference of its kind ever held here and
was marked by a registration of well over 00 mem-
bers. The Conference last year had an enrollment
of 584 and this year's session greatly exceeded that
mark. Prof. Morrison of the Highway Engineer-
ing Department was in direct charge of the affair
and much of its success can be attributed to his
untiring efforts.
The Conference was officially opened with a
smoker at the Union on Wednesday, the 20th, and
was featured by a very interesting paper given by
Prof. H. E. Riggs, a talk on the new four-day
transatlantic ships by Dean Sadler, and an illus-
trated talk on travels in South America and the
Orient by Mr. W. V. Alvord.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
The principal speakers of Thursday's sessions
were Mr. Robert Kingery of Chicago, Mr. P. J.
Freeman of Pennsylvania, and Mr. James Schermer-
horn of Detroit. In addition to these men of na-
tional reputation in our own country, the Deputy
Minister of Highways of Canada, Mr. R. M. Smith,
gave a very interesting talk.
On Friday, in addition to the regular meetings,
a special meeting open to the general public was
1 eld in Hill Auditorium and Prof. Hobbs of the
Geology Department
gave an illustrated talk
on "The Greenland Ex-
peditions of the Univer-
sity of Michigan." This
was naturally of very
great appeal and proved
both interesting and in-
structive.
Transportation
Club
Following the mid-
year lull in activities, the
Transportation Club has
been making extended
plans for the second
semester. Speakers for
the remainder of the
\ ear have been arranged
for, and interesting
meetings are in store for
the members. On Feb-
ruary 27th, Mr. Ells-
worth, '05, who is the
head of the Signal De-
partment of the New York Central Lines, gave a
talk which was accompanied by motion pictures on
the "Dispatching of High Speed Trains." Also Hud
Heath. '27, a former Michigan football player,
spoke on "The Buffalo Interlocker." The March
meeting will be featured by the presence of Mr.
K. B. Scardon, who will talk on "The Cleveland
Terminal." It is planned to have Mr. Lorriee.
President of the Delaware and Hudson Railroad,
speak in April on "The Consolidation of Eastern
Railroads." The last prominent speaker of the
year will be C. A. Morse, former Chief Engineer
of the Rock Island Railroad, whose subject will
lie "1 he Chicago Terminal."
o
Aero Club
Having successfully inaugurated its first glider
in January, the Aero Club has been using it con-
tinually since then and will soon have its second
glider in operation. This second one is now being
constructed in the Engineering Shops and will soon
he ready for use.
William R. Hough
Rill Hough is a rather modest
sort of a chap, but, nevertheless,
he is also very capable, and there
have been few happenings
around the Engineering College
during the last four years in
which he has not had a hand.
Bill's high scholarship during
his Freshman year merited his
election to Phi Eta Sigma, his first notable activity of
any kind at Michigan. \ear the close of his Sophomore
year his winning personality had gained him many friends
and he was elected to the presidency of the coming
Junior Class. He was also elected to Triangles. Junior
honorary engineering society. Before he had finished his
Junior year he was elected to Tau Beta Pi, National
Honorary Engineering Fraternity, and was made a mem-
ber of Vulcans, Senior Honorary Engineering Society.
Now in his Senior year Bill is Chairman of the student
branch of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers
and subsequently a member of the Engineering Council.
He was elected to Phi Kappa Phi, National honorary
scholastic society. Bill is a member of Tau Kappa Epsi-
lon, social fraternity.
Some of the more experienced men have been
flying at the gliding field on the Pottawatomie
Trails, but those who are inexperienced in the use
of a glider have been training on the ice on Barton
Lake. The glider has been connected to a car by
means of a long rope and then pulled along behind.
Sufficient speed has been attained so that the glider
has left the ground and thus has given the "greener"
men a chance to become acquainted with the opera-
tion and use of the glider.
Several weeks ago Mr.
Heineman of the Air-
craft Development Co.
at Grosse He made a
flight in the glider. Mr.
Heineman was the first
President of the Aero
Society and so this was
quite an event.
A change has been
made in the officers due
to the fact that C. W.
Koeczny. the former
President, resigned, and
so L. M. Ball was made
acting President and is
now in charge of the
Society.

Camp Davis Moves
to Wyoming
Camp Davis has had
many locations within
the state of Michigan
since 1874. when it was
established. Since 1908 it has been situated on
Douglas Lake, fourteen miles west of Cheboygan.
The surrounding country was not altogether un-
favorable to surveying work at that time and for
several years thereafter, forest fires having de-
stroyed most of the timber. Under University
management, the forest growth has been protected
and the lands have gradually become unsuited for
field work in surveying. The Staff of the Depart-
ment of Geodesy and Surveying has hoped that the
cam]) might be transferred to a country where
trees and brush would not handicap instruction.
This hope was realized on February 21, 1929, when
the Board of Regents approved of the purchase of
a tract of land in Wyoming. As far as our knowl-
edge of surveying camps enables us to draw con-
clusions, this is the first time that lands have been
selected by any university because of their suit-
ability to the field work presumed to be pursued
at such camps.

Rollo G. Manning
MR. K. G. MANNING has been connected
with the Ambridge Savings and Trust
Company since January of 1909 and in
1918 was elected one of its vice-presidents. Dur-
ing this time, though an inactive official, he has
been very closely in touch with the affairs of the
bank and with its growth and
advancement and is therefore
unusually capable to fill the
position to which he has been
appointed in its enlarged offi-
cial family, which the fast
growing business is requiring.
In 1927 Mr. Mannings in order
to devote his entire time to the
Ambridge Savings and Trust
Co., tendered his resignation
as Engineer of the Ambridge
Plant of the American Bridge
Company.
Mr. Manning has been a
resident of Ambridge since
September, 1906. Outside his
duties with the American
Bridge Company he has been a
tireless worker in the civic activities of the com-
munity as a vice-president of the Ambridge Wel-
fare Federation, a trustee of the Laughlin Memo-
rial Library, a trustee of the Methodist Epis-
copal church, a director of the Ambridge Building &amp;
Loan Association for twenty years and its treasurer
during the last fifteen years and a director of the
Ambridge Board of Trade, in fact there have been
few if any endeavors toward the betterment and
growth of Ambridge which have not had his willing
effort and assistance and gained for himself the re-
spect and confidence of the citizens.
Mr. Manning graduated at the University of
Michigan in eighteen hundred and ninety from the
ROLLO G. MANNING
Civil Engineering Department and was given the
degree of C. E. from the same University in 1904.
Since graduation he has been continuously engaged
in the bridge and structural engineering profession
with the American Bridge Works of Chicago, Illi-
nois, the Edgemoor Bridge Company of Edgemoor,
Delaware, the Toledo Bridge
Company of Toledo, Ohio, and
the American Bridge Company
as engineer of the Toledo and
Ambridge Plants. The three
companies first named were
included in the organization of
the American Bridge Com-
pany, which gives Mr. Man-
ning a continuous service of
thirty-seven and one-half years
with the United States Steel
Corporation. He has been en-
gineer of the local plant of the
American Bridge Company
since September, 1906, or more
than 21 years. He is a mem-
ber of the American Society of
Civil Engineers.
Such success as Mr. Manning's career illustrates
speaks well for Michigan training and makes him
one of Michigan's outstanding graduates.

"Control of Fibre
99
How it Builds Endurance in New Departures
THE exceptional endurance of
New Departure Ball Bearings
is explained in part by the
control of the unseen in steel.
One of these hidden elements is the
direction of the fibre in the steel.
Where this is kept parallel to those
surfaces subjected to greater loads,
the endurance life is found to be
greater than where the load is taken
on "end grain" or fibre ends.
By producing bearings by modern
upset forging processes, it is possible
to control the direction
of fibre in the finished
forging. The subsequent an-
nealing process relieves any
internal strains set up in the
steel by forging and the final heat
treatment carried out in automatic
electric furnaces produces the fine
grain essential to the long life of bear-
ings, but neither of these treatments
alters the direction of the fibre.
Add to this superiority over other
anti-friction bearings the use of a
special electric furnace high carbon
chrome alloy steel—the most uni-
formly enduring bearing metal known,
the exquisite precision of every part
and a 250 percent inspection sys-
tem—and you have some
of the secrets of the remark-
able endurance found in

Treason in the Ranks?
At a dancing party held in the law- club a couple
of weeks ago, we have it that no less than a dozen

known that these traitorious men further lowered
the dignity of our Engineering College by imper-
sonating most accurately the type of students who
hail from the other end of the diag. The Oil Can
respectfully suggests that these men be tarred and

worse—that they be forced to enroll in the law

have so flagrantly perpetrated.

"One more unfortunate . . ."
One afternoon last week, on the second floor of
the West Engineering Building, a young lady was
seen coyly powdering her nose in front of the door
to the Dean's office. The writer stared in amaze-
ment—not because the girl in question was pow-
dering her nose, but because the sweet young thing
was wearing a pair of real khaki denim coveralls.
Hurried investigation brought out the fact that this
harmless appearing little girl is an engineer!!!
Think of it, those of you who can bear such a
devastating thought. The last stronghold of mas-
culinity upon this campus has been assailed by one
of the fair sex. Alas! In the future may we
expect to hear, mingled with girlish giggles, such
remarks as this? "Oh, my dear, have you seen the
new orchid coverallettes that Alice is wearing?
You can't imagine how perfectly becoming they
are." Come what may, we are sure that not one
of these feminine engineers can reach the heights of
profanity which are reached by those unfortunate
Mechanicals who have to set the valves on the old
Corliss engine in the M. E. lab.

Resistances as small as one billionth of an ohm can
be measured accurately. One rather important
phase of the work of this laboratory is the calibra-
tion of secondary standards for various public
utilities and other users of electrical measuring
devices in this part of the country. The laboratory
is equipped to make either a quick check against
accurate meters, or, if desirable, a comparison with
the utmost precision against accurately maintained
standards.
The Photometric Laboratory attracts almost as
little attention from the student body with the ex-
ception of the electricals, chiefly because it is a dark
room, or rather several dark rooms. It really con-
tains some very fine pieces of equipment among
which may be mentioned a forty meter photometer
bar. a mirror selector, a thirty inch integrating
sphere, a part sphere, a spectro-photometer with
which colored light may be carefully analyzed into
its constituents, a daylight recorder with a Case
photoelectric cell and a recording potentiometer. To
the photometer equipment has recently been added
a Schmidt and Haensch, Weber Photometer which
is about the nearest thing to perfection in this type
of instrument. In addition, there is a surface light
source equipment of one hundred and eighty square
feet with adjustable dimensions. With this equip-
ment some very fine pieces of daylighting research
have recently been carried out, which are outstand-
ing in the field of natural illumination. Some in-
teresting work is also being done with photoelectric

CAMP DAVIS MOVES TO WYOMING

stone National Park in northwestern Wyoming, has
been considered an ideal location for the cam]) since
1904. when Professor J. B. Davis and the writer
visited that region. The construction of good roads
and the cheapness of automobile travel have
changed the habits of the large majority of the peo-
ple of the United States. Large numbers of peo-
ple travel by automobile from all parts of the
country to the Yellowstone Park each summer,
240.00 visitors having registered there during the
summer of 1928.
The new camp site is located in the valley of
the Hoback River, twenty miles south of the town
of Jackson and about seventy miles south of the
southern boundary of the Yellowstone National
Park. The site is at the southern extremity of what
is known as Jackson's Hole. The camp is reached
1 owing the Lincoln Highway, which para le':.
the Union Pacific Railway from Omaha through
the entire lengths of Nebraska and Wyoming to
Keck Springs, Wyoming, where a splendid road
runs northerly and then northwesterly, crossing
Green River and passing over the divide to the head
waters of the Hoback River. The new camp site
is immediately below the canyon of this river.
The land at the camp site is open, yet it is not a
treeless country. There are enough trees to decor-
ate the hillsides and the banks of the Hoback River.
Forest growth is limited by the water supply and
we know that as time goes on the land will be as
favorable to surveying work as it is now.
While the University will only own 120 acres of
land, an unlimited area of surrounding country—
federal forest lands—will always be available. A
small stream of water, a tributary of the Hoback
River, runs through the land purchased by the Uni-
versity. By installing a pipe line, water can be
delivered to the camp under gravity pressure. The
Hoback River is only a few hundred feet north of
the camp site.
Students taking the work at the new camp will
not only profit by travel to and from Wyoming, but
they will be able to live for eight weeks in the most
attractive section of the United States and have op-
portunities for seeing the surrounding country, the
Yellowstone National Park and many noted engi-
neering structures.
Many tourists find a trip of a week or ten days
rather expensive. This is due almost entirely to
the high rates at hotels which operate for but three
months each year. Students should be able to make
this trip, to see all of the local points of interest
and receive splendid instruction in surveying for
$200.00 or less. Since something like $200.00 is
required by the average student who attends the
University for a period of eight weeks during the
University year, it would seem that those who take
advantage of the opportunity to participate in the
activities of the new camp would be doing much to
improve their training and broaden their outlook.

hours. This is a very remarkable showing. One
pound of "DRY-ICE" will produce the same effect
in refrigerating goods in transit as about 15 pounds
of water-ice, therefore there is a great saving in
space and freight when refrigerated articles are
transported. Also when shipping perishable arti-
cles it is not necessary to use containers on which
return charges must be paid. As a specific instance
of this a package of ice-cream refrigerated with
"DRY-ICE" weighs only about one-fourth as much
as though packed for shipment in the usual man-
ner.
The use of "DRY-ICE" on railroads eliminates
the corrosion of rails due to salt water and also
eliminates the corrosion of the metal parts of the
cars themselves. Rotting of the car insulation is
also prevented. These same advantages hold true
for automobile delivery trucks.
Since there is no water or brine to be disposed
of, simple, inexpensive, throw-away packages may
be used to place ice-cream or food-stuffs in along
with the necessary amount of "DRY-ICE" and the
whole package placed anywhere with no danger of
damage of any kind.
It is interesting to note just what may be accom-
plished by the use of "DRY-ICE." Consider the
ordinary one-pint carton of ice-cream. If this pint
carton of ice-cream is placed inside of an approved
corrugated container and on top of this carton
there is placed one-half pound of "DRY-ICE" in a
paper bag and the package is then sealed with
gummed tape, the ice cream will be kept solid for
about 6 to 8 hours. By following this same pro-
cedure 4 quarts of ice cream may be kept for the
same length of time by the use of 2 pounds of
"DRY-ICE."
When specially designed shipping boxes are used,
20 quarts of ice cream may be kept solid for 96
hours or 4 days, by the use of 25 pounds of "DRY-
ICE."
In railway refrigeration work it is a point of
especial importance that cars do not have to lay
over for re-icing and that the space available for
cargo is greatly increased, and that the time the
cars are in transit is very greatly reduced.
We will next turn our attention to the engineer-
ing aspects of the problem and to the methods em-
ployed at the present time to manufacture "DRY-
ICE" on a commercial scale.
Every student of engineering has seen the pro-
duction of white carbon dioxide snow by allowing
liquid carbon dioxide to flow through a throttle-
valve and discharge into a cloth bag. This is what
is known in thermodynamics as a "throttling-
process" and is exactly analogous to what happens
if a stream or spray of water is allowed to flow into
a region where an absolute back-pressure below
0.1804 inches of mercury or, 0.0886 lbs. per sq. in.
is maintained by means of a very high vacuum
pump, that is to say, a portion of it vaporizes and
the remaining portion freezes into water-ice. It
is on these physical phenomena that the production
of "DRY-ICE" depends.
Let us follow logically the steps that must be
followed in the production of "DRY-ICE."
First we must locate a suitable, continuous, ade-
quate and economical supply of carbon dioxide gas.
We know that we must start out with carbon diox-
ide in the gaseous form because it does not exist
normally as a liquid. The reason for this is evi-
dent when we consider that in order to have carbon
dioxide liquid at, say, 70° F., requires a pressure of
848.7 lbs. per sq. in. absolute. We have previously
noted some of the possible sources of CC)2 gas and
without going into the economics of the situation
it can be said that not every source of COa gas can
be economically used due to impurities, remoteness
from markets, etc. At the present time the carbon
dioxide supply is artificially produced from the
combustion of coke. It is absolutely essential that
a gas of high purity be used and the process about
to be described is the one most extensively used at
the present moment. Use will be made in the near
future of other sources.
Carbon dioxide gas may be produced in very
large quantities by the treatment of various car-
bonates with acid, but this is not an economical
method and is ordinarily used only when a COj gas
of greater purity than 99.5% is needed. This gas
may also be produced in large quantities by the
combustion of coke. If one was concerned with only
the production of the gas the treatment of carbon-
ates with acid would be by far the cheapest supply.
But, unfortunately, obtaining the gas is only a part
of the story; it must be compressed and cooled to
get it into the liquid state and due to the fact that
the heat from the combustion of the coke to pro-
duce C02 may be used to produce power for com-
pression of the gas, the use of coke has, up to the
present time, been found most economical and is
the material used. Enormous quantities of power
are required in the compression process. It is an
impressive fact that in a plant of the best design
the most economical use of all the heat produced
by the burning coke does not yield anywhere near
enough power to separate, purify and-compress, the
C02 so that it may be reduced to a liquid upon
cooling. Economy of power throughout the entire
process is of the greatest importance.
Assuming for the moment that coke is the most
available and economical source of CO., we will see
how the production of CO. gas is carried out in

The new Sullivan Coal Loader is a giant in

sensitive controls. It moves steadily to the
working place, opens great jaws to gather up
coal, and swings its steel tail to load the cars
—with only two men to guide it.
Primarily, the machine consists of a shovel plate,
with a bit-studded roller, and two conveyors. It is
equipped with a substantial frame, and crawler
traction.
Each digging, conveying, and moving member is
independently controlled. The machine forges its
own way into the pile, and the coal is pulled by the
roller, onto the conveyors which deliver it to the cars
in the rear.
These loaders will handle 200 to 300 tons in an 8-
hour shift.

more than a generation, in improving mining efficiency.

the best present practice.
Coke is burned under steam boilers with specially
designed furnaces capable of withstanding high
temperatures. These settings are not provided with
stacks. Forced draft is used and the products of
combustion contain a slight oxygen excess. This
is to make sure that no carbon monoxide or hydro-
gen sulphide are present. The steam from these
boilers operates the steam-driven C02 compressors,
blowers, circulating pumps and other power-driven
equipment required in the operation of the plant.
The products of combustion, after leaving the
furnaces, pass through economizers to reduce their
temperature as much as possible and to recover as
much heat as is possible. The products of combus-
tion leave the economizer at about 302° F., and
show about 17 to 18% of carbon dioxide and about
1 to 2% of oxygen along with inert gases. This
gas is now passed through two scrubbing towers
filled with trap-rock where it is scrubbed with cold
water. This is to remove impurities and also to
cool the gas mixture.
As the washed gases leave the last scrubbing
tower they are picked up by a centrifugal blower
and forced through two absorption towers in series.
The gas mixture is principally carbon dioxide and
nitrogen. These absorption towers are packed with
coke and over this coke a 10% sodium carbonate
solution is allowed to trickle. The carbon dioxide
in the gas mixture is absorbed by the sodium car-
bonate, of which about 70% is converted to sodium
bicarbonate; the remaining nitrogen and oxygen
passing to atmosphere from the top of the second
tower.
This sodium bicarbonate solution is next pumped
to the carbon dioxide generators. These generators
are heated by exhaust steam from the various
pieces of steam driven power equipment along with
additional live steam to a temperature of about
239° F. at which temperature carbon dioxide of
about 99.9 to 99.95% purity is given off. The hot,
regenerated sodium carbonate solution, still having
some bicarbonate, is returned to the absorbing
towers by way of double-pipe heat exchangers
wherein it gives up some of its heat to the cool
sodium bicarbonate solution on its way to the gen-
erators.
The pure carbon dioxide is released under a pres-
sure of about 10 lbs. per sq. in. gage and is cooled
to remove as much water vapor as possible. The
supply of carbon dioxide gas is now available for
use and the next step in the process is to get it into
the liquid form.
We know from thermodynamic considerations
that a gas cannot be liquefied by compression alone
nor by cooling alone, but that it must be both com-
pressed and cooled. Therefore the gas is now
passed into three-stage compressors with intercool-
ers and aftercoolers where it is compressed to a
pressure of about 1100 pounds per square inch gage
and cooled to a temperature below the critical tem-
perature and thus emerges from the condensers as
liquid C02 and is passed into cylinders for storage,
or on into the evaporators to be partially converted
into carbon-dioxide snow.
The next step in the process is to convert as
much of this liquid carbon dioxide into carbon diox-
ide snow as is possible. The method employed is
simply that of allowing the liquid C02 to expand
through a nozzle. As carried out by the simple
laboratory method, about 10 to 15 pounds of snow
are obtained for every 100 pounds of liquid passing
through the nozzle. In the most carefully carried
out commercial practice 33 or more pounds of snow
are obtained for every 100 pounds of liquid passing
through the nozzle. This increased output of snow
is obtained by reducing heat infiltration to as low
a value as possible. The liquid carbon dioxide at
a pressure of 1100 lbs. per sq. in. gage, or more, is
simply allowed to flow through the nozzle into
suitable apparatus to catch the resulting snow. The
snow formation is, of course, due to the Joule-
Thomson effect.
The snow is next periodically removed from the
evaporators and placed into steel molds which are
removed to hydraulic presses capable of exerting
pressures of between 500 and 800 pounds per square
inch with the resultant production of the solid car-
bon dioxide known as "DRY-ICE." The pure car-
bon dioxide which is liberated in the evaporators
is under a pressure of about 10 pounds per sq. in.
gage and after being cooled to remove as much
water as possible is led back to the compressors,
where it is again compressed to a pressure of about
1100 pounds per sq. in. gage.
Figure 1 shows a plant for manufacturing solid
carbon dioxide. Three evaporators are shown with
molds and finished blocks. A press for producing
the blocks of "DRY-ICE" is also shown at the left
of the evaporators.
A few commercial facts will be of interest.
Bureau of Census surveys show that liquid carbon
dioxide in cylinders has an average market value of
10 cents per pound. This price, however, contains
a large item of cost, carriage and depreciation of
the necessary heavy steel cylinders. "DRY-ICE"
can be sold profitably at one-half the price of liquid
carbon dioxide, or 5 cents per pound.
During the summer of 1929 one plant alone will
be producing 60 tons of "DRY-ICE" per day; an-
other plant will be producing 30 tons per day and

grade was a treacherous ten miles of
rocky trail which led out of the Imperial Valley
into the mountains of San Diego, California.
At that time a concrete highway, 20 feet wide
and 7.2 miles in length, was completed. Its ele-
vation variance is approximately 1800 feet mak-
ing an average grade of 7% with super-elevated
curves and a continuous series of alternating
reverses.
Unusual conditions — preparing a grade from
solid rock formation, long haul of materials,
temperature as high as 122° — demanded rug-
ged, dependable equipment. That's one reason
why the Koehring Heavy Duty Shovel did all
the excavation work — traveling over uneven

smaller quantities will be produced from a number
of otber plants.
The present price of "DRY-ICE" is approximate-
ly ten times that of water-ice, but even in the face
of this. "DRY-ICE" is able to find ready sale.
Experience has shown that in the transportation
of ice cream between New York and Philadelphia
200 lbs. of "DRY-ICE" will render the same service
that ordinarily requires 3,000 lbs. of water-ice and

ratio of 15 to 1.
It must be evident that this industry is very new
and one possessing great possibilities. It is another
very notable example of how an old time laboratory
experiment is being applied on a large every-day
scale to produce very important commercial results.

able, rather than tragic. Having given us the
really tragic human figure of Max Gottlieb, Sin-
clair Lewis might have made Martin Arrowsmith
less contemptible, had he taken the trouble to do
so. As a matter of fact, the author's interest lay
so much more in the depiction of the social, moral,
political, educational injustices and inconsistencies,
influences that played so disastrously on Martin's
high resolves, that he failed to make him as great
a human figure as he might. Leona seems much
more real; Martin is too much a puppet of circum-
stance. The book falls short of being a great work
of art in many ways: it is too obviously a thesis,
an expose of wrongs to be righted. It affects the
method of photographic realism by massing of
great detail. One feels, however, that the camera
has caught only the drab and the commonplace:
There is little beauty and too little contrast.
Nevertheless, in spite of its limitations and obvi-
ous defects, Arrowsmith is a profitable' book for
every young man to read who would gauge the
strength of his purpose, and the strength, of his
ideals against the shock of circumstance.
Middlemarch, presenting the same problem in the
life of the human intellect, is a much greater book.
In the first place, it is not a thesis. George Eliot
accepts all the circumstances of life as inevitable.
She is not interested in them as the inforaier. Her
primary concern is in the human factors''of her
story. Dr. Lydgate is a much nobler an&lt;f* more
tragic figure than poor Martin, and Dorothea
Brooke, a shining Saint Theresa, is incomparably
more beautiful than poor little Leona. How clear-
ly George Eliot shows the tragic and human signifi-
cance of her story is best evidenced by the following
quotation from one of the early chapters of Middle-
march: "In the multitude of middle-aged men who
go about their vocations in a daily course deter-
mined for them much the same way as the tie of
their cravats, there is always a good number who
once meant to shape their own deeds and alter the
world a little. The story of their coming to be
shapen after the average and fit to be packed by the
gross, is hardly ever told even in their conscious-
ness; for perhaps their ardor in generous unpaid
toil cooled as imperceptibly as the ardor of other
youthful loves, till one day their earlier self walked
like a ghost in its old home and made the new
furniture ghastly. Nothing in the world more
subtle than the process of their gradual change!
In the beginning they inhaled it unknowingly: you
and I may have sent some of our breath toward in-
fecting them, when we uttered our conforming
falsities or drew our silly conclusions: or perhaps
it came with the virbrations from a woman's
glance."
"Lydgate did not mean to be one of those failures,
and there was the better hope of him because his
scientific interest soon took the form of his profes-
sional enthusiasm."
"Does it seem strange to you that a Middlemarch
surgeon should dream of himself as a discoverer?
Most of us, indeed, know little of the great origina-
tors until they have been lifted up among the con-
stellations and already rule our fates. Each of the
Shining Ones had to walk on the earth among
neighbors who perhaps thought much more of his
gait and his garments than of anything which was
to give him a title to everlasting fame; each of
them had his little local personal history sprinkled
with small temptations and sordid cares, which
made the retarding friction of his course toward
final companionship with the immortals."
Dr. Lydgate's plan for the future, to quote again,
was, "to do good small work for M Lddlemarch, and
great work for the world." How. perfect a phras-
ing of the ambition with which so many of us find
our first places in the world's work! Meantime.
Middlemarch counted orL* Swallowing Lydgate and
assimilating him very comfortably." That was, of
course, just what happened, what so often happens.
An unfitting marriage, professional jealousy, village
gossip, age-long prejudice, the weariness, the depres-
sion that numbs the spirit—these, and a multiude of
other influences against which Lydgate struggles
in a way to move our pity, finally bring him to the
confession of defeat. He says, "I must do as other

WHAT SHALL I READ?

men do, and think what will please the world and
bring money; look for a little opening in the Lon-
don crowd, and push myself; set up in a watering
place, or go to some southern town where there are
plenty of the idle English and get myself puffed—
that is the sort of shell I shall creep into and try
to keep my soul alive in." So at the end one finds
the eager .enthusiastic, clever, philanthropic young
surgeon who had ideas and ideals for the reform
of his profession, a prosperous, famous physician
to wealth}' people. George Eliot's simple com-
ment is eloquent. "But he always regarded himself
as a failure: he had not done what he had once
meant to do."
In both Arrowsmith and Middlemarch the young
professional men achieve worldly success by com-
promise. The books are both definitely depressing.
After reading them one needs the pure, bracing
breath of a book like. The Great Hunger, by Johan
Bojer, where a great engineer heaps up a fortune
and then loses it through circumstances beyond his
control. At the end one finds Peer, old and broken,
laboring at his forge in an obscure country village.
Tragic, heart-breaking! But all the misfortunes of
his life have not touched the courage of his spirit.
These beautiful words are his comment on life as
he found it.
"I sat alone on the promotory of existence, with
the sun and the stars gone out, and ice-cold empti-
ness above me, on every side."
"But then, my friend, by degrees it dawned on
me that there was still something left. There was
one little indomitable spark in me, that began to
glow all by itself—it was as if I were lifted back
to the first day of existence, and an eternal will rose
up in me, and said: Let there be light!
"This will it was that by and by grew and grew
in me, and made me strong.
"I began to feel an unspeakable compassion for
all men upon the earth, and yet in the last resort
I was proud that I was one of them.
"I understood how blind fate can strip and
plunder us of all, and yet something will remain in
us at the last, that nothing in heaven or earth can
vanquish. Our bodies are doomed to die. and our
spirit to be extinguished, yet still we bear within us
the spark, the germ of an eternity of harmony and
light both for the world and for God.
"And I knew now that what I had hungered after
in my best years was neither knowledge, nor hon-
our, nor riches; nor to be a priest or a great crea-
tor in steel: no, friend, but to build temples; not
chapels for prayers nor churches for wailing peni-
tent sinners, but a temple for the human spirit in
its grandeur, where we could lift up our souls in
an anthem as a gift to heaven."
Arrowsmith, Middlemarch, and The Great Hun-
ger, are a strangely assorted trilogy, but, for the
men to whom I am addressing myself through these
pages, I believe they will afford an interesting op-
portunity to make themselves aware of one of the
circumstances of professional life in which for most
of us there is an inherent danger.

friends. The Dean plans to build a main house
with adjoining houses, for guests, and riding stables
for saddle horses. When visitors arrive they will
lie established in one of the adjoining houses with
their personal servants and as Dean Cooler says,
"a good donkey to transport their gear to any part
of the farm they may damn well please to go."
Dean Cooley spoke at the Army and Navy Club
Dinner, which was held at the Union, Tuesday
evening, February 19th. During the meal the
"grand old gentleman," with his precise Van Dyke
beard, his half-moon spectacles, and his ever-
present, winning smile, his face flushed with excite-
ment and his eyes twinkling with enjoyment, ex-
changed greetings with old friends and drew the
attention of all at his table while he related some
incident of his past life, or told some humorous
anecdote as only the Dean can. Occasionally a
distant look would creep into his eyes when an old
comrade would recall some incident of the past, or
reminisce upon former days in the Engineering
College.
Many members of the staff of the Engineering
College were present,—"engineers of defense."
At last the meal was over and the time had come
for the Dean to speak upon his chosen topic, "The
United States Navy of Fifty Years Ago." At the
outset, he said, "When I chose this subject I had
hoped for a cheerful one, but I find that it is not so
cheerful!" Following is the substance of the Dean's
speech:
Fifty years ago, the United States Navy was at
its lowest ebb. During the Civil war we bought
418 ships and built 208. In the year 1879 we had
60 warships, of which only 32 were fit for service.
Congress repeatedly refused to appropriate money
for new ships, although money was appropriated
for the repair of those ships then in the possession
of the Navy. One of the most notable instances of
repair was that of the old Canandaigua; after it had
been repaired, the only original part of the ship
w hich was left was the ship's bell.
All the ships in the navy at this time were of
wooden construction. Of the five first-class steam
ships in possession of the Navy at that time not

one was fit for service; of 27 second-class vessels,
9 were serviceable; 15 of a total of 29 third-class
ships were fit for service; and out of 6 fourth-class
vessels none were ready for service. It is seen from
the above data that the U. S. Navy was in a most
unbelievable state of disrepair. In addition to the
above mentioned ships which were powered by
steam, the Navy had 22 sailing ships, 5 of which
were ready for service and 24 ironclads of which
14 were fit for service, also two torpedo crafts, one
of which was ready for use. Thus, of a grand total
of 115 vessels which were in the hands of the Navy
at that time, only 44 were ready for service.
The hulls of the ships were all built of wood,
usually "live oak." The Dean told of an incident
in which, at the close of the Civil war, one of the
ships had been brought to Detroit to serve as a
training ship; it was found necessary to cut a hole
in the side of the ship in order to install some
machinery, and such difficulty was encountered in
cutting through the oak that pneumatic hammers
were necessary to complete the job.
The Dean told of an incident in which one of
the ships had sailed several hundred miles up the
Amazon River. One day the cross-head on one
of the engines became broken and the connecting-
rod subsequently jammed and became very badly
bent. A spare connecting-rod was not to be had,
and consternation reigned among the crew. At
length a young man (whom Dean Cooley referred
to as "some bright young fellow") worked out a
scheme whereby a forge was installed under the
rod and a large jack was placed above and used
to straighten the rod after it had been sufficiently
heated by the forge fire. After this had been ac-
complished, the ship got under weigh again.
Another interesting incident occurred on the
Powhatan when the nuts worked loose on one of
the cylinder-heads and something became wrong
w ith the piston on one of the inclined engines em-
ployed in the ship. The vessel was in a heavy
seaway and it would have been very dangerous to
remove the cylinder-head in order to repair the
piston. Another "bright young fellow" conceived
the idea of going down into the cylinder from
above, cutting a hole in the piston and making the
repair. He did this very successfully, and put a
patch on the piston where he went through, with
the result that all inclined engines which were con-
structed after that were provided with manholes in
the top of their pistons.
The Dean's first ship after his graduation from
the Naval Academy was the Quinnebaug. During
a test run to discover whether or not the ship had
the required speed for service on the Mediterranean,
the boiler was "pulled" so hard that the Dean (who
was in charge of the fire-room), could hardly read
the gage-glass. He said, however, "we got the
Mediterranean post."
The Dean told of many other incidents (in the
way that only he can), among which were the
difficulties encountered through the use of vegetable
lubricating oil, which was satisfactory for use if it
did not blacken the wick of a lamp when burned
in it. He also remarked upon the difference in age
between the sailors of those days and those of to-
day. When the Dean saw his service on the sea,
the sailors were men "well along in years" and
came from towns along the seaboard; to-day the
sailors are all young men and most of them come
from the inland states.
The Dean also recalled many humorous incidents
of too personal a nature to bear a place in this
article.
The Dean, it seems, is still "sawing wood," but
planning and living in the future, as he would have
every engineer do. May he be with us for many
years to come.

World's Largest Electric Lamp
The world's largest electric lamp, a monster
50,000 watt experimental bulb built recently is like
a radio tube in appearance. At the top of the bulb,
a radiator made of metal fins carries off intense heat
generated by the white-hot tungsten filament, which
has a temperature of 5500 deg. fahr.—twice as hot
as molten steel. The bulb is filled with nitrogen gas,
whose circulation cools it and carries upward into
the radiator evaporated or thrown-off tungsten par-
ticles from the filament, thus preventing blackening
of the walls.
Although the present lamp is intended simply for
a test by its designer such huge lights ultimately
may find use in airport lighting and for the illum-
ination of motion picture studios. — Transactions

Gclliiif/ More Oil Out of the Ground
The recovery or partial recovery of the oil re-
maining in oil sands after the usual methods of
production have become unprofitable is perhaps the
greatest problem in the petroleum industry tiday,
states Ren E. Lindsly, petroleum engineer of the
Bureau of Mines, Department of Commerce, in a
recently issued report. The amount of this oil
remaining in the sand is variously estimated by
those familiar with the subject to be 25 to 90 per
cent of the original content.
The progress made in the oil industry during the
past few years relative to the prevention of evapo-
ration losses; to improvement of cracking proc-
esses, whereby the gasoline yield from many crudes
has been doubled and trel led; to the increased re-
covery of gasoline from natural gas; and many
other developments, remarkable as they are. can
be applied only to that comparatively small portion
of petroleum products which are raised to the sur-
face. A device or process which would cut develop-
ment costs to one-half would probably result in a
much smaller profit to the oil industry, than the
profit derived from an additional 10 per cent re-
covery of the total amount of oil in a pool. Various
methods have been used and many others proposed,
for the increase of oil recovery from normally de-
pleted sands.
In France, oil sands are being mined by means
of shafts and galleries. In other places, notably
the Bradford, Pennsylvania, field, the yield has
been increased by means of water flooding, wherein
water is introduced into the sand to displace oil,
and drive it to producing wells. It has been
claimed that a well planned Hood drive might pro-
duce as much oil from the Bradford field as has
already been produced, thus leaving a residue of
75 per cent of the original amount of oil in the
sand. It has also been estimated that in better
parts of the Bradford field, water Hooding will pro-
duce 6,000 barrels or more of oil per acre in ad-
dition to the 3,(X:0 or 4,000 barrels which have
already been produced by ordinary methods, and
that about 20,000 barrels of oil per acre will remain
in the sand after flooding.
Vacuum has been used extensively in eastern
and mid-continent fields for the purpose of stimu-
lating production, and in recent years the Smith-
Dunn or the Marietta compressed air process has
been used with success in some of the Ohio and
Appalachian fields. This latter process consists in
principle of pumping air or gas into the oil sand,
and hereby artificially restoring in whole or in part,
the propelling force of the original gas.

Pulverized Coal for Marine Purposes
The announcement was made in the September
number of "The Shipbuilder," (British Marine En-
gineering Journal), that the Berwinder Steamship
Co., Ltd., of Liverpool, had placed an order for the
construction of a coal and ore-carrying steamship,
the Scotch boilers of which were to be fired by coal
pulverized on board by special plant. This vessel
will be 400 ft. long, with a deadweight carrying ca-
pacity of 8,000 tons, and she is being built by the
Blythswood Shipbuilding Co., Ltd., of Scotstoun,
Glasgow, to the design and specification of Messrs.
Eplen &amp; Sons, Ltd., of Liverpool. The propelling
machinery, supplied by Messrs. David Rowan and
Co., Ltd., of Scotstoun, Glasgow, will consist of
a set of triple-expansion engines taking steam from
two boilers fitted with superheaters and working
at a pressure of 200 lb per sq. inch, and the speed
of the vessel will be Wy2 to 11 knots loaded.
It is now officially stated that the coal-pulveris-
ing plant will be supplied by Messrs. Clarke, Chap-
man &amp; Co., Ltd., of Gateshead. Special interest at-
taches to this announcement, as the vessel referred
to will be the first designed and built in the British
Isles for propulsion by steam raised in this way. It
will be recalled that the Gateshead firm have al-
ready placed a pulverising plant on board the Blue
Star Liner "Stuartstar," but that steamship, of
course, was not specially designed for using coal
treated in this way.
In the new vessel coal will be fed by gravity from
permanent bunkers into "Resolutor" pulverisers,
each capable if firing one boiler up to 30 per cent
overload. Here it will be crushed in a high speed
impact mill, the fines and the superfines being au-
tomatically separated from the coarse coal and
passed straight to the burners by means of a fan.
At the same time, the coal which is too coarse to
pass over will be rejected and returned to be re-
pulverised. The coal will then pass through a
"Woodeson" Short-flame burner where it will be
thoroughly intermixed with hot air, and combustion
will take place immediately. The pulverisers will
be driven at constant speed by electric motors, and
the feed of coal will be varied by hand. The ad-
vantages claimed for this system are, of course, that
the lowest grade of coal can be used, and even less
of this is required than would normally be con-
sumed, thanks to the much more scientific method
of burning.
Something in the nature of a test of the relative
merits of pulverised-coal installations manufactured
in England and the United States will result, for
when the ship under construction at Scotstoun is
completed in May next it is understood that she will
run in comparison with a similar vessel which is
being built in America and is being equipped to
burn powdered fuel by an American firm.
The service performance of these two ships will
be closely watched not only by marine engineers
on both sides of the Atlantic, but by all who desire
to see the fullest and most efficient use made of
the coal supplies. So many skilled investigators
are now working on the problems connected with
the use of pulverised coal for steam-raising at sea
that there can be little doubt they will be satisfac-
torily solved in the not far-distant future.

Aircraft Lighting to Be Studied
Adequate and proper lighting equipment on an
airplane is an important feature of the design of
commercial aircraft that has a direct bearing on their
safe operation in flying to avoid collision and in
landing to avoid danger of crack-ups. For this rea-
son a suggestion has been received by the Society
of Automotive Engineers that a careful study be
made of this subject with a view to establishing
standardization of airplane lighting equipment and
its arrangement on the plane.
Preliminary tests are in progress by L. E. Ligh-
ton, a member of the standards committee, on com-
mercial airplanes that are being built, with the in •
tention of placing the resulting data in the hands of
a subdivision that will probably be organized.
It is felt, that with the rapid progress made with-
in the last two or three years in the design and
operation of commercial aircraft, the formulation of
definite standards for aircraft lighting has now be-
come a necessity.—A. I. E. E. Journal.

of POWER .
Th
continued industrial expansion of
America depends, in a large measure, upon the avail-
ability of an ample supply of cheap power.
A most efficient Industrial Steam Cycle is coming into
use; a cycle which through the use of high initial steam
pressures provides a source of cheap power for any plant
using steam for processing.
There has been a definite trend toward the adoption
of higher steam pressures in the Public Utility field. Our
intimate identification with this development led to the
realization that the use of high pressures could be advan-
tageously extended to Industrial plants by generating
steam at a pressure sufficiently high to develop theamount
of power required, when the turbines or engines are ex-
hausting at a pressure high enough to meet the steam
needs for process work. The prime movers thus act as re-
ducing valves and the steam serves a double purpose in
its reduction from initial pressure to final exhaust pressure.
The cycle is simple, dependable and economical.
Several installations of this type are already in suc-
cessful operation. Several more are designed and in course
of construction.
This Company has developed, manufactured and in-
stalled all types of steam generating equipment covering
a wide range of pressures up to 1400 lb. per square inch
— and, we are now building units to operate at 1800 lb.
pressure. This will be the highest steam pressure in com-
mercial use in America and the plant in which these units
are being installed, will be the largest steam plant in the
world operating at such a pressure.
The use of high pressures involves many engineering
problems which necessitate close coordination of fuel
burning and steam generating equipment. As pioneers in
the development of complete steam generating units—
both stoker and pulverized fuel fired types—Combustion
Engineering Corporation is in a position to give valuable
counsel to those interested in the economies of high pres-
sure steam.

The New Camp Davis
By Louis E. Winkelhaus, '29E
.4 Surveying Camp Unsurpassed in Scenic Beauty
DURING the next three or four months Camp
Davis will be moved from the site on Doug-
las Lake, near Cheboygan, Michigan, where
it has been located for the past twenty years, to
the famous Jackson Hole Country of northwestern
Wyoming. It
will celebrate
its fifty-fifth
birthday in a
region adapted
to field work in
surveying and
amid surround-
ings which are
almost unsur-
passed for
scenic beauty.
The Jackson
Hole Country
and the area
now included
in the Yellow-
stone Park were
first explored
by John Coul-
ter, a member
of the Lewis and Clark expedition. When the
Lewis and Clark expedition was returning to St.
Louis, they met a party of trappers going up the
Missouri River, at a point near where Omaha is
now situated. Although Coulter had been in the
wilderness for several years, his ardor for explora-
tion had not been satisfied. He joined the trap-
pers and returned with them to the Yellowstone
River. After many adventures with hostile Indians
he joined a friendly tribe in 1807 and with them
ascended the Big Horn River to its headwaters in
the Wind River Mountains. The party went on to
Jackson Hole and then turned north to the coun-
try that is now
embraced in the
Yellowstone
Park. Coulter
finally returned
to St. Louis
where he re-
ported his dis-
coveries and
submitted a
rough map. He
was immediate-
ly classified as
"the American
Munchausen"
and the area
now inclosed
within the Yel-
lowstone Park
was known as
"Coulter's
Hell" for some time. This part of Wyoming re-
mained uninhabited except for a few French trap-
pers and native Indians until after 1850. The first
adequate description of the country was made by
F. V. Hayden, who was engaged for many years in
exploratory work under authority of Congress.
Hayden became acquainted with this section in the
60's, but made most of his systematic investigations

between 1870 and 1880. The United States Geologi-
cal Survey is an outgrowth of the Hayden organi-
zation. Hayden's photographer was a young man
by the name of W. H. Jackson, who later became
one of the great landscape photographers of the
world. Thomas Moran, who later became a famous
landscape painter, was also a member of the Hay-
den party during the 70's. Mount Moran, in the
Teton Range, still
bears the name of
this celebrated art-
ist. The name of
Jackson is perpetu-
ated in the name of
Jackson Lake, the
principal town of
the valley—Jackson
—a nd the val-
ley itself is known
as Jackson's Hole.
Snake River, which
runs through the
Jackson Hole Coun-
try, has its head-
waters in the south-
ern part of the
Yellowstone Park.
It runs into Jack-
son Lake and then
from the lake southerly for about sixty miles, where
it turns westerly, crossing the Idaho-Wyoming
boundary. The elevation of Snake River where it
leaves Jackson Lake is 6,800 feet. At the junction
of Snake River and the Hoback River, sixty miles
further south, the elevation is about 6,000 feet. A
THE HOBACK RIM. LOOKING DOWNSTREAM, WEST-
ERLY. FROM THE SOUTH BANK. THE LAND IN THE
FOREGROUND IS PART OF THE UNIVERSITY TRACT
number of large tributaries flow into Snake River
from the mountains lying east of the valley. The
largest of these is the Gros Ventre. This river
joins Snake River at a point about eight miles
northwest of the town of Jackson. The junction of
these two rivers is not far from the southern boun-
dary of the Teton National Park, which was created
at the last session of Congress.
Three years ago this spring, a remarkable land-
slide occurred on the south side of the Gros Ven-
tre canyon and about three miles east of the val-
ley. A dam 300 feet high, one-half mile wide and
one and one-fourth miles long in the direction of the
river channel was formed by this slide. The
waters impounded
behind this dam
created a lake eight
to nine miles in
length. During the
high water of the
spring of 1927, the
dam was over-
topped and a chan-
nel between 80 and
100 feet in depth
was cut across it.
Seven people were
drowned and much
property was dam-
aged or destroyed
by the escaping
flood and impound-
ed waters. A lake
seven miles long
still exists behind
the remaining part of the dam. The maximum
depth of this lake is nearly 200 feet. It is estimat-
ed that about 150,000,000 cubic yards of earth, rock
and trees were carried into the canyon at the time
of the slide.
The Teton Mountains form the western boun-
dary of the Snake River Valley. Hayden and other
authorities consider them among the most beautiful
mountains in the country. The Grand Teton is
about 14,000 feet high, and Mount Moran, imme-
diately west of Jackson Lake, is about 12,000 feet
high. Unlike many other mountain chains, the
Tetons rise abruptly from a flat country, and it
might be said that foothills do not exist. The Grand
Teton was not scaled until 1898, when W. O. Owen
reached the summit after making unsuccessful at-
tempts during the seven preceding summers. An-
other peak north of the Grand Teton, Mount Owen,
named in honor of Mr. Owen, has not yet been
scaled. Glaciers and snowbanks exist on these
mountains throughout the year. The summits of
the higher peaks are from two to four thousand
feet above the timber line. A chain of lakes lie
along the base of the mountain range. Jackson
Lake is the largest and it is the farthest north. It
is about 9 miles wide along the southern shore, and
from 12 to 13 miles long from north to south. Its
reported maximum depth is over 700 feet. This
lake is used as a reservoir by the United States

Reclamation Service, a dam 35 feet in height hav-
ing been built across Snake River at the outlet.
Leigh Lake, immediately south of Jackson Lake,
with Jenney Lake next in order, form the other
large links of the chain.
While passable roads for wagon travel have led
in and through the valley for more than fifty years,
but little money was spent in highway construction
until the past decade. After automobiles were per-
mitted to enter the Yellowstone Park, good roads
were constructed over the Wind River, Wrasatch
and Teton Mountains, and north and south through
the Snake River Valley. The town of Jackson is
the principal trading point in the valley. Its near-
est railway point is Victor, Idaho, 27 miles to the
west on the Oregon Short Line Railroad. The dis-
tance from Jackson to Moran is 32 miles, and from
the latter point to the southern boundary of the
]&gt;ark, 22 miles. Persons contemplating an automo-
bile trip from Michigan to this section of Wyoming
are advised to follow the Lincoln Highway, U. S.
30, as far as Rock Springs, Wyoming. From that
place a road, "U. S. 187," runs northerly and then
northwesterly to Jackson Hole and the Yellow-
stone Park. This road follows the north bank of
the Hoback River in the neighborhood of the camp
site. The road connecting this highway with the
camp is less than a mile in length.
The new camp of the Department of Geodesy
and Surveying will be located in the valley of the
Hoback River about 14 miles south and 6 miles
east of Jackson; 120
acres of land has
been purchased by
the University,
which will be used,
in part, as a camp
site. These lands
were selected be-
cause of their suit-
ability for field
work in surveying.
They lie just be-
low the canyon of
the Hoback River
and 6 miles east of
Snake River. The
valley lands are not
timbered except for
a fringe of trees
along the Hoback
River and a scat-
tered forest growth on the mountain-side. The
Hoback River runs through the University lands,
and with the exception of a few acres near the
river and on mountain slopes, a truck or automo-
bile can be driven anywhere in the valley. The
camp will be located a few hundred feet south of
the Hoback River on gently sloping ground not
far from the foot of the mountain slopes which
form the southern margin of the valley. A small
stream of water runs from these mountains which
will provide a domestic supply for the camp, under
gravity pressure. The type of buildings erected at

THE FOUNDRY LABORATORY, LOOKING EAST
The Engineering Shops
By Orlan W. Boston, T4E
Professor of Shop Practice
THE value of shop courses in any curriculum
depends on the purpose of the curriculum and
the nature of the shop course. In general,
when one speaks of shop work, manual training is
suggested. This training, in many cases, is based
on exercises of an elementary and limited nature
with little or no background. During the past few
years the shop courses at the University of Michi-
gan have been changed in nature and content with
the object of making them more worth while to
the student. It is, therefore, with pleasure, that
this opportunity to present some of the features of
the courses in shop practice as taught here is made
use of.
While shop courses of a special nature are given
to students in other schools of the university, such
as dentistry and education, the object of this arti-
cle is to outline in a general way those courses for
engineering students. It is prepared primarily to
acquaint one with the laboratories and their uses.
The particular object of shop courses is to per-
mit the students to become acquainted first-hand
with materials. Various types of materials, chiefly
metals, are studied as to their composition, produc-
tion, and treatments: methods of fabrication or
processes of converting them into finished prod-
ucts; and the influence of these factors on design.
Whether in job or mass production, a part is
usually made of a specific material possessing
needed properties. The processes by which that
part should be formed, treated, built up, or worked
may prohibit the use of the most desirable mate-
rial, so that a compromise is made and one less
suited substituted. The economic advantage gained
by using one process instead of another may make
it desirable to use a material less suitable for those
properties but better adapted to manufacture. If
of steel, for example, the part may be forged, cast,
rolled in sheets, or drawn in bars, but the part may
be of steel, cast iron, malleable iron, brass, bronze,
aluminum, or any other of the hundreds of alloys,
each having an indicated best method of working.
The part should be so designed for material and
shape that it is adapted to accommodate manufac-
ture.
These principles are studied in the classroom and
carried out by the student himself in the labora-
tory. In this way skill is acquired, although it is
of secondary consideration. The shop laboratories
serve in the same manner as the mechanical, elec-
trical, physical, or chemical laboratories. Most of
the processes used in modern metal working indus-
tries are demonstrated, supplemented by trips to
nearby plants.

Looking Backward
In August, 1881. Assistant Engineer, U. S. N.,
Mortimer E. Cooley reported at the University of
Michigan to teach engineering. At that time all
engineering courses were taught in six rooms in
the south wing of old University Hall. In October,
Doctor Frieze, then acting president, Doctor Angell
being minister to China, sent for Mr. Cooley and
advised him of the appropriation of twenty-five
hundred dollars for
an engineering lab-
oratory. The money
was to revert to
the state if not ex-
pended before De-
cember thirty-first
of that year. Mr.
Cooley was asked
if he could use this
sum to establish a
mechanical engi-
neering laboratory.
The possibility of
shops was men-
tioned, but the ap-
propriation seemed
insufficient. The
matter was dropped
until November,
when Mr. Cooley
was again called
before the presi-
dent and ordered
to spend the money.
He acquiesced on
condition that the
building cost no
more than fifteen
hundred dollars,
leaving the balance
for equipment.
Professor J. B.
Davis, teacher of surveying and one of the spon-
sors of the appropriation, drew up plans for such
a shop. Construction was started in December and
the building was finished for the second semester's
work. It was twenty-four feet by thirty-six feet,
made of brick placed edgewise and nailed to the
studding, and so was the first fireproof building on
the Campus. It was placed just south of the tower
of the present old shops. I have it, on the best of
authority, that the frost was not out of the ground
until July.
Meantime, a two-horse-power vertical steam en-
gine was purchased, wrought-iron shafting fur-
nished at less than cost, an old lathe, previously
scrapped, was resurrected from the basement of
University Hall, mostly by faith.

A forge was built, an anvil and tools bought, a
twenty-four inch cupola installed, so that the open-
ing of the second semester found the laboratories
completed and the money gone. The foundry was
located on the first floor at the east end. The cupola
was adjacent to the centrally placed brick chimney.
The forge shop was located in the west end of the
first floor. The second floor housed the woodwork-
ing and machine tool laboratories.
Heat was supplied by an old stove on the sec-
ond floor, next to
the chimney, later
improved into a
combined vapor
system by heating,
on the top, a pail of
water which froze
overnight.
The second se-
mester saw the
shops formally
opened, with Mr.
Cooley instructor in
forge, machine, and
pattern shop, in ad-
dition to his other
duties in the class-
room. Mr. Robert
Winslow was ap-
pointed instructor
in f oundr y, and
held that position
until his death. The
first class in forge
shop was six senior
civil engineers—
they were all civil
then.
M r. Cooley
watched them enter
the laboratory, and
wondered what, in
this world or some
other, he would do with them. They had had a
course in metallurgy and knew the chemical com-
position of metals, so Mr. Cooley sent them to a
wagonload of scrap in the corner, with orders to
pick out a piece each of wrought iron, cast iron, and
steel. The failure was one hundred per cent. This
gave Mr. Cooley an opportunity to lecture for the
balance of the period and avoid calling on his slen-
der talent at the anvil.
In 1883, a second unit was added, a wooden struc-
ture housing the wood and pattern shops. This
occupied the position of the present old foundry.
In 1885, the third three-story unit was added, from
which the forge, machine, and wood shops were re-
moved to the East Engineering Building five years

THE NAVY ZMC-2
A METAL CLAD DIRIGIBLE
By Frank N. M. Brown
Assistant Professor of Aeronautical Engineering
THE Navy metal-clad airship project that has
been under way for a number of years on a
contract let to the Aircraft Development Cor-
poration at Grosse He has been an object of more
than a little interest ever since its inception. Now
that an actual airship, embodying Mr. Upson's
ideas, is nearing comple-
tion, it is only to be ex-
pected that this interest is
intensified, and everyone
even remotely concerned
with lighter-than-air craft
is waiting with some im-
patience for a trial flight.
The reason for this in-
terest is the very unique-
ness of the design. No new
principles are involved;
the originality in the de-
sign lies rather in a new
combination of conven-
tional practices. The de-
partures are, however, rad-
ical enough to give rise to
conjecture and criticism.
The major departure
from conventional design
is, of course, the metal bag
or container for the gas.
On conventional designs
of the size of the metal-
clad craft it is usual prac-
tice to make them non-
rigid. That is to say, the
bag is built up of rubberized fabric of two or three
ply and the car is swung beneath on cables attached
directly to the bag by means of large patches. The
shape of the bag is maintained by means of internal
pressure.
It is obviously impossible to use the same type
of construction with a metal bag the thickness of
which is only eight thousandths of an inch because
of the relatively small deformation before a per-
manent set takes place in the metal, giving rise to
local wrinkles that may develop into tears demol-
ishing the whole bag. For this reason an entirely
new type of structure has been used, consisting of
the conventional transverse frames of the rigid
STERN SECTION OF DIRIGIBLE FROM CAT-WALK
types at intervals along the length of the bag and
longitudinal girders running from the bow to the
stern of the bag. The transverse frames are riveted
to the longitudinal girders and the skin, or thin
metal of the bag, is riveted to both. There are no
longitudinal diagonals. This is obviously a depar-
ture from any conventional
practice. The structure can
not be called rigid, since
there are no diagonals to
take the vertical shear. If,
however, the skin is includ-
ed as a part of the struc-
ture, as indeed it should be,
then the system has a
measure of rigidity, but
even so does not approach
that of a conventional rigid
ship such as the "Los An-
geles." To overcome this
deficiency, it is necessary
to maintain internal pres-
sure-—between 7/100 and
and 1/10 lb. per square
inch gauge—at the bottom
of the bag. This is consid-
ered sufficient to maintain
the shape of the bag and to
insure rigidity.
The car is attached to
two of the circular frames,
and the control surfaces
and ground handling equip-
ment is also attached to
circular frames within the structure.
Actually then, this new ship is neither a rigid nor
a non-rigid, but a different type entirely, embody-
ing some of the principles of each.
The machine which made the construction of a
metal bag possible is of especial interest, since it
is obvious that the placing by hand of enough rivets
to make a seam gas tight would be prohibitively
expensive. The machine developed for the purpose
of sewing or riveting the circumferential strips of
"Alclad" together places three rows of 1/32 rivets
%" apart. In each row the rivets are spaced 3/16"
apart, the middle row being staggered. After the

THE CONQUEST OF THE SOIL
AN increasing interest in the local traditions of
t-\ our country has been evidenced in a number
of ways during the last twenty-five years.
Even in our smaller towns, historical societies have
busied themselves gathering and treasuring pathetic
little tokens of earlier days and making records
of memories fast fading in the minds of the older
generation. An epidemic of pageantry has spread
into the middle west. As ob-
scure little towns have come
to their centenaries, historical
pageants have been fashioned
from often the most meagre
traditions and have been staged
in all but impossible settings.
All this vivid community inter-
est in the past, this sudden re-
alization that, young as we are,
we have a background of
human history against which
to see our present American
life in some perspective and
has found abundant expression
in our contemporary literature.
Hundreds of books have been
written by men and women who have attempted
to make the past live through their pages and thus
preserve the records for future generations.
Much of this literature, in the nature of the case,
has no permanent value: it has been crudely done,
or has been done for commercial gain; it is interest-
ing only as an evidence of a new pride in our past
and an appreciation of the possibilities of our tra-
ditional and historical material. Among the books
which would seem likely, however, to find a per-
manent position in our American literature there
are two which I would like to commend to
those who would understand what the conquest
of the virgin soil cost our forefathers. They are
Hamlin Garland's "A Son of the Middle Border,"
and Rolvaag's "Giants In The Earth." The first is
the autobiography of a man of pure American an-
cestry, by which one means Scotch-Irish and Eng-
lish, bred on the soil for half a dozen generations.
The second is a novel written by a Norwegian im-
migrant in Norwegian, which came to us in trans-
lation only after it had gained wide recognition in
Europe as a contribution to contemporary Nor-
wegian literature. Yet, strangely enough, both
books have many striking points of similarity:
both present the pioneer as a heroic figure moving
through epic sequences of hardship and superhu-
man endurance. Hamlin Garland describes him

thus: "The men and women of that far time loom
large in my thinking, for they possessed not only
the spirit of adventure but the courage of warriors.
With the hearts of woodsmen and the fists of sail-
ors, they were precisely the type that appeal to the
imagination of a boy. Hunters, athletes, skilled
horsemen, everything they did was to me heroic."
To Rolvaag, the simple Norwegian immigrants
who faced the loneliness of the
prairies, undaunted by blister-
ing summer heat and frightful
winter cold, by blizzards, by
devastating clouds of locusts,
were "Giants in the Earth."
They are like the huge heroic
figures in old Norse sagas.
Both books agree in their
emphasis on the privations
and hardships of pioneer life.
To Hamlin Garland the mem-
ories of his boyhood and his
early manhood bring a sad-
ness and depression that is
only relieved by the sweet re-
membrance of his family ties. To Rolvaag the
whole adventure is tragic. His story moves from
beginning to end with a sense of inevitable trag-
edy: its mood is somber, fatalistic. Yet in both
there is a poetic sense of beauty that shines through
the narrative like sun through mist. "Late in
August," says Hamlin Garland, "my father again
loaded our household goods into wagons, and with
a small herd of cattle following, set out toward the
west, bound again to overtake the actual line of
the middle border." "This journey has an unfor-
getable epic charm as I look back upon it. Each
mile took us farther and farther into unsettled
prairie until in the afternoon of the second day we
came to a meadow so wide that the western rim
touched the sky without revealing a sign of man's
habitation other than the wood in which we trav-
eled."
In Rolvaag's novel the prairie is almost as great
a protagonist in the story as is Egdon Heath in
Hardy's "Return of the Native." It is a beautiful
but malign presence always brooding over the
scene, ready to strike with snow or hail or wind
or plague the pigmy band huddled on its limitless
space. "An endless plain in Kansas and Illinois, it
stretched far into the Canadian north, God alone
knows how far: from the Mississippi River to the

The Aeronautical Society—1909
In the March issue of the Technic, an article-
appeared in the College Notes section, entitled
The Aeronautical Society's Glider—1912. Word
has just been received from Oscar R. Blumberg,
an alumnus of the class of 1912E, informing us
that an Aero Society was in existence as far back
as 1909. Following is a clipping from the Michigan
Daily in 1910:
"Today is the day when the glider flies—that is,
provided the wind is a mild 'sou'easter,' the weather
not too cold, the aviators in a daring mood, and the
apparatus in good trim. Truly, there are still many
'ifs' connected with the bird business.
"'W e are going to make a flight Saturday if it
is at all possible,' said Oscar R. Blumberg, '12 E,
president of the Aeronautical Society. 'Our ma-
chine is not constructed to stand every weather
condition, however, so we cannot make definite
statements that the big show will certainly be held,
rain or shine. The wind plays a large part in
glider flights, and anything but an easy eastern
breeze will scarcely fill our needs.'
THE AERONAUTICAL SOCIETY AND THE GLIDER—1910
"Today's flight, 'if it occurs, will take place at
the hangar directly across the railroad tracks from
Ferry Field. It is uncertain whether the flight will
be attempted in the morning or afternoon, the
weather man being again a prominent factor in this
matter."

Aeronautical Department
Thirty students of the Aeronautical Department
made a very interesting trip to Grosse He to ob-
serve the construction of the ZMC-2, the Navy's
latest experiment with lighter-than-air craft, which
is being fabricated by the Aircraft Development
Corporation of Detroit. Arrangements for the trip
were made by Professor Felix W. Pawlowski, head
of the department, who accompanied the men to the
hangar. The event will be a memorable one to the
students, as the airship is the first of its type ever
constructed, and, if successful, will probably be
common in a comparatively short time. The stu-
dents were shown about the hangar in which the
ship is being built, and were given information
about the oustanding problems encountered in its
construction. Much valuable information, both in
design and methods of construction, was obtained,
since the ship is a radical departure from the con-
ventional semi-rigid airship. Many novel features
are incorporated in this unusual ship, the most out-
standing thing being the use of the whole envelope
as the only gas cell, while this same envelope forms
the hull of the craft. The ZMC-2 is designed pri-
marily as a training ship, and will prove invaluable
for this type of work because it is much sturdier
than the fabric covered ships now used, its all metal
construction insuring much better strength and
durability. The ZMC-2 will be ready for its trial
flight some time toward the latter part of April. o
Tau Beta Pi
Mr. Elmer A. Sperry, internationally known for
his accomplishments in science and engineering,
has been elected to membership with distinction by
Tau Beta Pi, national engineering honor society.
Only one other man, Captain Ralph Earl, now
president of Worcester Polytechnic Institute, has


Page 13

heretofore been honored with this membership.
The initiation of Mr. Sperry took place at a large
meeting of Tau Beta Pi alumni in New York on
April 18, at which time Professor A. D. Moore, of
the University of Michigan and National President
of the organization, spoke.
Mr. Sperry is perhaps best known for his devel-
opment of the gyroscopic method of obtaining
equilibrium, both
in ship and aeroplane
stabilization. The
famous inventor and sci-
entist has not confined
his activities only to one
line, but has contributed
a great many valuable
ideas to physics, chemis-
try, electricity, and engi-
neering in general, hav-
ing over four hundred
patents in the United
States and Europe, and
being twice honored by
foreign governments.
Mr. Sperry is exceeding-
ly well known in engi-
neering circles and has
membership in most of
the leading scientific
organizations of this
country.

have totally avoided the
traditional "bay-window."
Jack's first activity on the
Michigan Campus came through his election to Phi Eta
Sigma, Freshman honorary society.
During his Sophomore year he was elected Chairman
of the Social Committee of the Class of 1929, and was
subsequently Assistant Chairman of the Soph Prom Com-
mittee. He also proved himself quite a swimmer and
earned his "A M A."
During his Junior year he was elected to Triangles,
Junior Honorary Society, and to Web and Flange, Junior
Honorary Civil Engineering Society. He joined the Stu-
dent Branch of the American Society of Civil Engineers
at this time.
During his Senior year he was elected to Tau Beta
Pi, and became Corresponding Secretary. In addition, he
was elected to Vulcans, Senior Honorary Engineering
Society, and to Phi Kappa Phi, National Honorary
Scholastic Society. He is on the Invitation Committee
of the Senior Class.

Scabbard and Blade
The Michigan chapter of Scabbard and Blade,
national honorary military society, held an hon-
orary initiation for Col. Henry W. Miller, head of
the Mechanical Drawing Department, and Col. A. H.
White, head of the Chemical Engineering Depart-
ment. The initiation preceded a banquet held at
the Union on Wednesday evening, March 13th.
Professor White and Professor Miller, as thev are
better known by the campus, both served in the
Ordnance Department during the war. Professor
Miller had charge of the large guns during the
war; his experiences are related, in part, in a book
written by himself, "Shellfire," which will be re-
leased from the press sometime during the summer
months. Prof. White was, as might be expected,
connected with the Chemical Warfare Division of
the service. He was placed in charge of the Chemi-
cal Warfare Laboratories at Washington, D. C,
when the war ended.
Election of officers was held at the beginning of
the new semester. C. B. Moyer was elected presi-
dent, T. M. Cooke Vice-President, T. M. Rogers
Treasurer, and Fred Fention Secretary. The chap-
ter is underwriting the Military Ball again this
year, and from all prospects it looks as though the
"army" is due for a real skirmish on the waxed
floor Friday night, April the 26th. A limited num-
ber of tickets are available for the general campus,
and may be procured through members of the
society.
Competition in the inter-chapter rifle match is
especially keen this year, and the "firing squad" has
finished its shooting with a very creditable record,
emerging from the fray with an average of about
three hundred and sixty out of a possible four hun-
dred points per man. The team, coached by Lieu-
tenant H. B. Turner, has done much better than
last year, and prospects for a good placement in the
national contest are very favorable. The men who
have so effectively wielded the shooting irons under
the captainship of Jack Haldane are: C. C. Moyer,
Paul Meister, C. E. Staff, and H. L. Scofield.
Industrial Engineering
Representatives, who have visited the various de-
partments of the Engineering College seeking
graduates for future employment with their respec-
tive companies, report that a large proportion of
the men inquire about the possibilities of getting
into plant management, although they have not
taken any parallel work here at the University. It
would seem from the questions of these graduates
that there is considerable unfamiliarity in regard
to what constitutes the field of Industrial Engi-
neering. The activities of the Industrial Engineers
here at the University should serve as a very en-
lightening illustration of the extent to which indus-
trial engineering has developed into a distinct en-
gineering field, and also guide students in their
selection of courses.
At the present time degrees are offered in five-
year Industrial Courses by the Mechanical, Elec-
trical, and Chemical Departments of the Engineer-
ing College. Essentially these courses embody the
training offered in straight Mechanical, Chemical,
or Electrical courses plus a year's work in the field
of Business Administration. The training in the
basic engineering sciences gives the Industrial En-
gineer that characteristic, straightforward engi-
neering mode of problem attack, as well as a sound
foundation of engineering principles upon which to
ground his administrative effort.
Along with this basic technical training the in-
dustrial engineer studies management and admin-
istration. Following a preliminary study of the-
oretical economics, accounting, statistics, and labor
problems, courses in factory management, organ-
ization, personnel, marketing, forecasting and bud-
geting, and finance are included. Through these
courses, some of which are devoted to plant stud-
ies and trips, the embryo engineer obtains a rather
intimate knowledge of the problems encountered in
the administration of an industry.
A group of industrial engineers who realized that
their ultimate goal was quite distinct from that of
their brother engineers, and to secure a still more
intimate contact with industry, organized the In-
dustrial Engineering Society. To date the society
has not affiliated with any of the national industrial
engineering societies, but has enjoyed a very rapid
growth. There are now nearly twenty-five mem-
bers, through whose co-operation and effort a very
interesting and valuable series of programs have
been arranged.
At each meeting some prominent man has been
secured to talk on some phase of industry. This
talk has usually been followed by a very informal
discussion of the evening's topic. Prof. Ford of the
Psychology Department, spoke on the subject of

TALKS FROM THE DEAN
Contacts
Judging from many years' experience, I think it
is safe to say that the average boy, who has made
up his mind to become an engineer, and to enter an
engineering college, has one all-absorbing ambition
—to get into work of a technical nature as soon as
possible. In many ways a laudable ambition, it is
one nevertheless hampered by the fact that he does
not possess a real conception of what a Technical
Course in its broadest sense actually means.
Every course in the engineering curriculum can
be construed as a Technical Course, if we use the
word in the sense that it is part of the preparation
for a well-educated engineer. If it is absolutely
essential that an engineer should be able to write
good English in order to make a success of his
career, then English is just as much a technical
course as one in the Steam Engine, or Electrical
Machinery. The same argument could be made for
other courses," such as Mathematics, Physics, Lan-
guages, etc., which a man usually takes in his first
two years in the engineering college.
I have referred to the above fact not for the pur-
pose of elaborating upon the importance of any par-
ticular course, but rather as an introduction to a
broader subject; namely, the value of Contacts with
things other than those which are usually looked
upon as being of an absolutely essential or engi-
neering nature.
In the first two years, particularly, and also later
on in the curriculum, there is a chance to come in
contact at least with such subjects as have already
been mentioned, and probably others. It cannot be
expected that a man would become an expert schol-
ar in English or a foreign language in the short
time available, but nevertheless, if approached with
the proper state of mind, and perhaps emphasized
by the fact that he may need a knowledge of these
later on, the contact with such things is a valuable
experience in broadening a man's outlook.
Even if nothing more is gained than an apprecia-
tion for and interest in other things than those pure-
ly engineering, the time so spent in forming the ini-
tial acquaintance of the same may prove of ines-
timable value in future years.
Another contact outside of the purely University
work, and one that should be cultivated, is that of
association with one's fellow students. A wide
circle of friends with different ideas or ideals cannot
help but broaden a man's outlook on life. Whether
we like it or not, the fact remains that ever since
men began to collect together in groups, communi-
ties, or nations, the necessity of living with, and be-
coming a part of, some social organization, and con-
forming to the accepted usages of the same, has be-
come paramount. It may be that certain social
customs and methods appear irksome to the young
and vigorous individual, and he feels that he ought
to show his independence; but the fact remains that
when he starts his work in the great world, and for
the rest of his life, he is practically compelled to fol-
low some institutional laws, whether it be in a com-
mercial organization, a profession, or as a citizen.
The human side of industry is one that is occupy-
ing the attention of its leaders, as much as, or even
more than, some of the more technical or business
problems. A knowledge of the other man's ideas,
and a sympathetic feeling for the same, as opposed
to the purely selfish attitude, is something the value
of which cannot be over-estimated. Even the con-
tact with some of the professors may mean much,
if a man is willing to see in them things other than
merely teacher and student association.
An active, but not necessarily all-absorbing, in-
terest in student activities is another valuable con-
tact. Class officers, music, societies, dramatics, col-
lege publications, or athletics, form a valuable group
from which a man may select a field suited to his
particular temperament, and from which he may
obtain something that will enrich his university
education.

Purpose
The cause of most suicides seems to be that life
was not worth living, that the value received from
life was not worth the effort. Those who find
life not worth while are those who have no purpose
in their lives. Purpose may be compared to the
drop or descent that urges water to flow. When
there is a strong drop in the course of a stream, the
water runs swiftly and strongly. When there is
no drop, the stream runs slowly and sluggishly.
So it is with the life of a man. The man who has
a strong purpose to spur him on is a doer of tasks.
We recognize him by his industry, alertness, and
decisiveness. He must direct his efforts toward the
fulfillment of his purpose. A man with a purpose is
really alive and has a joy and an interest in life. Just
the opposite is true of the man without a purpose.
He has no urge to do things. Aimlessness pervades
his life. Why should he do things with no object
in view? It is far easier for him to "sit back and
let the rest of the world go by."
The sooner a man or student conceives a purpose
to direct his actions, the better are his chances of
not wasting his time or efforts. Of course, not
everyone is fortunate enough to be able to form the
main purpose of his life in his earlier college years,
but the student can form minor purposes for his
actions that would prevent their being aimless or
dilatory. The important thing is to spend some
thought and reasoning on every decision. These
minor purposes will unconsciously lead to the
formation of one guiding purpose in life.
The purpose should be worthy of the man. The
danger lies not in forming a purpose that would
be hard to follow through to its ultimate objective,
but rather in conceiving an unworthy purpose.
Even if the purpose cannot be completely followed,
in the striving and effort made great things are
accomplished. Columbus' great purpose was to dis-
cover a westward route to the Indies. He failed,
but in his efforts he discovered America. As
Browning says, "A man's reach should exceed his
grasp, or what's a heaven for?"

Broadening the Engineer
For many years, the impression has been general-
ly prevalent in educational circles that the engi-
neer in general receives a very narrow education.
Its scope, they would have one believe, never passes
heyond the bounds of gears, motors, transits, and
test-tubes; in short, it is their belief that engineers
are nothing more than glorified mechanics. To
those persons, learned and otherwise, who refer
to the Engineering College as "The Tin Shop," this
editorial is written.
It has been said that most misunderstanding
arises from ignorance. In their treatises on argu-
mentation men of letters offer as the first item to
be considered in any oration the item of definition
of subject and the terms relating to it. The great
majority of those who bemoan the lack of scope in
an engineering education have not taken the trouble
to determine what the engineer actually does learn
in his four years at college. True, he does not
learn the details of the march of events of the
world, but he does learn the important messages
that history has to convey to man; the significance
and bearing which past events have upon the pres-
ent is ever before him. The ability to say what he
wishes comes to him spontaneously in his report
writing; he views rhetoric from the practical side
instead of the proofreader's. He looks upon liter-
ature, especially the great classics, as a pleasure to
be enjoyed in leisure hours; letters, he justly be-
lieves, are a secondary matter in the march of civil-
ization.
The engineer's training gives him a keen mind,
skilled in analysis and synthesis. His knowledge of
natural laws puts him "on speaking terms with
nature." The ability he develops to see ahead and
act accordingly equip him for life's battle in a way
that is unsurpassed in any other college educa-
tion. In short, the scope of an engineering educa-
tion is so broad that it appears invisible to the
casual observer.

The May Issue
The next issue of the Technic, May. will present
an innovation in Technic cover designs. The
cover will appear with a specially designed make-
up on a colored background. It is intended to
change the color of the background of each issue.
It is sincerely hoped that it will meet with the favor
of Technic readers, both students and alumni.
A few changes in the interior make-up are also
contemplated. Several new sets for department
heads and titles for articles will be given a trial.
These new additions are but another milestone
in Technic progress which have been continually
appearing since 1882.

Theodore H. Hinchman
A T the head of one of the largest firms of its
L\ kind in the country is a man of great engi-
neering ability; a man who was responsible
for the erecting of such structures as the Intra-
mural Sports building and Yost Field House at the
University of Michigan, and the Penobscot Build-
ing and the Union Trust Building at Detroit. In
every day speech: he is a
REAL engineer. He is a man
who began his career as a
draftsman, advanced from this
to consulting engineer, then to
partner in a firm engaged in
consulting engineering prac-
tice and electrical contracting,
and finally to the position of
executive of a great firm en-
gaged in architectural and en-
gineering work.
The engineer referred to is
none other than Theodore H.
Hinchman, executive and
treasurer of the firm of Smith,
Hinchman and Grylls, with
offices on the eighth floor of
the Marquette Building, De-
troit.
Mr. Hinchman was born in
1869 at Detroit. He attended the public schools of
Detroit and was graduated from the Detroit High
School in 1887. The following fall he entered the
University of Michigan. He received the degree of
Bachelor of Arts in 1891 and entered the Mechani-
cal Engineering Department of the Engineering
College the next September. He was graduated in
1893 with the degree of Bachelor of Science in
Mechanical Engineering.
Following graduation, he became an assistant to
the then Professor Mortimer E. Cooley. He helped

Harold Brooks Winchell, chief
engineer of the John W. Brown
Manufacturing Co., died Thurs-
day, Feb. 7, 1929, at his home,
1871 Coventry Road, Columbus,
Ohio, after a three months' ill-
ness. He was 34 years of age.
Funeral services were conducted
in Columbus, after which his
family went to Northampton,
Mass., his birthplace, where the
burial took place.
Mr. Winchell was a member of
Tau Beta Pi while at the Univer-
sity, and also of the Society of
Automotive Engineers. He leaves
a wife, Mrs. Marion Winchell,
and three sons, Robert, William,
and Richard.
Professor Cooley design heating plants for state in-
stitutions which Mr. Cooley was preparing at that
time. He also did drafting work. In 1889 he had
charge of the appraisal of the Detroit Street Rail-
ways, and from 1900 until 1905 he had charge of
the appraisal of Public Utilities for the State of
Michigan. He also took part in the appraisal of
Public Utilities for the State
Tax Commission and the At-
torney-General.
When he left Dean Cooley
in 1895 he began work as a
consulting engineer for the
Jesse M. Smith Company, in
Detroit. Later, he and H. G.
Field formed an engineering
business all their own and the
firm was called Field and
Hinchman. Mr. Field was
graduated from the College of
Engineering of the University
of Michigan in 1893 with the
degree of Bachelor of Science
in Electrical Engineering. The
business of the firm of Field
and Hinchman consisted in
consulting engineering prac-
tice and electrical contracting.
For many years this firm was connected with the
Detroit School Board.
In 1898. Mr. Hinchman went to the Spanish-
American War. He served as chief machinist in
the United States Navy in Dean Cooler's crew. In
1903 the firm of Field and Hinchman was com-
bined with the Mortimer Smith and Sons firm.
Field, Hinchman and Smith was the name given
to the combined firms.
Tn 1907 George Field left the firm to go to Cali-
fornia and the present organization, called Smith,

Hinchman and Grylls was formed. Mr. Smith has
to do with the building contracting, Mr. Grylls is
the architect, and Mr. Hinchman is the engineer,
the man who is responsible for all the engineering
work of the firm. Among the structures built by
this firm are the Penobscot Building, the J. L. Hud-
son Building, the Michigan Bell Telephone Com-
pany Building, the Morrel Street Lighting Plant
for the Public Utilities Commission, and the Union
Trust Building, all in Detroit. The erection of the
Yost Field House, the In-
tramural Sports Building,
the East Engineering Build-
ing, the Chemistry Building,
and the Campus Power
Plant, all at the University
of Michigan, were super-
vised by this firm. The Sec-
ond National Bank at Sagi-
naw, a beautiful structure,
was also built by Smith.
Hinchman and Grylls. The
Union Trust Building, just
recently completed, is a
most wonderful piece of en-
gineering skill. Ninety per
cent of the work on a build-
ing of this type is essentially
for the engineer.
Mr. Hinchman was an ex-
cellent student at the Uni-
versity and has always been
interested in the cultural
side of engineering. He be-
lieves that an engineer
should be well trained in
cultural subjects as well as
along engineering lines, and
he provides a very good example of the cultured
engineer. Mr. Hinchman has made several trips to
Japan, Italy, and many other countries with a view
of studying the culture of the country as expressed
in their engineering and architectural work. He is
a member and an active participant in the Literary
Society in Detroit. Speaking of Mr. Hinchman's
interest in literary subjects, it might be well to
call to mind that before entering the Engineering
College Mr. Hinchman first secured his Bachelor
of Arts degree. The story is told about Mr. Hinch-
man that some years ago a man who planned to
have a large factory built in Detroit asked Dean
Cooley to recommend an engineer for the job. Dean
Coolev asked him, "Why not Hinchman?" "Hinch-
man?" the man replied. "Hell! He's no engineer.
He's a literary man. Why I just heard him. in the
Literary Society the other night, give one of the
best readings I've ever heard about Japan." To
which Dean Cooley replied. "You better look him
Albert B. Newman,
B.S., Ph.D., took his de-
gree in Chemical Engi-
neering in 1911. After
his graduation he worked
as Chemical Engineer in
various firms. At first he was with the Corn
Products Refining Company, and later with the
National Zinc Company, Eagle-Picher Lead
Co., the Davidson Chemical Company, and the
Thermo Chemical Co. In 1924, he became
works manager of the East St. Louis plant of
the Monsanto Chemical Works. He left this
position two years later, however, to return to
the University, where he studied for the de-
gree of Doctor of Philosophy, which he received
in 1928. In 1927 he entered the research divi-
sion of the General Company, of New York.
He resigned this position last fall, when he
accepted an appointment as Professor of Chemi-
cal Engineering in Cooper Union for the Ad-
vancement of Science and Art, in New York.
He will have supervision over all instruction in
Chemical Engineering and Chemistry. He is
also consultant to chemical manufacturing in-
dustries. He is married, and one of his two
sons is now attending the University High
School.
up." The man did look him up and found out that
Mr. Hinchman was not only an excellent literary
student but also a wonderful engineer. Incidental-
ly, Mr. Hinchman got the job.
Mr. Hinchman is a member of the A. S. M. E.,
the Detroit Engineering Society, the Detroit Club,
and the University Club of Detroit. Sigma Phi is
his social fraternity. Mr. Hinchman is also an hon-
orarv member of Tau Beta Pi, honorary engineer-
ing society.
Mr. Hinchman is a very
modest and an unsually con-
genial man. When one won-
ders how a man like Mr.
Hinchman has accomplished
what he has, one must see
that it is the patience, accu-
racy and engineering ability
of a man such as he which
has given him success. o

ployed in the Yellowstone Park is made up of stu-
dents from our universities. The Fark Service and
the officers of the transportation company have dis-
covered that these young people are the most effec-
tive help that can be secured. While much fiction
has been written relative to the "Wild West," the
natives of the mountain states have realized for
many years that their lives are subject to a mini-
mum of hazard and risk. At the new camp site
there will be no troublesome insects, no poisonous
snakes or plants, and no dangerous animals. The
local people represent the old Anglo-Saxon element
of the country to a great extent. Many people com-
ing directly from England and Scotland have se-
lected Wyoming for their homes.
There is a general feeling among those who have
been observing the engineer for the past 25 or 30
years that too many of them become provincial.
They tend to stay in one place and to cling to one
line of work. If, while students, young men are
able to spend eight weeks in this region of scenic
beauty, they should return with new viewpoints
and broader conceptions of the work and responsi-
bilities of the engineer. The great engineers of the
country are those who have moved about. They
have followed their work wherever opportunity has
beckoned. They have not become so attached to a
job that they have lost their courage. This new
Michigan Camp not only offers an opportunity for
better instruction, but it will afford an experience
which but few people enjoy at much greater ex-
pense. The writer of this paper, with two com-
panions, drove by automobile from Michigan to
Colorado last summer. Our party then went north-
erly to Cheyenne, Wyoming, and then diagonally
across that state to the Jackson Hole Country and
the Yellowstone Park, returning by the way of the
east entrance. The cost of the trip per person was
about $52.50. We saw enough of the Jackson Hole
Country and the Yellowstone Park to be convinced
that we would spend a summer there whenever we
could make arrangements for so doing.

ago. At that time the experimental laboratory oc-
cupied the first floor or basement, the machine shop
the second, and the wood shop the third. The sec-
ond unit had been replaced by a brick building
housing the forge shop in the north end and the
foundry in the south. It was not until the experi-
mental laboratory, or mechanical engineering labo-
ratory, as it is now called, was moved into the
West Engineering Building, that the forge shop
went into the basement of the third unit. Until
1915 the source of power was a steam engine which
was then supplanted by the electric motor. This
brings us down to modernity.
The Present
The Department of Engineering Shops consists
of four divisions giving instruction and one shop
for instrument work, as follows:
(a) Woodworking
(b) Metal Working and Treating
(c) Foundry
(d) Machine Shop
(e) Instrument Shop
The department is located in the south wing of
the East Engineering Building. Chemical Engi-
neering, Highway Engineering, Aeronautical En-
gineering and Engineering Research departments
are also housed in this building. While the shops
were formerly in a group of buildings by them-
selves, the closer association with these other de-
partments in the building permits closer co-opera-
tion. For instance, the metallurgy of Chemical En-
gineering is practically demonstrated in the Metal
Working and Treating, and Foundry Laboratories.
The shop administrative offices are located on the
second floor front. A drawing room twenty-five
feet by thirty-five feet, a small dark room for photo-
graphic work, and a research room in which appara-
tus is provided for the study of the cutting cuialities
of metals, are close by. Classrooms are arranged
adjacent to each laboratory, and locker rooms are
provided on the first, second, and third floors, with
showers on the first and third floors. Three rooms
are available in the basement for the storage of oils
and cutting fluids, iron, steel, non-ferrous stock,
and salvage materials.
Electric power is used throughout, most machines
being driven in groups rather than individually, in
order to keep the investment as low as possible. In
some cases, however, individual motor drive is ar-
ranged, for instructional purposes as well as effi-
ciency, on such equipment as lathes, shapers, drill
presses, blowers, and a drop hammer.
Power transmission has been standardized as to
size and speed for all laboratories, so that maxi-
mum flexibility and efficiency are obtained. The
steel shafting is 1-15/16 inches in diameter. Shaft
hangers and bearings of two types have been in-
stalled: The Hyatt roller bearings with Pioneer
pressed steel hangers, and the S. K. F. self-aligning
ball bearings with the S. K. F. cast hangers. The
ring and plain type bearings are in evidence on
countershafts and machine tools. Barry pressed-
steel split pulleys with rolled edges, provided with
cast iron bushings, have been universally installed
on drive shafts. Installations have been made in
such a way as to serve as examples of power trans-
mission and safety.

Forging the Sinews

UPSET forging plays an interest-
ing and important part in mak-
ing the New Departure Ball
Bearing so enduring that it will outlive
the machine in which it is installed—
and yet never wear within itself to the
extent of requiring adjustment.
This method increases the density
of the steel by compression and like-
wise controls the flow of the steel fibre
—a feature with a direct bearing on
endurance life, as will be explained.
The bar is first heated to an exact
temperature checked constantly with
optical pyrometers to obtain a non-
oxidizing atmosphere for the
prevention of scaling.
The first blow of the
forming die in making the
inner race ring produces the shape
shown in the first form. This is im-
mediately followed by the second
operation, by which the ring is formed.
The third or piercing operation cuts
the ring from the bar.
Thus the fibre or grain of the steel
flows into carefully predetermined
channels, bringing it parallel to the
surface at the points of greatest
load in the finished and revolving
bearing.
Normalizing and annealing opera-
tions which follow relieve all internal
strains and greatly refine the grain
size of the steel. The di-
rection of the fibre for
maximum endurance
mains unchanged.

The Woodworking Laboratory is located in the
central part of the second floor and is fifty feet square.
The courses in woodworking and pattern mak-
ing were discontinued as requirements for gradua-
tion for engineers in 1919, and while the equipment
has been reduced considerably, the layout still con-
tains a wide variety of the equipment found in this
type of shop. In the north half of the laboratory
are placed twelve individual work benches, a space
for setting-up work and gluing, and a small tool
crib. In the south half are all of the machine tools
required for instruction in woodworking and pat-
tern making. The woodworking equipment is often
used by the students in the School of Education in
connection with their study of the teaching of
manual training.
The Metal Working Laboratory, sixty by one
hundred feet, is on the third floor. Equipment is
provided in this division for the teaching of the
principles applied to the hot and cold working of
metals, welding and cutting, heat-treatment, test-
ing for physical properties, protective coatings, etc.
On the north side of the laboratory there are forty
Buffalo forges of the down-draft type. The gas and
smoke are removed from these forges through
pipes leading to a direct motor-driven fan in the
air room at the east end of the second floor. A
direct motor-driven blower is also located in the
air room for supplying the draft to the forges. At
the east end of the north side of the laboratory
is a Beaudry power-driven forge hammer, which is
used for demonstrating the forging of heavy parts
and the use of dies. Nearby is located an electric
forging heater of the resistance type. Brazing
tables and thermit welding equipment are at the
west end of the north side.
The heat-treating equipment is located at the
west end of the south side of the Metal Working
Laboratory. This section consists of a Bellevue pre-
heating furnace of the double deck type for high-
speed steel, a Stewart triple-purpose furnace hav-
ing one forging, one heat-treating and one liquid
bath furnace, two American gas furnaces, and one
high-temperature heat-treating furnace made by
the department. A Westinghouse electric furnace
is also provided. A single Roots blower, individ-
ually driven, supplies air to any one or all of the
gas furnaces. An Engelhard temperature indicator
is attached to a thermo-couple in each of the fur-
naces for accurate temperature measurement. A
variety of quenching baths for heat-treating are
provided. Testing equipment consists of a 50,000-
pound Riehle universal testing machine, and Brin-
ell, scleroscope. and Rockwell hardness testing ma-
chines. With this equipment the student is given
an opportunity to become acquainted first hand
with the heat-treating, case hardening, and testing
of various types of steels. The Universal testing
machine is provided so that an idea is gained as
to the relative values of strength of electric and
gas welds, and riveted joints made by them. To
the east of the heat-treating section is located the
tool crib and stock-storage room, beyond which are
the machine tools, benches, and welding equip-
ment. After forging a drill, lathe tool, chisel, or
shaper tool, it is hardened and drawn, then ground
to form and tested under actual working condi-
tions. The machine tool equipment consists of
three heavy duty lathes, three drill presses, two_
shapers, and three grinding stands. Twenty work
benches with vises are provided for testing the cold
chisels and for the student to become acquainted
with the use of a file. The welding equipment in
this section consists of a Thompson resistance
type electric welder, a "metal-arc" alternating cur-
rent arc welder, a Lincoln motor-generator set di-
rect current arc welder, and an oxy-acetylene weld-
ing outfit, together with the necessary accessories.
For the purpose of demonstrating protective
coatings, the copper and nickel plating outfit, to-
gether with a Parkerizing bath and baking oven,
located in the Instrument Shop on the second floor,
are used.
The classroom work of the course in foundry
practice consists of a study of the principles and
practice applied to cast metals, including gray iron,
malleable iron, steel, and various types of non-fer-
rous castings. Special consideration is given to the
principles involved in the melting process, the mix-
ing of the metals, the composition and properties
of cast metals, the making of cores, molding prac-
tice, and the use of equipment. The work done in
the laboratory is arranged to demonstrate the prin-
ciples considered in the classroom. One or two
heats are run from the cupola weekly, the castings
produced being used by the different departments
of the University. The engineer becomes ac-
quainted with the influence of foundry practice on
the design of metal castings.
The foundry laboratory, sixty by one hundred
and thirty feet, is on the fourth or top floor of the
south wing. It is divided into the melting, mold-
ing, cleaning, and core-making sections. A five-ton
Whiting cupola is centrally located in the east end
and extends from the molding floor through the
charging floor and through the roof. Air is sup-
plied by a Roots blower driven directly by a West-
inghouse variable-speed electric motor. The charg-
ing floor, sixty by twenty-three feet, is provided as
a working space for arranging and handling the
raw materials for the cupola charge. Raw mate-

Typically American the walls of this imposing building
rise in steps called the "set-back" style in construction.
On one side of the building the steps occur at the 13th,
17th, 20th and 23rd floors while on two other sides they
occur at the 15th, 22nd and 25th floors.
Unseen, yet of great importance, is the foundation. Here,
as on many large building projects throughout the world,
a Koehring Heavy Duty mixer with its re-mixing action

rials, such as pig iron, limestone, coke, scrap steel,
and iron are stored in a row of brick sheds in the
court of the building, and when needed are deliv-
ered to the charging floor by means of the two-ton
electric elevator located in the northwest corner of
the south wing.
A two-ton, twenty-two-foot span Northern Engi-
neering Works crane serves the molding floor.
Xear the elevator door in the northeast corner of
the laboratory is located the cleaning section where
castings from the molding floor are cleaned prior
to shipment. The cleaning equipment consists of
an American Foundry Equipment Company sand-
blast cabinet, one large and one small tumbling
barrel, and two snagging grinding stands. A bench
equipped with a vise and air and hand-operated
chisels, together with files, completes the cleaning
equipment. Dust and dirt is taken from this part
of the laboratory by means of a large fan and
passed through a Sturtevant dust collector before
being discharged on the outside of the building.
Air pressure at one hundred pounds pressure for
operating the sand-blast equipment, and otrfcf air
operated molding machines, tools is furnished di-
rectly from the campus power house. A Simpson
sand mixer is also located in this section with other
power driven machines. An Her brass furnace of
the crucible type for melting non-ferrous metals is
located in the southeast corner of the laboratory.
This furnace uses city gas as a medium of heat.
Air for this furnace is furnished by a directly-
driven Connersville blower. Adjacent to the Iler
brass furnace is a Detroit Electric furnace of the
rocking type, which is used for melting cast iron.
This furnace has a capacity of two hundred pounds
of cast iron per hour and requires from seventy-
five to eighty kilowatts of electric power for opera-
tion. A large transformer for reducing the voltage
from twenty-three hundred to four hundred and
forty volts is located on the roof directly over the
furnace. A Holly Carburetor Company permanent-
mold molding machine is nearby. Various types of
air and hand operated molding machines are located
along the north and south walls of the foundry lab-
oratory.
In the southwest corner of the laboratory is the
core section. Various types of core-making equip-
ment are available, together with a large Young
Brothers core oven and a small core oven made by
the department for baking the cores. The core
ovens are heated by city gas. On the north side
of the west etid of the laboratory are racks for
storing patterns used in instruction, a tool crib, and
various types of equipment for testing core and
molding sands. To the west of the foundry labora-
tory is the Metallurgical Laboratory, twenty-five
by thirty-six feet, for foundry control and experi-
mental purposes. The combination of this labora-
tory with the foundry laboratory not only points
the way to scientific foundry control but affords an
excellent opportunity for investigations dealing
with foundry practice. The test specimens of cast
metals are tested physically on the testing ma-
chines located in the Metal Working Laboratorv.
The classroom work in Machine Shop Practice is
devoted to the study of the principles underlying
the various processes and the tools and machine
tools used. After discussing machine shops as to
types, that is, whether job shop, semi-production,
or mass production shops, a resume of the proc-
esses found in machine shop practice is made. Tool
materials, tool shapes, together with the machine
tools required for each process, such as turning,
boring, shaping, planing, milling, drilling, tapping,
reaming, broaching, grinding, polishing, buffing,
lapping, honing, etc., are studied. After these ele-
mentary processes have been covered, their appli-
cation to semi- and mass production, as used in the
turret lathe, screw machine, or automatic turning
machine, is treated. Other production processes,
such as automatic gear cutting, die castings, punch
and die work, together with auxiliaries, such as
jigs, fixtures, special tools, standards, gages, etc.,
are correlated. Additional subjects, such as stand-
ardization, accounting and costs, organization,
stock records, time and motion study, and routings
are introduced to show their influence on the cor-
rect application of the various metal cutting proc-
esses.
The Machine Tool Laboratory serves to demon-
strate by actual application these features. This
laboratory, sixty by one hundred and thirty feet,
is on the first floor. On the north side and at the
east end of the Machine Tool Laboratory is located
the polishing and buffing room, in which wheels
and materials for a wide variety of work are kept.
An electric glue pot is provided for setting up the
polishing wheels. Two motor-driven polishing
stands, one having a spindle speed of 1.800 r. p. m.,
and the second of 3,600 r. p. m., are available. The
polishing room is inclosed so as to get better tem-
perature control and at the same time to keep
abrasive dust from being carried to other machine
tools in the laboratory. The polishing machines are
attached directly to the large suction fan which
draws the dusty air from the polishing room and
discharges it through a stack extending through
the roof of the building. Adjacent to the polishing

THE enormous output of automobiles per
working day in America's Automobile Fac-
tories is an outstanding accomplishment of
American Engineering Skill and Enterprise.
The Automobile Industry has set the pace by
adopting manufacturing methods and equip-
ment to meet new demands for greater output
and lower manufacturing costs.
Considering these facts, it is significant that

to the north wall are located the various grinding
machines, which consist of one large and one small
universal cylindrical grinder, one surface grinder
with a magnetic chuck, two tool and cutter grind-
ers, and one lathe tool grinder. Still further to the
left are arranged, in one group, nineteen engine
lathes, not more than two of the same manufac-
ture. Some of these machines are arranged with
step-cone-pulley drive through countershafts, some
by single-pulley drive through geared heads, and
still others by direct motor drive with the motor
placed in the leg of the machine or attached to the
back of the leg, in which case a short leather belt
is used. ..
At the east end of the north side of the labora-
tory is located a die casting machine equipped with
the plunger type melting chamber or air pressure
type chamber so that any of the base alloys of
lead, tin, zinc, or aluminum may be die cast. The
melting furnace of this machine operates on city
gas. Adjacent is a large Standard Engineering
Company cyanide furnace for cyanide hardening
various parts, such as small tools or set screws,
either to obtain a salable finish on a polished sur-
face or a few thousandths of an inch of hard case.
The pot of this furnace is sixteen inches in diam-
eter and sixteen inches deep, and in operation is
heated by city gas so that the liquid bath is main-
tained at a temperature of about 1,700 deg. F.
In the central portion of the south side of the
Machine Tool Laboratory is located the tool crib
and material storage room. The tool crib proper
is twenty-five feet square and under the constant
supervision of an attendant. This crib contains a
wide variety of cutting tools, measuring instru-
ment, and gages for machine and hand use. The
material storage room is provided for storing rough
stock and material which is in process of construc-
tion.
To the west of the tool crib, various machines of
the semi-production or mass production type are
arranged to give the student a perspective of the
selection and layout of machine tools, such as
would be used in the manufacture of articles in
quantities. These machines consist of three tur-
ret lathes, several drill presses, a Fellows gear
shaper, a Gould and Eberhardt gear hobber. a
Gleason bevel gear planer, an American broaching
machine, a punch press, a National Acme four-
spindle automatic screw machine, a Brown and
Sharpe single-spindle automatic screw machine, and
milling machines equipped with fixtures. Adjacent
to the west side of the tool crib is an off-hand wet
grinding stand and a Wilmarth and Morman drill
grinder for general use. Two additional drill grind-
ers, rather complicated in their operation, are
located within the tool crib proper. A cutting-off
saw employing a rubber or Bakelite bonded abra-
sive wheel and a two-wheel off-hand tool grinding
stand are also placed in the tool room.
To the east of the tool crib is one small and one
large planer, the latter provided with a dynamom-
eter for measuring the force on a tool during a
cut. This dynamometer has been used extensively
in the determination of the influence of the cutting
speed, shape of the tool, or the size of the cut, on
the cutting force. At present it is being used in
connection with a microscope and moving picture
machine to record just what happens when metal
is cut. One belt-driven, sixteen-inch Gould and
Eberhardt shaper, and a motor-driven thirty-two-
inch Gould and Eberhardt shaper are also in this
section. Against the south wall is a motor-driven
Ryerson engine lathe having a thirty-inch swing
and fourteen-foot bed. This machine is being used
to determine the influence on the life of a tool, of
various tool sizes and shapes, and types of tool ma-
terials, such as high-speed steel of several grades,
Stellite, and the recently developed tungsten car-
bide.
The Instrument Shop, which serves the Univer-
sity in general in the making of instruments, re-
search apparatus,' or doing repair work, is located
at the -easf end of the second floor. This depart-
ment has a permanent staff of skilled machinists
and instrument makers and is self-supporting in
that actual costs of labor and material are billed
against each job. While the equipment in this de-
partment is confined chiefly to that used in the
typical job shop, such as engine lathes, bench
lathes, a shaper, a milling machine, a band saw,
drill presses, etc., it has the facilities of the instruc-
tional divisions at its disposal.

joint is riveted a viscous tar-like preparation is
applied to the inside of the seam and is forced by
capillarv action through the joint, most effectively
sealing it. It is claimed that the completed seam
or joint is hydrogen tight. An interesting compari-
son, although not quite a fair one, is that it takes
only slightly more than a day to rivet a joint com-
pletely around the bag with the machine, while
it is estimated that it will take three or four weeks
to join the two halves of the bag together, which
must obviously be done by hand.
The metal used in the bag is of major interest.
The first selection was, of course, duralumin, hut
it was found that this metal, while perfectly satis-
factory at first, corroded rapidly with an attendant
increase of brittleness that precluded its use on
such a relatively flexible structure. Then "Alclad."

ALL METAL DIRIGIBLE
(Continued from page 2S)
which is nothing more or less than a sheet of dura-
lumin with a very thin sheet of aluminum rolled
on each side, was substituted and found satisfac-
tory. The shielding of the duralumin by the alu-
minum makes corrosion of the duralumin practi-
cally impossible, since the joint between the two
metals is very close and thought by some to be an
actual inter-crystaline merge. The combination
exhibits none of the properties of some others; for
instance, tin over iron, where corrosion of the iron
is actually hurried when the tin is scratched
through. On the other hand, it is said that a scratch
through the aluminum to the duralumin sets up an
action that will "heal" the scratch and recover the
bared duralumin with pure aluminum.
The advantages of all metal construction are
manifest. One thinks immediately of indefinite
service periods where metal is used. The deter-
mination of the period must, of course, wait until
the dirigible is actually in service. However, we
are aware that fabric coverings and rubberized
fabric bags, even fabric bags lined with gold-
beater's skin, leave much to be desired insofar as
durability is concerned. The cost of recovering a
craft such as the "Los Angeles" is staggering, and
the intervals between repair, redoping, even recov-
ering, are not long. Obviously, if the metal may be
made to outlast even two fabric jobs—and there is
reason to believe that this is not especially optimis-
tic—then it will be only a matter of time until
metal-clads replace fabric jobs.
Aside from the factor of durability, there is
another point in favor of the metal bag. Gas will
diffuse through ordinary three-ply rubberized fabric
with such facility that a single inflation is worth-
less after a period of about four weeks. Even fabric
lined with gold-beater's skin—nature's best parti-
tion wall—resists diffusion only enough to lengthen
the period between inflations to four months. How-
ever, gas in a metal bag does not seem to diffuse
at all, and the period between necessary inflations
is indefinitely long. This factor alone is sufficient
to bring maintenance cost down markedly. For in-
stance, a single inflation of a 200,000 foot dirigible
with helium costs about $7,500, exclusive of the
labor necessary and the cost of time out of service.
Tt follows that if the metal bag will conserve this
expensive gas indefinitely it will undoubtedly come
into more general use.
In addition the metal-clad is, of course, fireproof,
and while the danger of fire aboard a fabric ship
using helium is not great, it is nevertheless present
since the covering and the gas cells themselves will
burn. The use of metal throughout undoubtedly
ranks with the use of helium and the heavy oil en-
gine as a step toward complete elimination of fire
hazard.
It must be remembered throughout this discus-
sion that the specific metal dirigible that is nearing
completion is purely an experimental job and should
not be compared too rigidly with other dirigibles in
its own size class. It is likely that a conventional
non-rigid of the same size may be made to out-
perform, as far as useful load is concerned, the craft
under discussion. That is, the total weight of the
metal-clad is greater than a non-rigid of the same
size. The main reason for this is that the thickness
of the metal of the bag has been reduced as much
as is thought practicable, but the strength is still
great enough for a ship several times the size of
the present one. It follows from this that the real
field for the metal-clad will be in very large craft,
where the full strength of the metal may be utilized.
It is the opinion of designers that metal-clads of the
size of the "Los Angeles" and larger will perhaps
be lighter than conventional rigid designs.
There remains, however, one serious objection to
large metal-clad pressure type dirigibles. The fact
that dependence is placed on internal pressure for
strength means that subdivision of the bag into
compartments or separate gas cells would have no
advantage, inasmuch as pressure must be main-
tained in all portions of the bag, and if one of the
cells were damaged severely it would tend to cause
the collapse of the bag. On the other hand, if a
single cell is used, then special balloneting will be
needed in large ships in order that they may be
trimmed, and the safety will probably be not as
great as conventional multi-cell rigids.
In summary, then, the metal-clad pressure ship
of large capacity certainly will have an advantage
over existing rigid ships insofar as durability and
maintenance are concerned. It is possible that in
very large sizes they may be made to out-perform
large conventional rigids, and in this size the cost
of construction will not be much greater. As re-
gards safety, however, they will be inferior as long
as they remain pressure ships. The solution of this
last may be a pressureless ship that places less de-
pendence on the skin for rigidity.

voluptuously; giant-like and full of cunning, she
laughed softly into the reddish moon." 'Now we'll
see what human might may avail against us. Now
we'll see.' " The cruelty of the storms, the scourges
of drought and locusts, the silence and loneliness
against which the heroic Per Honsa and his family
battled, all seem a part of a diabolical plan of some
prairie demon. Yet how exquisite is the simple
vividness in some of his descriptions. "A day in
June, a quivering, vital sunlight. The irregular
shadows of fleecy clouds drifting across an endless
plain. Sun and irregular clouds—nothing but these
all day." "The wagons drifted slowly through the
outspread day, creeping through indolent, drowsy
fall sunshine and blue-green haze toward a distant
skyline from which hung a quivering yellow veil."
As the picture of the courage of the human spirit
against the terrible forces of untamed nature,
"Giants in the Earth" is quite without parallel in
American literature. Hamlin Garland's autobiog-
raphy is less heroic, but it also gives one a new
appreciation of the capacity of the soul for deter-
mined struggle toward an ideal in the face of ad-
verse circumstance. This is the common quality in
the two books which makes them so much more
than an account of the conquest of the prairies.
If one is interested to till in the details of the
picture these two books give him, he should read
also "A Daughter of the Middle Border," "Trail
Makers of the Middle Border," and "Back Trailers
of the Middle Border." These books do not seem
to have the inspired beauty of the first one of the
series. The feeling of world weariness, of depres-
sion and discouragement dulls the charm of the
narrative, but the accuracy of detail, the fidelity to
the facts make the records of this phase of Ameri-
can life of real significance and value.
One may very well also read Riilvaag's sequel,
"Peder Victoreous," in which he has invested the
bickerings and misunderstandings between the old
immigrant parents and the young generation, with
the dignity of tragedy. I confess I dreaded to read
this sequel: I feared to find it a disappointing anti-
climax after the noble level to which Per Honsa's
heroic death had brought "Giants in the Earth."
But, while it is different, it is quite as effective as a
powerful analysis of human motives. The stark,
tragic figure of the old Norwegian mother, incap-
able of adjusting herself to the new environment,
is one of the most memorable creations since
Hardy's Mrs. Yeobright.
If the somber beauty of these books appeals to
one, he should read also Hamsun's "Growth of the
Soil," Bojer's "The Great Hunger," to which T re-
ferred last month and Raymont's "The Peasant,"
which is. to be sure, Polish rather than Nordic.
These books are of the same mood. One under-
stands better after he has read them all how, with
his Norse ancestry, his Norse feeling for pathetic,
tragic, depressing aspects of life, Riilvaag, even in
his adopted land, should write as he has written.
If the story of how men rise to heroic deeds in
the conquest of the soil fascinates one as it has the
writer, he should read Herbert Quick's "Vander-
mark's Folly," a book which does not perhaps be-
long in the class with the two books reviewed in
this article, but which gives a very vivid account
of the settling of the Iowa prairies. I do not care so
much for any of Mr. Quick's other works, but I do
find in "Vandermark's Folly" an interesting picture
of pioneering in Iowa that is given with a certain
sincerity and simplicity which makes it seem quite
genuine. Then there is Hugo Wast's "Black Val-
ley," where the scene, to be sure, is South America,
but the theme is much the same as in the other
books mentioned; and F. P. Grove's "Settlers of the
Marsh," and Martha Ostenso's "Wild Geese," both
stories of the Canadian Northwest. I suppose one
should include Zola's "La Terre," which is available
in a fair translation.
In order to put these suggestions in a more use-
ful form, I will brings the books mentioned in this
article together in the following list:
Hamlin Garland:
A Son of The Middle Border.
A Daughter of The Middle Border.
Trail Makers of The Middle Border.
Back Trailers of The Middle Border.
Rolvaag:
Giants in The Earth.

"Applied Psychology in Modern Industry"; Prof.
Keeler discussed "The Problems of an Industrial
Power Plant"; A. H. Lockwood and "Mac" Ma-
lone, of the Consolidated Paper Company, outlined
the personnel and labor problems encountered in
the paper industry; Dean Sadler and Prof. Ander-
son presented some very interesting talks on Indus-
trial Engineering, from the standpoint of "human
engineering"; Mr. De Vere, University of Oxford
lecturer, pointed out the things which he had found
peculiar to American industry in his recently com-
pleted study here; Mr. Sullivan, works manager of
the Ternstedt Manufacturing Company, related
some of his experiences with Mr. Taylor at the
early stages of scientific management, and showed
their connection with the present day problems in
his industrial work. All of these talks have been
very helpful in increasing the contact between
University work and industry.
In the past it has been customary for the engi-
neer to assimilate his technical knowledge at the
University and then accumulate his management
knowledge as he worked his way up to the execu-
tive position. While there will still be those who,
by means of unusual ability, will be able to make
successful executives of themselves, competition is
becoming so keen that this will be the exception
rather than the rule. Those who familiarize them-
selves with modern industrial engineering are
going to be the ones who will have the first oppor-
tunity at the administration of the industry of
tomorrow.
o
Modern Legerdemain
There is always something fascinating about the
sleight-of-hand performer and his amazing series of
impossible tricks. Even the small boy, however,
realizes that twenty pink rabbits cannot be con-
tained simultaneously in the one silk hat from which
they are apparently drawn, and the bowl of goldfish
has not vanished into the air when the mystic passes
have been completed over the soft blue cloth. Why
are some power-station engineers so unbelievably
credulous about their ability to cause equally tan-
gible materials to disappear without trace?
A steam generating station utilizing 500 tons of
coal a day with a conservatively estimated ash con-
tent of 6 per cent has 30 tons of solid material to
dispose of properly whether a stoker-fed boiler or
pulverizeri-fuel equipment is used. Some of it will
inevitably reach the open air; with stoker-fed fur-
naces this is relatively limited. It is amazing to
hear engineers who have lived and worked through
the era that has minimized the smoke nuisance
state that they do not know where the ashes go
and that there is an almost negligible quantity of
which to dispose. The ashes, as any one on the
leeside of the plant and possibly many miles away
can tell you, are floating gently down on the
countryside.
Official data of test runs in one pulverized-fuel in-
stallation where special precautions have been taken
to control ash deposits indicate that while an av-
erage of 3.68 per cent of the dry coal is reclaimed
as slag from the combustion chamber, the total flue
refuse per pound of dry coal burned amounted to
0.0994 pound. Slowly indeed has industry learned
that refuse is not disposed of when acids and dyes
are poured into previously attractive streams, that
smoke pollution of the air is a civic offense, in ad-
dition to being unprofitable, and that valleys were
not made for refuse pits. The past points the way.
Ashes must be disposed of, not blown into the air
and forgotten by all but one's neighbors.

Substations Passing Out
Load growth in the electrical industry keeps en-
gineers and system planners keyed to a high pitch.
In larger cities a density is found ranging from
3000 kw. to 300,000 kw. per sq. mi., and this density
keeps on creeping upward. A ten-year perspective
on load growth gives a new conception of a met-
ropolitan system; it modifies present layouts and
makes radical changes necessary.
The substation seems to be an expensive and
hazardous incumbrance on the metropolitan system
of the future which uses alternating current. It has
served its time in the system layout and must pass,
because it is no longer needed as a functional de-
vice. Instead of the substation there will be unit
generators, an a-c. grid distribution system, mult-
iple-transformer vaults underground and synchroni-
zing at the grid. It is a simple and reliable system
because all faults clear themselves if small cables
are used to tap the network, no large concentra-
tion of energy is had in generating stations, system
stability is a maximum oand service is also a max-
imum owing to the simple layout and multiplicity
of supply points. When several generating stations
are used, there is no problem of tie cables or of load
and wattles control. The system becomes the old
F.dison grid system, which has proved to be the
most reliable system of supply and lacks onlv the
storage battery to be comparable to the best d-c.
supply system.

signed to assist the industries of the State
in placing at their disposal the entire scien-
tific resources of the University.
It is not organized for the mere running
of routine tests or the solution of minor
shop problems, hut for the exhaustive study
and investigation of scientific manufactur-
ing problems critical to the progress of for-
ward looking industries.
Through this Department the manufac-
turer may secure the service of trained
scientists, special laboratories, library facili-
ties and testing equipment of exceptional
sort, and the sustained and thorough qual-
ity of research work which is to be found
in a great university.
Under the present generous patent ar-
rangements, clients of the Department may,
by the payment of a somewhat higher serv-
ice charge, secure the benefits to be derived
from all inventions, patents and patentable
processes resulting from the investigations
made in their behalf.
All problems submitted to the Depart-
ment should be addressed to the Director.
Such problems will be carefully studied and
only those will be undertaken in which it is
felt that the Department may be of service
to the prospective client. The regular serv-
ice charge for such work is thirty per cent,

The difference in investment costs of this high
pressure installation and of an installation for 300 lb.
pressure is surprisingly small.
At Northeast Station, the fuel saving resulting
from the use of the higher pressure is nearly three
times the fixed charges on the increased investment.
This installation is an excellent example of
coordinated design. The complete fuel burning and
steam generating equipment was sold and installed
under one contract—one responsibility and one set
of guarantees.

The Ambassador Bridge
Edited from numerous authentic sources, with additions
By Eim'AKU It. &gt;KM„ *.'tOE
AFTER one has seen the Ambassador Bridge
for the first time, although it is not yet com-
pleted, he realizes the futility of an attempt
to describe it. This mammoth structure defies
description, with its great sweeping steel catenaries
gracefully strung across
the Detroit River like some
Gargantuan spider - web
system. Here, stretching
before one, is seen the cul-
mination of centuries of
engineering development
in one of the most magnifi-
cent structures ever creat-
ed by man. It is at once,
beauty and utility: grace
and stolidity: complexity
and simplicity.
It is of more than pass-
ing interest that the long-
est span highway bridge
in the world should be in
process of construction at
a site on the Detroit River,
where the Indians, for
centuries before the white
man's arrival, found it
most convenient to cross.
The bridge structure itself is approximately
7.400 feet in length. The main span—between the
towers—is 1,850 feet in length, 100 feet longer than
the main span of the Philadelphia-Camden Bridge,
which is, at present, the longest single-span sus-
pension bridge in the world. Adjoining each end

of the bridge structure proper, will be a terminal
equivalent to a large city block in area. The dis-
tance from entrance to exit is approximately 9,000
feet, nearly two miles. The bridge will carry an
unobstructed roadway 47 feet wide, with a capacity
of five lanes of traffic, in
addition to an eight-foot
sidewalk. The number of
lanes of traffic used in any
one direction may be var-
ied to suit traffic condi-
tions.
The clearance of the
bridge over the river at
high water is 135 feet near
the shore, and 152 feet for
a short distance near the
center. This allows the
passage of vessels with
stacks, masts, or funnels
20 feet higher than any
now plying the Great
Lakes. The approach
grades are entirely in ac-
cordance with the best
highway practice.
The main piers, which
support the two steel towers, are located close to
the two harbor lines, and leave the entire available
stretch of navigable water free from obstruction,
liach of the two piers supports a superimposed
load of 20,000 tons, and is composed of two con-
crete cylinders, one under each tower column.
These cylinders are 38 feet in diameter, and are

carried about 115 feet down through clay and sand
to a firm bearing on the natural limestone rock.
The anchorages are two of the most prominent
structures In either Detroit or Sandwich. Their
function is to resist the pull of approximately 8,000
tons on each of the main cables. Each comprises
two portions, of which the larger is buried from
view and consists
of two rectangular
concrete blocks,
22y2 feet wide. 100
feet long in the di-
rection of the major
axis of the bridge,
and about 105 feet
deep to bed rock.
The other portion is
the superstructure,
which rises to a
height of 100 feet
above the ground.
They are composed
entirely of con-
crete, and are of a
modernistic design.
The main towers,
supported by the
piers, describe d
above, have the
sole function of supporting the cables, which de-
liver to them the entire weight of the 1850-foot
span. Each of the two main towers consists of
two vertical steel columns and an adequate system
of cross-bracing, designed to hold these columns
rigid against wind pressure and other disturbing
influences. Each of the columns forms a tower,
which is made up of three square cells of structural
silicon steel, firmly riveted together, and provided
with entrance doors and ladders, so that inspection
and painting may be easily carried on. The load
imposed by the cables on the top of each column
is approximately 9,000 tons, and this is increased,
by the column's own weight and the action of
wind and other forces, to approximately 10,000
tons, which is delivered by the column to the pier
below.
The form of the cross-bracing which unites the
two columns in each tower has been selected to
afford a great, clear height over the roadway, so
that users of the bridge, as they approach this
cross-bracing, may not feel that it constricts their
passage. Such a feeling has been definitely noted
on some earlier bridges of this type and is avoided
here.
There are two main cables, each of which, when
compacted and wrapped, will be 19 inches in di-
ameter. Each will consist of 7,622 parallel and
closely compacted steel wires .192 of an inch in
diameter, or about lead-pencil thickness. The
wires are produced in pieces by a combination of
continuous cold-drawing and tempering in baths
of molten lead. The wires are heat-treated by a
most intricate process which increases their yield
point strength to over 80% of the ultimate strength
and makes them almost four times as strong
as ordinary mild
steel.
After all the
wires forming the
cable are in place,
they are squeezed
by hydraulic tongs,
which change the
cross-section shape
of the cable from
a hexagon 21 inch-
es across corners
to a circle 19 inches
in diameter. They
are then clamped
at intervals with
heavy cast steel
bands, held in place
by a sufficient
number of special
bolts, drawn up to
a tension of 16 tons
to prevent the bands from slipping, and over these
bands are placed the wire suspension ropes from
which the suspended span is supported. The cable
wires are covered with a light film of protective
material in addition to heavy coats of zinc, applied
in the molten state. It was this process of zinc

coating which, while perfectly weatherproofing the
cable wires, was destroying almost completely the
invaluable effects of the special heat-treating proc-
ess to which they had been previously subjected.

Rapid Passenger Transportation
for the Majority
By JOHN S. WOKLKY. Professor of Transportation
FAST transportation of persons, as it will be
considered in this paper, will be for distances
not less than fifty miles or more than five
hundred miles, although the means, methods and
facilities described can be used efficiently for shorter
or longer journeys.
Were an inquiry made of a large number of peo-
ple as to what means would furnish rapid transpor-
tation of persons for the dis-
tances named above, it is safe
to say that an almost instant
answer would come from the
large majority—the airplane.
In that the majority opinion
on any subject is generally
more nearly correct than we
are willing to credit it, we will
further consider this phase of
our subject.
Those who frequently travel
distances ranging from fifty to
five hundred miles are a con-
siderable number of our popu-
lation. In addition to these
there are a large number who
occasionally journey these dis-
tances. As a rule a very con-
siderable part of this journey-
ing is along routes such as De-
triot to Chicago, Chicago to
St. Louis, New York to Boston,
Boston to Albany, New York to Philadelphia,
Washington to Richmond and Los Angeles to San
Francisco.
The ideals as to conditions and facilities desired
by the traveler are, a continuous passage from place
of departure to place of destination without inter-
ruptions of any kind, the minimum lapse of time
from the beginning to the completion of the trip,
the maximum amount of comfort and safety; and
a vehicle which can be almost instantly "parked" at
or immediately adjacent to the point of destination,
instantly available for use between local points in a
town or neighborhood, always ready for instant de-
parture to another destination fifty or more miles
away, one which is usable in all kinds of weather,
and one the purchase price of which is reasonable,
the cast of operation low, which requires the mini-
mum of repairs, which can readily be repaired in
any locality, and which can be operated safely by
the owner or one of thousands of drivers who would
be available.
TRANSPORTATION is civ-
ilization," according to Kip-
ling, and, as civilization becomes
more highly developed, the need
for more rapid transportation be-
comes more pressing. This ap-
plies particularly to the trans-
portation facilities between large
cities which are from three hun-
dred to five hundred miles apart.
As this article points out, the
airplane is limited in its applica-
tion to this problem by numerous
factors. The only practical al-
ternative is the automobile. Pro-
fessor Worley presents a very
sound and practical solution in
this article, and it is, indeed,
possible that the solution which
he outlines may become the ulti-
mate answer to civilization's
transportation problems.
—The Editor.
In addition to the above, the American has a de-
sire to own his own vehicle, to have it at his place
of residence so it may be at his "beck and call." The
only means of transportation we have today which
approach these ideals are the airplane and the auto-
mobile. The former excels only in "road" speed
and possibly in elapsed time between termini. The
average road speed of passenger airplane transport
is a little under one hundred
miles per hour.
In the matter of a vehicle
available for instant use, com-
fort, safety, low cost, minimum
operating cost, which is readily
repaired, capable of being
driven by many, usable in all
kinds of weather and has gen-
eral adaptability and flexibility
to meet innumerable varying
demands of service, the auto-
mobile excels the airplane. It
is only in road speed and
elapsed time between point of
departure and point of arrival
that the automobile fails to
equal the airplane. At this
time, 1929, the average road
speed which can be obtained
between the corporate limits of
cities such as Detroit and Chi-
cago, for fast automobile trans-
portation, is about forty miles per hour, or an
elapsed time from business center to business cen-
ter of seven and one-half hours.
The elapsed time of the airplane between the
business center of Detroit and the business center
of Chicago is four hours, the elapsed time from Chi-
cago to Detroit being twenty minutes less.
The average road speed or total elapsed time is
dependent upon the automobile or the road, or both.
Upon inquiry we find that the present day automo-
bile, those with a cost, ranging from $1.000.(X) to
$2,000.00. is capable of a "road" speed of sixty to
seventy-five miles per hour, and, with a little re-
finement, there seems to be no good reason why
they can be made to be capable of a sustained road
speed varying from eighty to one hundred miles per
hour. We also find that the present low road speed
is due largely to the location of the road, the design
of the road structure and the conditions adjacent
to the road. As a rule our modern hard surfaced

New Developments in Aircraft
Cowling
By KASIMEH K AIt I'l &gt; SK I. '31B
AMONG the more recent developments in air-
craft design, nothing has aroused so much
attention and discussion as the new N. A.
C. A. cowling for static radial engines. The prob-
lem of cowling and cooling radial air-cooled en-
gines was first brought to the fore during the con-
ference of aircraft manufacturers, held at Langley
Field, Va., in May, 1927. A program for experi-
mentation and testing
was drawn up and ap-
proved by the group,
who, in addition, recom-
mended that these plans
be carried out by the Na-
tional Advisory Commit-
tee for Aeronautics in
their new Twenty-Foot
Propeller Research Tun-
nel, which was then in
process of completion. As
a consequence the N. A.
C. A. undertook the in-
vestigation. One notable
result of a portion of this
investigation is embodied
in the cowling of the rec-
o r d-breaking Lockheed
"Air Express."
The Propeller Research
Tunnel used for the ex-
periments is of the open throat type with an air
stream 20 feet in diameter, in which velocities up to
110 m.p.h. can be obtained. A standard 9-cylinder
Wright "Whirlwind" J-5 engine developing 200 h.p.
at 1800 r.p.m. was used for the tests. Two types
of fuselages were used: a cabin fuselage which was
an average approximation of the fuselage design
of several commercial cabin monoplanes, and an
open cockpit fuselage which was similar in design
to a Vought UO-1. It should be noted also that a
UO-1 type landing gear was used with both the
open and cabin fuselages, in order to keep the drag
of the landing gear constant. A stub wing, of sec-
tion Gottingen 398 with a 7-foot chord and a 16-foot
span was used in all the tests. The use of the same
wing and landing gear with either one of the fuse-
lages mentioned made possible the statistical com-
putation of the advantages from the new cowling
in relation to the others tested. The final result of

LANDING GEAR. MOUNTED IN THE PROPELLOR RE-
SEARCH TUNNEL.
part of the investigation is the present form of the
N. A. C. A. cowling.
There are three possible explanations why the
use of the cowling gives a reduction in head resist-
ance, and thereby a reduction in drag. The first
and most obvious, is that the outer contour of the
cowling or nose acts much in the same way as the
auxiliary airfoil of a slotted wing. It acts as a means
of modifying the airflow
over the nose of the fu-
selage, bending the flow
of air inwards toward the
center of the fuselage just
back of the cylinders and
causing the air to follow
closely the contour of the
fuselage clear to the tail.
Before this the bare cyl-
inders caused a disconti-
nuity in the surface of the
fuselage and so caused a
departure of the stream-
lines of the surface.
The second explanation
is that the air is com-
pressed in the space be-
tween the inner and outer
cowlings by the action of
the slipstream in forcing
accelerated air into the
nose opening, and this air is further accelerated and
compressed as it issues from the relatively small
slot at the rear of the cowling. The effect of such
an action is that the air, thus accelerated straight
back from the slot, washes off the boundary layer
of vortices, causing a flow of air to follow the
streamline surface of the fuselage from the rear
opening of the cowling to the tail. This action is
similar to what happens when the wing slots open
on the Handley-Page slotted wing.
A third explanation is possible from the stand-
point of the flow of air over a streamlined body.
In a simple streamlined body without any obstruc-
tions, there is a variance in air pressure from the
nose to the tail: from the place where the motor is
usually installed to the tail is a region of negative
pressure, which is almost constant. As soon as a
motor is installed, the region just back of the cyl-

The Metal Art—
Wrought Iron
The Art of the AneientN Revived
By HARRIET .1. THOMS, *2»A
M
ETALS having durability
and intrinsic value, and
more often than not being
shaped to useful ends, are unique
materials. Such qualities afford
the artist craftsman an ideal me-
dium with which to work. He en-
hances native beauty while giving
purpose to its substance. This is
a fine art, indeed. It is, therefore,
not surprising that the architect,
who, more than any other artist,
deals in both utility and beauty,
has long employed iron, bronze,
copper, tin, and lead in many forms
of building decoration.
Metals have been of such importance that two
ages in the history of the world have been named
for them. Coming up through the centuries their
need has been felt ever increasingly, but their nat-
ural beauty has been dimmed because they have
been used as bases for false
representation. Precious met-
als predominated in the Greek
Era, and much of the fame of
the Roman architecture is due
to their use. However, it is
no uncommon sight today to
admire a supposedly fine piece
of wood and find it painted
metal. Nothing so false can
be beautiful, and it remains
for us to establish the metals
as such in building. It is true
that metals were not thought
durable enough to be used
alone. The machine age, too,
stopped what splendid work
was being done in hand
wrought metals, and commer-
cialized these things of natural
loveliness.
The modern architect is returning to the use
of metals as a medium of expression of unlimited
value. The decorative aspect has been added to
the structural viewpoint, and the modern building
is a thing of metal from its very steel foundation
to its truly fine furniture of polished steel. Viewed
ARTISTICALLY worked
metal has been a part of
beautiful buildings since the time
of the ancient Egyptians. During
the past few decades, however,
it has been used to a compara-
tively slight extent. In this ar-
ticle the author points out the
fact that the trend in architec-
tural decoration is again toward
the use of metal. The various
types of artistic metal ornaments
are discussed, and several out-
standing contemporary examples
are discussed. This article will
prove of interest to anyone who
admires beauty of detail in archi-
tecture.
—The Editor.
as a whole from a distance, the
structure possesses little apparent
detail, so it remains for the entrance
and the casements of the ground
floor windows to attract, and for
the corridors to invite. Examples
are too numerous to mention where-
in these details are of metal. How-
ever, the Steel Church, built only
last year at Cologne, is worthy of
note. It has neither walls nor win-
dows in the usual sense; steel up-
rights with necessary connecting
parts and an unbroken surface of
glass set in metal encloses all sides
of the auditorium but one. This,
the entrance side, is of sheet copper. The roof,
too, is sheet copper on a steel frame, and the pul-
pit and the crucifix in the apse are of beaten metal.
Simple, but beautiful, the church stands as a de-
cidedly successful experiment in the field of metal
art.
The metals are many, and
all are worthy of special dis-
cussion. For example, in one
symbolic metal screen de-
signed and executed by Oscar
B. Bach, which won the Medal
of Honor of the Architectural
League of New York during
its forty-first exhibition; the
frame and crestings are of
wrought iron, the solid panels
of etched steel, and the base
of the ornamental panels of
hand-cut steel. Five tech-
niques were used in the orna-
mentation: repousse, a flat
piece of metal pushed into
shape from the wrong side;
intarsia, a sort of metal inlay
wherein one metal is cut out and another pressed
in; applique; chased cast bronze; and vitreous fire
enamel, not an ordinary process, with astonishing-
ly beautiful results.
At the outset, it is impossible to discuss the
many metals in one article, so I shall emphasize

A Glance at the New Museum
By L. YERIVE ANSEL, "3 IE
SINCE the foundation of the Smithsonian In-
stitution in 1847, museums have taken a definite
and prominent place in our educational sys-
tem. Previous to this time specimens of natural
history and art were collected solely to serve as
materials for research, no special effort having been
made to exhibit them to the public, except as a
foundation for scientific description and theory.
About this time curators deemed it advisable to
display the speci-
mens already stud-
ied in classified
groups. However,
it was not until
1876 that the mu-
seum directors en-
deavored to appeal
to the popular
mind by displaying
the specimens ac-
companied by de-
scriptive labels and
illustrations.
The University
of Michigan Mu-
seum was founded
in 1838 and had as
a nucleus the Led-
erer collection of
minerals purchased
that same year.
The accessions to
the museum from
later sources have
been numerous and
prised of thousands

today the exhibits are cora-
of interesting specimens of
natural history and art. The new Museum Build-
ing, recently opened to public inspection, houses
many objects of interest to the student who is in-
terested in art, archaeology, ethnology, natural
history, mineralogy, geology, and many other sub-
jects. The museum exhibits are arranged and
classified in such order as to best facilitate their
examination and study.
One of the most interesting, as well as complete,
collections is the Chinese exhibit. These speci-
mens were obtained from various sources, the
most important of which were obtained through
the generosity of the Chinese Government. In
1884 and 1885 the Chinese Government sent a great
many objects of historical significance to the New-
Orleans Cotton Centennial Exposition. At the close
of this exposition the Chinese Government present-
ed this collection to the University of Michigan Mu-
seum. The Chinese collection contains illustrations
of Chinese art, modes of travel, native industries,
and numerous manifestations of the effect of the
various religions on the social and economic life on
the inhabitants of China.
In one of the illustrations, an early spinning wheel
is shown. With
such seeming crude
apparatus beautiful
tapestries have
been made. In the
background of the
illustration is a
marvelous example
of this art. This
fabric, composed of
thousands of sepa-
rate pieces, was
used as the table-
cloth of a Chinese
emperor. On either
side one will per-
ceive model images
of the imperial
rulers of this
period.
In another illus-
tration tools of an
early period are
pictured. The Chin-
ese plane, which is
used much in the fashion of a drawknife, being drawn
to the worker instead of being pushed away, is in
this group. The saw, although small, is similar to
the saw of today. The edge appears to be in good
shape in spite of the hard usage it has, no doubt,
been put to. The teeth have very little set but are
filed in such a way as to effectively cut into the
wood. Next to the saw is a balance scale. The
principal of the balance scale, that of moments, was
known and used by the Chinese for centuries in
weighing objects. Next to the scale we have the
earliest known type of adding machine, still used
by the Chinese to computate sums and differences.
Occasionally one will see such an apparatus in a
Chinese laundry.

What Shall I Read?
By J. RALEIGH NELSON. Professor of English
Great St*n Stories
MY grandfather's house in Gwennap stood in
a sheltered hollow protected from the winds
of the Atlantic by the hill to the west of it,
but one was always aware of the distant sound of
the sea, and had only to follow the quarter mile of
gently sloping road that ran past the big front gate
to see across a stretch of treeless Cornish plain the
blue, hazy line of the Bristol Channel. Great
uncles and cousins, of all degrees removed, went to
sea as their forefathers had for centuries, sea cap-
tains some of them, and no
doubt ordinary seamen many
of them. The old house was
full of outlandish curios
brought from the West Indies,
Australia, the mouth of the
Amazon. Strange tropical trees
and plants grew in the gardens
and in the quaint old green-
house. There was always the
exotic scream of a parrot or
the chatter of a tame monkey
about the place.
It is, perhaps not, strange,
therefore, that the sea has al-
ways held so great a fascina-
tion for me. Like Ambrose
Applejohn in "Captain Apple-
jack." I have even cherished a
secret hope that somewhere in the ancestral line
there may have been a pirate captain or two. But
while the dull commonplace of an academic l'.'e
has inhibited all these atavistic impulses, I have
found my sea-going instincts, ingrown as it were,
dictating some of my most enjoyable reading.
Stories of the sea and of seamen have awakened in
me a response which almost nothing else has
equalled. In this, the last of my series of talks on
books, I could not refrain from telling my readers
of some of the sea tales that in a very uneventful,
land-locked life, have been my substitute for the
open sea and the roll of a full-masted vessel.
First of all, of course, comes Conrad. To be sure
one gets from his stories much more than a vivid
picture of the sea: there is his philosophy of life,
there is his rare gallery of English seamen, por-
traits of types now fast disappearing, there is the
romance of heroic deeds and the glamor of exotic
scenes. But after all. the sea is never less than a
glorious background for his narrative, and often it
LIFE upon the sea has always
been a "Castle In Spain"
for most of us. In this article,
the last of a series of talks on
books which Professor Nelson
has been writing for the Tech-
nic, is to be found a very inter-
esting discussion of the great
stories of the sea. Professor Nel-
son, as he, himself, admits, is a
great lover of sea stories, and
his observations upon this sub-
ject are presented here in the
same personal, magnetic style
that he has used for more than
twenty years in his informal
talks about books in his office.
—The Editor.
becomes the great protagonist against which his
seamen and his ships pit their puny strength. If
any of my readers has not yet made the acquaint-
ance of Joseph Conrad, he may find the deliberate,
detailed, narrative somewhat difficult at first. To
me, for whom Conrad is scarcely less than a literary
passion, every shining word is precious. I rejoice
in the very volume of his work because it means
to me a prolonged literary satisfaction. But to one
who is.making his first contact with this great lover
of the sea, the thread of the
narrative is often apt to seem
too slight, and the action too
slow. One should go about his
reading of Conrad as he would
go to sea, shipping for a long
voyage on which he will see
new sights vividly, and hear
strange, thrilling, heroic tales.
I would suggest that one's first
reading be ordered as follows:
first. The Lagoon, then Youth,
then Typhoon and The Nigger
of the Narcissus, and, at last,
Lord Jim. After that one will
either have convinced himself
that Conrad is not for him, or
he will rush eagerly through
the dozens of other tales of the
sea and the jungle.
Next after Conrad in my list of sea stories comes
Melville's Moby Dick-, which, having outlived the
trying experience of being filmed, still remains one
of the incomparable epics of the sea. Here again a
word of warning to those who saw John Barry-
more's impersonation of the insane Captain Ahab.
The movie was a thrilling succession of incidents,
swift and terrible, for the narrative had been lifted
from its poetic setting, condensed, cut, utterly
changed in many of the details: the original is un-
hurried; it moves to its frightful climax with the
long, slow certainty of fate. The pursuit of the
monstrous white whale takes one from sea to sea,
from adventure to adventure. The narrative is col-
ored with poetic beauty and a certain mysterious
symbolism which one feels and but half under-
stands. It is pre-eminently a book to be read slowly,
and not to have passed out to one in the swift
flashes of the movie screen.

senior engineer walks into the Military Office and
asks what these strange sounds are about, and why
he did not know of them before. The Military De-
partment, and its function as a part of the Univer-
sity, is, I dare say, the least known about of any
of the various departments in the University. It
is my purpose to give the reader a brief outline of
what happens in the little grey-stone building, and
what bearing on the engineering student these
things have.
The University of Michigan ranked first of all
universities during the war in the size of its Stu-
dent's Army Training Corps. However, with the
signing of the armistice, the unit wras quickly de-
mobilized. Through an act of congress in 1920.
under the National Defense Act, provisions were
made for the training of men interested in securing
a commission in the organized reserves. This Uni-
versity is one of the few in the country today in
which military training is not compulsory, the rea-
son for this being that the Regents of this Univer-
sity refused to establish compulsory military train-
ing in 1917 when the proposition was placed before
the regents of all colleges and universities of the
country. Consequently, here, as at Yale, provi-
sions are made for only a small percentage of the
male students in the University.
The unit here is comprised of engineering stu-
dents, chiefly, since the courses offered are par-
ticularly interesting to men who are being trained
in the technical branches of industry. For exam-
ple, the Signal Corps offers training in Communi-
cation Engineering, that is not, and cannot be, of-
fered by the Electrical Engineering Department.
The Signal Corps is perhaps the best known of all
the branches at Michigan, largely through the in-
fluence of the radio station maintained through the
combined efforts of the Signal Corps Unit, and the
Electrical Engineering Department. Similarly, the
Ordnance Department offers courses that are in-
valuable to the student interested in Mechanical.
Metallurgical, and Chemical Engineering. It may
be of interest to know that Col. Miller, the head of
the Drawing Department, and Col. White, the head
of the Chemical Engineering Department, both
held commissions during the war in this branch of
the service, and will continue to hold their com-
missions in this branch of the Organized Reserves.
Contrary to popular opinion, the courses are not

Model Home Built by Architect
A model of great interest not only to designers
but to the general public as well is being completed
by Ross T. Bittinger, Instructor of Decorative De-
sign, College of Architecture. This model is to rep-
resent a typical American home, showing the as-
sembling of household accessories from all parts of
the world, the purpose being to bring out the close

international association between modern nations in
the realms of Architecture and home furnishings.
The house is about 4 feet square, two stories high,
and complete in every detail as to accessories. Of
English type, it combines stucco and stained wood
for outside finish, and rough plaster walls are pre-
dominant inside. The completed model will be seen
through its own windows.
The model is a part of an exhibit from the Michi-
gan State Normal College at Ypsilanti that will be
shown at the World Federation of Education Asso-
ciation in Geneva. Switzerland, July 25 to August 4,
1929. It is to be exhibited in Washington, D. C.
before being shipped abroad, and after the confer-
ence is to be exhibited in several of the large cities
of the United States. It will be shown in the Archi-
tectural Building in the near future, and all those
interested are invited to visit the school at that
time.
A. S. M. E.
Continuing its very active program of the year,
the Student Branch of the A. S. M. E. held a regu-
lar meeting on the 28th of March, at which time
Mr. Prevle, Vice-President and Chief Engineer of
the Handling Systems, Inc., of Detroit, gave a talk
on "Material Handling in the Automotive Indus-
try."
On April the 3rd the Society made an inspection
tour to Jackson where it was taken through the
plant of the Sparton Radio Co. Following the Eas-
ter Recess another trip was taken, this time to Self-
ridge Field, where a flying exhibition was given.
Early in the month of May the Professional
Branch of the A. S. M. E., located in Detroit, is to
be the guest of the Student Branch at a dinner to be
held in Ann Arbor at the Union and which will be
of inerest to all those connected with the Society.

Engineers Office in Detroit spoke on the work of
the U. S. Engineers. The Major is a newcomer in
this territory, having recently succeeded Colonel
Dent, who was located in Detroit. A very inter-
esting program was presented by members of the
Student Branch, including sleight of hand tricks,
singing, dancing by men from the Union Opera, and
other entertaining events. A very good crowd was

Modernism for the
May Party
The committees in
charge of the Architects'
May Party this year are
planning to present
something quite novel in
the way of ballroom dec-
oration. They have se-
lected through a general
competition C. Wayne
Mead of the School of
Architecture to act as
designer of the wall cov-
erings and furnishings.
From a stolen glance
over his shoulders as
he worked, it could be
easily seen that his
scheme would be im-
mensely successful for
he has wisely chosen an
impressive style of de-
sign and effectively de-
veloped it.
The type of decoration
to be employed is essen-
tially modernistic, exem-
plifying a commercial
view of life. Reeling
skyscrapers, whirling
wheels a n d whistling
locomotives carry out
the spirit of incessant
industry. The orchestra
sits in the midst of the
din of screeching ma-
chines before a glowing furnace spouting fire and
smoke. The doorman guards a threatening, yet im-
pressive, entrance of revolting color and form,
while imaginary searchlights and beacons spread
floods of red and yellow over an array of ocean
liners, grinding machines and airplanes.
Unusual effects are created by a clever arrange-
ment of lights by which fire and water become real
and wheels turn. The plan is to have a continuous
footlight indirectly illuminating the room, vet em-

Spotlight
Bernard M. Cain
As Barney Cain stepped off
the train from Hastings in the
fall of 1925, and brushed the
hayseeds from his clothes, he
looked about him and concluded
that he must be in Ann Arbor—
the sign on the Railroad Station said so. He joined the
eager stream of youths who were hurrying up the State
Street hill, and soon became enrolled as a student in the
Engineering College of the University of Michigan.
Barney settled down to hard study the first semes-
ter of his Freshman year, and was rewarded with
very good grades in all his courses. At the begin-
ning of the second semester he began his first extra-
curricular activity.—he became a tryout for the staff
of the Michigan Technic.
In the fall of his Sophomore year, he was elected
to Phi Eta Sigma, Freshman Honorary Society, as a
Charter Member. At the beginning of the second
semester he was appointed Articles Editor of the
Technic, and labored unceasingly under the band of
"The Great Congo."
Barney was awarded a Donovan Scholarship to
begin his Junior year, as recognition of his high
scholastic standing. At this time he was also ap-
pointed Acting Editor of the Technic by Jack Congo,
then Managing Editor, who was stricken with paraly-
sis in Port Huron, Michigan. The competent way
in w-hich Barney took hold of Technic affairs is at-
tested to by the fine issues he put out that fall. He
was elected to Triangles, Junior Honorary Engineer-
ing Society, and to Tau Beta Pi, National Honorary
Engineering Fraternity. At the beginning of the
second semester, he was appointed Managing Editor
of the Technic.
During the fall of his Senior year. Barney was busy
with the organization of the Engineering Council, and
was Acting Chairman during its inception. He was
elected to Vulcans. Senior Honorary Engineering So-
ciety, and to Phi Kappa Phi. National Honorary
Scholarship Society. He was also elected Treasurer
of the Student Branch of the American Institute of
Electrical Engineers at this time.. Barney completed
the final organization of the Technic as a monthly,
and carried the plan through very successfully.
Barney's social fraternity is Kappa Delta Rho.
phasizing the wall treatment. A large central chan-
delier will light the dazzling colors of the ceiling,
producing a dome effect over the dance floor.
The colors of the whole scheme are brilliant and
contrasting but carefully chosen to make for a har-
monious result. The ceiling, which was designed by
Paul F. Jernegan, con-
tains blending ranges
from orange and blue to
neutral reaching up to-
ward the lighting fix-
ture. The arrangement
is pleasing and entirely
effective.
Previous May parties
have usually kept within
the limits of traditional
design, avoiding any at-
tempt at the modern
style. The 1928 party
was executed in Mayan
architecture, while the
preceding one portrayed
an Elves Garden. Mr.
Mead's plan promises a
well-needed relief from
the usual thing and gives
an excellent chance for
some clever costumes.
The work of decorating

tirely by architectural
students of the univer-
sity under the direction

A. S. M. E.
The highest h o n o r
that it can bestow was
recently conferred upon
Dean Emeritus Morti-
mer E. Cooley by the
A. S. M. E. at its an-
nual banquet held at the
Union on April 19, when
it granted him an Hon-
orary Life Membership
in the organization.
Dean Cooley has long been a regular member of
the Society; in fact, at one time he was its Na-
tional President, and during that administration
presented Charles M. Schwab with the same honor
which he himself received at this banquet. A con-
gratulatory telegram was received from Mr.
Schwab and was read at the banquet.
This was the regular annual banquet held jointly
with the Detroit Branch of the A. S. M. E. by the
Student Branch. About 125 men were in attend-

ance and witnessed the conferring of the honor
upon Dean Cooley by Mr. Alexander Dow, Presi-
dent of the Detroit Edison Company. Other speak-
ers of the evening included President C. C. Little,
Dean Effinger and Dean Sadler. Michigan feels
greatly honored in having this honor presented to
Dean Cooley, and the Technic extends to him its
heartiest congratulations.
The Student Branch held a regular meeting on
April 24 and at that time a film dealing with the
manufacture of abrasives was presented by the Car-
borundum Company. On the 27th an inspection
trip was conducted by the Society to Selfridge
Field and about 90 men availed themselves of the
opportunity presented. An inspection trip to the
Sparton Radio Co. at Jackson was also planned for
the early part of May, as well as the election of
officers.
o
Phi Kappa Phi
Seventy-six new members were elected to Phi
Kappa Phi, national scholarship and activities so-
ciety, this term. The installation banquet was held
at the Michigan Union on May 16th, at which time
an address was given by Herbert C. Sadler, Dean
of the Colleges of Engineering and Architecture.
It might be of some interest to engineers and
architects, who are contemplating a Phi Kappa Phi
pin in the future, fo knowr that a change has been
made by the local chapter in the method of select-
ing candidates from the two colleges. Formerly the
candidates were chosen from the different depart-
ments of the schools, there being several divisions,
as electrical, chemical, civil, architectural, etc., two
men being eligible from each division. Now, how-
ever, under the new ruling there are no depart-
mental distinctions and the limited number of elec-
tions are made from the individuals ranking high-
est in the group at large. This makes competition
a bit keener, and supposedly creates a more demo-
cratic method of election, as those most deserving
get the honor. So, fellows, if you want to be a
B. M. O. C, "get on the ball."
• o
Hydraulics
Professor H. W. King, instructor of hydraulics
and associated subjects concerning rivers, harbors,
drainage and irrigation, is engaged in a very inter-
esting piece of work regarding the Chicago Drain-
age Canal and the controversies which have arisen
from the divergence of water from Lake Michigan.
The drainage canal was formulated in 1892, at
which time actual construction was started, and
additional work has been done on the project up
tf) a few years ago. Ever since the canal was built
a great deal of trouble was experienced and much
legal difficulty was encountered. In 1925, Wiscon-
sin started complaint against the State of Illinois
and The Chicago Sanitary District, having Minne-
sota, Ohio and Pennsylvania as co-complainants;
later Michigan and New York states also brought
complaints against the defendants. The various
complaints state that much damage has resulted
from the diversion and that navigation and com-
merce have been materially hindered: also that fish-
ing and hunting grounds, public parks and other
enterprises have been detrimentally affected. As a
result of these litigations the Supreme Court has
given some opinions that indicate a decrease in the
present divergence of water into the Mississippi
Watershed and that the sewage must be treated by
some other disposal process.
Professor King acted as a witness for the com-
plaining states and is now engaged in research re-
garding suitable methods of disposing of excess
water from the storm sewers of Chicago in case of
heavy rains or other sources of undisposable water.
In the event that the Supreme Court decision cuts
off the divergence, a serious problem will result in
the disposal of the vast amount of rain water which
collects, and the solution of this problem, upon
which Prof. King is working, is of much impor-
tance to Chicago and its vicinity.

Aero Club
Another very interesting trip was made by sev-
eral members of the Aero Club when on April 7th,
which came during vacation, six of the fellows set
out from Wyandotte in a balloon belonging to the
Detroit Balloon Club. New York was their objec-
tive and with strong prevailing winds it looked

highly probable that they would reach their goal.
They crossed the Detroit River and continued on
over Canada after attaining sufficient altitude. The
trip over Canada was particularly beautiful and
would have been enjoyed still more except that the
wind made it quite cold, and since they were in the
air for some time, it, of course, grew rather dis-
agreeable. At last they neared the end of Lake
Erie, but the supply of gas had become consider-

TALKS FROM THE DEAN
Hind-Sight and Fore-Sight
This last number of the Technic for the school year
of 1929 suggests two thoughts; one, a backward glance
into what has happened in the past: the other, a vision
of the future.
It is always interesting, occasionally, to take a retro-
spective attitude. Sometimes there may be pleasant
thoughts, at other times decidedly the opposite, in-
cluded in our reverie: but be that as it may. the past
has added something to all of us as an increase in our
store of experience.
The Freshman. Sophomore, or Junior, have each
discovered certain things about his life and work which
should be a help and guide for the future. Some, un-
fortunately, may fall by the wayside, so far as the
University is concerned, but that is no reason why the
rut that has probably caused the stumble and ultimate
fall, should not be observed by a backward glance, so
that it may be recognized and avoided in th? roadway
ahead. Others may have run across minor obstruc-
tions, which, while not exactly causing a fall, have
tended to retard their normal progress. By an oc-
casional glance towards the earth, instead of always
carrying one's head in the air. the p.ttails might have
been avoided.
To the Senior, the past year has probably been full
of varied experiences; the dominating one being that
of graduation, combined with certain doubts and anx-
ieties as to the immediate result of his four years'
work.
Each and all have accumulated something worth
while as an experience on which to build for the future,
if a really honest attempt shall be made to eliminate
the mistakes of the past.
The immediate present must always more or less
dominate our general actions, but the one thing that
can do more towards our effectiveness or success, is
the cultivation of "vision." The old quotation, "pos-
terity has done nothing for me, and therefore I should
do nothing for posterity," while partly correct as a
statement, represents an attitude of mind, not only
pathetic in its smallness, but one that leads to stag-
nation and ultimate decay.
The coming generations of engineers must cultivate,
more than ever before, the habit of vision, or the ever
forward-looking method in all their endeavors, profes-
sional and otherwise. The past, and particularly the
past four years of those about to graduate, has simply
been the foundation, or rather part of the foundation,
on which to build in the future. One word of warning
I would give to all seniors: don't imagine that you are
now an engineer, and that your period of study is all
over. You are only just beginning, and if you wish to
get ahead, your life for some years to come must con-
tinue to be one of study. New facts, new ideas, new
discoveries, are constantly occurring, and it will mean
continued study to keep abreast of the times. While
your next few years will be spent in accumulating ex-
periences of a different kind from those you obtained
in college, and you may wonder why you cannot use
immediately many things you have learned here, re-
member that later on, when you begin to have re-
sponsibilities thrust upon you. it is then that your train-
ing will stand you in good stead.
Upon you will fall in greater or lesser degree, not
only the carrying on of the past traditions of the en-
gineering profession, but of enlarging in the future
its sphere of usefulness to mankind. Do not be con-
tent to stay in the rut that some more ambitious pi-
oneer has made—have the vision to forge ahead for
yourself.
"This is the test that is given—a minute remaining to play.
And eleven men facing eleven—and the line ten yards away.
But which is the winning eleven? Ah. they won who gave
to the game
The best that they had to be given when the test of the
crisis came!"

To Dean Cooley*
He looked at fame with open eyes
And lightly wore her crown.
He would not change for any prize
The friendship of the town.
He never bartered fellowship
For haughty pride of place,
But chose instead to make life's trip
With a smile upon his face.
He walked a comrade, near and far
With all he chanced to meet.
He would not let great Wisdom mar
With scorn his nature sweet.
The shams of life he kept at bay.
He hated small men's sneers.
He shared in all men's laughter gay
And pitied all their tears.
He loved Ann Arbor, and its men.
He loved the young and old.
He'd sit with boys, remembering when
He, too, heard adults scold.
He'd talk with sages as a sage,
And never once forgot
That there is many a truthful page
Which lies unwritten yet.
And thus he won the love of all
Who gathered round his feet.
Despite life's venom and its gall.
He kept his nature sweet
And while we boast his conquests great.
Since first his work began.
Tonight we meet to venerate
And glorify the man!

"Wanted: An Unpractical Education"
"1 have a son who is nearly thirteen years old.
... I hope he can be given through the years of
high school and college the sort of thing that is
commonly called an 'unpractical education.'. . . .
I know perfectly well that his young mind will ab-
sorb only a certain amount and that if particular
training in a too narrowly defined art be given him.
life may perpetrate one of its ghastly jokes in pre-
senting narrow opportunity along that line and big
opportunities in fields for which he has not been
trained at all. ... If he elects to take a course in
engineering. I hope that he will bring out of it a
knowledge of the conduct and behavior of materials
and of the processes by which industrial human
progress has taken place. ... I shall not, however,
be very much concerned with whether he has been
taught some particular form of valve gear or some-
body's pet formula for buttoning up a riveted joint."
These are not the words of a cloistered recluse.
Rather is their author an engineering executive in
constant touch with the stern realities of power
generation and distribution—John C. Parker, '01 K,
vice-president in charge of engineering, Brooklyn
Edison Company. The sentences quoted are culled
from a recent address to members of the Society
for the Promotion of Engineering Education.
Leaders of industry and education alike are
swinging more and more to this viewpoint. They
begin to see that a mastery of fundamental prin-
ciples with some practice in their application, plus
health, character and enthusiasm, must be the goal
of real engineering education. Thus equipped, the
graduate can grapple with and eventually conquer
almost any problem he may meet.
"The ink will not have time to dry on the stu-
dent's diploma before the quantitative facts, social
emphasis and the problems that are crying for solu-
tion shall have changed. . . . Let it be thoroughly
understood, too, that the teaching of practice may
be the teaching of obsolete or bad things. All prac-
tice contains some elements that are not worthy to
be continued, and some practice is positively wrong.
. . . The teaching of practice tends to the contin-
uation of evils rather than to the type of mind that
makes for betterments. . . . What little of prac-
tical training may be necessary can very quickly
be grasped by a young man fundamentally and
thoroughly educated, through his contacts in the
only school of practice—life itself."—Power.

Beauty and Utility in Architecture
"Architecture." according to Ruskin, "is the art
which so disposes and adorns the edifices raised by
man. for whatsoever uses, that the sight of them may
contribute to his mental health, power, and pleasure."
Ruskin's definition has held true for all styles and
periods, but today we more readily associate archi-
tecture, not only with beauty, but with utility as
well.
This does not mean that architects before our time
designed buildings solely as things of beauty. Proper
utilization of all floor space was the first problem in
which the designer had to display skill in solving, be-
fore becoming engrossed in the intricacies of adorn-
ment. No matter whether he was Greek. Roman, or
Renaissance, the architect had these two problems to
solve, and the degree of perfection to which they solved
them can be seen in their buildings which remain as
architectural gems. Every building of any period that
has architectural character has fulfilled these con-
ditions, so that even in our time if a building be erected
in a style of strict utilitarianism ; it is beautiful, it is
architecture.

ALUMNI NEWS i?
Hon. Robert Patterson Lamont
ON March 3, 1929, President-elect Herbert C.
Hoover chose Robert Patterson Lamont, of
Chicago, to fill his former position of Secre-
tary of Commerce. President Hoover desired to
have as his Secretary of Commerce a man with
engineering training and skill, and a man familiar
with, and an active participant in,
commercial enterprise.
Mr. Lamont's qualifications
showed him to be just the man
Hoover desired, and hence his ap-
pointment to the President's Cabi-
net. Mr. Lamont was a graduate
of the Engineering School of the
University of Michigan, and has
been very prominent in engineer-
ing enterprises throughout the
country. The privilege of writing
this biography is a very great
pleasure, indeed.
Mr. Robert Lamont was born in
Detroit in 1876. He was graduated
from the old Detroit Capitol High
School, which Central High has
now replaced, in 1885. In his high
school days he is recalled as a
slender, active, likeable youth, of medium height
and wearing a shock of reddish-brown hair. He
stood out among his classmates for scholarship and
industry. He was selected president of his gradu-
ating class. Two of his classmates have also be-
come prominent in later life. These men are John
Hayford, who headed the Engineering Department
of Northwestern University at Evanston, Illinois,
until his death three years ago, and Herbert Decon,
an archeologist, who was killed in North Africa
several years back.
Mr. Lamont entered the Engineering School of
the University in 1888. During his university days,
Lamont devoted himself intensely to his studies,
making excellent grades and undertaking research
work that stood him well later. He also found time
to work on the staff of the "Technic," and in 1889
was managing editor of this publication. In 1889,
there appears an article written by Lamont on the
subject, "A First Class Passenger
Coach." In this paper the object
was "not to trace the development
of the passenger car from its
former rude condition, when it was
nothing but a stage coach body set
upon wheels, to its present almost
perfect state, not to enter into any
discussion of its mechanical de-
tails, but simply to give, if possi-
ble, a general idea of the cost and
construction of a 'first class' pas-
senger car, as built by a prominent
road in this section of the coun-
try." In this article, Mr. Lamont
gives a very thorough treatment of
the subject, and several very fine
drawings are submitted and ex-
plained along with the article. In
ROBERT PATTERSON LAMONT , . . . , ....
conclusion, he states that ten cars
built in 1888, with inside finish of cherry, averaged
in cost $5,300 apiece."
Mr. Lamont was very much liked by his teachers
and they thought that he could not help but suc-
ceed after graduation. His university teachers de-
scribe him as being rather dignified, giving one the
impression of being older than other students and
more conscious of his responsibilities. Mr. Lamont
used to spend his week-ends at Detroit in the
Michigan Central Shops there.
When he was graduated from the University with
the degree of Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineer-
ing in 1891, he wrote his graduating thesis on the

In the world's forward-looking industries, a

walls nor by any other walls.
At Western Electric, the student with the
inquiring mind may carry his studies beyond
the frontiers of knowledge. The man
of action has an ever-broadening field
of endeavor. To the ultimate scope of
any one's activities there are few limits

subject of all-steel railroad car construction. Later
Mr. Lamont formed a car-building company in Chi-
cago which produced the first all-steel freight car,
now in general use.
After graduation he went
to the Michigan Central
Shops and he formed the
first class in draftsmanship
for workers ever held in
Michigan, which met under
his supervision in the eve-
nings. While working at the
shops he worked out a
method for hardening rims

gal process.
In 1892, Mr. Lamont ac-
cepted a post with the engi-
neering firm of Shailer and
Scheneilan, in Chicago, at
$100 dollars a month, where
he rose from the ranks of
the employees to partner-
ship by an unexpected ex-
ploit.
Both of his employers
were fond of hunting and at
one time went into northern
Wisconsin, leaving Lamont
in charge of the office. Dur-
ing their absence it was dis-
covered that the existing
Chamber of Commerce
tower in Chicago was un-
safe, and would have to be
torn down. Bids were
asked, and Lamont submit-
ted one, neither of the part-
ners being at hand to ad-
vise him. When they re-
turned from the hunting trip
they found not only that the
bid had been accepted, but
that Lamont had completed
the work and made a profit
of $50,000 on the contract.
He was in the Engineer-
ing Department of the
World's Fair in Chicago in
1891-1892. Since that time
he has been director in
many different business enterprises. He became
vice-president of the Simplex Railway Appliance
Company in 1897. In 1895 he became vice-president
of the American Steel Foundries. He held this posi-
tion until 1912 and has been president of that firm
ever since.
Mr. Lamont was chairman of the Hoard of the

Louis A. Vaupre, of
Kalamazoo, Mich., who
graduated from the Elec-
trical Engineering De-
partment in 192S, and
who was with the VVest-
inghouse Company until
last summer, has written
Professor A. D. Moore
a very interesting letter concerning his training
in the U. S. Air Corps at March Field, River-
side, California.
Here is the letter:
"So far, so good, and with a little more luck
I'll complete this course in flying. About 90%
of the 'undesirables' have been eliminated from
our class of cadets, and the remaining 10% are
due to leave within the next two and a half
months. I'll have straight sailing for the four
months or more of advanced training at Kelly
Field, Texas.
"Our training at present is leaving the pri-
mary stage, that is, we are starting to solo
service type ships such as De Haviland and
Douglas Observation, powered with Liberty
430 horse power motors. The previous primary
training we have received consisted of every-
thing one can do in a plane having an over-
stress factor of twelve. Since the human body
is liable to injury when subjected to accelera-
tions of eight or ten (8 or 10 //), we did all we
wanted to do.
"According to clippings which my mother
sends out, the U. of M. is more or less inter-
ested in gliding. I've never seen a glider in
operation; I'd surely like to fly one. One could
spend a pleasant afternoon in a glider if he had
some one to tow him up to about 15,000 feet
and then let loose. Regular planes come down
too fast in a glide.
"Our ground school is interesting, as they
give us a pretty fair course in aerodynamics,
navigation, construction of ships, motors, and
a goodly number of courses dealing with such
things as 'air laws' military subjects, gunnery,
etc. Some of our work will be aerial gunnery,
using a movie camera for a gun, so that our
instructors can see what we've 'shot' during
aerial battles, ground straffery, etc. We also
have aerial photography (night or day), aerial
radio practice and so on. Part of our ground
school is radio and radio code.
"I'm a Cadet Officer, so to speak, now, and
get hoarse twice a week drilling the lower class,
or 'Do Do's' as we call them. All in all, our
day is from 5 :45 A. M. to 7 P. M., so we keep
pretty busy. I'm playing tennis pretty soon, so
I'll heave the anchor now."
Griffin Wheel Company, and director of a large
number of industrial and commercial firms, includ-
ing the First National Bank of Chicago, Armour
&amp; Company, the American Radiator Company, the
Illinois Bell Telephone Com-
pany, Montgomery-Ward &amp;
Company, the International
Harvester Company, and the
Chicago Daily News Com-
pany.
In 1905 he was one of the
chiefs of construction in the
building of the Boston sub-
way. He was a trustee of
the University of Chicago
and its Art Institute, and
has given large amounts to
that school. He was also a
trustee of the Rosenwald
Industrial Museum and
vice-president of St. Luke's
Hospital.
In 1912 he was given the
degree of Master of Arts at
the University of Michigan.
He was chief of the Procure-
ment Division of the Army
Ordnance Department with
the rank of colonel in the
World War and received
the Distinguished Service
Medal. As a member of the
International Chamber of
Commerce he went to
Europe to study trade rela-
tions with the United States,
and he also served on com-
mittees having to do with
the great Mississippi flood
of 1927 and the Illinois
River drainage system.
It was in 1908 that Mr.
Lamont, a friend of Profes-
sor William Joseph Hussey
since college days, was
ready to finance the plan
for observation of double
stars in the southern skies,
which Professor Hussey,
then head of the Astronomy
Department of the Univer-
sity, and he had kept in mind for a number of years.
Mr. Lament's initial contribution was $1,000. Plans
were begun in 1910 by Mr. S. P. Langley. nephew
of the celebrated astronomer of the same name. A
contract was placed with the Alman Clark and Sons
Corporation for a twenty-four inch telescope in
1911, but so great were the difficulties of the manu-

because of the interruption of the World War, that
it was not until early in January, 1925, that the
lens, then increased in aperture to twenty-seven
inches, arrived in Ann
Arbor to prove itself on
the stars in its finished
mounting.
The site of the observa-
tory is on Navil Hill in
the town of Bloemfon-
tein, the capital of Orange
Free State, South Africa.
This site is about seven
hundred miles from Cape
Town.
The expedition sailed
for Africa in October,
1928, but Professor Hus-
sey was later attacked
by heart trouble and died
in London three weeks
later. Professor Ralph
Curtis was made head of
the expedition and Doc-
tor Rosaiter continued the
undertaking. The expedi-
tion reached Bloemfon-
tein on November 28th.
Professor Curtis super-
vised the preparation at
Ann Arbor. The design
of the dome was approved
by Professor Curtis and
the building was com-
pleted in January, 1927.
The next June observa-
tions began.
The expedition has been
planned for an eight-year
undertaking and its suc-
cess is definitely estab-
lished by an announce-
ment made by Professor
Curtis that up to March
9, 1929. 1,033 double star

made, and more have
been made since then,

A Memoriam
William C. Naylor, '22E
William C. Naylor died in
the Henry Ford Hospital
April 13, the third victim
of an air collision at the
Ford Airport. A. H. Kreid-
er. president of Kreider-
Reisner Aircraft Co., and
Capt. Alan E. T. Bruce,
chief test pilot of the Ail-
American Aircraft Co., were
also killed in the crash. Mr
Naylor was a passenger in
Capt. Kruce's plane.
It was in 1925, in the National Elimination Balloon
race, that he showed the stuff which made him pre-
eminent in a short four years. As aide to Herbert V.
Thaden, he sought to mend a rip in the balloon, despite
a terrific wind which twisted and whirled the big bag
about the field. The gas made him sick and he was
taken to a hospital, revived with a lungmotor, and then
he insisted in returning and competing in the race.
Later that same year, while piloting the Skylark in
the race for the Detroit News Balloon Trophy, he and
his aide, Kenneth W. Warren, were ducked into Lake
Erie and forced to abandon their balloon and take to a
pneumatic boat which they carried. For hours they
floated on the rough surface, alternating in blowing up
the craft and holding their fingers tight over the air
tube, for they had lost the cork. At dawn a steamer
rescued them.
This experience did not discourage Naylor, or Warren
either, for in the Elimination race in 1926, which the
Naylor-Warren team won, they set a new American rec-
ord for small balloons, traveling 410 miles and remaining
in the air for 19 hours.
In 1928 came two exciting experiences. First was a
wild ride from Pittsburgh, during the National Elimina-
tion race of that year, in which Mr. Naylor and his
aide, Russell Wherritt, won the right to represent the
United States in the international race for the Gordon
Bennett Trophy. In hail, snow, sleet and lightning the
two men flew through the night, completing a race in a
storm that killed two balloonists and in which only two
other balloons were able to survive. Half of the balloon
net was torn away when the big bag crashed into a tree,
and the final landing was made in Virginia in the top
of a 60-foot tree.
Immediately after graduating from Michigan, Naylor
went to Detroit, where he worked on motors for a short
time with two automobile companies, and then went to
the Aircraft Development Corp., where he specialized in
all-metal dirigibles. He left this employment for the
Stimson Aircraft Corp., where he was chief engineer,
going from there to take the same position with the Stout
Engineering Laboratories. He was elected president of
the Detroit Flying Club on April 1, 1928. The famous
airman was married and lived at 905 Merton Road,
Detroit.
hundred. "Double Stars"
are stars which seem to be single to the eye but
which are seen to be double under the telescope.
The purpose of the Lamont expedition is to ex-
tend the Lick observatory double star survey to
the south celestial sphere from the southern half
of the globe, in order to complete astronomical
work as has been completed in the Northern
Hemisphere.
In its research for the discovery of double stars
the university is co-operating with two other Amer-
ican universities which have observatories in South
.Africa. These are Yale
and Harvard, both of
which are engaged in a
certain branch of the
work of surveying the
southern skies. Yale Uni-
versity observatory is fif-
teen miles from the La-
mont-Hussey Observatory
(the official name of the
observatory) and is pho-
tographing the stars and
spectra at its observatory.
Harvard Observatory is
measuring the distances
of stars at its observatory
at Johannesburg, two
hundred miles distant, as
its par t of the work.
These three universities
are the only ones con-
ducting astronomical ob-
servations at the present
time in South Africa.
Three men constitute
the staff of the observa-
tory. These men are Dr.
R. A. Rossiter, '20, chief
astronomer, who is in im-
mediate charge: Morris
K. Jessup, '26, and Henry
F. Donner, '25.
Mr. Lamont has al-
lowed the erection of the
observatory, the dome,
the telescope, and all
auxiliaries incident to the
expedition. Thus far he
has donated $150,000, and
according to the prospec-
tive budget he will con-
tribute $125,000 more for
the further development
of the apparatus and for
maintaining the expedi-
tion during the next seven
years. Mr. Lamont's ad-
vice on matters of policy were also of greatest
value in forming of the project.
Mr. Lamont has contributed generously towards
many projects. One of the more recent ones was
that of a contribution of $100,000 for the Women's
League Building in 1926. This was the largest sin-
gle gift received toward the project.

for Federal Building
im-
probably one of the most interesting and attractive of the federal
buildings erected during the last year is the United States Post Office
and Court House at Madison, Wisconsin. In addition it is one of the
first in the building program resumed since the World War.
Situated in the shadow of the state capitol and only a few hundred feet
from Lake Monona, one of the four lakes which surround Madison,
the three-story building of Bedford stone has an ideal setting.
Employing the latest methods in the interior transfer of mails the Post
Office department arranged the rooms, conveying machinery and
platforms to bring about greater ease and speed in the handling of all
classes of mail.
In the main lobby, marble slabs cover the walls from the floor to a
height of eight feet. Quarter-sawed oak is the interior finish through-
out the building.
Despite other unique features found in the Madison Post Office, its
foundation of dominant strength concrete is similar to that of other
well-known building projects throughout the world — concrete mixed
by a Koehring.
The ingredients of concrete are the same in all cases but the Koehring
re-mixing action — a fundamental principle of Koehring concrete
mixers and pavers — coats every particle of sand and gravel with
cement to produce dominant strength concrete.

Mr. Lainont married Helen Gertrude Trotter, of
Chicago, in 1894. They have two daughters and a
son. The son, Robert, Jr., was decorated for serv-
ices at the front in France. The Lamonts make
their home near Lake Forest, Illinois, in a huge
structure composed largely of sections of imported
English farmhouses.
Col. Lamont severed his private business connec-
tions shortly after assuming the position of Secre-
tary of Commerce. Mr. Lamont's policy, as he
states it, is, "When a man of unusual endowment
has stayed with a job for nearly eight years as Mr.
Hoover did, he knows more about it than anybody
else. It is my intention to find out his ideas and
visions and to carry out those policies."
Secretary Lamont has many problems to solve.
But it is our opinion that Mr. Lamont is a man
who is well fitted to solve big problems.
The story of the ten talents might well be applied
to the case of Mr. Lamont. Having solved the small
problems, he has been called to solve the great
ones, and proving himself capable he has been ap-
pointed to his present position. He ranks as one of
Michigan's foremost graduates and he will no doubt
stand out still more as the years go by.

AFTER forging, the next step in the prep-

Ball Bearings is to relieve all internal
strains ... to refine the grain and to soften the
steel to a point where it may be readily machined.
The grain is refined by normalizing in the
batteries of oil-fired furnaces shown above where
a relatively high temperature is maintained uni-
form by the use of electric pyrometers.
After a precisely determined time the forgings
are removed and allowed to cool in air. This
operation removes the heterogeneous structure
of the steel and puts it in the best possible
condition for annealing.

Annealing is required to soften the steel and
eliminate strains from forging. This heat treat-
ment brings the forgings to a temperature just be-
low the hardening or critical range of the steel and
holds this temperature for a relatively long time.
Through special processes unique with this
company the steel is spheroidized—or brought to
a structure of minute spheres. By this method
can New Departure's special analysis, high carbon

NEW AIRCRAFT COWLING
(Continued from page 8)
inders becomes a region of a greater negative pres-
sure than before, which is due primarily to the air-
flow separating from the body because of the dis-
tributing influence of the cylinders; this naturally
causes an increase in drag.
From this latter point of view it is apparent that
the action of the cowling is that of a medium to
equalize pressures. Air is taken in at the region of
positive pressure, which is at the immediate nose of
the fuselage, and released at the rear of the cowling
into a region of negative pressures. It is then seen
that any factor or group of factors which act to
decrease the region of negative pressures or suction
will also cause a decrease in drag.
With the above analysis in mind one can readily
perceive that any reduction in drag resulting from
the use of the new cowling is effected by its action
on that portion of the fuselage back of the engine
and the cowling itself. Therefore, since the cowling
is dependent upon the comparative streamlining
and roughness or smoothness of the sections for its
effectiveness in the reduction of drag, the form of
the fuselage becomes a prime factor in obtaining
the best results with the use of the new cowling.
The X. A. C. A", cowling in its present form em-
bodies the results of a long series of experiments
conducted at Langley Field. The combined unit
consists of an outer cowling or hood and an inner
cowling and deflectors.
The problem faced in the design of the inner
cowling was to provide a smooth-faced surface for
the accelerated air to form a streamline flow past
the cylinders, and yet leave enough exposed cylin-
der for proper cooling. The preliminary tests were
run with an uncowled engine in the nose of the
fuselage. A temperature average taken from the
cylinder heads of the five hottest cylinders was
used as a basis of judging the cooling effects of
the various cowlings used in the tests. This lim-
ited temperature average was necessarily employed
since in almost every test two or three of the cyl-
inders had very low temperatures. The cylinder
temperatures recorded were approximately 100°
higher than those found in actual flight tests, due
mainly to the temperature conditions in the wind
tunnel which were much higher than those encoun-
tered in flights over the surrounding locality.
The new internal cowling reached its maximum
effectiveness in a design covering the crankcase and
slightly less than one-half of each cylinder. This
reduced the cylinder head temperatures of the five
hottest cylinders an average of 70° F. but did not
alter the temperature of the cylinder barrels and oil.
After this development, it was decided to conduct
several tests using only the external cowling or
hood over the engine. There was a large opening
through the slots, without disturbing the streamline
in the front which permitted a large volume of air
to flow past the uncowled engine, and out through
a circular slot formed at the juncture of the hood
and the fuselage. The action of the latter is simi-
lar to that of a wing slot, since both tend to remove
nose for the purpose of engine cooling, and released
from the use of this type of hood and slot was the
ease with which the air was taken in through the
the boundary layer of air. An advantage resulting;
flow about the fuselage. It was noted, however,
that the cylinder head temperatures became exces-
sive after a short run with the use of this external
cowling, which caused further tests to be discon-
tinued.
It was then decided to conduct a series of tests
in which both the internal and the external cowl-
ings were used to cover the engine, so that the air
could be directed more at the cylinder heads and
yet have a smooth flow past the engine. There was
a slight improvement in the cooling of the cylinder
heads, but they were still much too hot. This w as

Spring or What Have You?
Spring is here—the season when flowers bloom
and youths' fancy turns lightly to thoughts of love.
It is the season of the year when campus politicians
sow their seed of graft,
but to the student of
Engineering it is a season
of endless toil. Birds may
be singing in the trees, but
the engineer must be con-
tent with the droning mel-
ody of chanting profs. The
river may beckon on swel-
tering days, yet he must be
strong and remain faithful
to his uncompromising mis-

Balmy nights and golden
moons may tempt him, yet
they shall not divert his con-

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
NEW AIRCRAFT COWLING
(Continued from page 28)
noted especially with cylinders Nos. 2, 3, 8, and 9,
which on the J-5 engine are situated just back of
the magnetos, and so deprived of their share of air
for cooling. As a remedy for this it was thought
to enlarge the opening in the nose and at the same
time decrease the outlet area. This seemed not very
satisfactory, for the same cylinders were still run-
ning too hot, showing that they were not receiving
their full share of air for cooling.
Further improvement was made by the use of
deflectors, the function of which was to direct the
air toward the hottest part of the cylinders, which
were found to be at the rear. There was a small
reduction in the average temperature, but still not
enough. Cut-outs in the hood around the magne-
tos were then thought of as being the best means
for cooling the affected cylinders. Even with fairly
large cut-outs the cylinder barrel temperatures were
still running higher than those of the uncowled
engine. In a further effort to reduce the barrel and
cylinder head temperatures, the slot was moved
back a little and the slope of the inner cowling
made more gradual.
After various attempts to improve the function-
ing of the deflectors, which were found to help the
cooling problem somewhat, a design was worked
out whereby each deflector directed most of the air
between each two cylinders to the hot rear portion
around the exhaust valves and rear spark plug
bosses. A combination was finally devised incor-
porating the improvements, which when subjected
to testing, gave very satisfactory cylinder head and
cylinder barrel temperatures, even in comparison
with those of the uncowled engine. It should be
noted that there was an increase in drag of 11 lbs.
at 100 m.p.h. due to the necessity of proper cooling
provision.
The most noteworthy result of the drag tests was
the large reduction in drag obtained with only the
external cowling covering the entire engine. The
drag of a bare fuselage without engine and the nose
rounded is 40 lbs. at 100 m.p.h.; with the uncowled
engine in place the nose drag increased to 125 lbs.;
with both internal and external cowlings over the
engine the drag is only 75 lbs. The conclusion
gathered from the drag test data as stated in N. A.
C. A. Technical Note No. 301 were:
1. The drag of an average sized cabin fuselage
with the engine removed and the nose rounded is
tripled by placing an uncowled J-5 engine on the
nose.
2. With the conventional forms of cowling, in
which a portion of the cylinders and valve gear is
exposed, the drag becomes less as the cowling is
increased, but even in the most extreme cases the
reduction amounts to only about 23 per cent of the
increase in drag due to an uncowled engine.
3. A spinner, if used in front of a radial engine,
decreases the drag but a small amount, and has an
almost negligible effect on the performance of an
airplane.
4. With a cowling which covers the entire en-
gine (internal and external together) and separates
the cooling air from the general flow about the
body, the reduction in drag is about 60 per cent of
the increase due to an uncowled engine.
5. The use of a cowling similar to the latter
seems entirely practical as regards both cooling and
maintenance under service conditions. It must be
carefully designed, however, to cool properly.
An example of the performance improvement
induced by the use of the combined cowling may
be shown by the following comparison. An air-
plane powered with a Wright "Whirlwind" J-5
engine requires 200 hp. to fly horizontally at 125
m.p.h.; with only the internal cowling, 196 hp.; but
with both cowlings in place requires only 167 hp.
to attain the speed of 125 m.p.h. From this it can
be concluded that an airplane fitted with the com-
bined cowling can fly at 125 m.p.h. with the engine
throttled more than 100 r.p.m. from the revolution
speed necessary for the uncowled engine.
It should be noted that for maximum practica-
bility the nose piece should be constructed in two
or three easily detachable sections to permit fre-
quent access for engine repair.
The Lockheed Aircraft Company was the first to
adopt the new N. A. C. A. cowling for their air-
planes. The results as exemplified in the remark-
able transcontinental flight by Capt. Frank Hawks,
made in a Lockheed "Air Express" equipped with
the new cowling, completely justifies its adoption.
In the first tests conducted by the Lockheed
Company, it was found that whereas before, 160
m.p.h. was the maximum speed attained with the
conventional cowling, a speed of 180 m.p.h. was ob-
tained with the new cowling installed, an increase
of 20 m.p.h. Trouble was encountered, however,
in the form of high oil temperatures which was
feared would become harmful to the motor if al-
lowed to continue. The defect lay in the design
of the exhaust system. The exhaust collector ring
was then removed from its place inside the inner
cowl to the space in between the two cowls. Though
this proved fairly satisfactory, it was thought safer
to replace the collector ring with short stacks ex-
tending from the cylinders out through the rear
slot of the cowling.
With the data gathered from the practical tests
made by the Lockheed Company, The Pitcairn Air-
plane Company decided to equip their "Mailing"
models with the same type of cowling. Not only
is this type of cowling adaptable to single-engined
airplanes but it has been found to give fairly satis-

THE AMBASSADOR BRIDGE
(Continued from page *!)
ly that it was found imperative to completely tear
out the cables, which, at the time of the discovery
of this enormous misfortune, were completely in-
stalled. It is this harmless appearing process of
zinc coating which has given rise to the most
discouraging and costly problem with which the
engineers of this bridge have yet had to grapple.
At this writing the work of removing the cables
has just gotten well under way.
The placing of the wires which form the cables
from anchorage to anchorage and over the tops
of the towers in exact calculated length and exact-
ly parallel, is one of the most interesting and highly
specialized developments of American bridge con-
struction. The general methods were invented by
John A. Roebling for the construction of the Brook-
lyn Bridge, and have been refined and developed
in the construction of each succeeding long span
suspension bridge.
The suspended structure of the 1850-foot main
span comprises two elements—the floor and the
stiffening trusses. The stiffening trusses are the
principal item of interest. Their function is to
prevent the undulations which would occur in the
cables during the passage of heavy separated loads
across the bridge. On early suspension bridges,
most of which were calculated with railroad
precedents in mind, these stiffening trusses were
designed with a depth of about 1 /45th of the span,
which in the case of this bridge would be about
41 feet, a height so great as to necessitate bracing
their tops together with an overhead system of
steel laterals. Study of suspension bridge prin-
ciples, including newer and more adequate methods
for the computation of their stresses, has proven
that, for highway traffic only, substantially lesser
depths are in every respect satisfactory. This has
led, for the Detroit International Bridge, to the
adoption of a depth of truss of 22 feet, which both
improves the appearance of the bridge and makes
possible the elimination of all overhead bracing.
Such bracing could not have failed to give the user
of the bridge, particularly as he drove toward the
main span from either side, the feeling of passing
into and through a tunnel, and would have been
definitely less pleasing than the more modern type
which has been adopted for this bridge. These
trusses are to be built, like the main towers, of
structural silicon steel—the metallurgist's modern
contribution toward economy in long span bridges
-—providing a fifty per cent increase in strength
and carrying capacity at little additional cost per
pound.
The sections between the main towers and
anchorages are occupied by two series of deck
truss spans, six in number on the United States
side and five on the Canadian side, the respective
distances being 972 feet and 817 feet. This inequal-
ity of anchorage distance is due to the location
of streets and important private properties on the
Detroit side of the river. On the United States
side these truss spans are necessarily located
where the tracks and other structures in the rail-
road yards permit. On the Canadian side, they
are free from such restrictions, and are placed to
create equality of spans and simplicity of appear-
ance. On these truss spans, as well as on the
approaches, the structure is open to the sky.
The approach on the United States side is 1,480
feet long, and on the Canadian side 2,420 feet long.
This difference is occasioned by the choice of ap-
propriate and available locations for adequate ter-
minal areas. These approaches are of a standard
type of deck plate girders, supported at intervals
on steel columns and spanning all streets and alleys
with ample clearances. All paving is of concrete
on these steel structures, with an asphalt surface,
except on the steeper grades, where the surfacing
is of granite blocks.
An international bridge requires terminals of
greater size than an intrastate or interstate bridge,
because of the necessity of inspection by Customs
and Immigration departments. These terminals
will provide an adequate number of collection
booths and inspection shelters to handle as many
streams of entering or leaving traffic as the bridge
will accommodate. The Detroit terminal will
cover an area of six acres, and the terminal in
Sandwich an area of seven and one-half acres. The
detention areas in the terminals have a parking
capacity of 300 vehicles undergoing or awaiting
examination without obstructing any of the main
lanes of traffic. It is estimated that 5,000 vehicles
per hour can be handled through either terminal.
The bridge will be illuminated by a modern sys-

THE Flo School of Flying is plan-
ned and operated for those who
demand the finest type of flying in-
struction. Personnel, equipment and
facilities all measure up to this high
standard, so that every student grad-
uated by our organization is an excel-
lently trained pilot. The Flo School
of Flying has a successful record and
is highly endorsed by leading Detroit
business men who have taken the
course, and army air corps officials.
Personnel
The president of the Flo Flying Serv-
ices Inc., Leonard S. Flo, is the chief
instructor of the Flo School of Fly-
ing. Nationally known as a pilot,
a graduate of the Army Training
Schools at Brooks and Kelly Fields,
with a year of service with the First
Pursuit Group at Selfridge Field and
extensive air-mail and commercial
flying experience, he is admirably
fitted from the standpoint of prac-
tical knowledge to direct the flying
school activities. He is assisted by a
competent staff of conscientious,
licensed pilots who were chosen for
their dependability and training.
Equipment
New Spartan and Arrow Sport
planes, powered by modern air-
cooled, radial engines are the
standard training planes. Particu-
larly well adapted to training pur-
poses, they offer the student open
cockpit flying experience plus a
maximum degree of safety. In
addition, students are given time
on closed types.
Facilities
Training at either of two fields is
available to students of the Flo
School of Flying. Haggerty Field,
conveniently located with respect
to Detroit at Ford Road and Wyom-
ing Avenue. And the Ann Arbor
Municipal Airport, Ann Arbor,
Michigan, which is the main base
of operations for the Flo Flying
Services Inc.
Airplane Distributors
Flo Flying Services Inc. are Michi-
gan and Ohio distributors for Spar-
tan and Arrow Sport planes. In-
spect these outstanding planes at
either of our two flying fields and
learn about our course!.
For your convenience, in Ann

ably diminished and it looked as though they might
be blown out over the lake and would not be able
to land safely, so it was finally decided to attempt
a landing then. With a 30 mile an hour ground
wind blowing, it was a rather difficult task to land
the balloon safely, and George Hineman, the pilot,
would have succeeded, but as they neared the
ground, a sudden jerk threw one of the members
out of the basket and, of course, the balloon imme-
diately shot skyward due to the sudden decrease in
weight. At last Hineman did succeed in bringing
the ship down, but not until it had been dragged
along the ground for a considerable distance. The
one member who fell out was not seriously hurt,
and after a little first aid treatment was quite re-
vived. The landing was made at St. Catherine.
Ontario, which is about seven miles from Niagara
Falls, and only after they had been in the air for
eight and a half hours.
The members who took the trip, in addition to
Hineman, were Floyd Kaufman, '29E; Larry Bell,
'29E; Harold Hoekstra, "29E: Pete Chadman, '29E;
and Jack Gray, Spec. After taking care of the bal-
loon the party returned to Ann Arbor safely by
land.
The Society is planning its annual banquet to be
held the 1st of May at the Union, and plans have
been made to bring several important men here for
the occasion, including Mr. Edward S. Evans, Mr.
Stout of the Stout Aircraft Co., Eddie Ricken-
backer and Eddie Stinson. Those in charge are ex-
pecting a good attendance, and this should prove a
very fitting conclusion to the splendid activities of
the organization during the past year.

Impressions of Second All-American Air-craft
Show
By Will Ross, '31E
During the week of April sixth to thirteenth, in-
clusive, there was held in Convention Hall, Detroit,
an exhibition of the most outstanding developments
in aircraft and accessories, an event that will be
long remembered in aeronautical history. Analo-
gous to the well advertised auto shows, the air
show comes as an inevitable and distinct step for-
ward in the march of transportation, a promise of
the coming importance and greatness of the air
transportation industries.
Stepping from windy Woodward Avenue through
the entrance of Convention Hall, the writer became
immediately confused, and found it necessary to
stop and consider which direction would prove the
best to start his tour, for on all sides were aircraft,
large and small, business planes, sport models, neat
color combinations, and all that host of other things
that thrill the neophyte of aviation. Finally, deter-
mining the most advantageous course, the round of
the show was begun, and it was not long before all
sense of time and place was lost in admiration of
the wonderful things gathered in this one spot.
Predominant, of course, were the planes pro-
duced by Mr. Ford and his Motor Company, for
Detroit is the home of that great project, and pro-
vides ample ground for experiment and develop-
ment through the services of the justly famous
Ford-Stout Airport, which was, incidentally, in gala
dress for the occasion and during the air show
knew hardly a moment of peace during the better
weather, for at all times planes were either taking
off or making three point landings on the broad
tracks provided. The best of the Ford exhibits was
the huge cabin monoplane, powered by three whirl-
wind motors and made entirely of metal. It was in-
deed a fine sight in its polished corrugated dress,
and received the admiration that it justly deserved.
Next to the Ford monoplane stood the Fokker
product, similar in many respects to the Ford plane,
but to the author's mind, better looking, and to all
appearances, better built, at least as far as luxury is

concerned. The metal tri-blade propellers of the
Fokker were most interesting in. design, and a
whole volume could be written about them and
their fittings upon the power plant.
Manufacturers from all parts of the United States
and Canada, as well as several from abroad, showed
examples of their products, and clever devices
abounded. Most impressive among the exhibits
were those of the American Eagle Aircraft Corpo-
ration, of Kansas City; the Wright Company, of
Paterson, X. J.; the exhibition of Eddie Stinson,
Command-Aire, and the Eastman people of Detroit.
Numerous others of unquestionable merit ex-
hibited, and it is more than probable that names
not mentioned here will be among the leaders in
years to come. It would be quite unfair to leave
out the Heath exhibit, for under that banner were
to be found two of the smallest planes to be seen
at the show.
The American Eagle Corporation obligingly
stripped down a ship, leaving only the skeleton and
the controls. This exhibit seemed to draw a great
deal of attention, for it is true that the layman,
though interested in his small way in the airplane,
is not conversant with the operation of the differ-
ent controls, and to be able to reach into the frame-
work of the plane and manipulate the control stick
and wires, and see the rudder move, or a bony wing
change, certainly appealed to the small crowed that
was always around the exhibit. This same company
displayed a very fine cabin monoplane, as well as
iwo or three types of sport planes, one of w-hicK
was equipped with folding wings.
The Heath Company rather starred their exhibit
by displaying two planes that were scarcely more
than toys. The larger of these had an overall length
of only sixteen feet, and was powered by a four-in-
line motor, similar in design to that seen in a Ford
car but smaller and of much finer construction.
The smaller plane, called the "Baby Bullet," was
but thirteen feet long, not as large as the experi-
mental gliders used by the university. The engine
was of a "semi-whirlwind" variety, if one may be
allowed to call it that, and the tiny propeller seemed
hardly adequate to lift the plane, to say nothing of
the pilot. This remarkable monoplane, with wheels
on the landing gear of a diameter not over twelve
inches, is advertised as having a landing speed of
from 28 to 35 miles an hour, a quite safe speed for
so small a plane.
Numerous companies took up wall space and ad-
vertised all sorts of wares pertaining to aircraft.
Literature advertising everything, from patent oil
pumps to comfortable wicker furnishings made no
further from our Alma Mater than Ypsilanti, was
literally shoved at one. Parachutes were displayed
in proximity to the insurance booth, and oil com-
panies beyond count advertised their special air-
craft products. Gliders similar to those owned and
operated by the University of Michigan Glider Club
were displayed, and the University of Detroit, not
to be outdone, showed off a complete air tunnel
unit at least twelve feet long.
The Western Electric Company had an interest-
ing display of units for airplane signal communica-
tion. The sending and receiving units together did
not weigh thirty pounds, and the tiny generator
used to supply the plate circuits of the set could
not have w-eighed more than three or four pounds.
This small dynamo is equipped with a single blade
propeller mounted in front upon a spring that al-
lows the blade to turn as wind pressure increases,
thus causing the same number of revolutions per
minute, no matter how fast the wind is blowing.
Controls of the set are reduced to a minimum, and
although no standard aerial has been developed to
date, the models displayed in Detroit have func-
tioned well with several different types.
To climax the air show, a visit to the airport
proved money and time well spent. Airplanes of
every description, and some beyond description,
were to be found here, all wheeled out of the spa-
cious hangars and lined up as for parade. Con-
tinually throughout the daylight hours the steady
drone of ascending, descending and warming planes
could be heard, and if one was interested the study
of the technique of flying could Here be studied at
close range.
It is becoming more evident as time advances,
and especially so since the last Detroit air show,
that thought of safety in purchase of a plane may
now be abandoned to thought of beauty. The pros-
pective buyer may now look around him for the
best looking, the most economical, and the longest
wearing plane just as he would do with a new
automobile, and have the assurance of knowing
that his final selection will in all probability have
the certificate.of government standard tests behind
it, for in the age of coming competition no manu-
facturer can afford to overlook this valuable credit.
The writer is tempted to note that in the not so far
future there will be used plane marts doing as great
a business as the used car marts of the present do.
(May God forbid, if the planes are in any way like
the cars!) And perhaps it will not be so very long
before collegiate models will be seen, very much
inscribed with the type of popular sayings so often
discovered upon disreputable cars seen on the mod-
ern college campus.

The Department of Engineering Re-
search of the University of Michigan is de-
signed to assist the industries of the State
in placing at their disposal the entire scien-
tific resources of the University.
It is not organized for the mere running
of routine tests or the solution of minor
shop problems, but for the exhaustive study
and investigation of scientific manufactur-
ing problems critical to the progress of for-
ward looking industries.
Through this Department the manufac-
turer may secure the service of trained
scientists, special laboratories, library facili-
ties and testing equipment of exceptional
sort, and the sustained and thorough qual-
ity of research work which is to be found
in a great university.
Under the present generous patent ar-
rangements, clients of the Department may,
by the payment of a somewhat higher serv-
ice charge, secure the benefits to be derived
from all inventions, patents and patentable
processes resulting from the investigations
made in their behalf.
All problems submitted to the Depart-
ment should be addressed to the Director.
Such problems will be carefully studied and
only those will be undertaken in which it is
felt that the Department may be of service
to the prospective client. The regular serv-
ice charge for such work is thirty per cent,
based on labor.

RAPID TRANSPORTATION
(Continued from page 7)
highways are located along the meandering wagon
roads which lead through and go from village to
village. These modern highways not only conform
to the crooked course of the former wagon roads
which had their origin a century ago, but their
grades are up hill and down dale, following ap-
proximately the old grades.
In the design of the structure, it is for two way
traffic, the hard surface seldom exceeding twenty
feet in width, the top surface of which is full of ir-
regularities, numerous cracks and soft spots which
have permitted the surface wearing away. Few-
railways are crossed at other than grade and no
highway crossings or cowpaths have their grades
separated. Under such conditions as have just been
described it is to be wondered, that an average road
speed of forty miles per hour is possible and that
the automobile accidents are so small in number. A
careful study reveals that the failure of automobile
travel to meet the ideal conditions is found almost
entirely in the road. Our present hard surfaced
highways are entirely inadequate and because of
fundamental defects in location, design and con-
struction, cannot be reconstructed to sufficiently
serve the present demand for rapid passenger trans-
portation.
Recognizing the demand for rapid passenger
transportation and that the automobile, excepting
for only slight refinements and modifications, is
capable of sustained speeds from eighty to one
hundred miles per hour, an inquiry is at once di-
rected to what is needed as a highway to meet the
present demands. A brief specification will be
given and for the purpose of better illustrating the
elements we will consider such a road running from
the corporate limits of Detroit to the corporate
limits of Chicago.
A road which will not pass through the corporate
boundary of any city, town or village. If this be-
comes necessary, then by an elevated roadway.
A fenced right of way the whole distance.
The alignment and rate of grade to be such that
the minimum distance at which an automobile can-
not be seen to be 2,000 feet. All railway, highway,
street and private crossings between the corporate
limits of Chicago and Detroit to be separated. A
one-way road in each direction with a minimum
width of twenty-four feet.
At intermediate points where provision is made
for entering and leaving the roadway that the sur-
face be widened to forty feet for a distance of 2.000
feet.
A surface which is smooth and at no time has
a variation which can be detected when driving at
a speed of one hundred miles per hour.
Adequate signals, policing, and such.
On such a highway the elapsed time for an auto-
mobile traveling between Detroit and Chicago, a
distance a little less than 300 miles, would be a lit-
tle under five hours, compared with the elapsed
time of the airplane of four hours.
A comparison between the airplane and the auto-
mobile traveling between Detroit and Chicago mak-
ing intermediate stops of one hour each at Jack-
son, Battle Creek, Kalamazoo, Niles and Michigan
City is very interesting. Such a comparative study
is shown below. The airplane "road" speed is taken
at 100 miles per hour with consumed time from the
business centers to the airports as follows: Detroit
30 minutes, Jackson, Rattle Creek, Kalamazoo,
Xiles and Michigan City at 20 minutes each, and
Chicago 40 minutes. The average road speed of
the automobile is taken at 80 miles per hour, with
an addition for time consumed entering or leaving
Detroit and Chicago and intermediate cities the
same as that consumed by the passenger, when go-
ing from the center of the cities to the airports, and
the boarding and getting under way of the airplane,
which is more time than will actually be needed by
the automobile.
For the airplane—
Time consumed going to and from the airport:
Detroit 30 minutes
Chicago 40
5 intermediate towns 200
Total 270
300 miles at 100 m.p.r. 180
Total 450
For the automobile—
Time consumed entering and
leaving towns 270
300 miles at 80 m.p.r. 225
Total 495
W ith a difference of total elapsed time of only
45 minutes, there seems to be little doubt as to
w hich vehicle would be used in such a trip as de-
scribed above. Such a road would not only be
available for the rapid transportation of passengers
from intermediate points to the two termini, but
also between the intermediate points.
Some one may say that the elapsed time for the
airplane between termini can and will be reduced
by having landing fields atop of our business blocks,
but this has no tangibility other than the mere sug-
gestion. W ere this to come about it would require
the traveler to consume time from his house to the
down town landing field and back home again,
which time could be used traveling by automobile
toward, or returning from, his destination. The
safety of such road speeds for automobiles may be

raised and attention called to the large number of
accidents now occurring on our roads. A study of
these accidents leads to the suggestion that they
are due, in a large measure, to the character of the
road over which the traffic is now passing. It is
even ventured that operating automobiles at 80
miles per hour upon such a highway as above de-
scribed, would tend to reduce the number of acci-
dents rather than to increase them over those occur-
ring at the present time.
It should here be said that only the highest praise
should be accorded to those who have had the vi-
sion and courage to develop the airplane industry,
and this industry should receive our full support in
its every effort. However, when we study sub-
jects such as this, we should give full recognition
to all facts, regardless of any special interests. It
seems equally pertinent to say that though our pres-
ent roads, in both design and construction, are in no
way equal to the service of rapid passenger trans-
portation, we who are thoroughly familiar with
their history have nothing but the highest praise
for the men who designed and constructed them and
what is said here is in no way a reflection upon
their work or professional ability. No one could
have done better.
In closing this brief paper we cannot avoid the
conclusion that the demand for, and the conditions
of rapid passenger transportation are unequivocal,
that the airplane at this time cannot meet the con-
ditions and we do not see in the immediate future
any prospects of it being able to meet the require-
ment, that the automobile as a vehicle is adequate,
or with little refinement can be made adequate to
furnish the service but is prevented because of the
design and construction of our roads.
o
THE METAL ART
(Continued from page 9)
wrought iron.
Wrought iron, a significant term, but how many
can define it or identify it by comparison with
steel? It puzzles even the experienced. Quite a
number of years ago in one of the many debates
among wrought iron and steel manufacturers on
the relative merits of their products, one of the
veterans made a rather keen statement, which was
very amusing to his audience when he defined
"Wrought iron as being merely made up of fibers
and layers of cinder surrounded by metal." This
definition acknowledges the importance of welding
cinder flux, and it states precisely the difference
between wrought iron and the rest of the metal
family, which is practically free from cinder or
slag impregnation. There is much evidence to
prove the existence of these fibers and layers in
a definite order and arrangement. Due to forging
and rolling, they are all parallel to each other, and
with the microscope it has been proven that good
pieces of wrought iron which did not materially
corrode during decades and even centuries of ex-
posure but merely were covered with a dense and
somewhat coherent surface layer of rust had the
cinder fibers spaced apart at least .0029 inch, quite
often, however, as close as .00093 inch. The thick-
ness of the cinder fibers or layers varies between
.00012 to .0055 inch. Due to the fact that these
threads are non-corrodable, they exercise a peculiar
and protective function, since water cannot pene-
trate every pore structure. Thus the adaptability
of wrought iron to withstand corrosion makes it a
highly valuable medium of expression.
Since this distinction between wrought iron and
soft steel has not long been noted, much work
done in the latter is called by the former name,
since even the craftsmen were unaware of the
difference. Of soft steel, then, are the five sets
of so-called wrought iron gates, unique in that
they are ornamented with figures representing the
exhibits in rooms in the corridors before which
they are placed, have been set up in the University
Museum Building. The gates are the gift of Otto
H. Hans of Ann Arbor, and were fashioned by
Elmer D. Wood and his son, Roscoe L. Wood,
an instructor in the College of Architecture. Each
set of gates graphically introduce the visitor to
the exhibits which stand in rooms in the corridor
behind it, those pictured here represent insects.
It is to R. L. Wood that I am indebted for much
of the information on these pages. He pointed out
that in reality soft steel had been used and a spe-
cial rust proof varnish guarantees their durability.
The gates are hand forged from bar and sheet
stock, and the details are beaten in repousse—the
process explained previously. Structural parts on
the gate proper are forged, welded, and an acety-
lene torch is used in joining parts of the decorative
panels. Mr. Wood explained that in the United
States there is no known rust-proof iron or steel.
Lacquering is the best finish to insure withstand-
ing weather conditions, but little is needed when
the gates are indoors. At Birmingham, Michigan,
a particularly lovely wrought iron clock adorns the
dining hall of the Cranbrook School, the gift of
Mr. and Mrs. George G. Booth. Work on the
hands was done by the Woods.
A recent magazine in the field of art is devoted
entirely to the metal craft. "Metal Arts—A Jour-
nal for Architects, Decorators, and Craftsmen in
Metal" has been issued since November, 1928, and
anyone particularly interested in this field will find
this a valuable source of information.

WHAT SHALL I READ?
(Continued from page 11)
For those to whom Moby Dick holds a fascina-
tion and a meaning, the new life of Melville, by
Lewis Mumford, which has but recently come from
the press will be of great service in interpreting the
significance and poetic symbolism of the book. In
itself and for itself this biography is worth read-
ing, for it is a rather belated tribute to an American
genius who is now recognized as having made a
permanent contribution to American literature.
It is a useful and profitable thing in connection
with the reading of these works of romantic fiction
to read also that painstaking record of a two-years
cruise around the world left us in Dana's Two
Years Before the Mast. It is filled with authentic
detail, which has given it the value of a text book
for English midshipmen. And yet it has illuminat-
ing flashes that vivify the life on shipboard as al-
most no other book I know. It is interesting, too,
to read Lubbock's Round the Horn Before the
Mast, David Bone's The Brassbonder, William
McFee's Casuals of the Sea, Jack London's The
Sea Wolf and The Cruise of the Snark, and now,
latest of all, A. J. Villier's Falmouth for Orders and
Joan Lowell's The Cradle of the Deep. Perhaps I
should also mention two of Cooper's which are little
read, apparently overshadowed by The Leather
Stocking Tales, The Red Rover, and The Pilot,
which are well worth adding to the list.
Perhaps the sea tale I have loved longest and still
love to read best is one which I hesitate to mention
or commend here for fear of admitting the genera-
tion to which I belong. Things Greek seem so re-
mote from the jazz age in which we life. Yet after
all the story of Odysseus's wanderings about the
"wind tossed, wine-dark sea" has outlived the ages,
and still keeps its naive charm. No experience was
ever quite like the thrilling puzzle of piecing the
amazing tale together from the original Greek. But
fortunately for those who do not read Greek there
is a translation that is almost as beautiful as the
original. Professor Palmer's translation of The
Odyssey is an almost perfect translation. One can
almost catch the full flavor of the Homeric verse.
Having read the Homeric story, it forms an inter-
esting commentary to read Richard Haliburton's
The Great Adventure, in which an amazing Amer-
ican boy sets out to retrace the voyage of Odysseus
and does it, of course, being a resourceful American
boy. I will admit I was not exactly thrilled by the
account of The Great Adventure. Its exuberant
youthful enthusiasm wearied me. But after all it is
the realization of the dream which every imagina-
tive boy has had when he first read his Homer. As
such, one can at least regard it with some envious
interest.
Perhaps I have laid out too extensive a program
for anyone to follow in its entirety, but for those
who love the sea it will be only a fair beginning.

point out the fact that the requirement to enter
the Signal Corps, for example, is that the student
be enrolled in the Electrical course, or courses that
are so closely allied as to be able to promote an
understanding of the problems with which he will
have to meet before completing his course and se-

However, I do not wish to be misconstrued on
the point of drill and an understanding of fire-arms.
If the War Department did not feel that drill was
an essential part of the training of an officer, I am
sure that part of the program would be omitted.

IMPROVING
BLASTING PRACTISE
ACCIDENTS are costly. Most of
them are avoidable. They are usually
the result of bad practises. To avoid
them we must know the causes.
Records kept by the U. S. Bureau
of Mines show that improper storage,
handling, or use, are responsible for
nearly all accidents with explosives.
Improper storage may involve damp
or unventilated magazines, or simply
the failure to enforce a system requir-
ing that the oldest powder or deto-
nators in the magazine shall be used
before later shipments, to avoid un-
reasonably long storage of any
explosive.
Improper handling and use include
a greater number of unsafe or ineffi-
cient methods than can be enumerated
in one advertisement. However the
principal ones will be discussed in
detail in a series of advertisements of
which this is the first. We are publish-
ing this series in the hope that it may

student. This point is an extremely desirable one
in the engineer's, as well as other college student's
assets. The Military Department is the only de-
partment in the University offering practical in-
struction in command and leadership. It seems
perfectly obvious that an engineer, regardless of
how well he may be educated, and intelligent he
may be, without that intangible something we call
"leadership" cannot present his ideas in as clear and
as forcible a manner as his ideas may be worthy
of presentation. President W. S. Gifford of the
American Telegraph and Telephone Company said
in an interview with one of his engineers, that he
considered Military Training equal in importance,
to any of the technical work he had during his col-
lege course.
A point that is frequently misunderstood is that
of requirements and financial compensation. I have
mentioned something of the scholastic requirements
for the Signal Corps, and Ordnance Department.
To gain admission to the Infantry, the basic branch
of the service, it is only necessary that the student
be a regularly enrolled student in the University.
To receive a commission it is necessary to complete
a course outlined to cover four years.—the normal
period devoted to pursuit of a degree. Frequently,
however, ft becomes necessary to "double-up" on
some of the basic work. That is. it makes it pos-
sible for a sophomore entering the Military Depart-
ment to complete his course and receive his com-
mission at the end of three years, by taking two
basic courses each semester in his sophomore year.
After the completion of the basic course, and the
satisfactory passing of a physical examination he
is eligible to enter the advanced course. While he
is studying his last two years, the government sup-
plies him with a complete tailored uniform, the
standard for officers of the army. Besides this he
is given a half ration, that is, he is paid $0.30 a day
for the last two years he is in school. This amounts
to a little more than $200.00 for the last two years.
Entering the advanced course obligates the stu-
dent to spend six weeks in summer training at a
camp designated for his respective branch. Infan-
try, Signal Corps and Cavalry are sent to Fort
Sheridan, about 20 miles from Chicago, while the
Ordnance men journey to Aberdeen Proving
Grounds, about 40 miles from Washington, D. C.
At camp the student is given his first real im-
pression of how a company functions day in and
day out. Here the student actually tries out some
of the theory of the class room. Once again, I
must refer to the Signal Corps in their training.
Last summer it was the writer's first opportunity to
appreciate exactly how a lineman feels perched on
top of a telegraph pole with a considerable wind
to help his anxiety over his descent. However,
there is more than work to round out the day, and
a good portion is spent in athletics of some form.
Grounds are available for baseball, football, soccer,
track, and there are accommodations for swimming,
boxing, tennis and golf. Most of the neighboring
universities and colleges have compulsory military
training, and one finds keen and enjoyable com-
petition in the above named forms of recreation.
Last year, seven members left Ft. Sheridan early
in the training period for Boston for the Olympic
try-outs. The army, it seems, takes a keen pride
in her athletes.
Besides adhering strictly to the training program
as outlined by the War Department in Washing-
ton, the Military Department fosters and helps in
the establishment of various other activities. At
Yale, the R. O. T. C. has a cavalry unit, and there
is trained the famous Yale polo team. Military
training at Michigan has not, as yet, reached the
point where the government feels that the expense
of a cavalry unit is justified. Here, however, we
have the famous Signal Corps radio station that kept
in communication with the Hobbs Greenland expe-
dition, and is now carrying on a weekly schedule
with Byrd at the south pole. Besides this, we have
the training of the rifle team, both for men and
women. Recently the Military Department has
taken over the training of the band, and it is the
hope of the future that we may have a band that
can compete with the famous Indiana "All-Amer-
ican College Band."
Finally, let me invite those interested to come to
the Military Department and ask questions or see
some of the interesting equipment that is sheltered
under the roof of the little grey-stone building. You
will find any of the officers willing and anxious to
show you about to see what Uncle Sam has placed
at your disposal while you are in college.

Xow and then we hear of different groups criticising
the practicality of some of these old architectural gems
in the old castles and palaces of Europe. They ques-
tion, for instance, the practicality in design of the
Palace of Yersailles. wherein the kitchens are located
far from the dining room. It seems queer that Louis
XIV should spend eighty million dollars on beauty
alone with such apparent lack of heed to utility. If we
would but consider that these palaces were built cen-
turies ago when different customs made necessary
different floor arrangements, and if these critically in-
clined people would first study the conditions which
existed then, social, religious, and political, they would
find that every room was located in the proper place.

and that the dining rooms were far distant from the
kitchens because of the state dinners which required
many long ceremonial processions of servants; and
finally, that the entire building was not only a master-
piece in beauty, but also in practical planning to meet
the needs of the times.
We see, then, that it is wrong to pass judgment on
periodic architecture on the basis of what the present
day demands in the art of combining beauty with utility.
Everywhere, and in all times, innumerable changes have
affected architectural style, so that although the stand-
ard for architectural beauty has remained the same, the
buildings of different countries and periods are radi-
cally different in construction, and therefore their fea-
tures of utility are not easily understood. We cannot
criticize any building with respect to utility, unless we
know the circumstances surrounding its construction,
for architecture has always adapted itself to existing
conditions.
Neither can we justly pass judgment on the
"modern" style of architecture now being developed
in this country, on a basis of what was good design in
other periods. Modern means of transportation,
steam, steel, elevators, and reinforced concrete have
radically changed the appearance of our buildings.
With our present eighty-four story buildings, we can-
not expect a survival of the trabeated or the paladian
motifs. We are prone, instead, to leave out all the non-
essentials of adornment, and put nothing into the de-
sign of a modern building that has no definite function.
True beauty is one thing, utilization and practicality
another, but when the two qualities are combined, they
produce what is good in architecture.

at short intervals. The "deadline" for May issue
copy was near at hand, and the Architectural Edi-

where to be found. Numerous telephone calls had

out Washtenaw. As the miles rolled by it became
evident that they must be going to that section of
this fair city affectionately designated by the Cham-

After several hours of vigorous hiking out Wash-
tenaw, they suddenly turned off on a winding cow-
path which led past closely grouped farmhouses. A
herd of cattle rushed out before them but they hur-
ried on, undismayed. At length, they turned down
the walk to one of the houses, stopped on the front
porch, and rang the doorbell. Hurried investiga-
tion disclosed the fact that their quarry lived three
doors further down the way. Again they turned
off the road and strode up the walk to one of the
houses, and another doorbell was pushed. The
lady who answered the door informed them that
they had come to the right place. The one they were
searching for lived there, but she had retired. They

THE CO-OPERATIVE COURSE IN ELECTRI-
CAL ENGINEERING AND INDUSTRY
There has been a feeling growing stronger the
last few years that many students of engineering
would profit by supplementing their formal colle-
giate work with periods of employment in some in-
dustry. It is believed by many that the so-called
"sandwich" plan of alternating periods of study
with periods of industrial work offers a stronger
educational scheme than that of the regular four-
year technical course.
In February, 1928, the Electrical Engineering
Department was authorized to make arrangements
with prominent electrical industries for the estab-
lishment of optional co-operative courses. Shortly
thereafter the following industries had agreed to
accept co-operative students: The General Electric
Company at Schenectady, N. Y., The Westing-
house Electric &amp; Mfg. Company at Pittsburgh,
The Electric Machinery Manufacturing Company
at Minneapolis, The Cutler-Hammer Mfg. Com-
pany at Milwaukee, The Michigan Bell Telephone
Company at Detroit, and The Detroit Edison Com-
pany at Detroit. The first four are electrical manu-
facturing companies, the fifth is a communication
company, and the last generates and delivers elec-
trical energy for factory and household use.
The plan consists in sending the students who
elects this program to one of the co-operating com-
panies for sixteen months in four periods of four
months each, where he is shifted from one depart-
ment to another, giving him a good opportunity to
learn the activities of that company. The student's
work with the company is guided by some member
of the concern in order that his time may be spent
to best advantage. As opportunity offers he will
be permitted to attend special courses given by the
company. From time to time the University may
require reports from the student covering his work.
The course at the University includes the same
127 hours of required work as that asked on the
regular four-year course in Electrical Engineering.
For completion of the co-operative assignment the
student receives nine hours of credit, leaving four
hours of free elective.—the total of 140 hours of
credit plus 16 months of co-operative work leading
to the degree of B.Sc.E., which is given also in the
regular four-year course.
The co-operative course will require approximate-
ly five calendar years. However, it must be remem-
bered that the regular four-year student almost in-
variably has to spend his first year away from the
University in a company cadet course before he is
given a permanent job. The co-operative student
in general completes this work before graduation.
In the light of this fact, the time requirement is
seen to be really the same for both courses.

system of competition, giving every man an oppor-
tunity to elevate himself by his own exertions was
adopted two thousand years ago and continues even
today.
Far more interesting to the Engineer are the
numerous scientific contributions which China has
given society. The most important of which are
gunpowder, printing, and the Mariner's compass.
Some Chinese books assert that the compass was
used to guide war-chariots across the desert as ear-
ly as 2600 B. C. The history of the invention of
the printing press is worthy of mention. Often
authors of history texts credit Gutenberg with the
invention of the printing press, yet for 700 years
previously, the art of printing had been practiced
in China, not as Gutenberg and Faustus practiced it
in secret, but as a great popular industry, printing
thousands of books on numerous subjects.
The art of making porcelain is so obviously
Chinese in origin that porcelain continues to bear
the name of chinaware.
A PICTURE OF SOME CHINESE RELICS. NOTE BALANCE.

The same may be said of the manufacture of silk.
The name is somewhat disguised, but it is undoubt-
edly derived from seres, the Latin word for Chinese,
through the adjective sericum, which by dropping
the final syllable becomes serie—China stuff.
Illustrations of these Chinese industries and arts
are but a few of the many objects of interest in the
new University of Michigan Museum. In addition
to this interesting Chinese exhibit there are exten-
sive collections of pre-historic fossils, minerals, rare
rocks, unusual animals, fish, reptiles, birds, early
primitive machines, and works of art of unique
origin. An afternoon or two might be profitably
spent viewing any one or several of these exhibits.

CO-OPERATIVE ENGINEERING
(Continued from page 50)
While actively connected with the industry the
student's wage will vary from 42 cents per hour to
$30 per week, depending upon the company and
the student's length of employment. These rates
are thought to be very liberal in view of the fact
that the student is receiving a large amount of
training with a consequent lessening of his useful-
ness to the concern. But it should be clear that the
remuneration is not sufficient to keep a student in
industrial work and at the same time permit him
to save enough for University fees added to living
expenses in Ann Arbor.
The co-operative plan contemplates the eventual
permanent employment of the student by the com-
pany upon graduation. No promises are made by
the student or the company with respect to this
point. Good faith is assumed on part of both. How-
ever, unless the graduate seeks and is accepted for
permanent employment by the company, it is doubt-
ful whether the expense of training has been justi-
fied from the company's point of view. Unless a
student is quite clear in his own mind as to the
type of work and company that interests him, he
would better follow the regular four-year program.
Any student in the College of Engineering in
good standing, who has completed at least one
semester of work in the College with an average of
C (2.0) or better, is eligible to apply for the co-
operative course and choose which company he de-
sires to enter from the accepted list. Applicants
should be American citizens, or at least have satis-
fied the governmental requirements with respect to
permanent residence in the United States. In gen-
eral it is expected that students who apply will be
freshmen. Applications will ordinarily be received
early in the second semester for assignment for the
following summer and year.
The company is at liberty to choose as it pleases
from those who apply. An interview between the
student and the company representative is ar-
ranged by the University, which acts in a purely
liaison capacity. The various companies require dif-
ferent scholastic standings, which in general are
higher than the 2.0 average required by the Uni-
versity. In addition, questions of personality and
past experience play a role in the matter of choice,
as well as a satisfactory physical condition. The
requirements are sufficiently high so that students
should regard an opportunity to join this course as
a privilege.
After acceptance by the company, the University
requires continued satisfactory performance by the
student both in the industry and at the University.
Since the plan contemplates graduation, the student
is expected to maintain his scholastic average at
2.0 or better.
The student under the co-operative plan is urged
to take his textbooks with him, or to elect formal
work in night classes when possible, in order that
he shall not lose the advantage of continued intel-
lectual application.
The University fees are no different for the co-
operative student. The usual rule that a student
dropping out of collegiate work for one semester
pays 60% of the annual fee applies. The total
amounts to very little more than under the regular
schedule.
There follows a typical schedule. U is the period

bers" Roberts, Bill "Fishtail" Wright, and Jack
"Mugwump" Adler are fast becoming the Engine
School's authorities on sex. At any hour of the day
or night, these above mentioned amateur neurolo-
gists may be found deeply immersed in a book by
Dr. Robie or Freud. Were this not enough, they
discuss this subject at great length at the dinner
table, and it is rumored that they talk in their sleep.
How gratifying it is to find some of our engineers
seeking culture extra-curriculum!

It had always been a certain Engineer's ('29)
ambition to own a fur coat, and after three collegiate
years of waiting, he was able to buy one. One
morning a friend approached him and remarked:
"Good-morning, old fellow! Cold day."
The Senior lifted his chin haughtily from the
depths of his fur collar. "I really can't tell about
the weather." he replied carelessly; "I haven't
looked at the report in today's daily."

Plans for World Engineering Congress; Tokio
and Japan Are Actively Progressing
October—November, 1929
As previously announced, a World Engineering
Congress will be held in Tokio, Japan, beginning
October 29, 1929, and continuing about ten days,
followed by trips to various places of engineering
and scenic interest throughout Japan.
The object of the Congress is to effect an inter-
national exchange of the latest knowledge of the
sciences and practices of engineering, and to bring
together the leaders who are directing the trend of
engineering activities, thereby initiating and pro-
moting international cooperation and comprehen-
sion of engineers throughout the world.
A Committee on American Participation in the
Congress was organized many months ago and
various subcommittees on finance, technical pro-
gram, transportation, entertainment, membership,
etc., have been actively at work for several months.
The interest already shown by engineers both in
this country and abroad indicates a large attend-
ance.
Dr. Masawa Kamo, Professor of Mechanical En-
gineering in the Imperial University at Tokio. and
Chairman of the Organizing Committee of the Con-
gress, was in New York early in December after
visiting various countries of Europe in the interest
of the Congress. The C ommittee on American Par-
ticipation gave a dinner in his honor at the En-
gineers' Club, New York, on the evening of Decem-
ber 6, when reports were made by the various
American committees, and Dr. Kamo gave an ex-
ceedingly interesting account of the plans being
made in Japan for the visiting engineers and mem-
bers of their families from foreign countries.
The Transportation Committee reported that the
"official" ship will be the President Jackson, sailing
from San Francisco October 11.
Dr. Kamo was told by Dr. Elmer A. Sperry.
Chairman of the American Committee, that the
attendance of a large delegation of American engin-
eers was already assured.
A "second announcement" in the form of a book-
let giving information regarding the program, and
the excursions that will follow the technical ses-
sions has recently been issued by authorities of
the Congress in Japan. This booklet, together with
application forms for membership in the Congress,
transportation and hotel accommodations, etc.,
will be forwarded to any engineer applying to Mr.
Maurice Holland, Executive Secretary of the Am-
erican Committee, at 33 West 39th Street, New
York, N. Y. Early application is desirable because
of the limited number of those who may participate
in the Congress as well as in some of the numerous
trips which are to be taken.—A. I. E. E. Journal.

The new C-E Single-Seam Box-Header
Boiler is a distinct advance in construc-
tion and design over ordinary box
header practice.
In the new design —
HEADER ER. ^he wrapper or Dutt straP joining the tube and
hand hole sheets is—ELIMINATED.
ONE ROW OF RIVETS JOINS THE TUBE SHEET
DIRECTLY TO THE HAND HOLE SHEET.
The row of rivets on the tube side of the wrap-

THERE IS ONLY ONE CAULKING EDGE and
this faces the outside — making inspection easy
and removing all rivets out of the hot gas and
fire zones.
Three thicknesses of metal at the caulking joint at
the ears are - REDUCED TO TWO THICKNESSES.
This new design provides an unusual factor of
safety. For instance, in the standard unit sold for
160 lb. to 250 lb. working pressure, the header
joint is adequate for a working pressure of450 lb.
Acareful inspection of this new boiler will

The radio that's heard at the
bottom of the world
Six months of night did not mean
dreary isolation for Commander
Byrd's hand-picked band of Antarctic
explorers. Fortnightly the Westinghouse
short-wave radio station in East Pitts-
burgh sent them programs of music and
cheer and word from their families.
Between scheduled programs it lent a
helping hand in sending down interest-
ing bits of news, relaying messages for
other stations that couldn't get through,
and even completing connections be-
tween the "Eleanor Boiling" and Byrd's
Base Station when they did not hear
each other.
Spectacular feats have been achieved
by the Westinghouse men working on
short-wave radio research, in reception
as well as sending. An average of five
nights a week they bring in c S W of
Chelmsford, England, and re-broadcast
to America the midnight chimes of Big
Ben. Strange voices from Holland,
Australia and far off Java and the Fiji
Islands register on their receivers quite
as faithfully as a station a thousand miles
distant comes in on the average set.
Many stations in remote corners or the
world depend on their broadcasts for
entertainment and up-to-the-minute
news.
Young college men figure prominently
in the exploration for new possibilities in
radio communication. Their field is rich
in opportunity-—their facilities are the
finest that modern science affords.

The New Hornier Plane
Edited from Numerous Authentic Sources, with Additions
By EDWARD R. NELL, \'IOE
ADEFINITE step forward in the progress of
air transportation, and another sustaining ele-
ment toward the wave of air-mindedness
which has been sweeping over the civilized world for
the past few years, is the design and construction of
several exceedingly large pas-
senger planes. These great ar-
gosies of the air, equipped with
power plants sufficient in size to
light a small city, whose roomy,
comfortable traveling compart-
ments rival our finest trains,
and whose air-worthiness and
reliability have already been
proven in rigorous test flights,
will soon be placed in regular
service, a valuable addition to
the world's fastest means of
transportation.
The largest, and perhaps the
most remarkable of these great
planes, is the Dormer Do-X,
which was recently completed
in the Cornier Plant at Alten-
rhein bei Rorschach, Switzerland. The plane was
financed by German interests, and the design and con-
struction was supervised by German engineers.
The plane was built to carry one hundred passen-
gers, in addition to the operating crew. It is a sea-
plane, of monoplane construction, although there is a
short stub wing on each side of the fuselage, below
BECAUSE of the great interest
recently taken by the engi-
neering profession in the design
and construction of very large
passenger planes, the Technic has
endeavored to locate authentic
material upon this subject and
present it to its readers. A care-
ful search for such information,
however revealed the fact that it
is very difficult to find. The ac-
companying article represents all
the reliable information which
could be procured upon the sub-
ject.

the main wing. The chief function of these stub
wings, however, is to act as convenient supports for
the main wing struts, of which there are three on each
side. The plane has a wing spread of 150 feet.
An increase in the carrying capacity of planes re-
quires a proportionate increase
in the driving power supplied.
Since mechanical difficulties in
design and construction limit
definitely the size of internal
combustion engines for aircraft
purposes, designers of large
planes have been forced to em-
ploy multiple-engine installa-
tions. Extreme complexity in
control systems is encountered
in such installations, and in the
past, three or four engines on
one plane was considered the
limit. But three or four en-
gines can sustain only a limited
load, and the engineers in
charge of design on the Dor-
nier plane were forced to use
an installation of twelve engines, in order to sustain
the load of one hundred passengers. These twelve en-
gines, all of which are of the radial type, and are of
525 horse-power each, are rigidly mounted above the
upper wing in tandem sets of two. The framework,
which supports the motors and encloses all means of
control, presented a new problem to the Cornier en-

gineers, but it was met with great success. All twelve
of the propellors are four-bladed, and are made of a
special aluminum alloy.
A cross-sectional drawing of the plan, showing the three decks
The plane itself presents one of the most efficiently
streamlined which has ever been constructed. Every
possible precaution was taken during its design to
insure a minimum of air resistance. The fuselage
consists of three completely enclosed decks (see Fig-
ure 1).
The navigating crew, and the radio operators, oc-
cupy the upper deck. Aeronautical instruments of the
greatest obtainable accuracy and dependability appear
on the pilots control panel. Two pilots are needed
to navigate the great ship. The engine control panel,
which is a searae unit from the pilot's control panel,
appears not unlike that of a small steam power plant.
Mere appear devices for starting the motors, specially
designed mechanisms for the purpose of synchronizing
the speed of the twelve engines and thus obtain the
greatest possible efficiency of operation, instruments
which record the temperature and fuel consumption
of each engine, and a galaxy of accessory instruments
necessary to the efficient operation of a power plant
plant of 6,300 horse-power.
The passengers occupy the middle deck. The in-
terior of this deck contains comfortable seating ar-
rangements for one hundred passengers, very similar
in general form to our Pullman coaches. If the pas-
senger so desires, he may summon a waiter by the
push of a button, and order a meal which is the utmost
in excellency of food and perfection of service. He
may look out the window at his side to see the ca-
thedral towers of Brussels, and an hour later glance
down to find the storm-tossed shores of the Baltic
meeting his eye. His trip is made free from appre-
hension by the knowledge that every possible precou-
tion has been taken to insure his safe transit.
The fuel and oil supply tanks occupy the lower
deck. These tanks can carry sufficient gasoline and
oil for a flight of one thousand miles.
The Dornier Do-X is, indeed, a great engineering
feat. The engineers who are responsible for it cast
aside the words of the doubting Thomases who of-
fered proof that it was an impossibility to build a
plane of such enormous capacity. The multiform
problems, which are always a part of any great project,
were met and conquered with the characteristic de-
cisiveness of German ingenuity. They are to be con-
gratulated by every member of the engineering pro-
fession.

The New Diesel Aircraft Engine
By BEN C. LANSDALE, »31E
THE recent flight made by a Stinson-Detroiter
powered by the new Packard Diesel engine has
proved the possibilities of utilizing this type of
engine for aircrafts. Until a year ago the subject
of Diesel engined planes had been confined to a theo-
retical nature, but following the announcement by
Packard that experiments were being conducted and
test flights undertaken, the work
has assumed a practical nature.
Not to be outdone, Ford an-
nounced that his company was
developing a similar engine. The
names of General Motors, West-
inghouse, Winton, Wright, and
others have been linked with the
development of this type of in-
ternal combustion engine.
During the last decade of the
nineteenth century, Doctor Ru-
dolph Diesel brought out an in-
ternal combustion engine which
involved in its operation a prin-
ciple which had never before
been applied in practical mechan-
ics. However, owing to the nec-
essary high cylinder pressures, the construction has
been of such a heavy nature that the adaption of this
motor to aircrafts has been impossible in the past.
The conventional gasoline engine has been used pri-
marily for its relative light weight, but, because of the
many advantages found in the Diesel type, engineers
have been seeking for a light motor involving this prin-
ciple.
Diesel engines of the slow moving type as used in
stationary and marine practice run at a maximum speed
of about 200 or 300 r.p.m.. whereas for aircrafts a
minimum speed of about 1500 r.p.m. is necessary. The
Packard Motor Car Company under Capt. L. M. Wool-
son and his associates has developed a high speed Diesel
which, when used in aircrafts, has performed very sat-
isfactorily. It is not the intention of this article to
go into the mechanical details of the new high speed
motor, but it would be well to briefly compare it with
the slow speed Diesel and the gasoline engine.
The difference in operation between a Diesel and a
gasoline engine may be shown by comparison of the
four strokes of the cycle. During the inlet stroke in the
gasoline motor a combustible mixture of gasoline and
air, prepared in the carburetor, is drawn into the cylin-
der. In the Diesel only pure air is drawn in on this
stroke. Xext follows the compression stroke where
the cylinder contents are compressed to a fraction of
MYSTERY has completely
shrouded the construction
and operation of the new Packard
Diesel Engine since its comple-
tion a few months ago. This ar-
ticle represents one of the first
authentic descriptions of this
aeronautical innovation. The au-
thor has avoided, as far as possi-
ble, giving technical detail, and
has, instead, devoted more space
to the discussion of the principles
involved. It is hoped that this
article will prove of value to
every engineering student who
evinces any interest in aviation.
—The Editor.
their original volume; in the gasoline engine the con-
tents are compressed from one-fourth to one-sixth. If
an attempt were made to compress them still further,
trouble from pre-ignition and consequent knocking
would result. In the Diesel engine, however, there is
nothing in the cylinder during compression stroke ex-
cept air. Hence, there can be no pre-ignition, and the
compression may be carried as
far as desired.
The difference in cycle opera-
tion between the high and the
low speed Diesels is that the fuel
injection in the former starts as
early as 50 degrees before top
dead-center is reached, insuring
complete and smokeless combus-
tion, while in the low speed type
the fuel injection starts only
about 10 degrees before top dead-
center and continues for about 32
degrees past that point. In this
respect the high-speed Diesel is
similar to the gasoline engine
where the spark is timed to oc-
cur at the same point in the pis-
ton stroke that the fuel injection of the high speed
Diesel is timed to start. However, an important dif-
ference exists; when the sparking takes place in the
gasoline engine, all of the fuel charge is contained in
the piston, whereas in the Diesel, only a small per-
centage of the fuel has been injected.
That is, the fuel in the Diesel engine is introduced
into a highly compressed and therefore hightly heated
charge of pure air at the very moment when it is
needed for the working stroke, and thus a nearly con-
stant pressure is caused. After the cut-off occurs the
gas works expansively, like the steam in a Corliss en-
gine, until the end of the stroke. The action there-
fore is more like that of the steam-engine than the
action of the explosive mixture in the gasoline engine.
However, the Packard high speed Diesel does not
operate on the true constant pressure cycle but rather
the mixed-combustion, or Sabathe cycle, where the fuel
is burned partly at constant pressure and partly at con-
stant volume. This is because the combustion must
start considerably ahead of top dead-center and con-
tinue while the volume of the combustion space is les-
sened by the approaching of the piston to top dead-
center. Working on the same compression ratios,
though, and the same expansion ratios, the constant

The Aeronautical Society
of the University of Michigan
By CORDELIA BURWELL, Secretory
THE Aeronautical Society of the University was
founded in 1916 by a group of men in the Engi-
neering School who were interested in aeronau-
tics. This nucleus of the present day organization
wished to interest others in ballooning and aviation, in
lighter-than-air and heavier-than-air craft, in fact, in
all the branches of aeronautics, including the physical
principles. They carried on a very good work, and a
few managed even to survive the World War, but the
organization dwindled to twelve members. In 1928 the
Society "came back with a bang" and included one
hundred and twenty-five members. This increase in
membership stimulated so much interest in the Aero-
nautical Society that as a group it was able to accom-
plish a great many things during the past school year.
One of the most important departments of the Aero-
nautical Society is the Glider Section, already well
known to many of the students at Michigan. The
Glider Section was started last year under the very
able chairmanship of Robert B. Evans. Much was ac-
complished in this group. Seven students passed the
test and received their third class glider's license. The
first student in the United States to receive a third
class glider's license was Milton Stoughton of the Uni-
versity. The ninth was Robert B. Evans, the tenth
was Basil G. Reed, the eleventh was Sam H. Bensky,
the twelfth was I. R. Stoughton. the brother of Milton
Stoughton, the thirteenth was J. Holte, the fourteenth
was James D. Redding, and Wallace Franklin received
both his third class license and the first second class
license to be given in the United States. That makes
a total of eight students receiving third class licenses,
with one of them the first to be given in the United
States, and one receiving a second class license, the
first to be given in the United States.
Robert B. Evans and D. W. Smith went to Cape
Cod this summer to learn more about gliding from the
German pilots of the American Motorless Aviation
Corporation. The tricks of glider flying which they
learned will be taught to the members of 'the Glider
Section of the Aeronautical Society this year.
Another interesting department of the Society is the
Balloon section. Through the Balloon section the
members of the Society may experience and learn the
art of "hedge-hopping". Two balloon trips were made
last year, one to St. Catherines. Ontario, which is a
very short distance from Niagara Falls, and one to
Bryan, Ohio. The pilot in both cases was George
Hienian.
The embryo department of the Society is the motor-
plane section, which is being developed this year. We
hope by the end of the year to be able to teach the
members of this section to fly a motor powered air-
plane.
The Society was awarded second prize at the Cleve-
land Air Show this summer. In getting the first glider
license to be given in this country, there was a great
deal of competition, and the University of California
was our closest opponent. Milton Stoughton received
his license on his first test and it was not until nearly
a week later that the students of the University of
California received their licenses.
Wallace Franklin has done some remarkable glider
flying while being towed by a dirigible balloon.
The Society as a complete organization also has illus-
trated lectures and talks by men famous in the aero-
nautic field. Last year, Mr. Stout of the Ford Stout
Aircraft Co. spoke to the Society on the history of
heavier-than-air-craft. Mr. Evans of the Evans Glider
Association spoke to the Society on gliders and heavier-
than-air craft. Both Mr. Stout and Mr. Evans are
available to the Society again this year. The Society
is endeavoring to get a motor-powered ship. There
are two balloons available for those interested in this
activity. The glider section of the Society has two
primary gliders now, and is building a third in the new
well equipped work-shop in the Natural Science Build-
ing. This shop was donated and fitted for the Glider
Section by the University. A secondary glider will
also be constructed this year, and those who receive
their third class licenses may train in this shop for their
second class license.
The Society will also be able to have many speakers
here for lectures during the year. Among these speak-
ers we may name Mr. Stout, the designer of the Ford
all-metal, sixteen-passenger airship, Mr. Evans of the
Evans Glider Association, Mr. Carl Fritsche of the
Detroit Aircraft Corporation. Mr. Harold Emmons,
director of an airplane company in Detroit, Ensign
Randecker, formerly of the High Hat squadron of the
United States Navy, and Mr. Harold Pitcairn, who is
now developing the latest and safest way of flying the
Auto-Gyro aeroplane.
The Auto-Gyro is a unique ship in the aircraft field.
It will take off in a shorter distance than any other
plane and can be brought down in a back yard.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
On Gliders and Gliding at Michigan
and Elsewhere
By FELIX W. PAWLOWSKI, Professor of Aeronautical Engineering
THE University of Michigan Aeronautical So-
ciety's Glider Section did splendidly last year.
They built several gliders; trained several score
of men in gliding; the first Glider Pilot licenses, issued
by the National Glider Association, were won by mem-
bers of this lively campus organization; with the praise-
worthy assistance of Professor R. E. Franklin they
developed the automobile-towing method for gliders to
be used in training in flat territories; and last but
not least, they won prizes at the First National Glider
Meet in Cleveland in August of this year, in spite of
being handicapped by the necessity of flying strange
gliders, since their own was wrecked the first day.
This success, of this energetic organization, has nat-
urally stirred up considerable interest in their activities,
and in the so-called new sport of gliding.
Gliding, however, is not new, and very likely dates
back several centuries. There are several reliable his-
torical accounts of flights made from high towers,
across rivers, etc., in "flying machines" equipped with
wings. These flights were made in France and in Italy
during the 17th, 16th and even the 15th centuries.
While these accounts, giving the names of the per-
formers, state that these flights were witnessed by
some important personages and crowds of people, and
that the flyers emerged from the experience with more
or less damage, they are all silent as to the question
of the wings making motions with respect to the body
of the machine or the flyer. Considering the time and
the scientific and technical means at disposal, it is abso-
lutely safe to assume that these "machines" were not
"flying machines" in the proper sense of the term, i.e.,
heavier-than-air craft, capable of sustentation and pro-
pulsion by self means (carried on board the craft),
since suitable and sufficiently light and powerful prime
movers did not exist at that time. The only prime
movers known then were water wheels and windmills,
and the first prime mover, independent of water or air
currents but utilizing, for instance, the heat energy of
a supply of fuel (the steam engine) started to evolve
in the 18th century. In view of the consistency, and
one might say persistency, of these historical accounts
from different places and at different times, it is safe
to assume that some of these flights were actually
achieved and that they could not have been anything
other than successful gliding flights in contraptions
imitating, to some extent, birds, as to the general ar-
rangement of the lifting surfaces (wings) and the
stabilizing surfaces (tail).
In support of this hypothesis, as to the possibility of
gliding flights a few centuries ago in Europe, it is worth
while to mention, here, another more recent discovery
of similar character, which was announced a few years
ago in the Air Service News published, at that time,
by the War Department. This particular news re-
lates to the fact that the U. S. Army flyers stationed
on the Hawaiian Islands found among the natives a
tradition, substantiated even by songs still known to
some of the older natives, of feats performed by Ha-
waiians some century previous and consisting of jump-
ing or diving from cliffs hundreds of feet in height.
The performeds used, for these jumps, some sort of
wings which slowed their descent and carried them
quite a distance out into the ocean.
All these early "gliding" flights, however, have been
forgotten, and no information has been left as to the
construction of these "gliders".
The first real glider was built by Sir George Cayley,
an English physicist, who may be considered also as
the inventor of the airplane, at the beginning of the
19th century. This glider, carrying a 200 pound sand
load, when launched from an elevated point covered a
distance six times the elevation above the ground upon
which it landed. But this, as in the case of other aero-
nautical contributions of Cayley, was not appreciated
by his contemporaries, and soon forgotten also. The
honor of starting the modern gliding practice, there-
fore, goes to Otto Lilienthal, a German engineer and
toy manufacturer, who not only built gliders but flew
them, as well. Lilienthal did not utilize the experience
of any of his possible predecessors but proceeded ac-
cording to his own ideas; getting his inspiration from
birds such as vultures, storks and cranes who can stay
up in the air for hours, utilizing the rising air currents,
without moving their spread-out wings. Lilienthal
made a couple of thousand flights during the period ot
1890 to 1896 before he met his death, thus falling first
victim of the new art of flying the heavier-than-air
craft.
Lilienthal, as a well trained engineer, proceeded sys-
tematically, using scientific methods, and therefore laid
a firm foundation for the work of his successors. It
is no wonder, then, that his work gave a new impetus
to gliding and contributed greatly to the development
of the modern airplane. After his death, gliding was
taken up by Piltcher, a young instructor of engineer-
ing at the University of Glasgow, Scotland; by Captain

THE SUMMER AT CAMP DAVIS
By Raymond Daly, '30E, Camp Manager 1929.
Camp Davis has experienced its first session in the
wide open spaces. Having been driven from its ear-
lier abode in northern Michigan by the black flies, ex-
orbitant undergrowth, and infringing rights of the
Biology Camp located near there, its Chief, Prof.
Johnston, sought a newer country better adapted for
surveying practice and
also more habitable.
The site chosen filled
the requirements most
adequately.
The new home is
situated at the mouth
of the beautiful and
romantic Hoback Can-
yon of W y o m in g
amidst towering
mountains and
abounding geological
wonders. Just seventy
miles from the cele-
brated Yellowstone
National Park and in
the heart of the novel burdened Jackson Hole
Country, the new and better Camp Davis lies
serenely amidst snow-capped mountains. The camp
site consists of a nearly level valley about a mile and
a half wide and three miles long which is carpeted
solely by sage brush and has a .1% grade to the north.
The University tract consists of 176 acres but the total
expanse is open for surveying use.
The Camp was constructed this year by employed
student help with the supervision and manual help of
several of the Faculty. The first group of students
arrived June 18, followed by a second group 7 days
later, making a total of twenty. The type of building
is the same as was used at the old Camp, namely, a
concrete floor, galvanized steel siding and roof, with
batten windows. The roof is of the plain peak type
set with a 10 degree slope to take care of any excess
snow which might overburden the small structures.
Each of the living quarters is equipped with a wash
basin and running water under a sixty-foot head, and
also with electric lights. There were five student
shacks, six faculty shacks, one visitors' shack, two bath
houses, an instrument room, a power unit, the mess
hall and kitchen, and the keeper's house completed by
the end of Camp.
\t Sept. 1. These were
the cause of many
blisters and callouses,
accompanied by a new
vocabulary of bigger
and better means of
expression.
The water supply-
projects of great im-
and power unit were
portance and unique
in themselves. The
water supply had as
its source a mountain
spring of delicious
water. A pipe line
was laid to approximately half the distance to
the source, giving the water a sixty-foot head. The
plans are to continue the pipe line to the source
of supply next summer and thus obtain sufficient power
to run a Pelton wheel of great enough capacity for
motive power for the generator. The power unit now
consists of a six horse power stationary gas engine
and an A.C. generator.
There were twelve students taking the course, Survey-
ing3, which lasted for eight weeks of Camp, while the
remaining eight students stayed until September 1 to
continue construction. I believe there is not a single
student of Prof. Johnston who attended Camp who
will not agree that the location and climatic conditions
are not ideal. Every one would like to spend more
summers in a place like the present Camp Davis.

Descriptive circulars are now on the press which
will he sent to various Engineering Colleges. The en-
rollment will he limited to fifty students. After the
University of Michigan students have heen accommo-
dated, the remainder of the quota will he apportioned
so that no more than four will attend the summer ses-
son from one college.
With conditions such as
they are the Camp is as-
sured of nothing hut the
greatest success.
Aero Club
Summer is the time
when most Campus organ-
izations pack up their
books and proceed to wait
until the fall term rolls
around before beginning
their activities, but at last
one society has had the in-
itiative to carry on its
work through the summer
months and seems to have
accomplished a great deal.
The Aero Club has shown
itself the brilliant excep-
tion to the rule and has
throughout the summer
taken part in various com-
petitive meets and thereby
brought considerable fame
to Michigan. At the Cleve-
land Air Show, Wallace
Franklin, Spec, won first
place for the most impressive glider performance.
After having been towed for two hundred miles be-
hind an airship, he proceeded to land his glider in front
of the Grandstand and carried away first honors for
his flight. Robert B. Evans, '30, took second place
in this same event. Previous to the Cleveland Air
Meet, Franklin and Bazil G. Reed, '30E, had been
barnstorming around Pennsylvania with their glider
being towed behind autos and airplanes. At the pres-
ent time Franklin is gliding against Dr. Klemperer who
was here last winter at the inauguration of the Aero
Club's first ship. Dr. Klemperer is flying the Good-
year ship "Condor."
This coming year the Society will be equipped with
three gliders, the one flown at Cleveland, donated by
the Exchange Club of Detroit, and a third which is to
be built by students. A very intensive membership
drive is now being carried on and it is expected that
with this new material coming into the organization, a
most successful year will be enjoyed. The very great
interest which was evinced by the students of
the University last year in the activities of the Club
makes those in charge feel very hopeful over the pros-
pects of the coming year.

With a new corps of officers chosen late last
year, the Student Branch of the American Society
of Civil Engineers is looking forward to a prosper-
ous season and with the men they have chosen to
handle their affairs, we feel confident that much
will be accomplished. The
list of officers includes:
President Raymond Daly
Vice President
Neil MacDougall

In The
Spotlight
John C. Widman
If you wander down to Ferry
Field in either the Fall or
Spring, to watch the athletic
II squads in action, you cannot
^^jj help noticing a fine appearing
young fellow who throws and
kicks the football exceptionally
well and who also is right in with the best of them when
it conies to sending the javelin soaring down the field.
And if you do see this blond haired youngster cavorting
about, it will be none other than our own "Jake" Widman.
Since his entrance into the University four years ago,
Jake has participated in many activities of the En-
gineering School. He won his numerals in Freshman
athletics and in his Sophomore year was elected a class
officer. Placing their confidence in him, the class of 1930
chose him as Chairman of the Engineering Honor Com-
mittee, which office he faithfully served during his Junior
year. Such an active interest in the affairs of the Uni-
versity brought its reward in the form of a membership
in the Honorary Junior Engineering Society, Triangles,
and last Spring Jake was among the "lucky palefaces"
who were taken into Michigamua. He has not neg-
lected the social life of the Campus and is President of
his fraternity, Phi Sigma Kappa. The Engineering
School feels proud of those who make a name for them-
selves not only on our own side of the Campus, but
among the "pipe hunting" Lits as well.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
ARCHITECTURE'S HALL OF FAME
Sir Christopher Wren
A story of untiring energy, vivid imagination and
infinite genius is the biography of Sir Christopher
Wren. His life was like a novel, sensational, impres-
sive, full of great successes and grave reverses, heights
and depths. According to the old adage, some men
are born great, some men achieve greatness and some
have greatness thrust upon them, but with Wren, great-
ness can be attributed to all three. This accounts for
his rapid and melodramatical ascent onto the throne
of the world's greatest architect.
Despite his father's tendency
toward architecture and his own
artistic nature, Sir Christopher
displayed little interest in the pro-
fession until his thirtieth year.
All indications were that his un-
doubted genius would manifest
itself in science and invention,
for he had acquired considerable
distinction in this direction while
he was yet young. The fact that
his scholastic efforts at Westmin-
ster and Oxford centered mainly
on the sciences and letters while
no attention was given architec-
ture or the allied arts demon-
strates that a generous portion of
his genius was inborn.
Greatness was thrust upon
him when Charles II, real-
izing his general aptitude, de-
termined to enlist his services and appointed
him assistant surveyor-general. Wren awoke to
the situation and succeeded in unearthening
enough information to effectively perform his
first commission at Pembroke College. The design
was faulty but displayed something of his later ability.
After designing several smaller buildings he spared
himself time to travel and study on the continent, re-
turning in a year to aid in the rebuilding of the fire-
devastated London.
Here Wren began to achieve his greatness. He ral-
lied to his city's need with a complete scheme for the
resurrection of its smouldering ruins. Within a few
years he had constructed over fifty parish churches and
commenced the design of the great Saint Paul's Ca-
thedral. His work in connection with the smaller
churches is commendable but the height of his genius
came only with St. Paul's. He had long cherished a
perfect ideal and a determination to immortalize it.
This ideal, together with his whole soul, he embodied
in the design of the new cathedral and for fifty years
he patiently watched it evolve into a reality. After the
construction was complete and
his age had rendered him in-
firm, he still made regular week-
ly excursions to the cathedral,
remaining for hours under its
immense dome engrossed in
thought.
For the greater part of his
ninety-one years he had enriched
the world with a wealth of arch-
itecture and culture, giving his
entire self to the profession, and
then in 1723, quietly died a happy
and contented man. Under the
pavements in the crypt of St.
Paul's his body was laid, headed
with a simple stone and the epi-
taph—"Reader, if you seek his
monument, look about you." o

THE ARCHITECTURE
OF FLORIDA
By Edmund T. Stewart, Architect, Boston, Mass.
It can hardly be said that Florida possesses a style
of architecture distinctly its own, for the state is yet
relatively young and unsettled. A true style requires
centuries upon centuries of evolution, resulting from
environment, customs, topography and climatic condi-
tions. Isolation, due to impassable mountains, large
bodies of water or even diplomatic differences, also
makes for the birth of a new art. But Florida, in the
short time that has elapsed since it was brought so sud-


Page Thirteen
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
denly and forcibly to the attention of the world, had no
time to evolve the type of design best suited to its con-
ditions but was required to look about and appropriate
an alien style.
The search ended on the shores of the Mediterranean,
where an art that was
picturesque and beau-
tiful lay in its nat-
ural setting. To the
marshes of Florida it
was transplanted to be
modified, misnamed,
and maltreated. Dif-
ferences are found
notably in the fenes-
tration and the build-
ing construction. As
the illustration of the
house La Mangia in-
dicates, windows were
small and few in num-
ber; the walls were
thick and lacked uni-
formity; the embellishment was delicate and concen-
trated at one prominent position, but in Florida it was
different, they believed in a wide expanse of windows
and showy displays of ornament. They found thinner
walls less expensive and quicker to construct. They
robbed a jewel of its lustre.
The better class of design, however, was not entirely
neglected, for we find many beautiful examples in Palm
Reach, Miami and Coral Gables. Its strongest appeal
comes from its range of colors, richness of detail and
unique plan. Textured walls, wearing sun-toned hues,
were topped with red, hand-made, clay tiles. Brilliant
awnings, wrought iron balconies and tiled floors com-
pleted a composition of color contrasts.
The detail boasts extreme intricacy possible by good
marbles and skilled craftsmen. It is influenced largely
by its Spanish predecessor through finely carved ar-
cades and balconies. From Italy come the decorative
cornices of brick and stone, used mainly on the larger
facades, while the small residence usually confined itself
to a simple eaves line.
In the plan of the Florida home several features are
generally found. The illustrations of the Tampa house
show thes-; characteristics as they appear in the typical
example. The patio and its pool majors in the whole
arrangement, enjoying a monopoly of the ornament and
points of interest. The rooms surround this patio with
outside light on at least two or three sides, providing
the necessary cross-ventilation. A boat house and dock
may accompany the residence when it borders a body
of water. Many homes have the entire living quarters
on one floor, while others, as the one shown, locate the
sleeping apartments above.
The retrogression of the real estate boom has im-
bibed in Florida a strong spirit of conservatism and
love for the old treasures of art. This serves to indi-
cate that the undesirable commercialism and exploita-
tion in architecture will disappear and that general im-
provement in design is forthcoming.

EDUCATIONAL
REVOLUTION
IN ARCHI-
TECTURE
In comparing the
present distinctiveness
in American design
with those stereotyped
styles of classical deri-
vation which have
sway in this country
for the past twelve
decades, no one can
deny that the greatest
change is now taking
place in American architecture. That this radical
revolution in appearance of the prevalent "Modern"
styles can be classed as generally and permanently
good, is a matter of conjecture. The new forms ap-
pearing about us are indeed an effort in the right
direction, and we can add with a measure of as-
suredness that many of the "freak" styles now in vogue
are but a means of evolving and quickening a new and
saner form of building adapted to modern materials,
construction, and mode of living.
This revolution is due to the universal demand for
purer and simpler forms: the introduction to a much
wider use of such materials as steel, reinforced con-
crete, and glass; and above all to the broader training
House, La Mangia, Barcelonia, Spain
now given to American architects. It is chiefly to the
increased influence of the university in training intelli-
gent designers coupled with the inherent creative ability
of the American intellect that we owe our remarkable
trend to a new standard.

Guggenheim and Safety
Incentive, effort, initiative, and indomitable perse-
verance are some of the major requirements for success
and progress in almost every field of human endeavor.
The development of the aeroplane was no exception,
and it was over four and one-half centuries from the
time Leonardo da Vinci formulated his plans for an
omithopter, to the time when the Wright brothers
astounded the world by constructing a machine that
would actually fly. Initiative surely was not lacking in
these pioneers, nor was effort and perseverance. In
fact, it was their dauntless perseverance in the face
of disheartening failure that brought about the final
glorious success of the Wright brothers.
Up to the present time there has been very little
material incentive for the aeronautical pioneer, save a
bit of personal glory of achievement, which didn't
amount to much as people were usually unaware of the
exact time and nature of the advancements. Now,
however, there appears on the horizon an air-minded
organization that has the insight to recognize a fault,
and has no aversions about correcting it. The Guggen-
heim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics has de-
cided to do something toward creating an aeroplane
more nearly "fool proof" than any other flying machine
ever constructed, and they have chosen the most ef-
fective way for getting results; they offer a real, ma-
terial inventive. The fund has offered a nice, juicy,
and thoroughly delectable purse of $100,000 to the
aircraft manufacturer who can build a plane to meet
a definite set of qualifications. The specifications are
very rigid, in fact they are so rigid that many people
think it almost impossible to incorporate all of these
characteristics in the same plane. The tests were made
up by eminent aeronautical engineers of both the United
States and Europe and were planned for the ideal of
safe flight performance. Harry F. Guggenheim, pres-
ident of the fund, thinks that the best way to convince
the people that the aeroplane is a safe machine even
in the hands of an unskilled pilot is to demonstrate the
proposition.
The requirements call for a plane that will maintain
controlled level flight at the surprisingly low speed of
3 miles per hour; it must also have a high degree of
inherent stability so that the controls can be freed for
a period of five minutes, the ship to be able to recover
normal flying attitude if thrown out by wind gusts.
Landing and takeoff must be accomplished on a field
500 feet square, surrounded by a 25-foot obstruction.
Unusually good gliding characteristics are necessary
and the stall with its abnormal attitudes must be elimi-
nated.
If the requirements are satisfactorily met it can
readily be seen that the safety of the small plane will
be materially advanced and flying can be enjoyed by
persons who find it impossible to get the highly special-
ized training of the skilled pilot. The stall will be
eradicated, the possibility of spinning will be lessened,
forced landings will be less dangerous, take off crashes
should be fewer in number and excellent stability will
be coupled with positive control. These improvements
should prove a real benefit to the industry as a whole
and even more so to the manufacturer who wins the
prize, as the prestige gained will be worth thousands
of dollars. At present there are six entries from the
States, four from England, and one from Italy; the
Cierva Autogyro has also been entered and has excel-
lent possibilities even though it is still in an experi-
mental stage. The contest also means much to the
non "air minded" individual because it is the greatest
stimulus to the incorporation of the best design in one
plane that has ever been offered. This will give the
layman his chance to do some flying. We hope that
the public will respond to the effort of the Guggenheim
Fund and we wish to congratulate the personnel of the
organization for their notable work.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Wanted—An Open Mind
Public opinion is certainly doubtful of the present
safety of the aeroplane, and the valuable stimulant that
public opinion would otherwise furnish to the aero-
nautical industry is lacking. Misinformed and sensa-
tion-man newspapers are constantly presenting to the
public misleading statements regarding the causes of
aeroplane accidents, giving these news items undue
prominence. Very little authentic information about
the phenomenal advancement of the aircraft industry.
Of course it is stimulating to read the accounts of
round-the-world nights or intrepid dashes across the
vast and trackless wastes of the air; but these feats
are so outnumbered by the "tragedies of the skies" that
the successful flights cannot overcome the unfavorable
influences of the failures. The obvious reaction to
these accounts is to plant a prejudice against aviation
in the mind of the average individual. This average
individual does not seem to realize that, considering the
miles traveled in ratio to accidents, the airplane is a
much safer means of travel than the automobile. The
Department of Commerce report on airplane accidents
of 1928 shows that the greater percentage of accidents
occurring were due to the carelessness and inability of
the pilots. Structural and engine failures caused only
a very small percentage of the accidents. In statistical
reports of the Navy Bureau of Aeronautics, there is
proof that the ratio of crashes to hours flown by the
pilot constantly decreases with the increase of flying
hours. In these reports it is shows that pilots with
four hundred hours of flight have forty percent fewer
crashes than those having only a hundred hours of
flight, while the one thousand five hundred hour men
have the probability of seventy-five percent fewer
crashes than the four hundred hour pilots. Almost
without exception transport pilots have over four hun-
dred hours flying experience and yet the American
people continue to be afraid of the airplane as a means
of transportation.
The aviation industry is not seeking the idealizing
faith of the public. An industry fears rather than
seeks a blind expectancy on the part of the public. It
is too easy to fail to fulfill that expectancy and then
suffer the really tangible effects of a reversion of
public approval. The aviation industry seeks only "an
open mind."
o
Aircraft and Weather Reports
An important new intensive weather reporting and
forecasting service for aviators was started on July 1
by the Weather Bureau of the United States Depart-
ment of Agriculture along the New York-Chicago-San
Francisco-Los Angeles airways. This service, which
was made possible by a congressional appropriation of
$350,000, will have a system of reports broadcast every
three hours by voice from four collecting centers where
there are powerful radio broadcasting stations of the
Department of Commerce. These stations, located at
Cleveland. Omaha, Salt Lake City and San Francisco,
will receive telegraphic reports every three hours, day
and night, from about 60 selected reporting stations
situated on both sides of the airways, and about 100
to 200 miles from the route taken by fliers. A strip
approximately 400 miles wide and stretching from coast
to coast will thus be covered by this network of report-
ing stations, which are about 60 miles apart. Aircraft
are now equipped with radio receiving sets so that when
information is made available to aviators by broadcast-
ing, it can be picked up along the route, thus insuring
greater safety.
After being entered on small-area maps, supplement-
ing the country-wide morning and evening weather
maps, the reports will be used as the basis for sum-
marized statements of current and predicted conditions,
followed by the three-hour airways forecast by voice.
A wave-length of about 900 meters (315 to 350 K.C.)
will be used.
The reports can be picked up by aircraft having suit-
able receiving sets, as well as by persons on the ground,
and will be available to everybody interested.They will
give the general character of the weather, the ceiling
or prevailing cloud type, the visibility, wind direction
and velocity, temperature, dew point in some cases,
pressure, and any unusual features. In other words,
they will contain those elements that have been shown
by experience to be absolutely necessary for safe flying.
The fact that they will be available at three-hour in-
tervals is considered highly important to those on cross-
country routes, since they will get direct warning of
conditions that have arisen since leaving the last air-
port. For example, when storms or other hazardous
conditions are noted approaching the airway at right
angles they will be reported, whereas no mention of
them would have appeared in the early report at the
time of taking off.
While this information is intended primarily for the
benefit of aviators, it will be equally available to the
general public, and will doubtless be utilized for many
purposes apart from aviation. It should be of especial
use to airport managers, air transport officials and many
in other lines of business within 150 to 200 miles of
these broadcasting stations. Eventually the system may
be extended to include the three great transverse air-
ways extending from the northern to the southern
boundaries of the United States.

The back to the farm movement has been a great

ALUMNI NEW
Prof. John E. Emswiler
Of the prominent alumni of other colleges who have
contributed to the fame of the University of Michigan,
Professor Emswiler, of the Mechanical Engineering
Department, is our first nominee for the Hall of Fame.
Professor Emswiler was graduated from Ohio State
University in 1903, and most of his time since then
has been spent in making college stu-
dents into engineers. He has been
at Michigan for twenty-three years.
In that time he has advanced from
instructor and assistant professor to
associate professor and professor.
After three years work with the
C. &amp; G. Cooper Company and
the General Electric Company, as
draughtsman, he became an instruc-
tor in the Mechanical Engineering
department. He was instructor for
five years before becoming assistant
professor, and in that time taught
several of the courses in mechanical
engineering, and also contributed to
the Technic. His contributions were,
as a usual thing, short but very in-
structive. Before the War the
Technic was devoted to rather heavy
technical writings in which mathematical formulae
played an important part. The professor's articles
are just one formula after another, but very interest-
ing to anyone who knows his way about the field. In
spite of their technical nature, the contributions deal
with widely varied subjects: "Design of Riveted Joints
for Boilers (June, 1910), three articles on the flow of
steam through nozzles (1911, 1912, 1915), a review of
a publication on power plant testing, (1912) and sev-
eral others which were published either while he was
an assistant or associate professor.
PROF. J. E. EMSWILER
Professor Emswiler's chief writing, however, is his
text book on Thermodynamics. The most interesting
thing about the book to those whose thermodynamics
are buried in the attic with their diplomas is the history
of its writing. In 1917, Prof. Emswiler returned from
his vacation, to find that there was an unexpected course
in thermodynamics which he had to
teach. He had to prepare his lec-
tures the day before they were given,
and he soon found that the prepara-
tion took entirely too much time, and
that the students taking the course
found it very difficult. After a study
of the methods used in teaching
thermodynamics, he decided that the
text books then in use approached
the subject from the wrong angle,
and at the suggestion of a salesman
from the McGraw-Hill Book Com-
pany, he wrote his own text. The
method of attack employed in this
book is that which uses the student's
viewpoint, and does not contain so
much involved mathematics. The
book was successful, and has been
used at this University and others
since the time of its publication.
Mr. Emswiler was made a Professor in 1920. Since
then, he has been one of the important men in the
College of Engineering, and, for all practical purposes,
the assistant head of the Mechanical Department.
Although the professor's writings are worthy of note,
his reputation would still be one of the best without
the added prestige that they give. To all students of
the Engineering College he is known as a very patient
man whom not even the idiosyncrasies of certain of
his understudies can ruffle. He is, to paraphrase, one
of those who put the joy in life.

The New Diesel Aircraft Engine
Continued from page 7
volume cycle is more efficient than the constant pressure
or Diesel cycle.
A Diesel motor differs in operation from the gaso-
line engine in another important aspect, that is, in its
higher compression. The average motor developes
pressures in the neighborhood of 550 lbs. per sq. in.,
whereas the high speed Diesel operates under a pressure
approaching 1200 lbs. per sq. in.
Although the normal pressures in a Diesel are much
higher than the normal pressures in a gasoline engine,
the average pressure in a Diesel is about 25% less
than the average pressure in a gasoline engine. The
reason for this is that, while the pressures in a Diesel
reach a maximum of about 1200 lbs. during combus-
tion, the pressure drop is much more rapid than in the
gasoline engine.
Such very high compression in stationary engines
would necessitate heavy, cumbersome construction, but
in aircraft design a maximum strength with minimum
weight is required. In the new motor especial care was
taken to utilize materials best suited to cope with the
individual stresses encountered so that the engine as
now developed weighs less than 3 lbs. per h.p.
The Diesel engine as adapted to aircraft usage em-
bodies many advantages not found in the gasoline en-
gine. The most important of these, without a doubt,
is reliability, since there is an increasing demand for
safer and more dependable air transportation. The
Diesel engine is more reliable because in two major
ways it has a distinct advantage over the gasoline
motor; namely, in carburetion and ignition.
Considering the first of these points, the Diesel en-
gine is furnished with a separate injection system for
each cylinder, compared with the single corburetor
found on the ordinary gasoline motor which usually
requires some kind of a rotary distributor or low pres-
sure supercharger. The failure of the carburetor
throws all cylinders out, but in the Diesel each cylinder
operates independently, as far as fuel injection is con-
cerned, insuring much more reliable operation. Then
again, comparing the two types of engines in regards
to ignition the Diesel is seen to be a great improvement.
On the gasoline motor a complicated ignition is re-
quired consisting of generator, distributor, and a great
many other parts, while the Diesel oil mixture is ignited
solely by the compression of the air charge. As in
the care of carburetion, each cylinder operates inde-
pendently so that no central system of ignition is
needed, which, if failure should occur, would throw the
whole motor out. This high tension electric ignition
employed on the gasoline engine seriously interferes
with radio communication since waves of sufficiently
high frequency are transmitted from the spark plugs
and primary interupter to cause static. With the in-
creasing use of radio equipment, the Deisel engine
should prove favorable in this respect as it does not
impair communication.
A great danger that has beset the gasoline powered
plane is that related to fire. In an airplane crash or
in the event of a fuel leakage, gasoline runs out over
the hot motor and is ignited quite easily. Often the
total destruction of the plane follows. The type of
fuel used in the Diesel is of such a nature that it does
not readily burn at temperatures occurring on the out-
side of the motor, even should the motor be heated,
so that practically all fire hazards are eliminated.
The economy of fuel consumption for the Diesel has
been one of its greatest assets both for the stationary
power plant engines and for the new high speed types.
For an illustration it might be well to consider the
flight made by Captain Woolson in the Stinson-De-
troiter equipped with Packard Diesel engine. He laid
his course from Detroit to Cleveland, Pittsburgh.
Washington, and finally terminated at Langley Field,
Va., with a total fuel consumption of 54 gallons of
furnace oil. This represents a cost of $4.68 or 8.7
cents per gallon. It has been estimated that a 200
horse-power gas engine burning aviation gasoline at a

cost of 30 cents per gallon, would consume 13 gallons
per hour, or 78 gallons in six hours, at a cost for the
trip of $22.40. The use of the Diesel represents a re-
duction of fuel costs of about 80%.
The fuel economy of a Diesel does not fall off ma-
terially at small loads because it operates at constant
compression irrespective of load. This cannot be said
of the gasoline engine because at light loads the throttle
considerably reduces compression which increases fuel
consumption.
A Plane Powered by the New Engine
Since a Diesel engine cylinder takes in as much air
as a carburetor type engine cylinder per cycle, it might
be expected to burn as much fuel per cycle as the latter.
If it did that, owing to its higher thermal efficiency,
it would show a higher average effective pressure.
However, since only an exceedingly short time is avail-
able for combustion in the Diesel cylinder, it happens
that about one-half of the air taken in is not utilized
for combustion. If it should happen that more fuel
is injected into the cylinder than is necessary for com-
bustion, it cannot combine with the air in such a short
space of time so passes out of the exhaust unburned,
with the result that the fuel consumption per horse
power hour increases. For this reason Diesel engines
are always operated with an excess of air, while car-
buretor-type engines nearly always operate with an
excess of fuel.
From another standpoint the fuel economy of the
Diesel is of considerable importance. Since the air-
plane must carry its own fuel, the more it carries, the
smaller its useful load and the smaller its cruising
range. The saving in fuel weight of the Diesel would
permit the airplane to operate with a longer cruising
range or it could be used to offset the greater weight
of the Diesel engine.
Although for stationary and marine use the Diesel
engine is quite highly developed, it has not been such
an easy matter to develop an engine of this type for
automobile or aircraft propulsion. In order to obtain
the high speed necessary without undue vibration, at
least four cylinders are required. This makes the in-
dividual cylinder quite small, and it is a difficult prob-
lem to measure accurately the very small quantity of
liquid fuel used per stroke. In a A]/2 by 6 in. Diesel
engine cylinder, which has a displacement of 95.4 cu.
in., the volume of air going in will be 66.8 cu. in. The
amount of liquid fuel which can be burned by this
volume of air, under the existing conditions, is one
fifteen-thousandth of this, or 0.0044 cu. in. This is
comparable with a drop of oil about three-sixteenths
of an inch in diameter. However, the problem of meas-
uring such a minute quantity of fuel is one of the
minor difficulties; what is far more difficult is to com-
pletely atomize and distribute the fuel charge through-
out the combustion chamber in the very short time
available.
There are several changes in design which, though
incidental, would come about upon the adaption of a
Diesel-engine powered plane. The most important of
these, perhaps, is that a single high powered engine
could be substituted for the tri-motored arrangement
prevalent on the larger cabin ships. This is because a
single Diesel motor is as reliable as the three gasoline
engines since, as already pointed out, the cylinders act
more or less independently of each other. It is quite
obvious that a single motored plane would operate more
efficiently than a multi-motored combination.
Taking all things into consideration the advent of
the Diesel engine as developed for aircrafts will give
the aviation industry a tremendous boost. It satisfies
the demands for safer and more reliable air transpor-
tation and above all it justifies its usage from an eco-
nomical standpoint. And everything pertaining to avi-
ation from the design of airplanes to the flight and
maintenance should be most favorably affected.

On Gliders and Gliding
Continued from page 24
uted much to. the improvement of gliders and to the
simplification of their construction, however, realizing
his inability to stand the physical shocks and jolts en-
countered in practicing this new art (he was past sixty
years of age at that time) he turned over the results
of all his and his predecessors' experience to a few
young able and energetic Americans, among whom were
Glenn Curtiss and the Wright brothers.
The Wrights, as is well known, practiced gliding
from 1900 to 1903, found the solution for the still un-
solved problem of control of lateral stability and on
December 17, 1903, made the first sustained and con-
trolled flights in a power driven airplane, thus opening
a new era for mankind.
Many people think that the glider has served its
most important purpose, and that it now remains only
a souvenir of this great achievement, and a plaything,
or at best a vehicle of a fascinating or thrilling sport.
This opinion, however, is not just at all.
As will be briefly accounted for below, since that
memorable date of December 17, 1903, the glider has
contributed much to the modern art of flying and is
bound to contribute still more.
Due to the restrictions as to military aviation, im-
posed upon Germany by the Peace Treaty after the
World War, the airminded youth of that country, who
otherwise would have found an outlet for their activi-
ties in the accordingly large air service of the huge
army that the country could maintain, turned toward
gliding and give it a new impetus. This resulted in
the organization of hundreds of glider clubs all over
the country, and the development of more efficient
gliders. Some of these gliders remained for hours in
the air, under the action of favorable breezes, and dura-
tion records of between 14 and 15 hours were estab-
lished a few years ago.
This movement, attracting college students in Ger-
many, primarily, soon started to spread all over Europe,
and is now spreading in this country due, chiefly, to
the enthusiastic efforts and generous support of Mr.
E. S. Evans, a prominent Detroiter, who created the
National Glider Association.
In this way, gliding is serving the following pur-
poses, at least: (1) As a most fascinating and safe
aerial sport since, due to the inherent stability of a well
built glider, an entirely inexperienced and unskilled per-
son, after launched in the air, can always get safely
down to the ground by the simple expediency of aban-
doning the controls.
(2) As an excellent, and the cheapest, method of
learning to fly an airplane, thus shortening the period
of training in the powered machine.
(3) As a method of improving the airplane design,
since the attempts of developing more efficient gliders,
demonstrated in the most striking manner the possibili-
ties of reducing the weight of the structure, as well as
the advantages of more careful streamlining of the
fuselage and various structural parts.
Therefore, gliding is now considered, quite generally,
as preliminary training for airplane pilots, and this use-
fulness of gliders will in all probability never cease.
New domains in the usefulness of gliders and gliding,
however, are being discovered. Lieutenant Thoret of
the French Army Air Service originated gliding flights
with the engine shut off, and in that way established
new duration records of between 8 and 9 hours. The
most remarkable thing about these records is, that they
were made in an obsolete type of training airplane,
which was perhaps the least efficient airplane in exist-
ence. It was a biplane with 12 struts between the
wings, 16 struts in the landing chassis, four wheels and
two skis, not to mention a corresponding number of
wires. He also made glider flights, hours in duration,
in a seaplane with heavy pontoons.
By taking up airplanes, under power, above mountain-
ous regions and flying them as gliders, he gained such
an experience in judging the disturbances in air cur-
rents, produced by the configuration of the ground
below him, that he was able to anticipate the effects of
the various sudden, and ordinarily unexpected, gusts of
wind and utilize them for his purpose of staying aloft
and clear of obstacles.
Flying above and among the mountains has been
justly considered as a dangerous stunt even by experi-
enced airplane pilots. However, Lieutenant Thoret
demonstrated that it can be made perfectly safe by
proper training in flying airplanes with the power shut
off. The outcome of this is, that the Potez Company
is now operating, regularly, sightseeing flights for
tourists in large ten and twelve passenger airplanes,
among the mountain peaks of the Mont Blanc group,
above glaciers, etc., thus providing beautiful and other-
wise inaccessible views and impressions for the pas-
sengers. All pilots employed by the Company, for this
kind of flying, have been trained by Lieutenant Thoret.
As an outcome of this new development in gliding,
the French government is starting a special gliding
school this year for army flyers, under the direction
of Lieutenant Thoret, thus establishing gliding as an
advanced training for graduate airplane pilots—a new
important and momentous development.
As I understand it, the operators of German com-
mercial air-lines are giving preference now to pilots
with experience in flying of gliders, as they have ob-
served that such pilots invariably make much better
emergency landings, i.e., with less damage to the planes
and less alarm to the passengers.
Gliding in rising air currents (referred to as soar-
ing) as encountered in mountainous regions around or
between certain clouds, enabling the glider to gain alti-
tude, cover considerable distance and stay almost in-
definitely in the air, is distinct from the common glid-

ARTERIES OF THE
OIL FIELDS
In 1928 over 5000 miles of trunk oil and natural
gas pipe lines, eight inches and over in diame-
ter, were laid with oxy-acetylene welded joints.
These lines involved over a million oxwelded
joints—tight, ductile, dependable—each joint
as strong as the pipe wall itself. In addition,
thousands of miles of welded pipe was used in
the petroleum industry for smaller diameter
gathering and distribution lines, station piping,
and refinery equipment.
Oxy-acetylene welding has met the increas-
ing demand for longer lines, higher working
pressures, lower maintenance costs and greater
operating efficiencies. As a result another of
the country's great industries has standardized
on this modern and better method for making
metal joints.
From time to time the oxy-acetylene industry is
in the market for technically trained men. It
offers splendid opportunities for advancement.

On Gliders and Gliding

ing practice, i.e., gliding down from elevated places in
still air. These, so to speak, higher form flying gliders,
while still not well understood, offer wonderful thrills
to the more experienced glider flyers. To give you an
idea of this kind of flying let me quote from the report
of Dr. W. Klemperer, a prominent pioneer of the Ger-
man post-war gliding development and now an engineer
with the Goodyear-Zeppelin Corporation at Akron,
Ohio, on his flight during the occasion of the last Na-
tional Air Races in Cleveland. He left Akron in the
afternoon of September 3 in the "Condor" (a soaring
type glider-built in Akron ) in tow behind the blimp
"Vigilant"y of the Goodyear-Zeppelin Corporation, go-
ing to Cleveland:
". j. . . . Unfortunately, it was extremely hot
and the wind very irregular, shifting 45 degrees almost
continuously. The ship was flown at about 40 miles
per hour, at which speed the soarer was very well under
control, although the take-off took quite some balancing
on account of the relatively slow acceleration. The
part otfCr the city of Akron was quite bumpy and rough.
It tooW^constant alertness to steer the glider in the path
of the blimp, following all its irregular motions in re-
sponse to the termal gusts. The length of the cable
was 400 feet. Fabric streamers had been tied to the
cable approximately 50 feet apart. They proved very
valuable because the cable was slack most of the time.
In order to avoid unpleasant jerking when the cable
went taught it was necessary to continuously correct
the course of the soarer for every motion the airship
would take and to be prepared to have as little yaw
as possible whenever the cable was tightening up. I
found it a relief to push down every time immediately
before the cable went taut. The part of the trip from
the outskirts of Akron as far as Ghent was quite
smooth and although several times the soarer strode
forward and flew abreast the airship with the tow cable
trailing behind in semi-circle fashion, it was not par-
ticularly difficult to maneuver it back behind the ship
by weaving sideways to the left and right within the
tolerance of the cable. Ofttimes the soarer would
outclimb the ship and I had difficulty in bringing it
down without overshooting so I had to resort to side
slipping.
"When we arrived over the hilly part of the country
between Osborn Corners and West Richfield the up-
ward currents carried the soarer so powerfully that it
became more and more difficult to stay within the 400
feet distance permitted by the cable. Due to the heat
the airship had a low ceiling and was subject to con-
siderable pitching and yawing. On one occasion one
of these irregular motions of the blimp occurred while
the soarer was riding several hundred feet above and
abreast its nose. It was impossible to follow the quick
motion before the cable went taut with a sudden jerk.
pulling downward, sideways and backwards, and
slipped out of the hook. I then continued to ride the
currents for several miles, the blimp following not far
away and at times quite close. Once I had a notion
to maneuver in position to catch the cable trailing from
the blimp, with my hand, but I gave it up when I saw
. how violently it whipped about. A safe landing was
made on a bare field at tbe corner of State Road 94
and Wiltshire Road, North Royalton. Although the
field was plenty large, difficulty was experienced in
bringing the ship to earth, as it would glide the whole
length of the field in a few feet altitude, carried by
the heat currents. I had to push it down when I came
to the end of the field, so that the shell of he fuselage
was slightly cracked. The damage is negligible and
will be repaired in a day or two. The wings did not
touch the ground in the landing and there was no
shock or any injury to the pilot, contrary to some
newspaper report. The landing was immediately re-
ported by phone to the Air Races Committee."
In conclusion, let me give an account of another
soaring flight, which, I am sure, the readers will find
still more interesting and thrilling.
I was surely not in a mood yesterday to make a
record. I would have preferred to go swimming or
to sleep. When I came to the starting point, without
any intention of flying, Pilot Hirth was already hang-
ing 3000' above the Wasserkuppe. When I put on
the belt of the parachute I thought it was ridiculous
for there was no wind at all and we waited. The
anemometer showed no wind at all. Then the hand
moved a little. Soon it went back to its original po-
sition. It started to sprinkle and the spectators dis-
persed. Suddenly the anemometer's hand springs up
to 12, to 18, to 21, to 24 speeds per second and was
rapidly going higher. I gave the well-known command.
The crew responded and I was up in the air. I did
not have any time to stay on the slope. The rain
poured down "pitter patter" on fuselage and wings. A
bean of sunlight flashed through the dark clouds—one
more—there is thunder on all sides. • And now starts
the race with the thunder-storm.
Fantastically built clouds crowd together behind me.
They come nearer and nearer. How will it end? Will
I be able to keep ahead of the thunder-storm? The
altimeter climbs without stopping. That may be my
salvation. I'm still rising. The higher I get the more
quiet it seems. 1 can see over the stormy clouds on
both sides. I already can see that it extends from
west to east and way out north. I spot the town of
Berka, far down below me. I am already 4,500' above
the starting point on the Wasserkuppe. Small white
clouds arising like pigeons below me. Wrecked clouds
are whirling around me. They are getting denser and
denser. A glance to my right and left showed me that
there is no escape any more. A game is starting. I
am trying to keep straight ahead eastwards, but it seems

architecture of the twentieth century are a realization
of the appreciably broadening type of mind that the
architect of today possesses in contrast to that of his
immediate predecessor. Amount of training for the
designer reflects directly on the quality of the work
produced. Preciseness and nicety in the use of archi-
tectural styles is prone to be the expression of a mind
of insufficient breadth handling unfamiliar materials.
This same mental attitude is evinced by formulation of
creeds and doctrines, to which the unrestrained edu-
cated mind so happily does not rely upon.
The last decade has erected a definite milestone in
American architecture. It marks with considerable
clearness the close of the period of general assimilation
among the profession of the ideas of the last and all
previous classic revivals, and the beginning of a new
enlightened epoch inspired by men unafraid of ex-
pressing themselves in true functional forms. The ex-
pansion of the architectural curriculum in the univer-
sities is also another work of this decade. As general
education tends to eliminate narrow prejudices and
bigoted creeds in a nation, so architectural education
similarly brings a broadened viewpoint that reflects
itself clearly in the truthful expression of the modern
building.
The educated architect of the present day has many
advantages over his predecessor. His technical train-
ing is more complete as a result of university training.
At preparatory schools he has had a supplementary
course which affected all his faculties in the same way
as his technical training improved his skill. He has,
moreover, a much wider range of completed work to
study, a richer literature, better opportunities for travel,
intercourse with the members of his profession and
with the general public through societies and organiza-
tions; all a development of recent years.
This cultivation enjoyed by the modern American
architect is having its natural effect. It has raised him
to a point where he is beginning to see that neither in
rigid precision nor in free originality does the actual
truth in design lie, but rather the "happy mean" tem-
pered by both but dominated by neither.
Given the background of a broadened taste that a
college education has bestowed upon the architect of
today and the natural originality of the American mind,
the present attempts at a new art now taking place
bid fair to become a basis of a sane and permanent
development rather than a sporadic growth as when
it first blossomed out a few years ago. Our present
attitude of mind recognizes the worth of a college edu-
cation in the architectural field and divests it of the
enslaving qualities which it had for our ancestors and
gives us complete mastery over it.
ARCHITECTURE IN AIRPORT DESIGN
The unprecedented progress in the perfection of air-
craft as transportation and military machines has been
creating, in the last decade, a number of new problems
which must meet immediate solutions if the develop-
ment is to continue at its present pace. The most for-
midable of these problems is the appalling need for air-
ports to accommodate the huge transport planes and
it is upon the shoulders of the architect that the re-
sponsibility of its solution falls. Many self-styled air-
port experts have already entered the field and have
succeeded in producing little other than poor and
expensive experiments, while qualified architects and
engineers, who are the better fitted to carry on the
practice, have been reluctant ot apply themselves. The
science of aviation has therefore issued its appeal to
the architectural world to aid in the construction of
beautiful and effective air terminals.
The design of the buildings and their surroundings
from the aesthetic viewpoint has generally been neg-
lected in the past, for aviation was too new and the
investment too insecure to justify the expenditure of
large sums of money for beauty. Airport owners,
however, now realize that the success of the project
is consistent with its appearance and are willing to
supply the necessary funds to build with real archi-
tectural quality. Progressive business has also awak-
ened to the need of better landing fields for it sees
that the customer, traveling by air, receives his first
and strongest impression of the city from the condi-
tion of its airport. Should it consist of formless sheds
and mired runways, it can not be expected to inspire
him with the due appreciation of the community be-
yond.
The position of the field in relation to its environs
is of major importance, for upon it hinges the effec-
tiveness of the entire ensemble. The most desirable
locality is in farm land, beyond the influence of urban
nuisances, yet within easy access of the population
centers. There should be no probability of future
construction on adjacent property such that will inter-
fere with the maneuvers of the planes or that will
produce objectionable drafts and excessive smoke. The
airport should be adequately served with transportation
lines to the business section and with an extensive rail-
road system as a night traveling supplement. Should
a large body of water be nearby, slips and ponds might
be provided for seaplane use. Allowances for later
development must always be made, for expansion is
certain and the possibility of acquiring more property
doubtful, due to the increased valuation because of the
establishment of the airport.
Careful consideration should be given the prepara-
tion of the fields and runways to insure safety in the
operation of the aircraft. The grounds must be thor-

oughly drained to maintain the soil formation firm and
solid during the wet seasons. The runways should
preferably be hard-surfaced, using either paving brock
or concrete. Brick has proved to be the most desir-
able since it reduces the glare of the sun and the night
lights. The directions of the runways are determined
by the position of the prevailing winds in order that
the planes may take off into the face of the wind.
Other runways in different directions are also provided
for contrary blows.
The grouping of the buildings depends entirely upon
Design For An Airport
the function of the airport. Should the problem be a
passenger terminal, an administration building, housing
ticket booths, waiting rooms, customs and post offices,
should occupyy the central position, with a hospital,
restaurant and hotel adjoining it. It is advisable to
locate this group of public buildings slightly in advance
of the hangar line in order that the controller may
have unobstructed view of the whole field. This will
also keep the nervous passenger, awaiting his plane,
from inspecting the repair shops, training schools and
hangars, where he would find evidence of accidents,
thereby augmenting his uneasiness. The line of hangars
should be parallel to the direction of the predominant
wind, allowing the plane to take off from the runway
directly in front of the sheds. All the remaining run-
ways must converge to the hangar in order to eliminate
excess taxiing. Living quarters for the pilots and
ground personnel with other small, dependent buildings
complete the group.
The illumination of the airport is a problem in itself,
involving a maze of complicated principles, but con-
sisting roughly of a series of border lights at the out-
lines of the field, air beacons, an illuminated wind direc-
tion indicator, danger lights on obstructions, and flood
lights for landing and take-off. Lighted markers are
required on all fields to guide the aviator in flight.
An airport, thoughtfully designed for arrangement
and appearance, embodying the principles which have
been outlined above, and satisfying the many other
minor requirements can play an important role in the
encouragement of aviation, for, as the old adage states,
"build the bird house and the birds will come." o
SKETCHING IN LEAD PENCIL FOR
ARCHITECTS
By Jasper P. Salwey. Chas. Scribner's Sons
The book is a clever little treatise on sketching in
the field for architectural study, containing numerous
illustrations and some very valuable suggestions. It is
an hour's reading which will provide both entertain-
ment and instruction for the student in pencil and
even others. The text rambles along in almost story
fashion, full of interesting little bits of sentence struc-
ture and slang phrases. The author, assuming the
reader a novice, conducts him through the various
stages of education in sketching until, at the finish, he
is an accomplished pencil mechanic.
Mr. Salway is an expert teacher and certainly a
first-rate entertainer but as a sketcher of architectural
subjects, his standards fall a little short. His draw-
ings shown in the book lack the crispness and vitality
necessary to an effective representation. In contrast,
there are several pieces by Otto R. Eggers, S. C. Hut-
ton, Harold Falkner and others which seem nearly
flawless. Regardless of its one deficiency, the book
is an admirable addition to the shelves, either as a
classroom text or as cultural reading.
o
TRAINING THE ARCHITECT
The history of the evolution of architectural educa-
tion spans centuries of time, beginning as early as the
first years of the Ancient Kingdom in Egypt and con-
tinuing into the present day. There is even evidence
of the teaching of the art of building in the prehistoric
age. Schools for the training of the architect of course
did not exist at that early date nor even in the relatively
recent medieval period. As with the painters, sculptors
and musicians, instruction was given under the ap-
prentice system by the masters of the arts and crafts.
To this day the method retains considerable popularity
and advantage, boasting as its most brilliant modern
example the late Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue.
Apprenticeship, however, is unfitted for quantity
production of embryo architects—hence the modern
system that necessity has invented. The famous Ecole
des Beaux Arts at Paris, which during the last cen-
tury was the recognized school of architecture, fur-
nishes an example of the transition from the old prin-
ciple to the more recent one of classroom education.
The students worked under the observation of prac-
ticing architects, received suggestions and criticism

founded on their broader knowledge and experience
but submitted the finished designs to a jury from the
Ecole for final judging and publication. The Beaux
Arts methods invaded the United Stales a few decades
ago and still dominates the field although several schools
have diverged radically.
Educators have recently turned their attention
toward a study of architectural instruction in the Amer-
ican university and have arrived at a series of inter-
esting and important discoveries. In the first place, a
four-year course has been found quite inadequate. It
not only fails to give the student a comprehensive work-
ing knowledge of architecture but it almost entirely
neglects the cultural side, the importance of which can-
not be denied. Some schools offer six-year curricula,
while others, as Harvard, require a degree for entrance
but the greater number still cling to the four-year pro-
gram in fear of decreased enrollment.
There appears to be a tendency in our institutions
toward encouragement for skill in presentation rather
than in real architectural expression. Juries often are
unconsciously susceptible to a beautiful picture and
will rate a good rendering of a mediocre design far
above a poorer drawing yet perfect composition. The
result is that students tend to develop into Tenderers,
not architects. Instructors who are clever illustrators
are many times set to criticizing design on the strength
of their draftsmanship, although their ability and ex-
perience in architecture is limited and doubtful. Here
experts find a new pitfall in the prospective architect's
training, namely, poor or misplaced teachers. Schools
whose departments of engineering and architecture are
combined present the most difficult problem insofar as
such subjects as Mechanics, Heating and Ventilation
are often given by professors of engineering whose
methods little suit the artistically minded designer.
Trials have proven that an environment of painters
and sculptors is better adapted to the needs of an
architect. Colleges of fine arts have shown, however,
great reluctance to admit architectural subjects into
their programs, thereby denying the profession unques-
tionable advantage.
The students in the American universities are grad-
ually absorbing these truths; they are becoming aware
that the four-year plan of study is insufficient, that the
instruction and the disposition of the courses are many
times faulty and they frequently add one or two years
of graduate work, giving a change of method and
broadening of scope. Some find that four years, sup-
plemented with eight or ten months of study in Europe,
will give them adequate training to carry them well up
into the architectural profession.
The mere mention of foreign study immediately sug-
gests to most men a mass of financial difficulties, but
those who have had the good fortune to travel return
with amazing stories of economy made possible by the
low cost of living and reduced student's rates. The ven-
ture is no impossibility for anyone, although he may
be required to finance himself or even others. The
average good draftsman's salary, coupled with mod-
erate thrift, permits of the opportunity of either ex-
tended study here or a few months abroad.

with ceremonies international in scope that will record
the achievements of the Society for the past fifty years,
evaluate the influence of mechanical engineering upon
the social and economic life of the country, and point
the way to future development. It is expected that
the five days, April 5-9, 1930. will be given over to the
celebration.
The preliminary meeting of the Society on February
16, 1880, was held in the office of the American Ma-
chinist. It is fitting, therefore, that the proceedings
start in New York with a visit to the present office of
the American Machinist where appropriate ceremonies
will be held. The organization meeting was held on
April 7, 1880, in the auditorium of Stevens Institute
of Technology at Hoboken, and on the second day of
the celebration in 1930 the scene of this first meeting
will be visited. Stevens Institute is preparing an elab-
orate pageant which will depict the early life of the
Society. The final three days of the celebration will
be held in Washington, D.C., with an interesting pro-
gram of stimulating speakers from many other nations.
Invitations have been issued to the engineering so-
cieties and engineering schools throughout the world
to send delegates to this event which bids fair to estab-
lish a new mark in engineering society development.
The student branch of the A. S. M. E., here at Mich-
igan, is planning a year of unprecedented activity. A
number of speakers of national prominence in engi-
neering circles have already been engaged to speak
before the meetings of the society, which will be held
fortnightly during the school year.
At the first meeting of the year, held on Thursday
evening, October 24th, a very large turnout of both
old and new members appeared. After an hour of
formal business and general discussion, the meeting
adjourned to the Union, where a combined meeting of
the A. S. M. B. and the Industrial Society was held.
At this meeting a very interesting and exceedingly
valuable talk on "Industrial Engineering Problems in
the Automobile Industry" was given by E. K. Wennur-
lund, Industrial Engineer for the General Motors Cor-
poration.

impossible. The compass seems to have gone crazy,
and it runs around in a circle. A howling noise is
commenced suddenly around me. My speedometer that
otherwise climbed only up to 30 miles an hour starts
trembling—jumps up to 50, 60 and 70 miles per hour.
Somewhere around 45 might be the highest allowed
speed. By pulling the machine I try to lower the
speed. I have the feeling as if I am staying with my
feet against the sky. I am getting pushed down by
some unresistible pressure against the seat.
I start thinking of my parachute. Suddenly it be-
came very quiet and no noise was apparent at all. My
speedometer goes back at once to zero. I try to bring
the machine back to normal speed. I have the feeling
as if I had tumbled forward, head over heels. At once
my vision becomes as in a fever dream, first very faint
and then more distinct. Fields and gardens are circling
around me. It gets light. I balance my machine again.
The town of Eisenach lies below me and I keep right
on. My rain-soaked hair starts drying as well as my
shirt. Some cool altitude for 6,000' of altitude. My
teeth are chattering. The town of Gotha comes in
sight. The compass shows toward the east. I keep
on going through to Thueringer country. Fields and
town pass by. My watch shows 7:00 o'clock in the
evening. The visibility is getting bad. The moisture
of a hot summer day lies above the country. Time
passes by and it starts darkening. W ide empty fields
are stretching below me. I am seeking the final point
of my flight. The clouds in front of me are vanishing.
I am coming down. There are woods below me, far
away a town, a railroad, quite a large place, just suit-
able for landing my ship. A few curves and the ship
slips through the grass. The flight is finished. o
Some of the efficiency engineers that were observing
the great jam the faculty had on the days of registra-
tion stated that a great deal of time and trouble could
be saved if some man were placed outside of the Cad-
illac to take charge of classification between the acts—
a better selection of courses would probably result.

DESIGN
BOX-HEADER BOILER
The newC-E Single-Seam Box-Header
Boiler is a distinct advance in construc-
tion and design over ordinary box
header practice.
In the new design —
The wrapper or butt strap joining the tube and
hand hole sheets is — ELIMINATED.
ONE ROW OF RIVETS JOINS THE TUBE SHEET
DIRECTLY TO THE HAND HOLE SHEET.
The row of rivets on the tube side of the wrap-
per strap is—ELIMINATED.
THERE IS ONLY ONE CAULKING EDGE and
this faces the outside—making inspection easy
and removing all rivets out of the hot gas and
fire zones.
Three thicknesses of metal at the caulking joint at
the ears are - REDUCED TO TWO THICKNESSES.
This new design provides an unusual factor of
safety. For instance, in the standard unit sold for
160 lb. to 250 lb. working pressure, the header
joint is adequate for a working pressure of450 lb.
Acareful inspection of this new boiler will
convince you that the C-E Box-Header
Boiler is a better Box-Header Boiler.

While you Seniors were shuffling worries about
machine stresses and saturation curves with
those of football last fall, a group of your pred-
ecessors, not so many years ahead of you,
were playing the game with grim realities.
The Columbia Steel Company of Pittsburg,
California, completed plans on September 12th
to build a new tinplate plant. On the 13th
they gave an order to Westinghouse for two
5,000 horsepower synchronous motors to
drive the rolls, to be physically the
largest synchronous motors ever built.
Delivery of the first was wanted
ninety days.
Ninety days in which to
design, manufacture, assem-

ble, test and ship any large unit, let alone a
new achievement in size and type of construc-
tion, affords no time for idle speculation.
Westinghouse men went at the job as only an
experienced and thoroughly equipped organi-
zation could do. And on the scheduled date,
four flat cars and a box car rolled out of
the Westinghouse plant, carrying the completed
and tested motor.
It was an industrial victory, as satisfying as
any athletic gain. Teamwork and indi-
vidual skill had won. Westinghouse had
once more made good and upheld the
reputation that earns the big
electrical jobs for Westing-
house men.

The Growth of the College
of Architecture
—A Quarter of a Century of Progress at Michigan
By .IOIIX .1. WHITE, 'U2A
RAISING its vane-topped roof high above the
campus, the lofty tower of the new Architec-
ture Building typifVes not only pure artistic
achievement with brick and stone; but also the estab-
lishment at Michigan, after
twenty years of careful
planning and steady growth,
of a foremost school of
architecture.
One sees today from
South University Avenue
the full stately view of the
tower and front facade of
the new four-story structure
housing the college, with its
terraced first floor and broad
arched windows, as it stands
overlooking the beautiful set-
ting of the garden-lawn of
Martha Cook. Inside, the
building combines simple
beauty with utility and meets
every need with its spacious
well-lighted library, museum,
lecture auditorium, a n d
drafting rooms. Nothing
has l)een overlooked that
would give the five hundred
students an inspirational en-
vironment in which to solve
their problems in design.
Contrast this present pic-
ture of ;i complete school of

design in which many students from other colleges,
in addition to the 368 architectural students enrolled,
who study painting, freehand drawing, modeling, de-
signing of furniture, decorative glass, metal and mo-
saic, with what was twenty
years ago but a handful of
students working in the din-
gy confines of a single attic
room in the old Engineering
building. Truly, the College
of Architecture today repre-
sents a notable realization of
a dream come true for Pro-
fessor Emil Lorch, for it was
he who has been its head and
guiding hand from the very
start. It is he who is to be
credited with its progressive
educational leadership and
with presenting the obvious
need for adequate quarters
for his students and in the
end. through President Bur-
ton, the regents and friends
of the University getting the
appropriation from the State.
Finally, it was he who de-
signed the very building to
house this professional
school.
In 1906 Professor Lorch
was called to organize classes
in architecture as a sub-de-

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
partment of the College of Engineering, the first en-
rollment consisting of sixteen students. For almost a
quarter of a century since, Professor Lorch has worked
and planned and from this humble beginning the Col-
lege of Architecture came into being. Student interest
in the profession quickened and the enrollment in-
creased steadily. Parallel with the increase in enroll-
ment came an increasingly large faculty, a more in-
clusive scope of work, and better equipment. Then,
in 1913, the Board of Regents and President Hutchins
gave the College of Architecture control of its pro-
grams of study and in general charged it with the
administration of its affairs.
As the College expanded, additional room was needed
and the space in the Old Engineering building became
inadequate for the differ-
ent branches of study so
that the various art
classes had to be divided
among the other build-
ings of the campus. Un-
til 1926 the drafting and
drawing rooms occupied
portions of the extreme
north and west ends of
what is now the West
Engineering Building,
design classes were con-
ducted in the older Me-
c h a n i cal Engineering
Shops Building, and in
the still older Pharmacol-
ogy Building worked the
sculptors in the model-
ing classes.
With the completion
of the new Architecture Building in 1927 came a bet-
ter equipped and more unified school of design. No
longer was it necessary for the architects in their bright
colored smocks to mingle in the grime of the machine
shops and no longer was it necessary for students en-
tering the Architectural College to be given campus
guide books in order that they might locate their vari-
ous classrooms.
As more new and better equipment together with the
spacious rooms of the new building allowed an even
greater expanding scope, additional study programs and
courses were added along with a larger faculty organ-
ization for the varied instruction. Beginning with
classes in architectural design and history, there was
presently developed a staff for teaching drawing, paint-
ing, and modeling, the faculty comprising a composite
of architects, painters, decorative designers and a sculp-
tor. In 1928 the first two students were graduated from
the four year program of decorative design.
There are at present five four-year programs of study
leading to a degree: Architecture, Architectural Design,
Architectural Engineering, Decorative Design, and this
Aquatint Study by John C. Crissey, '30A
year, due to the increasing interest in art, there has
been developed a four-year program for art teachers,
in which the instruction will be given jointly by the
schools of Education and Architecture.
Several years ago there was inaugurated, for the first
time in American architectural schools, the policy of
having a visiting professor, Dr. Eliel Saarinen being
the first incumbent; he was here part of the year 1923-
1924 and also the second semester 1924-1925. He was
followed by Samuel Chamberlain. In 1927-1928 Mr.
Lars Marnus lectured on old and new Danish architec-
ture. Last year Professor Johnny Roosval of the Uni-
versity of Stockholm lectured on Swedish Architecture
and during the present year it is expected to have an-
other visiting lecturer from Europe.
A m ong the faculty
brought together by Pro-
fessor Lorch there have
been or are a number of
men of outstanding abil-
ity. Dr. Saarinen brought
a purely continental point
of view, emphasizing the
progressive and modern
trend which has distin-
guished this from the
outset from all other
American architectural
schools. Professor Ern-
est Wilby came with
wide reputation as a
practitioner, and is a
modern designer with a
splendid English back-
ground. Professor Rous-
seau ably teaches the log-
ical point of view with respect to architectural compo-
sition of the flcole des Beaux-Arts, while Professor
Titcomb is equipped with a fine critical sense and a
wide first-hand knowledge of the art of Europe. Sam-
uel Chamberlain's draftsmanship and his influence re-
main as unique in their way as are the poetic landscapes
in oil by Ertiest Harrison Barnes. Jean Paul Slusser is
widely known in art circles for his water colors, Myron
Chapin for his paintings and batiks, Maestro Valerio
for his portraits, Fred Aldrich in the field of pastels and
Roscoe Wood in making decorative wrought iron. Dr.
Onderdonk's book on ferro-concrete is a real contribu-
tion in that field while Victor Slocum enjoys a growing
reputation as a sculptor. The classes in creative arts
all show the impress of these men and others whose
names might well be carved into cornerstones rather
than signed on canvas. An ever-present characteristic
of the architectural faculty has been the wide range of
school training and point of view represented by its
members.
During the past six years exhibitions of various kinds
bearing directly on the instruction have been hung in

Exposition Buildings in Brunn(Brno)
Wty FRANCIS S. ONDEKDOIVK, T. S. D.
Figure i. Main Exposition Building from entrance to the grounds.
BRNO is hard to pronounce, yet the reader may
Find consolation in hearing that the Czech lan-
guage has many words which are much more
difficult for the English tongue to master. Approxi-
mately one quarter of the citizens of Czechoslovakia
helong to the German race and hence the traveller who
speaks German can get along very well.
Brunn. as Brno is
called by the Germans, is
the second largest city of
Czechoslovakia, having
250,000 inhabitants; it is
the capital of Moravia, a
province in the western
Czech part of the young
Slavic republic. As
Brunn lies further east
than Prague, it is closer
to the geographical cen-
ter of Czechoslovakia
and hence was selected as
site for the Exposition of
Contemporary Culture
which was held to cele-
brate the tenth anniver-
sary of the founding of
the Czechoslovakia Re-
public in 1918.
The buildings were
erected for permanent
use and in this, their sec-
ond summer, they housed
the Exhibition of Mod-
ern Trade. The illustra-
tions of the Main Hall
which I had seen con-
vinced me that this gem
of the exposition must
be one of the most inter-
esting of all modern
buildings and I therefore
arranged to visit Brunn on my trip through Europe
this summer. I felt fully rewarded on beholding the
giant of glass and ferro-concrete which constitutes the
largest exposition hall in Europe. The photographs
alone hardly explain the arrangement of the building but
a glance at the plan (Eig. 1) shows that it can be
compared to a capital "A" with a high rotunda at the
apex which faces the entrance of the exposition
grounds (Fig. 2.) The legs of the "A" consist of
large halls covered with parabolic vaults. From these
two main radiating halls smaller halls which are parallel

tect. Dr. I'alenta, Engineer.
to each other branch off on both sides; they too are
paraboloids and hence parabolic cross vaults are created
at the intersections.
This Main Exposition Building covers an area of
16,000 square meters and was designed by Josef Kalous,
a Prague architect who won the competition. Accord-
ing to "Die Bau-und Werk Kunst" of Vienna. Dr.
Valenta. the engineer
who had charge of the
construction, changed the
design of Mr. Kalous
considerably: it is due
to him that parabolic bar-
rel-vaults were intro-
duced, and they are in-
deed very remarkable.
As the illustrations show,
the concrete parabolic
arches and the longitudi-
nal concrete ribs form a
network in which small
panels of glass are em-
bedded. The gradation
of light brought about by
the 9000 square meters
ef curved glass is very
effective for the interior;
the glass surfaces reflect-
ing the sunlight in vary-
ing degrees count very
much for the impression
conveyed by the exteri-
or. In addition the mul-
tiplicity of directions of
the parabolic halls gives
shadows contrasting with
shining glass of differen-
tiated brilliancy.
Another characteristic
which counts as much on
the exterior as on the in-
terior is the profusion of curved surfaces and curved
lines. Most of the surrounding smaller exposition
buildings portray the mania for straight surfaces and
angular shapes which so many contemporary architects
alone think worthy of our modern age. By contrast,
the Main Exposition Building shows forth the beauty
of the curve and especially the dynamic quality of the
parabola. Readers who doubt that these forms are
suitable for execution in reinforced concrete will find
further suggestions on this subject in the book, "Ferro-
concrete Style."


November, 1929
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
On beholding this building, the American architect
will feel worried at the thought of the labor expended
in making the forms for its complex concrete frame;
yet let us not forget that in all ages works of art de-
manded great expenditure of time and labor. Why
should the Ferro-Concrete Style be an exception? Two
hundred and thirty days were required for the erec-
tion of the Brunn Main Exposition Building whereas
Gothic cathedrals grew during centuries. As Professor
Mecesneffy predicted in 1911 in his book on the artist-
ic treatment of ferro-concrete, reinforced concrete is
creating an architecture which has many similarities
with Gothic. Standing beneath the intersection of the
parabolic barrel vaults one must indeed sense that the
genius of the Gothic masters has been reincarnated in
men like J. Kalous and
Dr. Valenta. Sincerity,
simplicity and the consis-
tent application of the
structurally best arch—the
parabolic one — produce
this effect. The three
arches which converge to-
wards the base repeat on
a large scale constructions
which were typical of
Gothic. Expansion joints
which are visible on the
interior as well as on the
exterior separate the struc-
ture into units which can
react to changes of temp-
erature independently.
The circular entrance
hall has a diameter of
thirty meters and consists
of a skeleton of twelve
arcbed ribs which are con-
nected by two horizontal
rings six meters and thirty
meters respectively above
the ground. In the center
of this rotunda is a statue
in ■■■ ■■■ Uat»
if1 W 1 !E
of the present President
of Czechoslovakia, . G. Masaryk. A flat concrete slab
which encircles the rotunda flaring out a little above
the doors, serves as marquise and is crowned by a ring
of flowers which introduce some color into the light
hues of the glass and concrete.
The parabolic vaults of the rotunda and of the radi-
ating halls pierce the enclosing cubic shapes similar to
a chicklet that carries yet a part of its shell. The new,
truly characteristic curved surfaces emerging from the
pseudo-typical angular shapes symbolize the present
stage of the Ferro-Concrete style. The Brunn Main
Exposition Building is a great creation comparable in
its significance to the Centenary all in Breslau, Ger-
many (1913) and to the churches of Professor Bohm,

Pinand and the brothers Perret. It represents a step
forward in the great development which started with
the Market-hall of Breslau whose parabolic arches
were poured more than twenty years sooner.
The pavilion "Man and His Origin,'' as well as the
buildings of the "Electric Farm" echo the motif of
the Main Exposition Building. In their design the
walls and roof of traditional architecture were replaced
by a vault in which wall and roof were merged into one.
Not artist's whims but structural possibilities are cre-
ating such examples of a "parabolic style."
Two other buildings of the Brunn Exposition are re-
markable for their spiral ferro-concrete stairs which
encircle a central column; in the one instance this col-
is terminated by a fountain capped by a lighting-fixture.
Just because these stairs
echo the type which is so
often found in Gothic
towers they show all the
more strongly by contrast
the tremendous advance
which reinforced concrete
represents when compared
with stone. They are built
on the cantilever princi-
ple whereas the medieval
ones usually had an out-
side cylindrical wall in ad-
dition to the central col-
umn.
These spiral stairs in-
troduce the motif of the
main tower of the expo-
sition. Its reinforced con-
crete stair-structure car-
ries light frames with
glass panels which consti-
tute the four sides of this
remarkable glass-tower. It
is forty meters high and
is crowned by a platform
which affords a splendid
view. In this tower archi-
tect Cermak has carried
out an idea which Frank Lloyd Wright proposed for
office-buildings. The illustrations afford ample insight
into the details of this remarkable design so that a fur-
ther description is unnecessary. It suffices to point out
that ferro-concrete masters the third dimension by its
ease of projecting in any length, and thickness, and with
any desired strength; thus a central spindle or pier is
all that is necessary to support a stairway or the four
glazed sides of a tower and the roof in addition thereto.
Rattmkunst—"Space Art,"—as the Germans sometimes
call architecture, comes into its own through reinforced
concrete.
The Glass Tower and the Main Exposition Hall are
buildings which represent significant stages in the evo-

Famous Architects in History, II
—Thomas Jefferson 1743-1826
THOMAS JEFFERSON, lawyer, diplomat, pub-
lic official, statesman, and planter, has remained
one of America's foremost figures. Successful
in everything that he undertook, it was due to his keen
insight and breadth of vision that during his long life
of active service he became, twice governor of Vir-
ginia, minister to France, Secretary of State in Wash-
ington's cabinet, Vice-President and twice President of
the United States, and author of the Declaration of
Independence.
He is not, however, readily
associated by the lay mind
with the architectural profes-
sion, but true to his thorough
and business-like manner, he
studied and mastered the con-
structive beauty and simple
dignity of Greek art and exe-
cuted it for his purposes in
such a brilliant manner that
he is accredited with a domi-
nating place in the history of
American Architecture.
The revival of interest in
Thomas Jefferson's great ver-
satility has stimulated anew a
study of his works as an archi-
tect. This study has been ac-
companied by an increased ap-
preciation of his very success-
ful architectural achievements,
and, as was natural, when one
is told that a man without spe-
cial training did accomplish so well what others with
ample training so often have failed to accomplish, won-
der and amazement have occasionally grown into skepti-
cism.
During Jefferson's lifetime, and for a half century
thereafter, no question was raised as to who was the
architect of Virginia's great seat of learning. Many
were then living who had watched this building take
its form under his hand. Many were then living whose
own colonial homes were the offspring of his genius.
The first born of Jefferson's architectural children,
the most ingenious and in many respects the most diffi-
cult was his own home, Monticello. This was planned
in its essentials and begun by 1769 and, while it was
not completed for thirty-one years, the foundation plan
was modified during that time in only a slight respect.
The dream of erecting a house of noble distinction
was taking possession of the mind of young Jefferson
University of Virginia, Jefferson's outstanding
civic achievement.
while he was a student in college, enjoying the pleasures
of Virginia's polite society, the guest of Governor Fau-
quier and the protege of Small and Wythe. During the
vacation of 1762-63 when he was in his twentieth year,
after spending his days in study, he would at sunset
cross the Rivanna, in his own canoe, from Shadwell to
Monticello Mountain, and leave new instructions for his
laborers who were even then, seven years before he be-
gan building, leveling its summit upon which he was to
erect the grand edifice. After
the fire in 1770 destroyed his
birthplace at Shadwell, he
moved his mother's family into
Monticello, which was far
enough advanced to house
them comfortably, and in the
winter of 1772 it was, although
incomplete, ready to receive
his bride.
On the completion of Mon-
ticello, he became the arbiter,
the critic, and the instructor
in this art, and his advice and
his services were urgently
sought by all the prominent
planters of the day, as well as
by the public, for the Virginia
Capitol Building was in a great
part his creation. His fame as
an architect was not confined
to his own State or even coun-
try. Monticello was visited by
many distinguished foreigners
and written of in books of travel in foreign languages.
Jefferson believed in removing from view the symbols
which suggested service, the offices and shops for the
conduct of the planters business, always holding that
in the soul of the home quiet dignity should prevail.
He began by concealing all these handicraft activities
through hidden passageways and stairs which were cun-
ningly tucked away in unobtrusive fashion.
The ingenious ignorance affected by those who as-
sert that Jefferson forgot his stairways is highly absurd.
Jefferson did not forget to provide stairs, on the con-
trary, stairways were the subject always of his serious
consideration. He looked upon them as a horrible
necessity; to his artistic sense they were extremely of-
fensive. His attempt to secure greater architectural
dignity than usual to a home required stateliness, high
ceilings, one roof—required that the ceiling should not
at once with a vulgar voice tell the tale of its being

far as traffic goes and it added greatly to the appear-
ance of, and the approach to, both Hill Auditorium and
the Women's League Building. On the other hand the
improvement of North University was a disappointment
to those who had hoped that this street would some day
be closed to traffic. Such
an arrangement would
have made the campus ap-
proaches from the two
corners much less haz-
ardous than at present,
and at the same time
would have made for
greater unity among the
University buildings now
very much separated and
badly cut by traffic lanes.
In fact, the central cam-
pus is cut off from rela-
tionship with its new
growth by busy streets on
all sides. This is to be
regretted, as access to the
hub of the campus is neck-
breaking for the students. Quite recently a student
was rather seriously injured at one of these intersec-
tions. The University must look after the student who
walks as well as the one who drives. For these reasons
it has been the hope of some far-sighted individuals
that all the streets (including State Street) bordering
on the central campus should some day be closed to
automobile traffic.
At present this may seem a ridiculous idea, but as
the University expands, the campus will become still
more widely cut up, and everything that we can do to
keep it a unit the more advantageous it will be for
future students. Dormitories probably will some day
occupy much of the land west of State street. Then
perhaps it would be wise to close this artery to automo-
bile traffic—leaving the street as a great promenade,
and erecting at the corner of State and William streets
some fine monumental entrance. Something similar
to the famous Harvard gates would not be amiss. Sev-
eral of these gates could be effectively placed clue to the
great extent of our campus. It would also be splen-
did if the whole area could be entirely surrounded by
a fine wall.

Such a cause might well be taken up by the "Alum-
nus"—some old grad would be happy to give the Uni-
versity a beautiful wall with fine gates. It would doubt-
lessly bring back to him memories of an old white paling
fence, which once surrounded the University plot. An
arrangement of this type would give an air of quiet that
the campus now lacks—or are we now perhaps in such
a state completely enveloped by business, motor cars,
and the world at large, that setting apart of the Uni-
versity would be detri-
mental to our present at-
titude of speed and pro-
duction? On the con-
trary, an orderly arrange-
ment and a closing in of
the campus would be in
harmony with our mod-
ern thoughts of planning
and efficiency. A wall
around the campus would
certainly be far different
from the present scatter-
ing and unrelatedness of
buildings and would have
a distinctly unifying ef-
fect that is not to be de-
nied.
There are many beau-
tiful buildings on the campus—more are being built
every year. It is unfortunate, however, that we are not
able to view them all well and fully appreciate their
beauty. Especially is this true of the Union with its
fine tower, the Literary building and Angell Hall, the
portico of which is strikingly beautiful. The exceptions
are perhaps the Main Library, the Architecture build-
ing and Clements Library. The Main Library is situ-
ated at the end of a mall and is so placed that it can
be admired from almost any part of the main campus.
The effect is most striking when approached from
the mall which is an extension of Ingalls Street. It is
to be regretted that every fine building on the campus
couldn't be displayed to the same advantage.
At some future date there will be opposite the li-
brary at the other end of the mall, which will extend
as far as Huron street, a great Campanile. This
scheme if ultimately carried out should constitute the
strongest part of the campus plan. However, it will
never be the nucleus that it had been planned to be.
due to the tremendous growth of the University in the
past few years which necessitated many unforseen

Modern Furniture in America
By DOROTHE M. WHITE, f30 Decorative Design
AX authority on decorative design was recently
confronted by a student and was asked about
his attitude toward modern furniture. The
student, in raising the point, very emphatically pointed
out that in choosing modern furniture one had the
privilege and freedom to select all the strong, bright,
and cheery colors one wished, while the same is hardly
true of traditional furniture. The decorator answered
that this was not quite true inasmuch as strong color
could never be at its best except when used with neutral
colors. This interesting age can best be expressed by
stronger color combinations
which are set off by rich
neutrals. New combinations
other than color have devel-
oped also. Various woods
are being used together with
an entirely pleasing effect.
Unfinished wood laid in hori-
zontal and vertical stripes
make a very pleasing effect.
Unfamiliar wood is taking
the place of the traditional
oak, walnut, and mahogany.
The new wood is sometimes
combined with the old and
interesting inlaid designs are
made of the natural wood
using the grain as part of the
design. The modern decor-
ator has introduced some
striking combinations. Novel
woods such as Macassar
ebony or cream colored syca-
more offer many possibilities.
Not only new wood, but combinations of metal and
wood give alluring effects.
With modernism pushing to the foreground, vivid
and bold colors have been introduced and the results
have been quite encouraging. The general public is
becoming accustomed to its constant presentation and
now their interest is aroused.
Living conditions today are vastly different from
what they were twenty years ago. As the result of
the urbanization of our country and mass production of
machine-made products, we have a different sort of life.
With room becoming more and more at a premium
in our cities, we have been forced to live in apart-
ment houses, and homes of fewer rooms, thus requiring
us to readjust our modes of living, while numerous
inventions have lightened the burden of looking after
our homes. We are faced with the problem, among

others, of how to obtain suitable and effective decora-
tion as the result of these new conditions.
At present we are being attracted to what is known
as "art moderne" furniture, supposedly designed to
meet the needs of modern living conditions and her-
alded as the beginning of a new movement in furniture
design. It had its origin in Europe about thirty years
ago, but is only of recent advent in this country. It
remains to be seen whether or not this new kind of
furniture will effectively solve the problem now at hand.
Thus far, most of the so-called modern furniture
produced in this country, as
well as in Europe, has been
characterized by eccentricity,
mere novelty, and freakish-
ness of design. Critics have
claimed that what has been
produced has only been made
to satisfy the desire to pro-
duce something different and
unlike anything made before.
It is for this reason that
many people are inclined to
look with disfavor upon the
movement. An American
style is developing slowly
and gradually. Each foreign
country has its own style and
characteristics which have
evolved only after a number
of years of thought and
study.
However, eccentricity is
not and should not be the
chief and highest expression
of modern furniture. A number of producers, it is
true, began by placing on the market furniture which
the general public would not receive. These producers
have realized their mistake and are now creating pieces
of furniture that can be used in the average American
home. They are now agreed upon the fact and are at-
tempting to educate the public to see the utility and
beauty rather than the eccentricity in modern furniture.
To date, there can be no doubt that more bad than
good modern furniture has been produced. In the good
that has been produced, however, there are discernible
possibilities of lasting value and significance that may
contribute something of stability and permanence.

after following the modern movement abroad for a long
time made this statement: "Had modernism has reached

Ancient Temple Uncovered
in Palestine
By LYLE F. ZISLER, e32A
THE expedition of the University of Pennsyl-
vania, returning from a successful season in
the Land of Caanan, Palestine, reports a series
of interesting and important discoveries. The Great
Temple at Beison, remembered by the reference to it in
the Bible but for thirty-five centuries hidden from the
eyes of the world under several feet of decayed ruins,
has at last been unearthed and shorn of its secrets. New
and enlightening revelations of the customs, religion,
and in fact, the whole life of the Caananite have been
added to the rapidly expanding history of Ancient Man
by the efforts of these archaeologists.
The temple was once a massive, brick structure,
dedicated to the cult of the God-Mekal and set aside
for the use of the priests and the rulers. It is built
around a large courtyard onto which opens a com-
plicated system of corridors leading to the various
rooms. The most notable of these rooms is that of the
great Stepped Altar. Built from the usual sun-dried
brick, without the use of mortar, resting upon a footing
of undressed stone, it stands a testimony to the mason's
skill. It contains four steps with balustrades on either
side, terminating in a platform that was evidently em-
ployed in the sacrificial ritual. At the other end of the
corridor to the altar there is a stele and a mezzabah, or
sacred stone, and in several other rooms, similar pieces
undoubtedly connected with the diety. all which serve
to indicate the idolatrous nature of the religion.
Immediately adjoining the altar is a small room which
was used as a vestibule to the entrance of the building
and as a station for the guards and their dogs. Low
seats, or mestabahs, lined the room, providing comfort
for the sentinels while the animals were leashed to pegs
in the wall where sockets still remain. Their duty, ap-
parently, was not to defend the temple against a foreign
invader, but to prevent the public from entering. A re-
markable sculpture on a basalt panel, depicting a con-
test between a dog and a lion, found in a heap of fallen
wall, was probably placed at the door of the room to
warn intruders. Protection in case of war was provid-
ed by a fort-tower separate of the temple, which was
discovered some months previous.
In addition to these finds, the party returns with a
whole collection of valuable objects. There are gold
ornaments, an ivory spindle-whorl, bronze arrow heads
and some pottery which shows strong influences from
Babylonian and Egyptian art. Scimitars and daggers
of bronze found in rooms set apart from the altar
sanctuary indicate the warlike disposition of the ancient
people of Palestine.
The archaeological contributions of this and past ex-
peditions from American Universities have been largely
instrumental in the accumulation and compiling what
little data the world really possesses regarding the
previous civilizations. Particular recognition by the
architectural profession should go to the Pennsylvania
institution for its invaluable achievements in the dis-
covery and pagenation of ancient architecture.

The Architect of the Incas
By LUIS VALYEKIIK Y FIGUEROA, %10A
ARCHITECTURE has always been the scale by
which people are able to measure the degree
of civilization and advancement of a nation.
The characteristics and the abilities of the men who
compose the nation and who are. in general, responsi-
ble for the type of building are also determined by this
rule. To study the culture and civilization of the na-
tions and the men of South America would require an
elaborate library of histories but a few details here
will suffice to give an ample background.
From the works of some very learned men we come
to know that about fifteen hun-
dred years ago a powerful race
arose in the heart of South
America, now Bolivia and Peru,
and established there the great
Tahuantinsuyo Empire, the na-
tion of the Four Winds, which,
owing to its culture and advanced
civilization, dominated the whole
continent from the south 20 de-
grees parallel northward to what
is now Ecuador. The great cities
and road systems, of which only
the ruins now exist, tell us the
story of this wonderful empire
and of the splendid type of con-
struction that characterized its
palaces, temples and dwellings.
The destruction of these struc-
tures is largely due to the sword
of the Spaniard in his crusade
of civilization and religion.
Among the buildings that still
remain standing is the Temple of the Sun in Tiahuan-
acu, Bolivia, which shows the great care with which the
Amautas (masons) planned their buildings in relation to
Astronomy. The science was already well known to man
and played a very important part in the life of the Em-
pire, not only from the religious side but for the practi-
cal use of determining the different seasons of the year,
the best time for farming and the safest navigation
of ships. Thus the temple became more or less of
an astronomical and meteorological observatory and
to this we can attribute the strange construction, the
perennial calendar in the facade, and the orientation
and location of the building on a dominating site.
The climate of the High Puna, which is always cold
in spite of the extremely bright sunshine piercing the
thin air of the upland (13,000 feet above sea level),
has an important influence upon the architecture that
cannot be ignored for it determines the structural
LUIS Valverde has the honor
of being the sole representa-
tive of Bolivia studying architec-
ture at the university. He comes
with a South American culture
that has given him an invaluable
artistic background. As he points
out in the discourse, his country
is the scene of a very ancient or-
der in civilization which has left
its mark upon the buildings of
the period. This style, the Incan
architecture during pre-Colum-
bian days, is Mr. Valverde's fa-
vorite subject, since he has grown
up in the midst of it. He has

sents a very authentic view of the

character of buildings, creating thick walls and small
openings.
The Tiahuanacu is much richer in monumental sculp-
ture than is any of the other temples of Pre-Columbian
times. The general tendency toward the treatment of
stone in cubical blocks and the use of straight-line
forms reveal the serious study the Amautas made of
their materials. The stone usually used was of strati-
fied formation and tended to split along the layers
unless worked in directions parallel or perpendicular
to the grain. We know that the nature of a material
has a decided influence on the
creation of form. For this rea-
son the porous stone of the
Empire determined the type of
mouldings and ornament. The
Amautas were masters in the
science of stone cutting for we
can observe that the architecture
of the Puna is, for the most
part, of hewn block construc-
tion. The watch and grave
towers of the group show this
principle and also the peculiar
tendency to increase their diam-
eter toward the top. This type
of building structure indicates
the adherence of architecture' to
severe and conventional form.
The abstract pattern of wall sur-
faces gives some idea of mental
condition of man at this age.
Below the Puna, in the fertile
valleys that once were in the
heart of the Empire, is witnessed the transition be-
tween the constructive principles of the unlands and
the Ortha Vralley. The temples and dwellings of Cuzio,
the capital of the Empire, show a lighter type of de-
sign, yet without departing from the severity and sim-
plicity of the former architecture. Thus, the style adapt-
ed itself to local conditions and constituted a mean
between Puna Coastal architecture.
Further down the valley toward the coast, are the
ruins of the great cities where a still lighter type
dominates and illustrates the life of the Inca State. The
emperor exercised a paternal despotism over his In-
dian subjects, acting with unrestricted political and
religious power, for he was looked upon as the son of
the God-Sun. Such a powerful and well-constructed
kingdom found expression in its many architectural
works and in its extensive military roads.

Architectural Color in the Past
By LYLE F. ZIM I II. A2A
THE extent of the use of color in ancient archi-
tecture has been doubtful in the minds of many
archaeologists until very recently, when investi-
gations led to the discovery of irrefutable truths re-
garding architectural color in the past. Remains on
the site or written records of the buildings have dis-
closed the secrets of the remarkable results of the com-
bination of color with purely architectural motives. It
was applied to every available area to accentuate the
raw forms or to tell some story. During the periods of
the highest Egyptian,
Mesopotamian and
Greek cultures, poly-
chromy experienced
a far greater popu-
larity in buildings
than during the suc-
ceeding ages. Rome
cast aside quite en-
tirely the archaic
principles of simple
forms embellished
with painted orna-
ment and employed
sharply sculptured
marbles and complex
mouldings in the de-
sign of its exteriors.
Something, indisput-
edly, was' lost in the process of the change and that
loss was augmented in the period of the Renaissance
when the last vestige of facade coloring almost disap-
peared. Consolation, however, may be gained through
modern indications of the return of applied color in the
art of building.
In Egypt the use of color and its infinite value
architecturally is everywhere apparent. The tropical
climate and the sandy geological formation made for
a complexity of reflected lights which strongly illum-
inated the mouldings and destroyed the desired effect,
while colors retained their full value as a space defin-
ing mediums and superficial decoration. Surfaces that
were painted were very simple and direct in form in
order that the coloring play the more important role.
The Egyptian artist executed his subjects in the true
colors of nature, mainly reds and yellows in a field of
white, producing a characteristic warmth. He possessed
the invaluable genius of co-ordinating (jolor with re-
lief without threatening the appeal of either means.
The history of the development of the color parallel
to architecture in Assyria takes on a different aspect
than that of Egypt, namely through the oriental influ-
Thc Parthenon at Athens, an extraordinary example of Greek color-work
ence. The predominating color was blue, which tended
toward an essentially cooler scheme, and incidently
a breach upon the laws of nature's coloring. The appli-
cation was generally carried through the vehicles of
ceramics and porphyry, while ancient Egypt painted
directly upon the structural stone as did the Greeks
to come.
Polychromatic decoration as a Grecian medium was
most lavishly used during the Archaic period, while
the Periclean age evidences its restrained and perfected
state. The extreme
simplicity of the
Doric order fostered
a generous applica-
tion of color to ex-
press its structural
function and decora-
tive contrast. Red
and blue were the
most prominent,
forming combina-
tions with gold and
silver tints or fur-
nishing the back-
ground for the white
marble sculpture.
The figures in the
famous Pan-athena-
ic frieze of the Par-
thenon stood in relief from a deep blue field.
Veined marble received little appreciation in Greek
architecture, while it furnished the Roman style with
most of its abbreviated exterior coloration. Byzantine
craftsmen from Greece revived the interest in archi-
tectural color to some extent as exemplified in the mo-
saics of St. Sophia, Constantinople, and in the marbles
of St. Mark's at Venice. The facade of the latter is
exceedingly interesting for both the applied and natural
color of its materials. The style rarely indulges in
elaborate exhibitions, so this example is scarcely repre-
sentative of the typical color work of the period but
it does show, in its fundamental principles, something
of the true Byzantine sense of ornament. The vari-
colored marbles of the columns and of the tympana in
the portals are native of the district and show all the
fine graining that only Italian marble can. The scheme
in mosaics of brilliant colors on a field of glittering
gold, applied to unbroken surfaces, was usual in the
eastern churches, as well as in Europe. St. Sophia dis-
plays an interior of peerless mosaics and pavements
while its exterior is left comparitively plain after the

The Glass Renaissance
—An Antique Craft Revived
By JOHN .1. WHITE, :»2A
r
fHE art of glass making is one of the oldest of
crafts, archaeologists having found traces of it
almost as far hack as history records, but after
reaching a high stage of development, it slowly died
out as an art. Only until recent times, w hen the advent
of modern architecture made glass an important ma-
terial for both structural and decorative
purposes, has it again resolved itself as
an art.
It has generally been assumed that
Egypt was the birthplace of the glass in-
dustry, and such may have been the case.
However, some of the earliest specimens
found in the Nile valley show considerable
advancement, and date from the middle
period of the eighteenth dynasty, a period
of much advancement and following nu-
merous Egyptian conquests and invasions.
Pliny records a tradition that attributed
the discovery of glass to the Phoenicians
and it is not unlikely that the Syrians
were prominent in the early perfection of
the art. Be that as it may, we do know
that glass is one of the oldest manufac-
tured materials the artisan and the builder
has had to deal with.
The first workers were only able to
make small vessels and bottles by blowing.
This was developed and carried down into
Roman times with the result that some of
the most beautiful blown glass of all his-
tory was produced at the time of the Ro-
man Republic. Modern tableware manu-
facturers of today are attempting to ap-
proach the fineness and iridescent color-
ing of ancient Roman glass. It is also a
fact that the Romans developed the art
of making sheet glass for windows as a
small bronze framed window in the house
of Faun in Pompei bears witness.
It is assumed that the art of glass mak-
ing steadily developed during the decline of the Roman
Empire. At least, we have a few examples of bronze
and marble grilles of the Imperial thermae which were
undoubtedly glazed. We are aware however that the
process of making had grown crude and clumsy and
the window glass in much quantity was quite rare.
After the sixth century, the time of Justinian, followed
the interim of the dark ages of seven centuries of in-
activity, until the art revived again in the thirteenth cen-
tury when work was once more developed to an amaz-
ing degree of skill and artistry. This period left us

style but made with mod-
ern methods, which shows

those magnificent windows of Chartres, the north rose
of Notre Dame, Sainte Chapelle at Paris, also Bourges,
Rheims and Rouen; in England, Canterbury, York,
Lincoln, and Salisbury; and the Rhine Valley, Cologne,
and Strassburg. This is not a complete list, but cer-
tainly sums up the best of it. Thirteenth century glass!
Intricate windows of rubies and emeralds
and amethysts.
Fourteenth century glass was in the
direction of larger pieces, less color with-
in the glass itself and more painting. Still
it was beautiful and western Europe is
populated with Saints on windows of this
era.
From this time on until just recently,
the art of fine glass making died out, but
clear window glass for commercial or resi-
dential purposes seems to have had its be-
ginnings just prior to the Renaissance.
The advent of larger panes of clear glass
came with Sir Christopher Wren and his
double-hung window. This type of glass
had a slow but steady development until
this twentieth century when we have clear
plate glass of any size.
Today, the machine age has perfected
transparency to an absolute degree, even
admitting the ultra-violet rays. Along with
these advancements has come bullet proof,
shatter-proof and fireproof glass. In short,
the modern chemist with his synthetic res-
ins made from formalin and phenol, stops
at nothing in producing glasses previously
unheard of for structural and utilitarian
purposes.
This modern renaissance of glass has al-
so brought a revival of the ancient art of
glass-making for decoration. True, we
have lost the great religious urge of the
medieval times, but modern methods have
found a cheaper and quicker way to get
the exact replicas and results. In the striking color
effects of "vitrolite" for instance, the designer is able
to get delicate and striking color effects, complicated
or simple, by the simple sand blasting process, first by
casting the material into slabs having two or more layers
of contrasting colors and then eating away unmasked
portions of the outer layer down to the background
color leaving the design in relief; the effect being the
same as that seen in the museum pieces of old Chinese
carved glass. This form of decoration is applied as

COLLEGE NOTES
NAVAL AVIATION
There are, undoubtedly, a great many aviation en-
thusiasts at the University, outside of the students of
aeronautical engineering, who are very much interested
in flying and flight training. We wonder how many of
these people are aware of the splendid opportunities that
are offered in that field right here at the university,
how many students know about the course in naval
aviation and what it consists of. It is the purpose
of this writing to roughly outline the course and its
scope for those who might be interested.
The course is open to citizens of the United States,
preferably college students or "grads" who are under
twenty-eight years of age; a very recent rule has been
passed by the naval authorities which states that no men
will be accepted who are not in their last year of at-
tendance at college, the reason given is that the de-
partment does not wish to have a regular course of
study at the university interrupted, as was quite cus-
tomary in the past. A primary ground school course is
given here on the campus and it is open to any male
student (the Navy evidently has not yet officially
recognized the emancipated woman) who is in his
last year of attendance in school. The course runs
through two semesters and classes are held semi-weekly,
the credit being two hours. The work is accreditable
in the university and may be applied toward graduation,
so there is no time wasted by taking this extra work.
The subjects, of course, are very elementary in nature
as a wide variance of matter must be introduced in a
comparatively short time. Aerology, simple aerodyn-
amics, aircraft operation, motors, radio work, civil and
military aeronautics, maneuvers, and Navy regulations
are some of the subjects that are studied.
After this ground school course has been completed
a rigid physical examination looms up and if this is suc-
cessfully negotiated, the prospective aviator has hope of
getting his appointment providing that a satisfac-
tory grade was received in the ground work. The physi-
cal exam eliminates some men, but normally good
health, good eyes, and a steady head should get a man
through without a great deal of difficulty. Now that
this crisis has been passed, the student is given four
hours of practical flying and study of operation and con-
trol at Grosse Isle. From here he is sent to the Great
Lakes Training Station at Chicago, where the real
flight training begins. Here the incapables are washed
out through a period of thirty days elimination, training
in which ten hours of instruction flight and five hours
of solo are given. This is a period of high tension, but
the strain is not any greater than when the profs get
together and hand out about twenty-five hours of work
for the week end of a big game; and people have lived
through that. At Great Lakes, one is raised to the
majestic position of Seaman Second Class, an appoint-
ment which gives the "stude" about as much rating as
a pledge during "hell week." However, there is a salary
of about fifty dollars per month which takes the edge
from the ignominy.
The remaining students are now sent from Chicago
to Pensacola, Florida, where they go through an eight
months period of advanced training. Here, there is
a lot of work to do and the time passes swiftly; flying
in the morning and school in the afternoon, the ground
work consisting of more intensive study of the same
subjects which were introduced at the University.
About three hundred hours of flight are given here and
by the time they are completed one is almost completely-
acquainted with the tricks of the trade. One is also giv-
en a commission here, that of Ensign in the Fleet Re-
serve. Before the commission is granted, however, a
professional test covering the ground school work must
be passed. When the period at Pensacola is finished,
the individual has the choice of going on inactive duty
as a member of a reserve squadron, or serving a year
of active duty with the fleet where they are assigned
either to an airplane carrier or a battleship. Regular
service ships are flown while on active duty; Boeing
fighters, Vought Corsairs. Marten Bombers, NY's and
several other types are used. While he is with the
fleet, the pilot gets a salary of about $2,000 per year
and much valuable training that cannot be measured
in money.

Now, the prospective student is inclined to ask, "And
what then?" Some of the men who have completed the
training now stay with the Navy, some join reserve
squadrons, and others enter the commercial aeronautics
field. All of them, however, are classed as Naval Re-
serve Officers and are subject to being called for active
duty, at the pleasure of the President of the United
States, in case of a national crisis.
Wennerlund Addresses S1E and AS ME
On Thursday, October 24th, the Society of Indus-
trial Engineers in joint meeting with the American So-
ciety of Mechanical En-
gineers, were addressed
by Mr. E. K. Wenner-
lund, Staff Engineer of
General Motors, Mr.
Wennerlund was intro-
duced by H. O. Engel-
fried, who presided
throughout the meeting.
Mr. Wennerlund took
the group through an in-
teresting verbal trip of
one of the huge plants of
his company, touching
upon the points of most
interest to the embryo
engineer. He spoke of
the need of good men in
the industries today, and
gave the unique system
by which most of the
younger men are chosen
for positions. The neo-
phyte is told of the ab-
solute necessity of thor-
oughly understanding the
business he is embarking
upon, and then of spe-
cializing in one phase of
that business. This re-
quires a period of inten-
sive training as an ap-
prentice, so that each man may have an individual
viewpoint of the various parts of the huge business
machine, and a broader view of the thing as a whole.
The speaker pointed out that of the quarter or more
million men employed by General Motors, at least forty
percent of the whole must be employed in telling the
rest what to do, in other words, a staff of nearly
half the total personnel must be continually on the job.
These are scattered through such departments as the
Engineering Department, whose duties include main-
tenance of the shop, as well as heat, light, repairs, etc.,
and who are responsible for the material supply. It is
obvious that material must be well regulated, for an
over supply would be a loss to the company as great
In The
Spotlight
R. Franklin Outcalt
After years of monopoly by
the Engineering School, the
Spotlight now beams upon the
architects, featuring, as the
most representative man, the
able Mr. Outcalt. He will,
doubtlessly, be deeply embarrassed when he finds he has
been named the representative architect, but his maidenly
modesty cannot be allowed to mess up the story.
Dick made his debut at the university as a freshman
several years ago, coming from Cleveland, Ohio. He im-
mediately showed himself the outstanding student in his
class and he still remains a worthy contender for the
crown. His popularity with his class-mates appeared at
the very outset, manifesting itself in several class offices.
Last February, Dick left school to assume an important
position with Warner and Mitchell, Cleveland architects,
in the design of the new Cuyahoga County Jail and
Courts Building. He returned to school this fall, losing
no time in renewing his friendships about the campus.
At the senior elections, he was presented with the presi-
dency and shortly after with membership into Tau
Sigma Delta, the Architectural Honorary Fraternity.
He is also president of his campus fraternity, Alpha
Rho Chi.
The biggest fault in Dick is his unusual affinity for
speech. To die talking would constitute for him a suc-
cessful existence. Offsetting this aptitude for quantity
production of words is the extreme perfection to which
he carries it. He bids to be one of the few interesting
conversationalists in the architectural profession.
as the embarrassment of an under supply. Mr. Wenner-
lund specified a turnover of material at intervals total-
ing twenty-four times a year. Other departments of
note are the Employment Department, the Advertising
Department, whose power it is to nonchalantly spend
twenty-six millions of dollars a year, and the Produc-
tion department.
Particular attention was called to the Industrial chem-
istry Department, and the need of modernization in
methods of plating, painting, enameling, etc. That all
units of the Great Auto company should co-operate in
this modernization indeed seemed wonderful.
It seems that the inde-
pendent engineer is also
needed by the big corpo-
ration, which does not
bother to keep upon its
staff specialists in plant
construction, architects,
engine and boiler design-
ers, and heating engin-
eer s . Contracts are
awarded to outside firms
for these projects.
Mr. Wennerlund intro-
duced a short talk upon
Porcelian manufacture as
used by General Motors,
in the construction of
electric refrigerators and
explained the wage incen-
tive plan in effect with
General Motors now. The
talk ended with an open
forum.
It was indeed a pleas-
ure to hear a technical
man, representative of a
huge corporation, talk,
and at the same time not
mention his company
with every breath. Mr.
Wennerlund is to be con-
gratulated upon his ad-
dress and personality.
Ye Olde Editor Thrown for a Loss
In the Theatrical world when a production is facing

Edward R. Nell, was suddenly taken ill. He has been
confined to the Health Service, where we know that
he will receive the best of care. We, ourselves, feel
very fortunate in the fact that this issue still contains
some of the fruits of Mr. Nell's faithful work. His

November Class Elections
Next to Football, the all engrossing item of interest
during the Fall term comes in the form of class elec-
tions. Since this issue of the Technic is devoted to
Architecture, we are fortunate to be able to offer to
our readers the selections for the various offices of the
Architectural School. Political interest was rife for
several weeks, but the elections were carried off suc-
cessfully and the officers chosen are all ready engrossed
in the administration of class affairs. The Seniors chose
as their representatives the following:
R. F. Outcalt President
C. A. Greenidge Vice President
Virginia Gies Secretary
J. Mills Treasurer
Shortly after the Senior elections, the Juniors pro-
ceeded to choose their class officers and a JTIop rep-
resentative.
Martin Crow President
Julia May Conlin Vice President
Dale Mehring Secretary
Floyd Johnson Treasurer
Neil Warren J-Hop Representative
The Sophomores held their elections a short time
later and selected the following:
John Gray President
Russell Bailey Vice President
Sylvester Stepnoski Secretary
Stanley Fleischaker Treasurer
Last but not least in importance. The Architectural
Society has made its selections for officers and presents:
President Paul Jernegan
Vice President C. Wayne Mead
Secretary Frederick J. Schweitzer
Treasurer Mortimer Hawkins
Senior Members Clarence Vliet
Richard G. Beck
Junior Members Percy Knudsen
Claude Gunn
Sophomore Members Austin O'Bryon
Lyle F. Zisler
While all this commotion had been going on in the
"Arch" School, the Engineers had elected the Senior
and Junior Class officers. The Seniors selected the
following men:
President Richard Gretsch
Vice President Hershel Powell
Secretary Robert Neis
Treasurer Phillip Allen
In the Junior Class more enthusiasm than usual was
aroused due to the fact that this year the J-Hop Chair-
man is an Engineer, the honor alternating between the
Literary College and the Engineering College. The
officers and J-Hop men are:
President Jack Diehl
Vice President Robert D. Thompson
Secretary Robert Scoville
Treasurer William Fouch
J-Hop Chairman Francis Bebee
J-Hop Committeemen Richard Furniss

kENCINEERSi
The Student Branch of the American Institute of
Chemical Engineers is planning a very active program
for the coming year which includes speakers of note,
varied activities, and frequent social meetings. On
October 23, Mr. 11. P. Morton, Chief Metallurgist for
The Hoover Steel Ball Co. gave a very interesting talk
on the problems encountered in the manufacture of
steel balls. Plans are also under way for a smoker to
be held the afternoon of the Minnesota game in the
Seminar Room. Between halves a lunch will be served
so it is expected that a good crowd will be present to
get the football returns. A radio will be installed to get
the report direct from the field.
The officers for the coming year who were chosen
at the first meeting are:
President C. G. Kirkbride
1st Vice President J. E. Wilson
2nd Vice President E. F. Fischer
Treasurer B. A. Daley
Secretary W. Mikulas

Aero Club
Not content with its present activities, the Aero Club
is planning further developments by contemplating the
formation of a Motor Section. Clarence M. Ellicock,
the President of the Society, is acting as temporary
Chairman of the Motor Section and expects to have it
functioning very shortly. If such a group is established,
it will mean that the Aero Club will be eligible for mem-
bership in the National Intercollegiate Aeronautical So-
ciety which has had its inception at Yale. This National
Society is aiding the Club in the procuring of a plane
which is a very material aid in itself.
The other two sections are continuing the very active
program which they pursued last year. The Glider
Section, under the leadership of Robert B. Evans '30,
has been operating practically every afternoon and in
the evening groups of the members under the leader-
ship of several of the older men have been working
on the construction of another glider and also on the
repairing of one now in the Club's possession. The
Balloon Section headed by Floyd Kaufman, Grad., is
also planning flights for the near future.
The Officers of the Club for this coming year are:
Clarence M. Ellicock, '30E President
James G. Redding, '30E Vice President
Cornelia Burwell, '30 Secretary
Hollister Mabley, '31E Treasurer
Robert B. Evans, '30 Glider Section

The Electric Sign a Enemy of Architecture
Commercial advertising has been for a number of
years a formidable foe to the architectural profession,
transfiguring beautiful buildings into glaring bill-boards,
and, in general, disparaging the quality of civic design
by its electrical abominations. From the very genesis
of architecture, signs have been employed to designate
the nature of structures, either by a system of letters
or by symbolic forms. Their arrangement, in the better
examples, has always been regarded as a factor of
the ensemble design until the age of high-pressure busi-
ness and industry ushered in a necessity for flamboy-
ant advertisements that architecture could not sustain.
Competition required that each sign out-do its neigh-
bor in magnitude and brilliancy, encroaching upon
beauty if it must and obliterating the finer qualities in
the building should the occasion demand,—anything
and everything for advertising!
We are now in the midst of this money-eyed, com-
mercial age with its incandescent monstrosities displayed
at every angle, on the theatre, the hotel and the shop.
A rich Renaissance facade masked with a multi-colored
sign for C. C. Pyle's Corn Cure or City Coal Com-
pany's Best Mine Run is a too common crime to pass
unresisted by the architectural profession, but due to the
lack of disciplinary power, the situation has not been
effectively corrected. Some architects have undertaken
to incorporate the design of advertising display in the
general scheme but the development is too minute and
young to occasion any great encouragement. The solu-
tion to the enigma is forthcoming and it rests with the
future architect. It is a contest between a highly-
organized system of business interests, fighting for the
exploitation of architecture, and a weak yet noble pro-
fession, fighting for the resurrection of architecture.
o
The Development of Building Codes
The rapid development of urban districts during re-
cent years has created a great realization of the need of
better protection against unsanitation and fire hazards.
Over 100 municipalities containing 10,000 or more in-
habitants are revising their building codes and taking
great steps in advance in the development of zoning.
These two means toward public safety, health and gen-
eral welfare are progressing hand in hand at a re-
markable rate.
Every city having as many as 5,000 inhabitants
should be vitally interested and active in the promotion
of better protection and safety for its people. Many
old building codes have long gone out of date by the
discovery of new and better materials which the ex-
tensive research of the last decade have made possible.
Then, too, improvements calling for recognition have
been made in construction but have been seriously re-
tarded by the restricted requirements on building.
Old codes have been referred to as being inadequate
but this does not necessarily mean that they are not suf-
ficiently detailed, for, as a matter of fact, they tend too
much toward detail. They are more of the nature of a
specification. Such documents, with continual re-
visions concerning construction and new materials, have
become encyclopedia of building construction. To some
it even serves to suggest their materials for specification.
This wordy type of code is disadvantageous in that it
hampers development, permits little freedom and no
incentive for designers to improve on standards, and
creates indifference on the part of the architect, con-
tractor and administrative official.
The real purpose of the codes is to provide protec-
tion for the public against incompetent builders and to
prescribe conditions of safety as far as possible without
fixing any specific methods by which they are to be done.
The quality of practically all of our building materials
is set by specifications prepared by the Bureau of Stan-


Page 21
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
dards. There is no need then, to include all the un-
necessary, well-known details into the code.
There are still many things in building construction
that affect public safety which are not adequately con-
sidered or which are under debate as to the best ways of
handling them and that should be dealt with in more de-
tail, such as the matter of interior stairs—how many to
be provided—where located—when and how landings
should be introduced—shall windows be permitted—
and many other questions. In order that the code be
administered properly, the official in charge of the task
should be well informed on the nature of materials;
lie must be a good judge of workmanship, he must be
versed on all the principles that underlie the minor
building trades as well as the major; he must under-
stand the science of fire protection; and he must be able
to speak with authority on any of these subjects and to
apply them with good judgement.
The question of the uniformity of building codes has
often been discussed but is not easily answered in a
few vrords. The main reasons why it will probably
not develop is based on the differences found in local
conditions, the difficulty in sectional standardization of
materials, and the various problems in regions peculiar-
ly affected by winds, Hoods or heat. However, there
is a possibility of uniformity in the arrangement of the
various codes which would be of great convenience.
Two methods to this end which have already been tried
in different cities are, firstly; the classification of build-
ings according to their occupancy and, secondly; accord-
ing to their type of construction. Either one of these
systems, or both, would prove to be very convenient
and desirable for architects and contractors who have
their practice in various districts.
To many persons, to engineers in particular, a build-
ing code suggests only a set of rules for governing
the strength, stability and construction of buildings.
Unwritten laws of good practice are probably better
established and followed than are the codes. If it were
not for the existence of irresponsible architects, incom-
petent engineers and unscrupulous builders, very little
provision in this connection would be necessary.
o
Science and the Profession
The Technic, as a criterion of the engineering publi-
cations of the various colleges, is pleased to note the
trend of cooperative development in regards to struc-
tural engineering, not only towards engineering, but
architecture as well. That science should unite vari-
ous branches of our profession to the betterment of
modern building construction, and in so doing, combine
the aesthetic with the hideously practical art with a
responsible backing of enduring and safe construction,
is indeed a wonderful thing, and deserves its place
in our public hall of fame.
The geologist has given his knowledge to the engi-
neer for the betterment of materials of construction;
and the engineer has placed his combined knowledge
at the disposal of the architect; the whole resulting in
sound, practical and beautiful modern buildings, whose
sky-scraping domes and permanent foundations will
long endure for the admiration of generations to come.
o
The Architects Book Shelf
"The Beautiful Necessity"
by Claude Bragdon, The Manas Press
"Let us build altars to the beautiful necessity"—that
is Ralph Waldo Emerson's tribute to architecture.
Claude Bragdon was inspired by these words and wrote
a book around them, to define them and to commemor-
ate them. The success of the definition and the com-
memoration can best be appraised by the remarkable
response the architectural profession gave to the pub-
lication of the book in iyio and to its second edition
several years later.
The subject is treated in a thoroughly philosophical,
yet easily-understood manner of expression. The au-
thor develops a number of interesting points rarely at-
tacked by the usual writer, beginning with a well-form-
ulated conception of the fundamental thought behind
architecture, and maintaining throughout a constant
flow of detailed logic. The chapter on the correlation
of music and architecture as the two pure arts, with
all others subordinate, is especially effective, both as
aesthetic exposition and as practical instruction.
The main content of the book, however, consists of
more than purely abstract reasoning, more than food
for the philosopher; it contains a good quantity of the
concrete factor in architecture, of rules and laws of
composition such as the professional architect thrives
upon. But therein lies the weakness of the whole
discourse. Any attempt to methodically catalogue a
series of arithmetical, hard and fast rules on such a
versatile, intangible substance as architecture will un-
questionably always prove a miserable failure. Certain
geometric relations can be traced in many of the finer
examples in design, it is true, but the diversions from
these principles are fully as frequent as the conformi-
ties. The author contradicts his belief in this dynamic
symetry and latent geometry as means of design by
stating that—"no masterpiece was ever created by the
conscious following of set rules, for the true artist
works unconsciously, instinctively, as the bird sings or
the bee builds its honey-cell." Bragdon, however, can
be commended upon the manner in which he arranged
and stated these laws, for their substance is very well
reasoned and might well serve as a helpful check in any
composition in art.

TTHfc, painstaking spirit of the medieval monk
* has been handed down to the New Departure
organisation—and intensified in transmission.
Modern science has augmented the will to
intensive effort with the ability to control the
unseen and to detect the slightest deviation
from exact physical truth.
Since much of the superiority of the New
Departure Ball Bearings over other antifriction
devices is due to its precision of dimension/
contour, and fit, a most elaborate and efficient
inspection system has been developed.
Not only is every tenth man in the plant an
inspector, but an average of 16,200,000 separate
and distinct decisions are made each business
day as to the acceptance or rejection of bear*
ing parts. A single bearing, for instance, must
be within proper limits on 90 separate counts
to avoid rejection, with a tenth of a thousandth
of an inch as a common unit of measurment.
In spite of these extraordinarily difficult
standards set by New Departure engineers,
New Departure special machinery — almost
human in its operation; with more than human
dependability . . . production proceeds with
very little waste of time or material.
Is it any wonder therefore that New
Departure Ball Bearings have the name of being
the precision product of the world.

manner of the East. The scene changed with the wan-
ing of classical influence and in the Gothic period there
was a marked decrease in color popularity, with the
exception of stained glass and frescoes, which were
very highly developed. This was largely discarded,
too, when the Gothic style was abandoned in favor
of the Renaissance.
The Facade of St. Mark's, Venice, in Byzantine color.
With the modern tendencies in design, coloring as
an architectural element is creeping back upon the
stage. The revival of colored glass and the develop-
ment of stained concrete points toward a new era in
the history of color which may prove to equal or even
surpass its predecessors.

tile accents to plastered walls or in the form of large
wall panels.
In an hour or two the sand blast operator can dupli-
cate days of tedious carving. He may cut entirely
through a slab and thus produce a perforated grille
that can be used for radiator enclosures as proof against
the detrimental effects of water and dust.
Decorative designs when applied are first incised by
the etching process; this may be anything from a slight
cut that will erase the polish to as deep as desired and
then colored, thus insuring permanence to the color
and decoration which are below the surface of the slab.
With the development of the present variety of colors
and decorative effects, glass both for structural, and
decorative purposes has come into a much wider use.
It is quite generally used for the wainscotting or even
the entire ceilings of bathrooms and kitchens in the
home, while in mercantile establishments it is used for
counters, soda fountain shelving and even for wall
paneling.
More recently it has come into vogue for modern-
istic effects and has been featured by leading modernist
designers. Joseph Urban exhibited a "Chambre de
Repose" in which the walls and ceiling were of black
Vitrolite relieved by luminous columns of frosted glass
which reflected in the ceiling giving a dramatic effect
of height and contrast.
Modern treatments are obtained by etching, whether
with hydofluoric acid, the so-called '"white acid," or
the sand blast—each of which produces its peculiar
tonal effect, chipping, cutting, and grinding with abras-
ive wheels, silvering in silver as such, or in a variety
of metallic colors. By varying manipulations or by
combination of acid and sand-blast etching it is possible
for the designer to work quickly on a particularly bold
scale and get results that hitherto have been impossible
and at a comparatively low price for both labor and
material. These new methods of handling the medium
and the new uses to which it has been put are creating
an unprecedented development in the decoration of
structural glass which is yet in its infancy but promis-
ing of success.
Of late some extremely interesting work has been
done with mirrors that may cover all or a part of the
walls of a room, either by the process described or
merely by painting appropriate designs or scenes on
the surface and the result, when skillfully executed,
is a decided contribution to the decorative art. Mirrors
of absolute reflection are possible—mirrors in gold,
silver and aluminum and every possible combination of
finish, type of glass and reflecting surface can be se-
cured to produce an effect.
So far, no mention has been made of the infinite
possibilities of the present day use of glass in regard
to lighting, not to speak of the various uses it also has
decoratively. Plate glass, because of its size of sheets
is susceptible to monumental treatment hardly possible
in any other medium. The modern cry for more light
in buildings and homes has brought a widespread use
of large areas of plate glass for structural purposes.
The recently discovered values of ultra-violet light of
sunshine has brought into .development and use of glass
so transparent as to admit these rays and houses with
glass skylights as well as glass relief ceilings and
vertical glass exterior walls are not uncommon.
In addition to all of these new innovations in the use
of glass, modern artisans and methods have been able
to duplicate exactly any kind of ancient glasses, even
to the rose window pieces of the thirteenth century.
Now that the creative imaginations of designers,
architects and artists, combined with the great ingenu-
ity of our chemists and inventors has been cut loose
from the apron-strings of stilted conventionality in
materials, one hesitates to set any limit to the artistic
as well as the utilitarian purposes to which glass may
be applied in architecture. Long neglected by them
because of the difficulty they saw in using it as a medi-
um for broad treatment, the manufacture and the use
of glass has at last been revived for decorative as well
as for new structural purposes after a period of seven
centuries of lazy inactivity.

Famous Architects m History
Continued from page 9
at the same time the floor of the hall above. The
earth itself was degraded in the Greek mind when it
conceived that the sky was the only floor of a heaven
above where Zeus reigned amidst his court. Jefferson
successfully conquered these difficulties by making the
exterior of Monticello appear to be a one-storied build-
ing, and safeguarded this delusion, for, upon entering,
no stairway stood sentinel to announce the deception.
How well he conceived and executed a piece of resi-
dential architecture; how perfectly he adapted it to
the spirit of true art and responded to the demands
of his time are attested by the fact that for more than
half a century after its construction it was the most
renowned private residence in America.
Whence came the preparation for such tasks? Jeffer-
son, a twenty-seven-year-old Virginian planter, con-
ceiving a new architecture, or ingeniously adapting clas-
sic forms to the unfolding of a new country's demands!
Such talent could not have been altogether inherent.
We learn that he was graduated with a fair reading
knowledge of Latin, French, and Greek; that he fur-
ther improved these accomplishments under the instruc-
tion of Wyeth, his law tutor, whom he describes as
the best classical scholar in Virginia, and that he mas-
tered mathematics and Italian in private study. So far
as evidence exists, these moments of delving into clas-
sic literature were the only sources of his architectural
inspiration up to the time he built his home.
Monticello, and other fine estate-mansions at Bremo
and Farmington are typical examples of Jefferson's
ideals in domestic architecture and the University of
Virgima illustrates his powers in relation to public
buildings of a monumental character. It is certain that
George Washington and his commissioners consulted
Jefferson on the plans of the White House and the
Capitol Building—that his knowledge and tastes were
influential in the making of Virginia's State House. But
it was in the University buildings that Jefferson's own
mind ran free, untrammeled, and unrestrained in the
field of monument.
Architecture was only one of the many human in-
terests with which Jefferson was identified. Examples
of his artistic genius and of his artistic execution could
be multiplied beyond number. There is much evidence
of his skill as a surveyor and engineer, and he is quite
as well known for his ability as a landscape architect
and for his work in town planning. In every field of
activity he worked in a most distinguished manner, and
whatever the subject, his relation to it was that of a
diligent and discriminating student.
In design alone, however, he could have made his
name famous. His discriminating selection of types,
his genius in combination, the pleasurable exhiliration
he produces in his daring but successful contrasts, the
tranquility secured by his harmony earn for him an in-
contestable place among artistic architects.
In his main hall at Monticello, Jefferson could face
the embers in his grand fireplace, watch the laborers on
his Pantops farm, observe the direction of the wind
which by his ingenuity was registered in the ceiling of
his portico, read the atmospheric pressure on a baro-
meter constructed by his own hands, compare the ex-
ternal and internal temperature on a double thermomet-
er from his own specifications, and observe the hour
on the face of the great hall clock, whose pendulum,
escapement, weights and regulators were built under
his personal directions.
It is a tribute to the profession of our generation that,
notwithstanding the development of their science and
the specialization of their tasks, they maintain a rever-
ence for those who labored under the limiting conditions
of the past. And nowhere in their history have they
found a figure standing for a higher truth or maintain-
ing a nobler ideal. As future generations of architects,
reviewing and in review, file by his work, they will bare
their heads to his fidelity to their art, acknowledge
him as the pioneer in an infant profession, and with
one acclaim, hail the Godfather of the American Archi-
tect.

changes. The campus has grown awkwardly like a
puppy, but as it matures time will bring that mellow-
ness that will do more than man in the end for its
beauty and unity.
The retaining of this mall throughout all the changes,
and the placing of these two fine structures at either
end will some day be remembered as a most fortunate
consideration. It is one of the brilliant and outstand-
ing strokes of planning for the campus. If it is com-
pleted, as visualized by Dr. Saarinen, the great Finnish
architect, it will be an unforgetable sight, and we should
earnestly strive to have the work go through as planned
by this great master.
That we cannot take in the full beauty of the Angell
Mall portico is a matter of regret. The row of great
columns which form it is particularly striking at night
as well as during the day but the setting is hardly
spacious enough. Betsy Barbour and Helen Newberry
dormitories are very fortunate in their outlook, where-
as passersby on the walks get but a fleeting half glimpse.
When Old Newberry Hall is removed and some other
University building put in its place, perhaps a park-
like open space embracing a full frontage opposite
the Angell Hall portico could then be planned so that
all of us might enjoy the picture. Such a building
surely deserves more than a fleeting glance.
It is especially beautiful to see the Union at night
when walking toward it on South University—but one
is constantly sorry that the tower couldn't have been
placed on axis with the street. It would have been a
dominant note as the termination for the avenue of
main approach from Detroit.

Some Notes on the Campus Plan
Continued from page 28
A gratifying bit of planning for one of the new
units, whether it be coincidence or premeditation, is
the placing of the new Law Library at the termination
of Oakland Avenue. If such care is exercised for
the ultimate beauty of the whole University plan it will
eventually place Michigan among the finest campuses
of the middle west. Care in the placing of our build-
ings has been for some time neglected. The rectifi-
cation of the errors begins to show itself in the present
scheme.
A unique feature of our campus is a small bronze
fountain at one end of the diagonal. It is just such
small things as memorial fountains, gateways, sculptur-
al work, and benches about the grounds which help to
give it atmosphere. Michigan could to advantage place
many more of these small but life-giving bits of beauty.
The 'Daily' and the 'Alumnus' could doubtlessly do
much to foster interest in gifts or remembrances of this
nature, both amongst the students as well as amongst the
old grads. The students themselves are interested in
the campus plan, its beauty, and its success. Perhaps
it would be advantageous if details of proposed ex-
tensions and the campus plan as it develops in the fu-
ture were published in the 'Daily' from time to time—
it is a worthy cause for that powerful organ to espouse.

Modern Furniture in America
Continued from page 11
its peak; good modernism has many years to go!" We
need not hesitate to use the good designs of the past,
that is, if they are suited to the demands of the pres-
ent needs. In every age the good is sorted from the
bad, and the things of lasting value are kept.
It should be remembered that in all periods of furni-
ture design there has been produced both good and
mediocre furniture. This is a notable fact and it be-
hooves us not to be too hasty in judging present modern
tendencies. In every age, the prevailing style of furni-
ture was as a rule designed to meet the particular needs
of the times. In the Colonial period, simplicity and
utility were stressed. Life was lived close to nature and
the furniture that best suited such needs prevailed. Each
article of furniture was designed for its practicability
and suitability. The spinning wheel, cranes, chests,
pine cupboards, and four-poster beds were wonderful
examples of both utility and beauty. Later, in the Vic-
torian age, when the population of our country had in-
creased and greater wealth was available, we went to
the extreme of superfluity and elaborateness without
regard for good taste and style. In this so-called Vic-
torian age, the walls, floors and mantels were loaded
with nick-nacks and old relics. Objects which had no
use or general interest were kept in a clutter. The more
"gim-cracks" and objects that could be piled in a small
space the better taste was accorded the owner. Now
the pendulum turns and the accumulated objects are
discarded, the "junk" is thrown out, and period furni-
ture arrives. Order that is very painful and severe
takes the place of disorder and chaos of the Victorian
style. Each piece of furniture is placed so the partic-
ular scheme of the room will not be upset. The result
of this period is artificiality. The modern spirit is
aroused and the attempt is made to strip away this
artificiality and to think and act in simple terms though
in very bold ones. The modernist is introducing furni-
ture which will reflect the spirit and freedom of our
time. The question arises whether or not modern de-
signs express utility and purpose. The majority of
modern furniture does, but there are a few designers
who insist upon bringing in the freakish—but time will
soon smother all of these bad elements.
We Americans face life very simply and directly.
This fact is bound to influence the design of our furni-
ture. We are no longer satisfied with elaborate detail
and ornament which covers up the structure involved.
Modern furniture in our homes must function properly.
The general character of modern furniture influ-
enced by modern conditions, is the saving of space.
&lt; )rTice furniture has this decided characteristic. Great
care has been taken to economize every square inch of
space for drawers, shelves for magazines, and pigeon-
holes for books. In the home davenports with built-
in book shelves at either end are a great convenience
thus comprising two pieces of furniture in one. Tables
are constructed with layers of shelves for books under
the table top. The buffet may be used as a book case
at one end and a cupboard at the other. Twin beds
can be joined together to give the effect of one bed, and
at the same time the head board may have shelves for
books. The modern skyscraper book case, of the ang-
ular type, will add dignity and scale to a low ceilinged
room. Its many nooks and drawers are both practicable
and convenient from the standpoint of beauty and func-
tion.
However, it is up to the public in general to accept
or discard these new innovations. If the movement is
here to stay it is the duty of every designer and decor-
ator to contribute his share to the improvement of the
furniture of our time.

design. The school is one of those recognized by the
American Institute of Architects. It is a charter mem-
ber of the Association of Collegiate Schools of Archi-
tecture, made up of the leading architectural schools.
The Lake Forest Foundation of Architecture and Land-
scape Architecture has from the start included Michi-
gan among the schools which are invited to send stu-
dents to it for a three-months' summer study.
Chief among the competitions is the George G. Booth
Traveling Fellowship in Architecture, which because of
the opportunity it gives for foreign travel, is a splendid
incentive to good work. Mr. Booth also gave $10,000
when the school was under construction. Other friends
and some of the alumni have also shown their interest
in connection with the building through generous dona-
tions of funds or of materials and objects for teaching
purposes.
Along with the regular work in the school several or-
ganizations lend life and interest to extra-curricular
architectural work. There is the mother chapter of Tau
Sigma Delta, national architectural honor society. The
Architectural Society, of which every architectural stu-
dent is a member, is also a source of activity. One of
its most important projects of the year is the Archi-
tects' May Party, a costume ball with a decorative set-
ting designed and put in place by the students. Prizes
are offered for the general design and for the costumes,
and it is generally agreed that it is the most colorful
social event of the year. There is also a local chapter
of Alpha Rho Chi, national architectural professional
fraternity, which had its inception at Michigan and
which has a very attractive home.
Taken together, Michigan's College of Architecture
has earned its place as a distinguished school of design
among the schools of the country, attracting, as it does,
students from the far distant corners of the United
States and from many foreign countries.
But Professor Lorch's building program is not yet
complete. The cost of the building was about $400,000;
several thousand dollars more will be needed to provide
sculpture for the as yet blank medallions affixed to the
pillars of the entrance hall, the symbol of the mother
art to stand above the main axis, and five figures rep-
resentative of the allied arts that are intended for the
northern terrace. Funds are yet needed to complete
the furnishings of the interior which, though by intent
simple in design, will remain somewhat barren until new
furniture, lighting fixtures and the like can be installed.
Despite the limits set to the building fund and the
necessity for providing adequate space and equipment
for the distant future as well as for the immediate pres-
ent, the new structure promises to meet every possible
need. Built from the appropriations from the state and
enriched by gifts from friends, patrons, and former
students of the college, the new Architectural building
represents a worthy addition to the campus and a monu-
ment to the ideals of Professor Lorch.
Anticipation that the growth of the college will con-
tinue in the same steady progression of past years is
seen in the fact that the site of the building was chosen
with a view to building expansion to meet the growth
in organization and enrollment. Two projected wings
ultimately will rise to join with those now completed,
the whole forming a hollow square and enclosing a
formal garden with a fountain at the center.
With sufficient financing and the subsequent furnish-
ing of the interior together with the hoped-for added
appropriations for running expenses, it is apprehended
that Michigan will ultimately have a College of Archi-
tecture second to none in this country.

The Architect of the Incas
Continued from page 13
Worthy of careful study is the Fortress of Ollantay-
tambo which reveals a new step in architecture, since
the treatment of the giant stone blocks is not typical
of Cuzco, the outlying district. The temple in this
city is also of peailiar construction and carries an in-
teresting history. The individual stone blocks, some 21
feet by 16 feet by 8 feet deep were carved high in the
mountains on the opposite ridge of the valley and
transported down the slopes and across the plains to
the site of the temple. This represents a feat com-
parable to the great Egyptian stone handling.
Inca architecture is decidedly primitive yet real and
organic in its principles. The values of the style can
no better be proven than by observing the many ex-
amples of modern buildings based in their design direct-
ly upon the influence of South American art. Often
structures that are built in the so-called 'modern style'
have unblushingly stolen their inspiration from the val-
ley of the Great Tahuantinsuyo Empire.

and Carl I. Bloomquist, Detroit, graduates of the Uni-
versity of Michigan last June, are enrolled in the ranks
of Frigidaire Corporation at Dayton, O., as members
of the corporation's junior executives' training class.
Adler and Bloomquist received B.S. degrees in me-
chanical engineering. Adler is a member of Tau Beta
Pi, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, and
the Society of Automotive Engineers. At college he
participated in interclass baseball. Bloomquist is a
member of the American Society of Mechanical Engi-
neers and the Society of Automotive Engineers. He
was a track man and a senior class committeeman at
Michigan.
Adler and Bloomquist are now well along in an in-
tensive 48-weeks training program consisting of practi-
cal experience in engineering, sales, service, materials,
production, finance and inspection.

WHERE QUALITY
IS PARAMOUNT
Oxy-acetylene welding is used for joining fuselage
members in the construction of over 85% of the
airplanes built in this country. In this service
hundreds of thousands of oxwelded joints have
proved their dependability and strength under
all conditions—in the Tropics—on Polar explora-
tions — on endurance and trans-oceanic flights
and for routine commercial flying.
No field of industry makes more exacting
demands of quality and performance than the
manufacture of aircraft. The modern plane is
tested and inspected thoroughly in every stage
of its construction. Quality of design, materials
and workmanship is paramount. Acceptance of
oxy-acetylene welding as standard practice in
this new and progressive industry is of out-
standing significance.
From time to time the oxy-acetylene industry is
in the market for technically trained men. It
offers splendid opportunities for advancement.

Probably one of the most interesting and attractive of the federal
buildings erected during the last year is the United States Post Office
and Court House at Madison, Wisconsin. In addition it is one of the
first in the building program resumed since the World War.
Situated in the shadow of the state capitol and only a few hundred feet
from Lake Monona, one of the four lakes which surround Madison,
the three-story building of Bedford stone has an ideal setting.
Employing the latest methods in the interior transfer of mails the Post
Office department arranged the rooms, conveying machinery and
platforms to bring about greater ease and speed in the handling of all
classes of mail.
In the main lobby, marble slabs cover the walls from the floor to a
height of eight feet. Quarter-sawed oak is the interior finish through-
out the building.
Despite other unique features found in the Madison Post Office, its
foundation of dominant strength concrete is similar to that of other
well-known building projects throughout the world — concrete mixed
by a Koehring.
The ingredients of concrete are the same in all cases but the Koehring

Television in Color
TELEVISION in color was accomplished this
July at the Bell Telephone Laboratories with
great success regarding both the faithfulness of
reproduction of the colors and the ease with which the
motions of the objects could be seen. In this demon-
stration roses, Hags and pretty girls were "viewed" by
television equipment, their images were translated into
electrical impulses which were sent over wires to be
reproduced at the other end of the laboratory in full
natural color. While this television demonstration was
largely as a matter of convenience and a similar radio
demonstration could have been effected. The screen
that was used could be viewed by only one person at a
time but what he saw was an exact reproduction of
moving things in full natural color. While this achieve-
ment represented a marvelous example of scientific
technique, there is nothing mysterious or inherently
difficult to understand about this development in tele-
vision.
The heart of every television system is the photo-
electric cell. This is a vacuum tube, somewhat similar
to those used in radio sets, which has the striking prop-
erty of passing more or less electrical current through
it as the light shining upon it varies in brightness. With
dim light very little current passes but-as the light in-
creases the flow of electricity becomes greater and
greater. The other essential element of a television
sending system is the moving beam of light which
passes over the object. When it rests on a dark place
very little light is reflected to the cell and hence very
little electric current flows. A bright area, however,
strongly illuminates the cell with the result that a large
current is passed. In this way each element of bright-
ness or darkness of a picture or object is expressed
in terms of electric current. Then the production of
the picture at the receiving end from these electrical
impulses is effected by using them to light a special
lamp and the light from this lamp is passed ovei a
screen at the same rate as that at which the original
light beam was, consequently whenever there was a
dark spot on the original picture a corresponding dark-
ening of the beam would occur at this point of its
path. The reason that a picture is seen on the screen
rather than a moving beam is because the beam moves
too fast to be visible just as on a moving picture screen
we see a continuity of motion and not separate pictures.
Colored television is carried out with exactly the
same apparatus as is used for television with light of a
single color except that much more equipment is re-
quired. It is made possible by the fact that out of
light of three colors, red, blue and green, it is possible
to reproduce any shade of color whatever. In color
television three groups of light sensitive cells are used,
one of which is screened by red glass, one by blue glass
and one by green glass, and since colored glass will
transmit only light of the same color, the amount of
light passing the colored glass, as for instance the red.
is the amount of that color in the original light. Then
this light falls on the light sensitive cell which converts
light into electricity. Each color has a separate circuit,
the three currents are transmitted as the single one was
before, and the picture at the other end is made by
the action of three light rays timed exactly together,
a red light, a blue light and a green light which by their
interaction produce the true colors of the original. To
produce these colored lights it is not necessary to use
a lamp that furnishes that particular color only. Thus
the red light is obtained from an orange neon lamp
which gives chiefly red, orange, and yellow light rays.
All but the desired red light, however, is screened out
by the interposition of the red glass filter of the same
color as the red glass filter at the sending end. Simi-
larly argon lamps are used to supply both the blue and
green light, being screened in one case by green glass
and in the other case by blue glass.
The final picture is small in size but remarkably de-
tailed in outline with the colors faithfully reproduced.
It is felt that the prediction may confidently be made
that the future development in this field will depend
more upon the use of simple and less expensive ap-
paratus than it will upon the discovery of any radically
new principle.

WHAT YOUNGER COLLEGE MEN
ARE DOING WITH WESTINGHOUSE
LIGHTNING HAS LONG BEEN A COSTLY RAIDER OF POWER LINES
lightning meets his master . . .
Remember how you used to sit on the
. porch during a thunderstorm and
shudder just a little at the forces that
seemed to tear open the sky and shake
the hills? Electrical men have often
shuddered in grave seriousness over those
same forces. For lightning has been a
costly raider of power lines.
Now, however, many means of defense
are available, and many more are being
developed. Science has been studying
lightning, and experimenting with it.
Down in the mountains of Tennessee a
group of Westinghouse men have been
making photographic records of the volt-
ages developed by lightning, with the
cathode-ray oscillograph and the klydono-
graph. Guided by their findings another
group in New Jersey is enabled to re-
produce lightning artificially, and study
its effects on a high-tension line. And in
East Pittsburgh, with a generator that
will produce lightning strokes equivalent
to 35,000,000 horse-power and with
a laboratory that duplicates power
line conditions, others are learning new
facts about the behavior of protective
devices.
Much of this work is carried on by
young men recently out of college. Their
achievements will save
millions for power com-
panies, and eliminate
many hazards to life in
sub-station operation.
Lightning jumps the gap be-
tween these Westinghouse arc-
ing horns, and spares the in-
suiatorg.

Steam Boiler Design
The use of high-pressures and high-temperatures in modern power plants
By C. H. FESSEXDEX. Professor of Mechanical Engineering
MANY important developments have occurred
in recent years in the hoiler room side of the
power plant. Central station steam pressures
in 1900 were usually ahout 160 lbs., in 1910 about 175
lbs., in 1920 about 250 lbs.,
and today, for non-reheating
cycles, about 450 lbs. When-
ever pressures in excess of 450
lbs. are used, and much higher
pressures are becoming rather
common, the reheating cycle is
adopted. Nine or more cen-
tral stations in the United
States are operating boilers at
pressures of 550 to 650 lbs.
and seven or more have select-
ed 1,200 to 1,400 lbs. pressure.
It is interesting to note that
an installation now in course
of construction, contemplating
the highest pressure (1,800
lbs.) in use in the United
States, is not in a central sta-
tion, but in an industrial plant.
—the Philip-Carey Company,
Lockland, Ohio.
High steam pressures and
temperatures have always had
ardent advocates. Professor
R. H. Thurston, writing in 1896 on "The Promise and
Potency of High-Pressure Steam," outlined the prog-
Kip's Bay unit in course of erection.
steel casing and brickwork
less up to that time and predicted—"it will be found
as easy to control and utilize pressures of 500 and of
1.000 lbs. per sq. in. as today to employ those of 100
to 153 pounds per square inch.
In England, the Benson En-
gineering Company, Limited,
of London, is interested in the
development of the Benson
Super-Pressure Plant to gen-
erate steam at the critical pres-
sure of 3,2(10 lbs. The basic
idea is the generation of vapor
from liquid by subjecting the
liquid to a pressure somewhat
above its critical pressure and
then gradually increasing the
temperature until it passes the
critical point. The Benson
Company contends that steam
for high-pressure plants can
be generated most cheaply at
the critical point, where liquid
changes to vapor without the
addition of latent heat and
without increase in volume.
Among the advantages claimed
are: the use of smaller parts
resulting in less weight and
building space requirements,
thus reducing the initial cost; a saving in fuel due to
higher thermal efficiency.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Naturally, one wonders about the gap between 1,400
or 1,800 lbs. and 3,200 lbs. The idea of generating
steam at the critical point, proposed almost ten years
ago, has not progressed much beyond the experimental
stage and has not been adopted in this country. Analysis
indicates that commercial economy will not l&gt;e increased
by going to higher pressures than are now being used,
unless there are changes in certain factors that affect
the total cost of producing power.
In 1915 the steam temperatures se-
lected for central station service sel-
dom exceeded 580° F. Since then,
there has been a gradual increase, but
no such radical jumps have occurred
as in the case of pressures in recent
years. With boiler tubes made of low-
carbon steel, a total temperature of
750°F. is usually regarded as the limit
by our conservative engineers. Some
European plants are using higher tem-
peratures, partly in an experimental
way and partly commercially, up to
900sF. Again assuming the role of
pioneer, the Detroit Edison Company
is experimenting, on a commercial
scale, with steam at temperatures of
1,000-1,100° F.
With the steam temperature limited
to 750°F., and the exhaust tempera-
ture at about 80° F. the moisture con-
tent of the steam leaving a turbine will
be about 10 or 12 per cent when the
steam is supplied at about 450 lbs.
pressure, unless reheat is used. It is
generally conceded that unless the
steam is reheated after partial expan-
sion, and with stage heating of feed
water, pressures above 450 lbs. will
lead to no increased commercial econ-
omy. But if the steam is reheated it
does pay, with certain operating con-
ditions, to go to higher pressures. The
whole pressure range from 450 lbs. to 1,400 or 1,800
lbs. is thus opened up to selection.
For steam pressures up to about 600 lbs. there need
be no departure from the usual type of boiler con-
struction with riveted drums, but for higher pressures
it is necessary to abandon riveted joints and go to
forged construction.
Forged drums, formed from solid ingots of steel,
are not made by the boiler manufacturing companies,
but are purchased from either the Midvale Steel Com-
pany or the Bethlehem Steel Company. Sizes up to
52" inside diameter and 6" thickness of metal have
been used.
It is extremely important, in the generation of steam
at high pressures, to have pure feed-water which is non-
scaling and non-corrosive. Condenser leakage permit-

ting impurities to mix with the condensate will cause
serious trouble.
When the first section of Delray Power House No.
2 of the Detroit Edison Company was started in 1909,
the Type W Stirling boilers selected represented a radi-
cal increase in size of unit. It attracted international
attention. Previously, 6,000 sq. ft. of heating surface
per unit was about the maximum; the new design pro-
vided 23,650 sq. ft. and at 200% of rating was capable
of an equivalent evaporation, from and
at 212CF., of about 163,000 lbs. per
hour. Today this rate of evaporation
would excite no particular comment
because it has been greatly exceeded.
At the River Rouge plant of the Ford
Motor Company approximately 400,-
000 lbs. of steam per hour were deliv-
ered from a single unit for a period
of 24 hours and it is reported that for
short intervals the rate of 660,000 lbs.
per hour has been reached. Recently,
the New York Edison Company pur-
chased three steam generating units,
each to be capable of delivering 800,-
000 lbs. of steam per hour.
Economic considerations have been
responsible for the development of
these larger units. They are expected
to show lower total costs during an ex-
tended period of time, say ten or
twenty years, than would an equiva-
lent capacity divided between several
smaller units. By increasing the out-
put from each boiler and thus reduc-
ing the number of boilers installed, the
investment cost per unit of output is
lowered. The effect extends to the
equipment that goes with them and
the building that houses them. With
fewer boilers for a given output, the
proportionate amount of building space
devoted to firing floor and aisles is
materially decreased and this affects the necessary cubic
contents and the cost of the structure. The steam and
water piping, although larger in size, is much simpler
in general arrangement and requires a smaller number
of parts. Fuel and ash handling equipment is similarly
affected. The cost of all equipment, per unit of output,
usually decreases as the capacity increases.
Complete combustion within a boiler furnace re-
quires high temperature, thorough mixing of the fuel
with the required amount of air, and sufficient time for
the reactions to be completed. As someone has said,
the requirements are temperature, turbulence, and time.
If the amount of one of these items is reduced a partial
compensation may be made by increasing one or both
of the others.

What Shall I Read?
The New Biography
By J. RALEIGH NELSON, Professor of English
APPARENTLY, if one can judge somewhat
from the book notices, the book reviews, and
the advertising pages of journals of a literary
sort, the reading public has suddenly gone in for biog-
raphy to an extent unparalleled in the history of letters.
This amazing production, as it comes from the press
month after month, is impressive, if for nothing else,
at least for its mere mass. The
Book Review Digest for last
September, reporting on books
which have appeared between
March and August, 1929, listed
two hundred and six biographies.
Even if one were cynical enough
to suspect that the supply is mov-
ing to meet a demand somewhat
artificially stimulated by the ad-
vertising agents of the publish-
ing houses, it is nevertheless
clear that the reading public is
responding enthusiastically. Per-
haps it is not strange, for surely
there is something here for
everybody. The pages of the
Digest, which arc usually dull
enough, are these days not with-
out humor: one finds listed lives
of Attila, Isadora Duncan, Buddha, Thomas Hardy,
Herbert Hoover, Dante, Rossetti, Henry Ford, Vice
President Curtis, and Annie Besant,—all in one amus-
ing hodge-podge.
All the dim figures of the past, as well as the bright
and shining symbols of our progress and contemporary
achievement, are being thrown upon the screen for a
somewhat popular and not always too discriminating
public. It is the sort of thing that naturally meets the
mood of the moment. The world has suddenly a
great new interest in men who dare. An age that pro-
duces a Lindbergh, a Commander Byrd. an Edison, has
a quickened interest and appreciation of Daedalus,
Marco Polo, and Galileo. It is an age of unrestrained
adventuring in every realm of human endeavor; and
the masses, who can never hope to escape their rou-
tine, suddenly find their release from the common-
place and a satisfaction for their romantic dreaming
in the lives of their contemporaries who achieve great
and romantic ends, and then turn with new under-
standing to a consideration of the heroes and wonder-
workers of the past.
It should be noted, however, that not all the biogra-
phies are written in the mood of hero worship. Ro-
IT is with genuine enthusiasm
that we again welcome Pro-
fessor Nelson to these pages. The
wholehearted interest with which
his talks on books were received
last year has led us again to seek
him as a contributor. In the ac-
companying article, Professor
Nelson sorts and classifies the
heterogeneous mass of biogra-
phies which have settled upon the
literary world in the past year or
so. We are sure that the infor-
mation which may be gleaned
here will prove an invaluable
guide to the engineer who has
literary interests.
—The Editor.
main Rolland, to be sure, expresses in his Beethoven
the Creator the adoration he feels for the great master;
it is a rhapsody in appreciation of all Beethoven's music
has meant to his sensitive, artistic nature. But Anna
Robeson Burr's Life of Dr. Wier Mitchell is a full-
length portrait done in something approaching the old
style; detailed, well documented, authoritative, judicial.
Hillaire Belloc writes his Life of
Richelieu with an almost blatant
insistence on his thesis that the
great Cardinal was responsible
for the breaking up of Christen-
dom into a "mosaic of nationali-
ties," and for the line of cleavage
between Catholic and Protestant
culture. And Rupert Hughes, with
iconoclastic hand, pulls Washing-
ton from his pedestal and makes
him, if more human, certainly
less heroic.
But whether the biography be
done with blind and uncritical
enthusiasm, or with a cynical
and over zealous realism that
does not hesitate to dim our
radiant heroes, its method and
manner are apt to be much affected by the so-called
"New Biography." For out of this demand for biog-
raphies that can be read with pleasure and zest there
has developed a new conception of biography which has
not only become popular with great masses of readers,
but which has had a powerful influence on all biograph-
ical studies. Emil Ludwig, Andre Maurois, and Lyt-
ton Strachey may be regarded as the initiators of this
new type. George Alexander Johnson in the Atlantic
Monthly for March, 1929, has made a very keen and
discriminating analysis of its characteristic method. He
points out that the new biography expresses itself in
the form of a novel, or even of the drama, rather than
in that of the conventional history, that it produces a
sense of vivid reality and enlists the reader's imagina-
tion by employing the methods of fiction. It presents
a life not as a prosaic chronicle from birth to death,
but as a dramatic sequence of episodes. It is neither
hero worship nor detraction; it is dispassionate, de-
tached. Its writers are profound psychologists who
emphasize the common humanity of their characters.
It is vivid, brilliantly colored, and picturesque. One
who would get the clue to the interpretation of much

Steam Power
its development down thru the centuries
By ROBERT A. WOLF, »31E
WE, of this generation, are living in a won-
der world of easy and luxurious life, creat-
ed by an intensity of scientific development
that no other people has ever experienced in the history
of this planet, yet a great many of us go about in a
complaceat state of semi-consciousness toward the won-
ders which science has placed at our disposal. We are
surrounded by a medium that has built up a higher
standard of living than almost any other civilization has
ever dreamed of and are in constant contact with the
elements of this marvelous development, still we
have a tendency to regard the advances of science
with a cold indifference that indicates a lack of ap-
preciation of the age in which we live. We view
a piece of machinery which took years and years
of painstaking effort to develop and regard it as
just another inevitable happening, thinking to our-
selves that it was about time that something like
this was done. The discov-
ery, or mechanism, or im-
provement, as the case may
be, soon becomes absorbed
in the intricate maze of
commercial adaption and
we become so accustomed
to it that we are wont to
forget its sources and the
untiring human endeavor
that has made its existence
possible. We live in an
age of machines, but do not
realize what it means to us
in comparison to previous
ages of man because we
forget that these same civ-
ilizations had been striving
for the Utopia in which we
are now living. We are
aware of development but
do not assimilate it with
effort because the finished
product is thrust upon us so suddenly that we are taken
completely by surprise. Perhaps, if we were to look
about a bit more carefully, we would begin to wonder
why we have so much scientific knowledge at our dis-
posal and who were the individuals who spent their
time and energy to bring this about. One of the sub-
stances, with which we come into contact almost every
day in our lives and one to which we are the most
oblivious, is a soft, white, vaporous substance that we
see puffing out of chimneys, to disappear into the at-
mosphere; we call it steam, a very prosaic and unro-
mantic name for a substance that is such a blessing to
humanity. Steam and its application to the uses of the
present day has a very interesting history and is not of
such recent origin as is the popular belief.
It was three centuries before Christ when Hero, a
Greek of Alexandria, first discovered the use of this
vaporous substance as a means for propulsion, although
it had been known for many years before his time.
This man produced a machine, much like the present
day lawn sprayers that are seen throwing water
from a set of nozzles and revolving merrily on
lawns in the summer time, only instead of using
water as a propellant Hero utilized steam and thus
created the first known reaction turbine. There are
numerous other examples of the attempted use of
steam as a motive force and it was nineteen cen-
turies later when the next de-
velopment was supposedly made.
In 1543, a Spanish captain,
Blaxo de Garay by name, exhib-
ited a steam boat which worked
on the same principle as Hero's
former aeolipile, or turbine, but
there is a great deal of obscurity
about the records and it is not
an established certainty that such
a steamboat was ever made to
operate. From De Garay's time
until the next development was
made was not such a long
period and yet find that in
the middle of the seven-
teenth century an English-
man, the Marquis of Wor-
cester, published a set of
works called the Century of
Inventions in which he in-
cluded a description of a steam pump that he had de-
vised. He used these words, "an admirable and most
forcible way to drive up water by fire, not by sucking
it upward." but by a method according to which "one
vessel of water rarified by fire driveth up forty vessels
of cold water." The Marquis also improved his de-
vice to such an extent that he claimed he had found a

A new development—a complete centrifugal refrigeration unit,
of very compact design.
Refrigeration
— its development and its future
By LEWIS UPMAN *
THE incessant effort of man to overcome the lim-
itations of his environment is manifested in his
effort to secure cool conditions in tropic sur-
roundings. It is said that the early Chinese dynasties
supplied the royal families with chilled delicacies thou-
sands of years ago. It is also said that the Egyptians
likewise favored their rulers. During the time of
Alexander the Great in his campaign against the Per-
sians, snow was used to chill his wines. We have
rather complete descriptions of Nero's royal banquets,
particularly the one on Lake Agrippa, to which the
Numidian slaves carried the snows from the Alps in
order that the food and wines served at that banquet
might be properly chilled. Even subsequent so-called
barbarians, during Charlemagne's reign, had begun to
realize one fact, namely, that water-ice lasted longer
than snow because of its increased density, and we are
told of the storing of this ice in his and later reigns of
the feudal period.
Some Early Experiments in Refrigeration
It was about this time, namely, 1550, that the first
efforts along scientific lines for the artificial develop-
ment of cold were made. These first attempts were,

of course, both crude and unprofitable, but they com-
bine to lead us to the perfected apparatus used today.
Almost the first attempt in this direction of which we
have any record, is that of the Italian physician and
scientist, Vlasius Villafranca, by name, who, in the
year 1550, determined that a marked temperature re-
duction could lie produced by dissolving saltpeter in
water. In 1607 another Italian, Tancredus, produced
still lower temperatures through the blending of snow
with saltpeter. This may well be said to be the first
discovery of the "frigerific mixture." A common ex-
ample of the "frigerific mixture" in use today is the
blending of ice and common or rock salt which was for
many years the customary way of producing and pre-
serving ice creams and the like.
Later on, experimenters discovered other "frigerific
mixtures,' many of them employing snow or ice as an
auxiliary to the chemicals used, as did Tancredus.
()thers employed simple chemicals in combination, such
as muriatic acid, nitrate of ammonia, sulphuric acid,
calcium chloride, sodium chloride, etc. In conjunction
with these, it is probably interesting to note in his arti-
cle "Science Remaking Everyday Life," by Edward
F. Slosson, the following: " The chronicle of a century
of effort to approach the farthest north of tempera-

Our Who's Who
In the past, when we wished to communicate with the
Secretary of Vulcans, or with the Chairman of the En-
gineering Council, or with any other officer of one of
our Engineering College organizations, it was almost
necessary to organize a man-hunt in order to get in
touch with the desired party.
The Engineering Council has taken definite steps to
remedy this situation. The names and telephone num-
bers of all the officers of student engineering organ-
izations, including the class officers, have been secured,
and will be posted on a special bulletin board which is
now being built in the Engineering Shops. When the
board is completed, it will be placed in the second
floor hall of the West Engineering Building, between
the two doors of the Engineering Society Room, (the
smoking room over the Arch).
The Engineering Council is to be complimented upon
having recognized and filled a crying need of the En-
gineering College. The Council may be assured of the
thanks of every one of us.

The New Course in Engineering Law
At a meeting a few days ago, the Board of Regents
adopted plans for a six-year course in Engineering
Law, to become effective at the beginning of the fall
term.
The need for men with this sort of training has
been felt for a long time in the industrial world. Cor-
poration lawyers, and men who occupy similar posi-
tions, have felt keenly, upon innumerable occasions, the
lack of a technical background.
Although at times we have felt that co-operation be-
tween Engineers and Lawyers was an impossibility, we
have noted that this apparent lack of harmony has
confined itself to matters of an extra-curricular nature.
May the true Michigan spirit of co-operation pre-
sent itself as a factor in the success of the combined
course in Engineering and Law!

Zeppelins Versus Airplanes?
One may pick up any newspaper or magazine to-day
and find articles regarding the competition in modern
life. It cannot be denied that competition is keener
to-day than it has ever been, and that we owe much of
our development to it; but, we must remember that
although we have keen competition, we also have co-
operation and harmony. In a true sense, humanity is,
and should lie, working in unison to reach the common
goal of peace and better living.
So, with our mechanical development, we must in-
vent and improve machinery which will lighten the
burden of mankind; but, that is not all, we must
properly apply these mechanical developments, so that
each may serve its purpose to the best advantage. This
fact seems to be unnoticed by many people, in regard
to aircraft, especially in regard to the zeppelin and the
airplane. The opinion prevails that the zeppelin and
the airplane are direct rivals in the field of aircraft.
It is true that remarkable records have been made by
both the airplane and the zeppelin, but let us analyze
these records. The airplane has made many long
flights, such as those of Lindbergh, Byrd and Chamber-
lain. These flights were, for the most part, about
4,000 miles in length, and no useful, or pay load, was
carried. This indicates commercial trans-Atlantic
transportation is out of the field of the airplane. In
its field, cross-country trips not exceeding 1,000 miles,
if is a commercial success. The zeppelin, on the other
hand, made a 7,000 mile non-stop voyage, and carried
a pay load of 20 passengers and thirteen tons of mail
and freight; at the end of the trip, the zeppelin had
enough fuel left for 3,000 to 4,000 miles of travel. If
the zeppelin were loaded like the airplane, with as much

COLLEGE NOTES
Tau Beta Pi
The Michigan Gamma Chapter of Tau Beta Pi held
its annual fall initiation at the Union on November 19,
at which time fourteen Seniors, three Juniors, and one
Grad were taken into membership. Mr. A. M. Dudley
of the class of 1902, who is at the present time con-
nected with the Westinghouse Electric Company in the
capacity of head of the Designing Engineering Depart-
ment, gave the principal address of the evening. Mr.
Dudley is well known not only for his connection with
the Westinghouse firm, but also for his literary efforts
which include several texts on the design of armature
windings for alternating current motors. He prolonged
his stay at the University for several days in order to
be able to interview Seniors who were interested in
securing employment with such a Company as Westing-
house. In addition to Mr. Dudley, Prof. A. D. Moore
presided as toastmaster and George Holbrook, the
President of the local chapter, spoke for the active
members while Armour Barber responded for the newly
initiated members.

Lwni
A.S.C.E.
The Student Branch of the American Society of
Civil Engineers was greatly honored in having Colonel
William Starrett of New York speak before a very
enthusiastic audience in the Natural Science Auditorium
on Nov. 25, on the Manhattan Bank Building which is
being built by the Starrett Brothers Construction Com-
pany of New York. This lecture was preceded by the
Fall Initiation banquet of the Student Branch which
was held in the Union. Following the banquet, the
meeting adjourned to the Auditorium to hear the Col-
onel's lecture. About four hundred were in attendance
to hear and see the illustrated lecture which he deliver-
ed. The Manhattan Bank Building which is partially
completed is to be the tallest building in the world
towering nine hundred and fifty feet above the street.
The talk dealt wth the problems encountered both in the
administration and construction of such a large building.
Col. Starrett is a graduate of the Class of '98 and with
his brother controls one of the largest construction
firms in the country. The A. S. C. E. was greatly
favored in having such a man as the Colonel speak
before them and the rest of the Campus is greatly in-
debted to the Society for having brought such a man
here.
Aeronautical Society
The Aero Society is just as active as ever and the
gliders are being used daily by the members of the
group, the total enrollment now being about two hun-
dred. This is a splendid record considering that the
society is just a bit more than one year old. The group
has two new projects upon which it is working; one is
the construction of a secondary glider and the other is
the organization of a new section of the club for
training of pilots in powered ships. This is rather an
innovation on the campus and the idea is a dandy one,
the society has presented a petition to the Board of
Deans and the Committee on Student Affairs and has
received favorable replies from both of the bodies. The
training is not considered as pleasure flying so there
will be no friction concerning the violation of the auto
ban. The new section has joined the National Collegi-
ate Aeronautical Association, which is already making
arrangements for obtaining a ship for training purposes.
The local group is the third member to enroll in the
national organization, Harvard and Yale being the pre-
decessors and N. Y. U., Ohio, and Illinois being the

other members. At present there are twenty members
enrolled in the power ship section, most of them having
had some previous flying experience. This arrangement
has been chosen so that these men may be trained first
and be of some assistance to the group at a later date.
Flying training will probably be given by Ensigns
Ellicock and Dandecker, members of the Naval Reserve
and both very competent men. o
Triangles
In accordance with the
traditional custom of the
Junior Honorary Society,
Triangles, nine members
of the class attempted on
November the twelfth to
wear out both the Arch
and their knees. They only
succeeded in the latter
much to their intense dis-
gust, but after entertain-
ing the Campus with songs
and melodious orchestra-
tions for an hour or so
they adjourned to the
Union where a very fine
banquet was enjoyed by
the Active members and
the initiates. Prof. A. E.
White, who is an Honor-
ary Member of the organ-
ization, gave a very inter-
esting talk on the work of
the Department of Engi-
neering Research.
The nine taken into
membership are:
John P. Diehl, William

In The
Spotlight
Richard F. Gretsch
This month the Spotlight
casts its piercing rays on none
other than "Dick" Gretsch, pen-
etrating the innermost recesses
of his hitherto unknown versa-
tility. Dick, who hails from
Forrest Hills, Long Island, matriculated at Michigan
four years ago as a freshman. He lost little time in
becoming identified in extra-curricular activity. As a
freshman he participated in freshman wrestling and was
a tryout for track manager, an activity which he has
faithfully pursued for three years. Last year he was
appointed track manager and from all reports he exe-
cuted his duties efficiently. "Steve" Farrell considers
Gretsch the most efficient track manager he has ever had.
As track manager he automatically became a member of
the board of governors of the Board in Control of
Athletics.
Dick is also a member of the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers and Vulcans, Senior Honorary En-
gineering Society. This fall the Senior class elected
Dick President of the Class of 1930. As President of the
Senior class Dick is a member of the Engineering Coun-
cil.
Although Dick has been rather a constant participant
in student activties since he first donned his grey pot,
he has had time on two different occasions to entertain
the Chief of Police and the Sheriff of Washtenaw Coun-
ty. We understand that on one of these occasions the
Chief and his boon companion the Sheriff paid a social
call and solocited Dick's aid in the nation-wide search
for Frances St. John Smith, the Smith College Co-ed
who so unceremoniously took French leave much to the
chagrin of the officials of said institution. On the other
occasion, a few days before Thanksgiving, a number of
chickens (barnyard fowl) were listed among the missing.
Again the Chief and his sidekick sought the advice of
Dick, and after deep reflection on the part of our fellow
student the chickens were recovered, none the worse for
their midnight frolic in a vacant dwelling.
A great many of the "fortunate" students who received
such touching letters from the Lonesome Club of the
Detroit Star might be enlightened as to their origin if
they could have been present at one of the numerous
"bull sessions" held in the stronghold of the versatile one.
A great future awaits Dck when he leaves the Uni-
versity. To date he has refused positions of importance
in no less than five national detective agencies, to say
nothing of the flattering offers of the "Lonesome Club."

FAMOUS ARCHITECTS
IN HISTORY
—CHARLES BULFINCH
IN old Bowdoin Square in Boston, among white-
washed, be-shuttered city houses, stands the birth-
place of Charles Bulfinch, a neat and refined resi-
dence built by his grandfather with all that character-
istic Georgian taste, providing the influence and en-
vironment fit for the development of a great architect
and citizen. His ancestors
present a very favorable rec-
ord of culture, ability and
activity, being mainly physi-
cians, merchants and states-
men of the first order. They
laid for him a foundation of
inherited wealth and respect
that later accorded him the
necessary opportunity to cul-
tivate a taste for architec-
ture and to develop it to the
highest stage of perfection.
His education was liberal
and well-balanced, preparing
him for governmental leader-
ship and commercial promi-
nence, but including nothing
of architectural bearing until
he came in contact with a
wealthy Boston land-owner
who interested him in do-
mestic design and encour-
aged its study. H's enthu-
siasm elevated" him above
the confines of residential architecture to the more in-
spiring problems of civic buildings where he was con-
fronted with the dire necessity of further instruction

in the art. During his brief travels through England,
France and Italy he succeeded in biting off a sizable
portion of European design along with a correspond-
ingly large quantity of foreign culture. Returning, he
became acquainted with Thomas Jefferson, then reputed
as architect as well as diplomat, assimilating his offer-
ings of architectural genius and amassing them to pro-
duce a peculiar combination of continental and Jef-
fersonian influences.
The debut of Charles Bulfinch as a professional
architect came with a commission for the construction
of the Hollis Street Church
in Boston, which resulted in
a half successful imitation of
the English parish church
but gave to the architect the
needed impetus and adver-
tisement to encourage his
venture into the profession.
The city found him entirely
favorable to its requirements,
both financial and esthetical,
and named him again to
serve on several other
churches in the community.

learned of his ability and put

ing his ability on more monumental problems. The
column was of stuccoed brick, sixty feet in height and
capped with the American Eagle in fine stone sculpture.
The refined, tapering shaft and the carefully studied
detail again revealed the incomparable Bulfinch quality.
More churches, some residences and the Connecticut
State House at Hartford ensued—all examples of para-
mount architecture.
The lot of Bulfinch was not, however, cast in a bed
of roses, for his reverses were many and tinged with
intensity, serving only to magnify his tremendous en-
ergy and his resolve to succeed. He experienced a
most discouraging financial failure in a large city-hous-
ing plan which he and his associates had undertaken.
The downfall was complete and, being confronted with
bankruptcy and poverty, they were obliged to solicit
the aid of some sympathetic friends whose timely en-
trance saved the day. The reconstruction of Bulfinch's
fortunes were affected through a very profitable con-
nection with the Massachusetts State House building
committee upon which he served in capacity of archi-
tect and general consultant. The State House excelled
everything that he had designed thus far both in size
and in architectural character; it surpassed even the
works of the older architects of Boston who had been
practicing more than a generation before him; it at-
tained an entirely new standard by which his contem-
poraries might scale their abilities.
The zenith of his achievements came, however, with
the design of the United States Capitol Building at
Washington. He was summoned by President Monroe
to take up the work of rebuilding the governmental
structures destroyed by the British troops during the
hostilities of 1812, succeeding to the office two archi-
tects who had failed in the enterprise. The construc-
tion, having been started with faulty plans and incom-
petent management, occasioned Bulfinch much perplex-
ity, for he was required to retain that which had already
been built and also to correct the bold blunders of his
predecessors. With the side wings of the building he
had a far greater opportunity to employ his capable
understanding of architecture than he had with the
partly completed central portion, thus explaining the
present-day error in attributing the main design to
others while considering Charles Bulfinch of only sup-
plementary importance. The fact remains, however,
that the real character and effectiveness of the buildings
were directly the products of the genius Bulfinch.
Various parts of the structure, especially the dome and
the west front, were modified in the process of building
to conform to his exquisite artistic sense. He studied
every proportion and detail to the finest degree, investi-
gated every possibility, making thousands of sketches,
a great number of rendered drawings and several actual
models. One of these models, cleverly constructed in
wood showing the whole building and including all the
fine moulding and sculpturing, held the attention of the
country for some time, both as a curiosity and an object
of art. The intricacy of this wood study suffices to
illustrate the careful planning the designs underwent
before they were executed.
In appreciation of his successful performance of the
work on the Capitol, Congress commissioned Bulfinch
to design the landscape of the grounds and in general
the outlying district. Here he found the unusual op-
portunity to exercise his fine sense of art to the fullest
measure, unharassed by external restrictions. The
beauty of these grounds has been recorded on some
of the greatest canvases of the country, expressing the
popular esteem for Bulfinch and his genius.
After years of high-powered activity on the Capitol
Building, the creative mind of Bulfinch gradually de-
clined into a state of dormancy. The remainder of his
life he spent with his books, his paintings and his mem-
ories, to be parted only with his death in 1844. As an
architect and a citizen, he will always find increasing
recognition by those who appreciate the beautiful and
the true and that public spirit expressed in integrity
and service.

ART finds its inspiration everywhere. The his-
tory of art constitutes a comprehensive record
of the civilized progress of mankind, preserv-
ing all that has transpired in the human mind, its ideals,
its successes and its failures. Paganism or Christianity,
imperialism or democracy, wealth or poverty—every
passion or prejudice of each succeeding age from the
very genesis of man has left its impression upon the
annals of art. Architecture, the mother art, represent-
ing the greatest of historical records, boasts of the rich-
est and truest of these impressions. The architec-
ture of the classics and of the ensuing civilizations
have always been influenced by society, they all have
imprinted upon them the political struggles, the re-
ligious fervor and the communal conditions of the
time. Moreover, the function of the establishment,
its reason for existence, the character of its occupants
—all find their expression in the building.
The principles of functional design have been
largely adhered to until the advent of the
Industrial Revolution, when a new era of civ-
ilization was ushered in, which obstinately re-
fused for a long period to inspire any truthful archi-
tecture. The buildings that housed the industries were
either formless, meaningless masses of concrete and
steel or false adaptations of traditional style. Should
the industrialist command sufficient funds to warrant
the beautification of his structure, he would immediately
summon some long dead classic, apply it to the frame
and call it commercial architecture. The futility of this
procedure as a means toward real, expressive beauty is

obvious, but examples were numerous and some still
persist.
We are now in the midst of awakening of industrial
architecture and can well realize the tremendous neces-
sity and the infinite potentiality of future advancement.
The recent progress in the development of power pro-
duction by gigantic hydro-projects and steam energy
has especially augmented the possibilities in power
house design to the point where a truly expressive
representation of the industry must surely result. It
is the discussion of these possibilities, the agents that
have created them and the results that will ultimately
evolve that chiefly concerns this discourse.
To thoroughly comprehend the subject of power-
house design or any other industrial project, a rudi-
mentary understanding of the technical requirements is
essential. The fundamental consideration in power
planning is the provision of adequate and properly ar-
ranged space to accommodate the apparatus. An
axiom of such a general nature as this seems to be
superfluous, but it must be realized that in no struc-
ture is the advantageous disposition of the parts,
the complex floor shapes of varying elevations, and
the labyrinth of pits, more thoroughly vital to the
success of the building. Thousands of dollars an-
nually are wasted as the result of improperly
planned power plants. According to the latest
developments, the best solution to the technical
A recent power house, designed in the true industrial spirit.
problem is involved in an intricate maze of conveyors,
hoists and chutes for the operation of the plant. The
coal is dumped into a hopper, passed through a crusher
and distributed to overhead bins. The pulverized fuel,
on the way to the conflagration chamber of the boiler,
undergoes processes of weighing and recording which
indicate upon their respective dials the quantities and
qualities passing through the chute. An automatically
controlled stoker subjects the coal to the fire and a
system of hoppers, elevators and drag conveyors re-
move the ashes—all without the touch of the human
hand. The apparatus required to perform these and
numerous supplementary operations undoubtedly costs
an immense sum of money and therefore every precau-
tion must be observed to insure the effective functions
of the plant. The requirements involved in the plan-
ning of such an intricate and expensive project have
determined the shape and the layout of the building's
contents and, by all laws of logic, should be evident
upon the exterior. Elevator pent-houses, smoke breech-
ing, coal hoppers and stacks all must enter into the
spirit of the architectural expression and tell its indi-
vidual story of incessant, overpowering energy. These
elements of mechanical necessity are the agents respon-
sible for the past progress and the future possibilities
in power plant design.
A forecast of the results that will ultimately issue
from these possibilities is entirely encouraging and, as
many authorities believe, represent the new architec-
ture of America. Attempts at purely spontaneous cre-
ation of revolting form and unusual principles of design
fade into insignificance before the highly organic evo-
lution of an architecture, expressive of its function and
representative of its native society. The activities of
modern artists, engaged in a conscientious effort to cast
off the yoke of tradition, are not entirely in vain, but
little can be expected of these very unnatural, affected
methods until a more solid nucleus is formed upon
which to build the new catalogue of design. Grain
elevators, river dams, mills, factories and warehouses,
as well as power plants, are serving to initiate into being
this new spirit, the soul of the Industrial Revolution,
after generations of dormancy.

fuel as possible, it could easily travel around the world
in two hops, and possibly in one. The field of useful-
ness of the zeppelin is obviously long distance flights:
the clumsy ship would be a commercial failure on short
hops of 50 to 1,000 miles.
If we were to ask a surgeon to supervise the con-
struction of a bridge, and a structural engineer to per-
form an operation for appendicitis, we would without
injustice, be called fools, because neither could do the
job we gave him as well as the other. Yet, popular
opinion fails to differentiate the fields of useful appli-
cation of the airplane and the zeppelin, and feel that
they are competitors. Let us '"put each thing in its
proper place."

to ground telephone communication. This
new development illustrates how it marches
a pace ahead of the new civilization. It is
now growing faster than ever before.
New telephone buildings are going up
this year in 200 cities. Many central offices
are changing from manual to dial tele-
phones. A vast program of cable construc-
tion is going on.
This is the period of growth, improve-
ment and adventure in the telephone

John Castlereagh Parker
JOHN Castlereagh Parker was born on April fif-
teenth, 1879, at Detroit, Michigan. He was edu-
cated in Detroit, and after completing high school
entered the College of Engineering of the University of
Michigan, taking his Bachelor of Science degree in Me-
chanical Engineering some four
years later, graduating with the
class of 1901.
The following year he returned
to the University and took up
graduate work in mathematics,
physics, and engineering subjects,
receiving his A.M. degree in 1902.
His ambition still not satisfied, he
went on with extension work out-
side of the university, and was
successful in gaining the degree
of Electrical Engineer, for work
done in absentia, dated 1904.
After completing his master's
degree, Mr. Parker accepted a po-
sition with the General Electric
Company, but left the following
year to instruct in electrical and
mechanical engineering at Union
College, in Schenectady, New
York. In 1904, Professor Parker became Assistant
Engineer in charge of the Niagara Construction Com-
pany, engaged in the designing and construction of the
hydraulic plant of the Ontario Power Company, lo-
cated on the Canadian shore, and in 1905 he transferred
to Rochester, to take up duties as Vice President and
Chief Engineer with the Iroquois Construction Com-
pany. In 1906. Professor Parker became Resident En-
gineer for F. B. H. Paine, and in the spring of 1907
was engaged by the Rochester Railway and Eight Com-
pany as head of the engineering staff.

the subject of Electrical Power Transmission, and in
1915, resigned his position with the Rochester firm to
take the chair of Electrical Engi-
neering at the University of Mich-
igan, his Alma Mater.
While resident in Rochester, Pro-
fessor Parker was active with the
Chamber of Commerce in develop-
ing industry, and served in the ca-
pacity of chairman of the Com-
mittee for the Recodification of
the Factory Law of the State of
New York, and on the Advisory
Board of the Wagner Factory In-
vestigating Committee. Besides
being a Tau Beta Pi, Professor
Parker is a member of the Ameri-
can Society of Mechanical Engi-
neers, the American Society of
Civil Engineers, and a fellow of
the American Institute of Elec-
trical Engineers.
In 1922, Mr. Parker gave up
his work at the University to become a member of the
Staff of the Brooklyn Edison Company, in Brooklyn,
New York, where his advance was both sure and rapid.
He is now Vice-President in charge of engineering.
Mr. Parker is married, having persuaded Miss Eliza-
beth Brooks Payne to become his bride while living in
Rochester. Three children, two sons and a daughter,
have blessed the union, and it is to be hoped that sons
of so illustrious an engineer may follow in his foot-
steps, to the honor of their parents and the profession.

Solving The Production Puzzle
What puzzles Industry most is
Waste. The moment "Timken
Bearing Equipped" is placed into
the picture, the bearing problem is
solved—Waste meets its Waterloo;
friction loses its grip; lubricant be-
comes a matter of little or no conse-
quence; machinery stays young;
costs catapult downward; profits
soar skyward—for Timken is the one
bearing that does all things well.
Timken Bearings will figure even
more prominently in future produc-
tion plans throughout all industry,
and student engineers will find that
a thorough understanding of Timken
applications and possibilities is one
of their most valuable assets.
Let the load be all radial, all thrust
or both in combination ... let the
burden be heavy ... the pace killing
...the exclusive combination of
Timken tapered construction,
Timken POSITIVELY ALIGNED
ROLLS and Timken steel adapts it-
self to the situation and carries on.

then for the development of his numerous hobbies,
being interested in the out-of-doors, especially in camp-
ing and hiking. He is also interested in raising his
own beets and radishes, and is an authority upon the
subject of landscape gardening. In his more artistic
moods, Professor Parker finds time to devote himself
to music, of which he is very fond. Other interests
include die Crescent Athletic club, the Engineers, and
rumor has it that he follows the political steps of the
elephant.
The gazetteer of the world, "Who's Who," devotes
quite a little space to the fame of this eminent son of
Michigan, but it was found that the authentic but con-
densed history in this admirable edition could not com-
pare as a source of information with the huge number
of friends who remembered, and in remembering, cher-
ished the friendship and good fellowship of Professor
Parker. It was not necessary to mention his name to
bring numerous data, items, stories and anecdotes to
light, from the many friends that Professor Parker
has made and kept upon the campus. Indeed, he is so
well liked and remembered that of the number inter-
viewed, only one did not remind us that the middle
name must be spelled right, and it has become our
heartfelt desire that our own middle name will one day
be as cherished and as famous as that of

A NEW ERA IN
STEEL CONSTRUCTION
Oxy-acetylene welding permits a flexibility of design
and construction unknown to any other method of
joining metals. Long established in other fields of in-
dustry, it is now taking an important place in the fab-
rication and erection of structural steel.
The oxy-acetylene welded joint is as strong as the
members themselves. Tough and ductile, it combines
those characteristics which assure a dependable struc-
ture fully capable of meeting the severe loads and
stresses of modern building. There is the added ad-
vantage that construction by the oxy-acetylene process
is practically noiseless. Oxy-acetylene cutting, too, is
indispensable in this field.
Motion pictures (in either standard 35 mm. width or
16 mm. width) showingthe application of these processes
in the fabrication and erection of structural steel are
available to engineering schools and technical societies
without cost.
From time to time the oxy-acetylene industry is
in the market for technically trained men. It
offers splendid opportunities for advancement.

Steam Boiler Design
(Continued from page 6)
High temperatures help to secure more rapid and
complete combustion. Furthermore, high temperatures
in the furnace cause an increased rate of heat transfer
from the furnace gases to the water in the boiler and
this is conducive to increased efficiency.
But with high temperatures it is difficult to maintain
refractory materials in the furnace walls and special
attention must be given to the construction of these
walls and to the location and arrangement of the heat-
ing surface of the boiler to prevent troubles from slag.
In the early days of boiler construction the furnace
temperatures were so low and the usual service con-
ditions so mild that furnace walls presented no partic-
ular problem. With forced draft stokers came in-
creased rates of combustion accompanied by better con-
trol of air supply and higher furnace temperatures.
Then followed a period during which furnace heights
were increased and the distance between the heat ob-
sorbing surfaces of the boiler and the heat generating
fuel bed grew larger. This caused further increase
in furnace temperatures and soon the slagging of ash
and the maintenance of refractories became a serious
problem. At first, clinker adhesion was the common
trouble, but more rapid rates of combustion and better
control of fuel burning caused such high temperatures
to be reached that with certain bituminous coals the
clinker and fine ash no longer merely adhered to the
brickwork; it melted to a very fluid slag which ran
down over the surface of the wall and washed away
deep grooves where it penetrated, and thus dissolved
the structure of the brick.
With the introduction of pulverized fuel, radical
changes had to be made in furnace construction. This
method of burning fuel permits the use of highly pre-
heated air. Combustion is easily regulated by con-
trolling the air and fuel supply. Turbulence and thor-
ough mixing can be obtained with burners properly
designed and installed.
When forced draft stokers are used, a relatively
small percentage of the fuel is carried up from the
grate by the draft and burned in suspension. But in
pulverized fuel plants, all the fuel is burned in suspen-
sion. The resulting ash may be deposited on the walls
surrounding the furnace, on the tubes above, or drop
to the bottom.
Gas temperatures close to 3,000°F. in the boiler fur-
nace are not uncommon. At temperatures as low as
1,800°F. the ash of some midwestern bituminous coals
will soften and as the temperature is incraesed the
fused ash becomes less viscous and will finally flow
like water. Erosion of brickwork occurs if its temper-
ature is above that of flowing ash deposited on its sur-
face. If the temperature of the brickwork is slightly
lower than the fusion point of the ash, a protective coat-
ing will form on the surface. The slag will continue
to flow, but the stationary protecting layer between the
fluid ash and the brickwork prevents destruction of the
wall.
Various methods of furnace protection have been
developed. One way is to build the walls of sectionally
supported refractory material, constructed so as to pro-
vide ducts for air circulation. Air passed through these
ducts is discharged into the furnace to assist in the
combustion; thus the heat which it absorbs is not lost.
This method is successful if limited to cases where
flame impingement on the walls is avoided, the fusing
temperature of the ash is relatively high, and the fur-
nace is large in proportion to the rate of heat liberation.
Another method is to use water-cooled walls. Water
walls are constructed of tubes, either bare or covered,
arranged in such a way as to wholly or partially sur-
round the furnace. They greatly increase the steaming
capacity of a given boiler, and their use permits a large
increase in the rate of heat liberation without slagging.
Another advantage is the reduction of boiler radiation,
due to lowering of the outside temperature of the fur-
nace wall.
In general, water-cooled walls should be selected in-
stead of air-cooled walls, if the ash has a low fusing
temperature, or if the load factor is high and the
boiler will be operated at high ratings over long periods.
Sometimes a combination of air-cooling and water-cool-
ing is advisable.
The excellent performance secured with pulverized
fuel has not caused that method of firing to supplant
mechanical stokers, but it has greatly stimulated stoker
development. Two types of stokers, the forced draft
chain-grate and the multiple-retort underfeed, are suit-
able for large capacity units. The selection of one in
preference to the other depends on the characteristics
of the fuel and an economic analysis.
The chain-grate has been built in widths up to 24
feet and lengths up to 23 feet of fuel supporting area.
Taking the average maximum continuous combustion
rate as 44 lbs. of coal per sq. ft. per hour, a stoker of
that size can supply heat fast enough to give an evap-
oration of about 175,000 lbs. of steam per hour.
The multiple-retort underfeed stoker has been built
in lengths up to 20 feet and widths up to 32 feet. With
an average maximum continuous combustion rate of 50
lbs. of coal per sq. ft. per hour, such a stoker can
cause an evaporation of about 250,000 lbs. per hour.
When greater capacities are desired two stokers, of
either the chain-gate or the underfeed type, may be
placed back to back in a double-ended furnace. How-
ever, at present, when maximum capacities are required,
we are forced into the pulverized fuel field.
In the later stoker installations, improved furnace
proportions, better air distribution, and more thorough

mixing, have resulted in higher furnace temperatures
and more complete combustion. Water-cooled walls and
arches are being used with excellent results.
An interesting installation was put into service late
in the summer of 1929, at Delray Power House No. 3.
Each steam generating unit consists of a main con-
vection boiler, resembling the four-drum Stirling type,
under which is an independent, screen boiler consisting
of four water walls completely surroundng the furnace
and with a bank of tubes across the top. This screen
boiler, which, with the fuel bed, entirely encloses the
furnace, has its own separate feed supply, circulation,
and steam collecting drum. Steam is delivered from
this drum through non-return valves to the rear steam
drum of the main boiler. Underfeed stokers were se-
lected, but the steel work of the building was designed
so that a change to pulverized coal at some future date
would be possible.
Hell Gate Station of the United Electric Light and
Power Company has placed an order for three new
boilers. Each unit is to deliver 800,000 pounds of
steam per hour and consequently pulverized fuel was
selected. When Hell Gate was built, in 1921, twelve
boilers were installed; three were added in 1923, and
three more in 1924, and three more in 1925. These
are all fired by underfeed stokers and, during a 28-
hour test of one of the units installed in 1925, the com-
bined efficiency of the boiler, superheater and econo-
mizer was 92.7%. The temperature of the gases leav-
ing the economizer was 193 F. The writer has seen
no higher efficiency reported with any method of coal
firing.
With such cool exit gases and such a large percentage
of the heat liberated in the furnace transferred to the
water, it appears that little remains to be striven for
in boiler design and construction. On the contrary,
there is much to be done, viz:—
(a) Develop a system of combustion control that
will give operating efficiencies equal to test ef-
ficiencies.
(b) Flatten the efficiency curve so that high efficien-
cies will be obtained throughout the range of
load variation encountered in operation.
(c) Minimize banking losses.
(d) Minimize maintenance costs and shut-downs; -
(e) Reduce investment by more skillful design lead-
ing to larger overload capacities, and higher
rates of heat transfers.

Strachcy. Maurois, Guedella, Bradford, and others.
It is also interesting to get the statement of the ideals
of the new biography from one of its most brilliant ex-
ponents, Andre Maurois, whose Aspects of Biography
has been recently published.
Although, as Mr. Johnson has pointed out, it had its
origin in the French classic literary forms of two hun-
dred years ago, the new biography meets the present
demand for a fresh, vivid, vital account of lives which
for one reason or another interest the popular public.
No one who reads at all can very well afford to ignore
it. Admitting that much of it is hastily and inaccu-
rately written, that it is written to sell, and that many
of those engaged in producing it are not specially well
qualified either as students of history, or as writers,
discounting cautiously the advance notices and the paid
reviews of all such books; it is still fascinating to watch
the procession go by. Now and then one will see a
figure vaguely familiar from one's reading of history
or literature or science whose closer and more intimate
acquaintance he will wish to make.
As a help to those readers of these columns who
will wrish some guidance in their choice, I am suggest-
ing four groups of readings which should serve at
least to familiarize one with the "new biography."
One -might very well begin by reading his way into
one of the most brilliant and creative epochs in the
history of the world, the reign of Elizabeth. He might
read Katharine Anthony's Queen Elizabeth, which can-
not fail to grip and hold his interest from first to last.
Then he might read Strachey's Elizabeth and Essex,
and finally, that smart and racy account of Henry the
1'HI which, although logically it should come first in
this group of readings, is possibly too long and de-
tailed for a good beginning.
Group 1.
Queen Elizabeth by Katharine Anthony.
Elizabeth and Essex by Lytton Strachev.
Henry the VIII by Francis Hackett.
A second group of books might then be chosen deal-
ing with the Victorian Era, so much nearer in time
to our own, but somehow so much more remote from
us in its essential spirit. Queen Victoria by Lytton
Strachev makes a good beginning here, to be followed
by Eminent Victorians by the same author, and Disraeli
by Andre Maurois. If one is interested to study some-
what more fully the life and work of Disraeli, he will

The first two of these suggested groups of readings
will serve to introduce two of the exponents of
the so-called new biography; Strachey, who historically
was first in the field, and Maurois, who has produced
it most consciously and advocated its technique most
loudly. The biographies of Emil Ludwig in Germany
are done in the same mood and with the same challenge
and appeal to the imagination and the sense of dramatic
values. Ludwig's Napoleon, while one possibly wearies
of the detail of its middle chapters—it is heavier
and slower than the biographies by either the
French or English biographers — Ludwig's Na-
poleon after all is full of breathless inter-
est. Napoleon and His Family by Walter
Geer, Josephine the Great Lover by Nezelof , and Mer-
ezhkvosky's Life of Napoleon might be suggested as
additional recent books on Napoleon and his times.
Group 3.
Napoleon by Emil Ludwig.
The Life of Xapoleon by Dmitri Merezhkvosky.
Napoleon and His Family by Walter Geer.
Josephine the Great Lover by Nezelof.
Ludwig is so important and so prolific a biographer
of this new school that one will surely want to read
more than one of his books. I would suggest an in-
teresting combination of Richelieu by Hillaire Belloc
and Bismarck by Ludwig. The two great sinister fig-
ures somehow should be studied together.
Group 4.
Richelieu by Hillaire Belloc.
Bismarck by Emil Ludwig.
Other combinations of books will suggest themselves
as one looks over the longer list of biographies at the
end of this article.
There is a charming passage in one of Romain Rol-
land's books,—Colas Breugnon Burgundian, which bet-
ter than anything I know expresses the genuine joy
one can get from the reading of biography. It is Colas'
comment on his experience in reading for the first time
Plutarch's Lives.
"Plutarch of Sheronaeus was a stout little volume,
as broad as it was long, of about thirteen hundred close-
ly printed pages; the words all heaped one upon an-
other, like corn in a bin. 'There is three years' proven-
der there, for three donkeys.' thought T. At the head
of each chapter were round medallion portraits of the
illustrious subjects of the memoirs, surrounded by
wreaths of laurel; these diverted me extremely; they
only lacked a bunch of parsley in their mouths to be
complete.
"'What are all these Greeks and Romans to me?' I
thought. 'We are living, and they are long since dead,
and can teach me nothing but what I knew before;
that man is a wicked creature, but agreeable enough:
that age improves wine, and spoils women; that in all
countries, the big fishes swallow the little ones, and the
weak jeer at their oppressors'
"Fluttering the leaves with a condescending air, I
threw my eyes along the pages, as an angler draws his
line along a stream, and hang me if I did not hook
something at the very first cast. . . ."
"From that day, the world might have come to an
end without my knowing what had happened; my eye
was fastened on my fishing line, waiting for a bite. . . .
Honestly, the best part of my life (days, weeks, or
years,—I kept no count of them,) was spent then: and
God be thanked! who gave us eyes, through which the
wonderful visions in books can reach our brains. Give
us only those closely packed little black marks, between
the borders of the white page, and from their sight
the magician conjures up long-dispersed armies, ruined
cities, great orators of Rome, fierce enemies, heroes and
the beauties that beguile them, the winds that blow,
the sparkling sea, the hot eastern sun, and the snows
of winter"
"All this is mine, these empires rose, flourished and
disappeared, only to give me pleasure. I feel as if T
were at a Carnival, where in turn 1 can wear every
man's mask and disguise, even to putting on his skin,
and with it his thoughts and passions. Thus I am
at once the music, and the dancer, the book and old
Plutarch, who was inspired to write it in a most for-
tunate hour."

was built and he obtained a patent on it in 1663. A
drawing of the Water Commanding Engine appears in

arranged his apparatus so that steam coming from a
boiler was used to force water upward by its own
pressure. Two storage receptacles were provided so
that while one was cooling the other could be used,
thus providing continuous operation. This invention,
although a very simple and elementary one, was the
cause of some research on the part of other individuals

it passed into seeming oblivion, as it sprang up in a

ciety and also proposed to use it for draining mines.
Savary's engine, while an obvious plagiarism, presented
a bit of improvement as he placed his engine above the
water level and thus utilized atmospheric pressure to
some extent, a decided advantage over the machine de-
vised by the Marquis of Worcester. Savary called his
engine The Miner's Friend as he evidently expected
great results from the pump in mine drainage, but it
died a natural death after it had been tried for pump-
ing water in houses.
None of the inventions heretofore devised made use
of the force of expanding steam in a cylinder until
Denis Papin, a French engineer, designed a machine
which used a piston and a cylinder in which to expand
the steam. He introduced the steam into the bottom
of the cylinder so that it would force the piston up-
ward and then drew the heat out of the cylinder, so
that the steam would partially condense and cause a re-
duction of pressure below atmospheric and thus use
the pressure of the atmosphere to force the piston
downward to complete the stroke. This was a very
crude machine and worked very clumsily but its im-
portance cannot be over-emphasized as it was the first
engine bearing the least resemblance to our modern
steam engine. Several Englishmen, Newcomen and
Cawley, studied Papin's machine and realized that
something must be done to it before the engine would
have any practical application so they invented a method
for introducing a blast of cold water into the cylinder
to act as a condensing medium instead of using the
clumsier method of Papin's. This was also a very im-
portant advance in the design of the steam engine as
it concentrated attention to the problem of condensa-
tion.
The name of James Watt has not been heretofore
mentioned and we may feel a bit of disappointment
when we discover that so much work had been done
with steam before the supposed inventor of the steam
engine entered the field. Many of us have a vague
:onception that this man was the first to invent the
.'ngine and have eulogized him from that standpoint.
W att's work, however, should not be deprecated be-
cause he was the first individual to discover a method
for condensing the steam in an efficient and practicable
way. His was the most far-reaching and important
'mprovement to the future of the steam engine that
has been made and the engine of today is merely a
refinement of Watt's first principles. The disadvan-
tages of the Newcomen engine were very numerous, the
most outstanding being the imperfection of the vacuum
produced by the injection of cold water. The second
Haw was found in the loss of power due to the alter-
nate heating and cooling of the cylinder. When the
steam had been expanded the cylinder was heated and
when the water was introduced the cylinder was cooled

so that at the next injection of steam there was a great
deal of condensation taking place on the upward stroke.
Watt detected these flagrant defects and set about to
remedy them by introducing a separate condenser out-
side of the cylinder. The first separate condenser used
was a cylinder connected to the steam cylinder in such
a manner that when the steam had been expanded to
raise the piston the exhausted steam was withdrawn
from the cylinder. Watt did this by keeping his con-
denser cooled by running water so that the steam would
be condensed and thus cause a partial vacuum which
would cause the dead steam to come out of the cylinder
due to the lower pressure within the condenser; a valve
system made this action entirely automatic in its ac-
tion. Watt did not stop his work after he had reached
this stage and the next thing he did was to put a head
on the heretofore open end of the cylinder so that he
could use the expanding steam for the movement of
the piston, instead of atmospheric pressure as Xewcomen
had done. A patent was obtained by James Watt in
1769 and numerous lawsuits made it extremely difficult
for him to retain his rights as many people attempted
infringement as soon as the engine became commer-
cially successful. From this time onward the develop-
ment of the steam engine was mostly a matter of re-
finement and adaption to other uses, the most revolu-
tionary being the adaption to locomotion and transpor-
tation, where there has been a great deal of fascinating
work done by such men as Stephenson, Fitch and Ful-
ton, pioneers in a field which today has veritably be-
come the backbone of the commercial world.
When we consider the enormous and powerful steam
engines that we use today, the great rapidity with which
progress has been accomplished tends to overshadow
the untiring effort of the early pioneers and their works
appear as mere electrons in the great molecule of the
machine world; it is the task of the historian to revive
our appreciation toward the men who have spent their
lives in the exhausting research that was necessary be-
fore the power of steam was made available to man
so that he could do the wonders that he does with this
powerful medium.

tures, absolute zero, is as fascinating as the temporary
struggle to reach the geographic pole, and, unlike the
other, has proved profitable at every stage."
"When Fahrenheit, in 1724, stuck his mercury into
a mixture of salt and snow, he thought he had reached
the lowest possible point, and boldly scratched a zero
on the glass tube, but it was not long before scientists
began to climb down the minus steps."
Refrigeration in the Last Seventy-five Years
These, then, were the first methods for producing
artificially low temperatures. In order to carry beyond
this point in the development of the art, it was neces-
sary for several discoveries to be made and their con-
sequent results practically applied, before the great
strides made in refrigeration during the past seventy-
five years could occur. These discoveries came in some-
what the following sequence:
About the time of the battle of Lexington, in 1775.
an Englishman, Dr. William Cullen, devised a purely
mechanical means for producing ice. Needless to say,
it was nothing more than a gesture toward purely me-
chanical production of cold. This is also true of the
first patented machine for this purpose, which patent
was taken out in 1824 by one Monsieur Vallance of
France. His apparatus consisted of shallow pans con-
taining water, over which a current of dry rarefied air
was circulated. The vapors arising from the water were
absorbed by the air and, as the process of evaporation
continued, the heat necessary to produce these vapors
being constantly extracted from the main body of the
water, lowered its temperature sufficiently to produce
freezing. The aqueous vapors with which the air was
laden, after passing over the water, were absorbed by
causing the current to flow into a vessel containing con-
centrated sulphuric acid. By this means, the air was

rendered fit for its process of again taking up new
vapors from the water to be frozen.
With this method, the process of freezing was ren-
dered continuous. A simple example of this process
has been in use by desert travelers for many years. It
has been the custom on desert travel, to carry vessels
containing drinking water, which vessels are covered
with a heavy cloth. By keeping this cloth saturated
with water, the evaporation of this water necessitated
the absorption of the heat contained in the water in the
vessel, and the temperature of the water thus contained,
was very appreciably reduced.
Following this Vallance invention, we find that a
Jacob Perkins, in 1834, contrived an apparatus for pro-
ducing artificial cold by the evaporation of ether, and
it was in this process that the first compression system
was inaugurated. The ether was allowed to flow into a
cylindrical vessel containing tubes, where it was vapor-
ized in consequence of the reduction of the pressure
caused by the suction of a pump at one stroke of the
piston; and was compressed into another vessel, cooled
by water, at the return stroke. By this means the ether
was restored to its liquid form and prepared for re-use.
It should be here stated that Dr. Faraday of Lon-
don condensed ammonia gas into a liquid by the now
common method of compressing the gas and then cool-
ing it. The liquid thus condensed by this process, of
course, boiled off rapidly into a gas again, absorbing
heat in the operation. It was this development which
made possible the vast majority of the present large ice
and cold storage plants.
It might be well to elaborate a little here on the first
important effort to manufacture artificial ice, for it
should be noted that all efforts considered up to this
point were more or less of the laboratory or experi-
mental nature and all efforts at practical temperature
reduction were looked upon as a matter of remote de-
velopment. This is indicated by Lord Bacon, in his
"Sylva Sylvarum," wherein he comments as follows:
"Heat and cold are Nature's two hands whereby she
chiefly worketh, and heat we have in readiness in re-
spect of the fire, but for cold, we must stay until it
cometh, or seek it in deep caverns or high mountains,
and when all is done we cannot obtain it in any great
degree, for furnaces of fire are far hotter than a sum-
mer's sun, but vaults and hills are not much colder than
winter's frost." There can be no doubt of Bacon's
realization of the value of such control of cold as of
heat, yet there seemed to be no vision of its possible
consummation.
Ice, of course, was in quite prevalent use from the
time of the Revolutionary War, for we have records
indicating the sale of it in the streets of England and
in home deliveries in America about 1800. Still further
shipments of natural ice were begun from America
about this same time. The records indicate the ship-
ment of a shipload of ice by one Frederick Tudor of
Boston in 1805, the ice being sent to Martinique in the
West Indies, for the purpose of assuaging the suffer-
ings from an epidemic of yellow fever raging there at
that time.
Twining, the Father of Compression Refrigeration
The year 1850 saw two very important events in the
field of artificial ice-making. In their proper order, let
us first consider that of Professor Twining of New
Haven, Conn., who developed an ice making compres-
sion equipment using ether as the refrigerant. This
scientist, of quite original and advanced thought, had
been experimenting for some time with sulphuric ether,
with the view of devising some tangible process where
ice could be produced in remunerative quantities. His
first patent was obtained in England. Another was is-
sued to him in the United States in 1853, and a machine
was placed in operation in Cleveland, Ohio, two years
later. Among the discoveries developed during his early
experiments. Professor Twining had determined that
by the evaporation or vaporization of 1 lb. of ether, 1.2
lb. of water-ice could be produced from water at a tem-
perature of 32 degrees F. He also proved that the tem-
perature of ether could be reduced 28 degrees. It was
upon this and other data obtained that the system em-
ployed in his Cleveland machine was developed.
In this apparatus, he used a double acting vacuum
and compression pump, having a diameter of 8^ inches
and a stroke of 18 inches, moving at a speed of 180
strokes per minute. A tubular "restorer" or condenser
was used in which the ether was retained in liquid form,
by reason of the pressure induced by the compressing
action of the pump, combined with the cooling effect
of water at a relatively lower temperature. The liquid
ether was permitted to flow through a pipe and valve
which regulated the flow, to a part of the apparatus
called the "cistern" in which, on account of the re-
duced pressure existing therein owing to the sucking
action of the pump, the ether would pass into its gase-
ous state, and so extract heat from the surrounding
surface of the "cistern."
This "cistern" was made in such a manner that it
comprised a number of cells open at their tops and con-
taining a liquid non-freezable except at extremely low
temperatures. In this non-freezable liquid were im-
mersed iron moulds, also open at their tops, and filled
with the water to be frozen. After this water had been
completely changed to ice, these moulds were lifted
from their cells and subjected to a bath of tepid water,
as is done today in order to facilitate the removal of
the ice block.
Professor Twining also discovered that by freezing
water at a comparatively high temperature the resulting

but if you should, you'll need to act quickly

THE leading public service compan-

Bailey Meters because they are essential
to the well-organized plant—the plant
that accounts for its heat units as care-
fully as for its dollars.
The high standards of efficiency that
prevail in these modern power stations
reflect the profitable operating economy
assured by Bailey Meter Control.
Bailey Meters keep complete account
of all important operating conditions.
By their use, you can determine the fuel
and stack losses, as well as check the fuel,
steam and water consumption. These
meters enable the operators to locate
and determine the magnitude of the
losses so they may be reduced to a mini-
mum and the final results thereby im-
proved. Bulletin No. 8 IB entitled,
"The Heat Balance in Steam Power
Plants" will show you how this can be
done. Write for a free copy.

ice would possess the much desired quality of trans-
parency, except for a small porous core in the center of
the block; whereas, if the temperature was unduly low.
the product obtained would be opaque.
This Cleveland machine was designed to produce 1
ton or two thousand pounds of ice in twenty-four hours.
The highest actual production attained, however, was
about sixteen hundred pounds, and this under certain
disadvantages. This equipment could not be set up and
made a success commercially, for the production of ice
was out of all proportion to the current price of natural
ice obtainable in Cleveland from Lake Erie and sur-
rounding small lakes. It was, however, operated oc-
casionally during the interval from 1855 to 1857.
An interesting fact with regard to this equipment is
that the process employed, with the exception of the
refrigerating agent used, is identical with the compres-
sion system of the present day. To Professor Twining,
therefore, should solely belong the credit of having de-
veloped the cycle of compression refrigeration in its
application to the manufacture of ice.
When Air Was Used as a Refrigerant
It was also in the year 1850 that Dr. John Gorrie of
Apalachiola, Fla., first devised an air compression
equipment for refrigeration purposes. He obtained a
patent on this equipment in 1851. Briefly, Dr. Gorrie's
machine minght be described as follows: In prior tests,
Dr. Gorrie had established a method for generating cold
through the known principle that the compression of
air increases its temperature, while its expansion de-
creases its temperature. He now developed a compres-
sion of the air up to four or five atmospheres or from
sixty to seventy-five pounds, thereby advancing the
temperature of the air many degrees. He conjectured
that by permitting this compressed air to expand after
it had assumed the temperature of the surrounding
atmosphere (resulting from the cooling effect of
water), its decrease in temperature below the normal
must be in an inverse ratio to its original increase in
temperature. Thus, it was proved by Dr. Gorrie that
artificial cold could be generated with nothing but the
atmosphere as a refrigerant, and that chemicals could
thus be dispensed with entirely.
This, of course, offered great inducement to inventors
everywhere and for many years research along these
lines was continued. It should, of course, be remem-
bered that the laws relating to thermodynamics had not
been clearly defined at that time. These laws have since
deprived Dr. Gorrie's efforts of considerable value from
a scientific standpoint, for it has since been proved that
heat and mechanical duty are the equivalent, one of the
other, and that the mechanical energy necessary to com-
press a given quantity of air so greatly exceeded the
work necessary when a volatile liquid such as anhydrous

The Ever Broadening Field of Refrigeration
It will be noted that no apparent effort had yet been
given to the production of artificial refrigeration for
any purpose other than of ice-making. The compara-
tively limited sense of things at that time had prevented
a proper grasp of the almost unlimited application of
artificial refrigeration which is still being developed.
With the gradual unfoldment of this idea, and its prac-
tical applications to current progress and developed ne-
cessities, refrigeration has just naturally divided itself
into three distinct general groups, viz:—
(1) Large Commercial
(2) Small Commercial
(3) Household units, etc.
The large commercial field was the first to develop,
for two distinct reasons, namely (a) larger savings and
(b) greater needs. This larger commercial field, or
group, covers all plants of nominal twenty tons capacity
per day and over, necessitating the continuous services
of licensed operating engineers. This group started, as
before stated, with the ice-making plants. Following
this came the cold storage plant, or warehouse; then the
dairies and ice cream factories, including the assembly
plants, where the milk is brought together for shipment
to the dairies and where the animal and other sensible
heat was removed to a degree.

Transportation
We have a bit of news coming from the administra-
tive office that we are to have a new course at the uni-
versity. A complete course in general transportation
is being formulated and probably will be included in the
curriculum of the fall term of nineteen thirty. The
course will be combined engineering and transportation
and will undoubtedly include aeronautical, railway,
water, and highway methods; communication, a close
relative to transportation will also be taught with the
course. We have excellent facilities in the engineering
school and all that is needed to initiate such a course is
to arrange the proper inter-departmental organization,
a problem that is time consuming and laborious.
This premature announcement is being made because
we think that it is something to be able to go home at
Christmas time and brag about. The University of
Michigan will be the only school in the States, with the
exception of Yale, that has such a course.

On Wednesday evening, November 6th, the Michigan
Chapter of Scabbard and Blade held the initiation of
Fielding H. Yost, in the Union. With the new change
of personnel, the chapter here is laying plans for a
rather elaborate programme of activity. Major Ed-
wards, the new commandant, came directly to Michigan
from the War College. The Wrar College is an institu-
tion of the government for the senior officers who are
eligible for promotion. Captain Powell of the Signal
Corps came here from Fort Monmouth. New Jersey,
but he has had previous experience as a Signal Officer
at Yale University. Captain Custus, likewise, has
seen service at the University of Maryland.
The announcement of the annual fall elections will
l&lt;t made sometime during the month of December. The
lateness of the date is largely due to the fact that no
cadet officers were appointed before the middle of
November. The society now numbers something over
15,000 active and alumni members, and has chapters at
75 of the larger Universities and Colleges throughout
the country.

The Automotive Laboratory
By WALTER E. LAY, Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering.
A Comprehensive Survey of the Auto Lab., by its Director.
I
THIS article really consists of answers to the
following questions about the Automotive
Laboratory.
What is it? Where is it? Why is it? What is in
it? What is done in it?
The first question may be an-
swered quite simply. This labor-
atory is a part of the mechanical
laboratory and of the department
of mechanical engineering. It
may be more properly known as
the automotive division of the me-
chanical laboratory.
The answer to the second ques-
tion is almost as simple. It is lo-
cated in a portion of the brick
building formerly occupied by the
foundry and in the low wooden
"lean-to", whose walls are covered
with red roofing-paper and whose
roof is covered with tar paper.
This latter part has been facetious-
ly referred to as "the cow-shed".
It is adjacent to the beautiful
Clements Library. It is the only
laboratory housed in a wooden
building on the campus proper. It
is undoubtedly the worst fire risk
on the campus. Gasoline and other
explosive fuels are used continu-
ously in this wooden building. The fire inspectors
recognized this risk. They made recommendations
which gave the laboratory three new fuel supply
T is quite appropriate
that we should print a
comprehensive survey of

tory in the Automotive

No man is better fitted to
undertake this task than
Professor Lay. Imme-
diately after his gradua-
tion in 1915 he began his
work with the Automo-
tive Lab, and has been
directly responsible for its
development during the
past 15 years. The ac-
companying article offers
valuable information to
every Michigan engineer-
ing student, and should
answer many questions
for him.

systems in almost as many years.
"Why is it?" In the first place it has a perfect
right to be. The University of Michigan is located
in the heart of America's largest industry,—at the
automotive center of the world. Within a radius
of one hundred and fifty miles,
over 75% of the world's automo-
biles are built. Students come from
all parts of the world to study au-
tomotive transportation, whether
marine, aerial, or highway, and to
visit or work in the great plants
located near by. Of all the Uni-
versities of the world, Michigan
should have the finest automotive
laboratory.
"What is in it? The laboratory
equipment may be divided into
two general classes; operating
equipment, and test apparatus.
The operating equipment con-
sists of complete cars and trucks,
and practically all of their com-
ponent parts. This includes not
only the engines used in cars,
trucks, and buses, but also those
used in tractor, marine, and avia-
tion service. Every one of the
twenty-five serviceable engines
have been donated or loaned by the
automotive manufacturers, or by the air services
of the Army and Navy. Two exceptions may be
noted; a recently purchased high-speed Diesel en-

gine, and the Universal Test Engine which has
been described in a previous article in the Technic.
The test apparatus includes five electric dynamo-
meters of 30, 40, 60, and 100 h.p, capacities. There
are two torque-stands of the reaction type, and one
engine mounting arranged to measure simultaneous-
ly the thrust and torque of an airplane propeller

mounted on it. Another electric dynamometer and
water brake combination of 500 h.p. combined ca-
pacity will soon be shipped here. A car test-stand
provided with six-foot diameter drums, capable of
seventy miles per hour, is available for test of a
complete car. Complete auxiliary apparatus is pro-
vided for measuring temperature and pressure of
oil, water, fuel and exhaust. Automatic devices de-
termine fuel consumption and engine or car speeds.
Air and water meters, high-speed cylinder pressure
indicators, and all the usual small apparatus is avail-
able to study the operation of automotive equip-
ment.
What is done in the laboratory is even more in-
teresting. There is first the regular course of in-
struction. This work centers about the heart of
the automotive vehicle, the internal combustion en-
gine. The desired qualities in such an engine are;
great power for a given weight or size, high effici-
ency, quietness, and lack of vibration. These may
be affected by such variable conditions as speed,
load spark advance, mixture-ratio, compression
pressure, etc. The inter-relation of these factors are
studied and a definite effort is made to demonstrate
by actual operation the general principles previous-
ly studied in the classroom.
One of the features of the work is the road test
of a motor vehicle, which requires a full day's work-
on the road with a truck, and from one to three
cars. Acceleration, deceleration, maximum and
minimum speeds, and fuel mileage are measured
over the complete operating range of each vehicle.
For the coming semester, a well known bus com-
pany has agreed to loan us a bus for this test. It
will be a veritable laboratory on wheels. This test
is preceded by a half day's trip to the General
Motors proving ground where this kind of work is
carried on continuously, day after day.
Another phase is the study of problems in re-
search by advanced students. This forms an excel-
lent opportunity for the development of material
for the thesis required for advanced degrees.
Very excellent work has been done on a variety
of problems relative to the betterment of the auto-
motive vehicle. At present time, two such projects
are under way, one a study of power losses in a
modern four-speed transmission, the other a study
of some phase of the operation of modern high-
speed Diesel engine, including the use of "doped
fuels".
A third phase of the work is the experimental
tests carried out for various industries who do not
have the necessary laboratory facilities or personnel.
This is a mutual service. It not only aids the in-
dustry for whom the work is done, but it keeps the
staff alive to what is being done by the industry.
It is during this work that many contacts are made
which result in gifts or loans of operating equip-
ment to the laboratory.
This semester the Universal Test Engine is in
operation almost daily, making anti-knock determi-
nations on fuels submitted by various petroleum re-
finers. In all of the spare time it is being used in
a general study of the various phases of the detona-
tion problem which has so worried automotive and

Tests were made on a new system of fuel vapor-

start, using a heavy distillate fuel apparently as
easily as when using gasoline. If this method is
feasible it will reduce the very great fire risk at-

What Shall I Read?
The New Science
By J. RALEIGH NELSON, Professor of English
PERHAPS there has never been a time when
an adventure into the literature of science was
so easy, so delightful, and so surely profitable
even for readers like myself with no special training
in scientific thinking. The growing popular move-
ment for adult education may be somewhat respon-
sible for the large number of simple, well written
books on the new scientific theories which seem
likely to revolutionize our con-
ceptions of the physical universe.
If one has any interest in any
aspect of his world, he need not
remain in ignorance of the newest
discoveries regarding it, nor of the
latest theories to explain its phe-
nomena. Fortunately, too, there
is evident a new humanistic atti-
tude toward science which is be-
ginning to produce what may, by
analogy to the so-called "New
Biography", be called the "New
Science". Just as biography has
to some extent abandoned the
tedious method of amassing pon-
derous volumes of fact for a vivid,
dramatic series of pictures which
appeal to the imagination rather
than to the fact-finding instinct for
mere information, so in the new
literature of science, one finds a
sense of the beauty, the wonder,
the bigness of the world which affect one's aesthetic
sense in some such way as do poetry or fiction.
The two outstanding and notable examples of this
new method are Jean Henri Fabre, and William
Beebe. Both are indefatigable and ingenious ob-
servers whose enthusiasm is so child-like, and so
genuine as to be highly contagious and stimulating:
both are so intent on the marvels and beauties of
the world outside themselves that they are quite
free from affectation or self-consciousness. Their
style is consequently charming, vivid, often bril-
liant, without smartness. They both have a keen
and delicate sense of humor, a broad philosophical
outlook, and on appreciation of human values.
James Henry Robinson in an essay on The Hu-
manizing of Knowledge in which he points out a need
for the re-synthesizing of knowledge, says, "Do we
not urgently need a new type of wonderers and
pointers-out whose curiosity shall be excited by this
strange and perturbing emergency in which we find
ourselves?"
SCIENTIFIC litera-
ture has always been
accredited with unusual
"dryness". In the ac-
companying article, Pro-
fessor Nelson has given
an interesting account of
his adventures in the read-
ing of books upon science
—books which offer the
thrills of "Treasure Is-
land" while they, at the
same time, impart valu-
able information. Pro-
fessor Nelson has pre-
sented his findings in the
same clear, informal style
which has characterized
his past articles.
—The Editor.
"The reassorters and humanizers should combine
a knowledge of the exigencies of scientific research
with a philosophic outlook, human sympathy, and a
species of missionary ardor. Each of them should
have professional familiarity with some special field
of knowledge, but this should have come to seem
to him but a subordinate feature of the magnificent
scientific landscape." To me Fabre and Beebe are
almost perfect fulfillment of this
ideal.
Begin with Social Life in the Insect
World and you will be liable to read
on through the various volumes to
the end—the hunting wasps, the
caterpillar, the fly, the scorpion,
the weevil, the spider. Actually,
I have found myself regretting
that there were not more insects
for Fabre to study, or that his long
years might not have been still fur-
ther extended.
Fabre's studies of insect life
are absolutely final and authorita-
tive, but they are much more. No
matter how little interest in bio-
logical facts one may have had
previously, he cannot escape the
fascination of these minute and de-
tailed pictures of life. Somehow,
too, the life so vividly portrayed
takes on almost human values.
If the personality of the quaint old French nat-
uralist suggests a closer and more intimate ac-
quaintance with the man, The Life and Work of Jean
Fabre by E. L. Bouvier will give the reader the facts
he may wish to know. If the amazing bugs and
beetles stimulate one's interest for further reading,
he should get Social Life Among the Insects by Dr.
William M. Wheeler, six lectures given by this
Harvard professor at Lowell Institute in Boston in
1922. It must be recognized that they have none
of the charm of Fabre's studies but they are au-
thoritative and scholarly without being too heavy
or erudite.
Beebe, despite the point of similarity already
noted, is distinctly different from his French
predecessor. Fabre has the steady, unwavering
eagerness of an old man whose one burning interest
has never died within him: Beebe has the flaming
enthusiasm of a boy. If Richard Haliburton did not
bore me and weary me, whereas Beebe has given

The Small European Car
By HAROLD 4. GIBSON, Grad.
EUROPE has long been regarded as the prov-
ing ground for freak automotive develop-
ments. Many of the smaller manufacturers
seem to take "Adopt" as their slogan, paying no at-
tention whatever to the success with which the
thing can be adapted to their product and then put
on a production basis. The American manufacturer
has as his slogan,
"Adopt, adapt and
produc e". As
proof of this we
have only to
search for pro-
duction cars for
the latest thing
in automotive de-
sign and we find it
in use. Many of
our ideas come
from Europe, but
no longer do we
follow the European trend in design. The American
engineer has adopted a style of his own in the last
few years, and now it is Europe that watches Amer-
ica to see how we have utilized the latest develop-
ment. This is particularly true in the small car field.
Xo longer can an American manufacture advertise
"European in design" and sell his cars to the public
on the strength of this alone. An interesting new
development along this line is the forthcoming at-
tempt to build and market in this country two or
three cars of the very small car type so popular in
Europe. It will prove of great interest to watch the
success attained by these cars. Undoubtedly there
is a place for such cars in this country, but it will
prove interesting to see if the motoring public will
accept them, as it is hoped.
Taking the small European car as a whole, we
find that it is vastly different from our so-called
"light cars." Figure 1 shows a car that is among
the most popular in its class, and is typical of small
car design in Europe. The Austin represents a
purely European trend while the Renault shows the
tendency of European manufacturers to follow our
American ideas of small car size.
The first outstanding thing observed is their
small wheelbase and tread. The wheelbase of the
Austin "Seven" is only 75 inches. The wheelbase
of the Renault "Monasix" is 104 inches which cor-
responds to our Ford Model "A" wheelbase. There
are at least thirty European cars which have a
wheelbase of less than 100 inches, while the tread
of these light cars ranges from 40 inches on the
Austin to a standard 56 inch tread on some of the
larger light cars. It is safe to say that the average
tread is about 43 inches on those cars which have a
wheelbase of less than 100 inches. One thing
very noticeable in all European cars is the absolute
lack of manufacturing standards. This point is
brought out very well by the tread variation. All
American made cars have treads of from 56 to 59
inches, while in
Europe the tread
varies all the way
from 40 to 60
inches. The nar-
row tread used
on these cars
keeps the width
in proportion to
the length. How-
ever, it is very
common to find a
tread of 46 to 48
inches on a car
with a wheelbase of 115 inches; this reduces the
available body room greatly. The tire sizes corre-
spond in general to the wheelbase used, being some-
what smaller than is common in the United States;
this is partly because of the smaller size of the car
and partly because of the excessively high engine
speeds employed, which make small tires a neces-
sity.
An inspection of the bodies reveals that many
unique steps have been taken to obtain body room
on these short, narrow wheelbase cars. In most
cases, four passengers are the limit in the sedan or
coach type of body. It is very difficult to seat even

four people comfortably in many of the smaller cars.
Leg room is the great problem in a 75 inch wheel-
base car. A certain amount of room must be al-
lowed even for the small engines used. The most
common solution of the problem is the use of
"wells" in the floor of the tonneau. The floor over
the propeller shaft is made high enough for shaft
clearance, and between the shaft and the frame it is

The New Front Wheel Drive
Automobile
By L. VERNE AXSEL, »31 E
AFTER five years of exacting experimental
work, the Auburn Automobile Company has
introduced America's first "stock" front-drive
automobile. While the front drive car has been
used in racing competition for a number of years,
by such men as Harry Miller and Barney Oldfield,
the present creation, the Cord car, is an entirely
new engineering development.
That the front-drive car possesses exclusive ad-
vantages is undeniable. The absence of frame
"kick-up" at rear makes lower body construction
possible, and
enables t h e
designers to
place the
rear seat on
the same
level as the
front seat.

Cord is the
first "produc-
tion" car to
use a unit power plant, engine, transmission,
differential and front brakes in one assembly. The
power, since it is applied near its source, is not only
employed efficiently, but the arrangement also
eliminates the long drive shaft used in rear-drive
cars which has a tendency to vibrate at high speeds.
Since steering, as well as the pulling of the car, is
controlled by the front wheels, the shaft is con-
nected to the wheels by a double universal joint.
This universal joint operates at wheel speed, and

locity, but also permits the steering of the front
wheels at an angle of 42 degrees while power is
being applied. This angle is somewhat sharper
than the average rear-drive car can turn and al-
though the Cord has a wheel base of 137^ inches
it is possible to turn it in a circle of 23 feet radius.
The ring and piston gears in the differential are
hypoid, designed 30 per cent stronger than for the
rear-drive car of similar weight. This careful
method of design is employed throughout the car,
and assures an unusually high factor of safety.

is standard in the transmission is reversed in the
lever, since the motor is reversed in the chassis, and
turns counter-clockwise. The shift is controlled by
a lever projecting horizontally out of the instrument
board. It is connected over the motor, as shown in
the illustration, to a regular gear shift lever which

The Cadillac V-1B
—Some Notes On Its Design
By SAMUEL B. MALIN, *32E
THE tendency toward larger motors and higher
powered cars has received an impetus with
the creation of the new V-type, 16 cylinder
motor car. Cadillac just introduced the new car at
the New York show, where it
caused a sensation.
The engine of the new V-16 is
an inherently balanced valve-in-
head design having a bore and
stroke of 3 by 4 inches. The dis-
placement is 542 cubic inches,
and the horsepower from 170 to
185 at 3200 r.p.m. The included
angle between the cylinder blocks
is 45 degrees. Thus the power
impulses occur at every eighth
turn of the crank shaft and are
equally spaced. As a result the
motor has a more continuous
torque and great flexibility. Also
smoothness of acceleration and
great power range are afforded.
The many unusual and interesting features in-
cluded are: automotive valve silencer, which does
away with tappet noises and adjustments, a vacuum
assister in the braking system, thermostatically
controlled crankcase ventilating system and two
complete fuel systems, one for each block of eight
cylinders.
Valve action is similar to that of the conventional
The Automatic Valve Silencer
Cross Sectional view. Note the compactness
valve-in-head mechanism with the exception of one
single improvement. The tappet noise which has
been accepted as inevitable with valve-in-head de-
sign is eliminated. This is accomplished by mount-
ing rocker arms on an eccentric
against which pressure is always
applied. These rocker arms ride
lower when the engine is cold, and
as valve stems and push rods ex-
pand, rise against this push. In
consequence the clearances in the
mechanism remain at virtual zero,
and clicking is prevented.
Ignition is performed with an
eight-lobed timer with two sets
of contact points, two coils, dis-
tributor and condenser. Each
coil fires eight cylinders and has
its own contact point.
The engine structure is com-
posed of eight castings of which
four are aluminum alloy and the
other four are of nickel-iron, the former comprise
the crankcase upper and lower sections and the cov-
ers for the overhead valves. To improve the oil
cooling, the crankcase lower section is provided
with longitudinal ribs. The four nickel-iron cast-
ings are the two clinder blocks and the two cylinder
heads. Cylinder barrels extend into the crankcase a
considerable distance, which in conjunction with the
small angle of the V, 45 degrees, gives a rather
compact engine. Connecting rods are located side-
by-side on the crankpins, the cylinder blocks being
offset longitudinally.
Combustion chambers ar,e oval in shape, and
completely machined. The oval shape produces a
low clearance space at two sides of the piston, there-
by increasing the cooling effect of that portion of
the charge which burns last. Combustion cham-
bers are milled out at the top of the sides for valve
clearance. Spark plugs are located at the highest
point of the chamber, on the side toward the V of
the engine.
The lubrication system supplies oil under pres-
sure to all engine bearings, including the piston
pins. To prevent oil surge, the sump is provided
with baffles. The crankcase ventilating system is
particularly interesting as the air inlet passage is
fitted with a thermostatic valve, permitting the en-
try of cold air only during the warming-up period.
The air intake is funnel-shaped and facing forward.

Michigan Engineering Conference
Engineers who have attained pre-eminence in
many fields of activity, including a member of the
United .States cabinet, the governor of a state, and
leaders in business and industry will be among the
speakers at the Fourth Michigan Engineering Con-
ference, observing the fiftieth anniversary of the
founding of the Michigan Engineering Society, to
be held at the University of Michigan on Thurs-
day, January 30, and Friday, January 31.
Included among those who have already accepted
places on the program, as announced today by Pro-
fessor F. N. Menefee, general chairman, are Robert
P. Lamond, Secretary of Commerce; Frank E.
Emerson, governor of Wyoming; Dr. Alexander
G. Ruthven, president of the University of Michi-
gan; W. A. Starrett of Thompson-Starrett company,
New York; Sergius P. Grace, assistant vice presi-
dent of the Hell Telephone Laboratories, New York;
and Howard E. Coffin, vice president of the Hudson
Motor Car Company, Detroit.
Sessions will be presided over by Gerald J. Wag-
ner of Grand Rapids, president of the Michigan En-
gineering Society; R. Perry Shorts, president of the
Second National Bank of Chicago and regent of the
University of Michigan; Dean H. C. Sadler of the
Colleges of Engineering and Architecture. U. of M.;
Gardner S. Williams, Ann Arbor; John S. Worley,
transportation department, U. of M., and M. E.
Cooley, dean emeritus of the Engineering College,
U. of M.
As befits the observance of the fiftieth anniver-
sary of the founding of the Michigan Engineering
Society, the program will have for its general theme
"The Engineer's Contribution to the Art of Liv-
ing". The papers and addresses will touch upon
different phases of the work of the engineer—in
government, in building, in finance, in industry, in
communication, in education—all dealing with the
important parts he is playing in modern life.
The conference will open with the annual meet-
ing of the Michigan Engineering Society on Thurs-
day morning. It will be followed by luncheon and
an afternoon session. On Thursday evening a ban-
quet is scheduled at the Michigan Union.
Friday will have four sessions, a morning meet-
ing, luncheon, an afternoon meeting, and a banquet
at the Michigan League Building. The conference
is to close with a theater party following the Friday
evening banquet.
The occasion is expected to draw engineers from
all sections of Michigan and also from outside the
state.
World Power Conference
The World Power Conference brings together the
leading workers throughout the world in the different
fields of power, so that they may discuss recent de-
velopments and experiences with each other, and with
members of the scientific and business world. The
World Power Conference also provides a platform
from which experts connected with power and fuel can
speak to the public outside the technical professions.
In this way the vital questions are made clear
which affect the economic and administrative
structure of society as a result of engineering progress.
Those attending meetings of the Conference include not
only engineers, but statesmen, economists and others
who are not ordinarily in close contact with this prob-
lem.
Under the leadership of D. N. Dunlop, the idea of a
World Power Conference came to fruition during the
Wembley Exhibition in 1924. In full agreement and
with wholehearted co-operation of their governments,

COLLEGE NOTES 1
Electric Department
We have information from the department that
they are getting a new Cathode Ray Oscillograph
manufactured by General Electric. The instrument
is exceedingly delicate and is used for sensitive
photographic measurements of electric currents, be-
ing capable of recording oscillations lasting only one
millionth of a second. This is far advanced in com-
parison to the ordinary ammeter method of meas-
urement, as the ammeter becomes a cumbersome
instrument when attempting to record variations of
over one thousandth of a second's duration. The
device is worth about five thousand dollars and
should prove invaluable to the department in some
of the research it is conducting.
Along with this comes news of the rearrangement
of the photometric laboratories, the apparatus being
moved from the cramped quarters on the ground
floor of the East Engine building to the larger
rooms on the third floor of the same building. The
new laboratory is about three times as large as the
old room and provides space so that some of the
much needed equipment could be purchased and in-
stalled whereas it was impossible to buy this equip-
ment heretofore because of the lack of space. The
lab is divided into six rooms, four of which are
occupied by photometer bars to be used by the re-
search men, a large general room, a small private
laboratory, and a separate division which is being
constructed for a research problem. The most con-
spicuous piece of apparatus is an integrating sphere
with which it is possible to measure the light output
of a lamp by a single reading, while without the in-
strument the process of measuring is exceedingly
long and laborious.
Some unique work is being done on the amount
and distribution of light through windows of dwell-
ings when the casings are constructed of different
materials. The problem is to determine the differ-
ence when steel and ordinary wood frames are used
and the arrangement of the method of solution is
rather ingenious. A room of average size has been
built in the laboratory so that conditions will be
about like those encountered in regular dwellings.
The room is equipped with an interchangeable cas-
ing which permits a hasty transfer of windows dur-
ing the tests. The source of light from the outside
has been arranged to produce conditions which
would duplicate sunlight on the normally bright day
and is provided by a bank of incandescent lamps ar-
ranged in boxes so that the open faces of the boxes,
which are covered with a semi transparent paper,
are toward the window. This gives a well dis-
tributed diffused light and is a constant source not
affected by varying conditions as, natural sunlight
is. In this manner the experiments can be made
with a great deal more accuracy because the condi-
tions of entering light are always constant and re-
liable. The effects of various types of drapes and
hangings on the entering light will also be investi-
gated. The work is being conducted for the Detroit
Steel Products Company, a concern which makes a
steel sashing.
o
Aeronautical Department
Professor Pawlowski and his staff are doing a bit
of interesting research on a low wing monoplane for
a California manufacturer. The plane is probably
the nearest approach to a flying creature. Some
features of the plane are an unusually small and
well stream-lined fuselage built in and projecting
from the upper part of the wing, the tail surfaces
are not carried by the fuselage, as is the conven-
tional practice, but by two booms attached to the
wings, and further stream-lining is provided by a
N. A. C. A. cowling and wheel faring. The model
of the plane does not indicate the adaption to com-
mercial uses, but has the characteristics of the alti-
tude or duration test plane.
The department is also conducting some wind
tunnel tests on a military type biplane for the Chi-
nese government.

Transportation Club
The first semester has been a rather inactive one
for the Transportation Club due to the fact that
practically all of its members graduated last June.
However, Prof. Sadler of the Civil Engineering De-
partment who is the Faculty Adviser has been
arousing interest among the members of the present
Senior Class and under the direction of G. L.
Beard, 30E, Temporary
Chairman, several meet-
ings have been planned
for the future. In order
to avoid such a situation
as arose this year it has
been decided to extend
membership to members
of the Junior Class so
that the activities of the
organization may be
continued. The Society
is co-operating with the
other Societies in bring-
ing Major Kennedy of
Washington, D. C. to
the Campus to speak on
Air Terminals in the
United States. Plans
are also being laid to
bring Mr. Shaeffer, Vice
President of the Penn-
sylvania Railroad to
speak on the Combined
Air Rail Work of the
National Railroad. This
is to be an illustrated
lecture. In addition to
these talks, trips of in-
spection to the Detroit
Terminal Facilities for
Railroads, Marine, Air,
and Automotive Lines
are being planned.
In the School of Architecture these men were
chosen to direct the destinies of the class of '33 for
a year:
President Joseph O. White
Vice President Duncan J. Seaton
Secretary Wallace E. Wilson
Treasurer Marvin De Vos
In The
Spotlight
George Holbrook
It is indeed a rare occasion
when one finds the qualities of
brilliant student and active
leader combined into one, but
there happens to be one partic-
ular individual in the present
Senior Class who has proven beyond a doubt that he pos-
sesses these qualities to the Nth degree. Ever since the
time that George Holbrook enrolled as a Freshman in
the Engineering College, he has been taking a prominent
part in the affairs of his class. His first achievement
was his election to the office of Treasurer of the Fresh-
man Class. But he did not allow his scholastic talents
to go to waste, and proceeded to maintain the very high
average which brought to him membership in Phi Eta
Sigma, the Honorary Freshman Scholastic Society. En-
tering still more vigorously into the affairs of the class,
he was chosen as Secretary in his Sophomore year, and,
in addition, was selected as the leader of the Soph Prom.
Such activity could not go unrewarded, and George was
permitted to caress the Engineering Arch with his knees
by way of initiation into Triangles. In the Fall of the
next year he was elected as one of two Juniors into
Tau Beta Pi. In addition to this, he was granted a
membership in Phi Lambda Upsilon, the Honorary Chem-
ical Society, George being one of our hard working
Chemical Engineers. But don't think for a minute that
his Class activity was being neglected, for he was se-
lected as one of the representatives of the Class of 1930
011 the Engineering Council. This year he is serving as
Chairman of the Council, and is also the very efficient
President of Tau Beta Pi.
It is indeed, a treat to find such brilliance coupled
with such an all engrossing interest in the affairs of the
class, that we can scarcely find words to express our ad-
miration and respect for such an individual who, in the
midst of all these honors, has retained those characteris-
tics which have made him so many friends.
Class Elections
The Freshman classes in the University are al-
ways rather slow to organize and so for that rea-
son the elections of the Class Officers for the Fresh-
man Engineering and Freshman Architecture
classes were not held until quite recently. These
completed the political activities for the Fall term
and so we present the names of the honored ones.
The Engineers elected the following men:
President Carl White
Vice President Robert Wilson
Secretary Robert Harrison
Treasurer Ransom C. Ellsworth
Pi Tau Pi Sigma
The Michigan Chap-
ter of Pi Tau Pi Sigma,
national Signal corps,
honorary society, is
holding a smoker for
the basic signal corps
men of the unit on the
night of December 15th,
the second Tuesday aft-
er Christmas vacation.
Official moving pictures
will be shown and ex-
plained of the Signal
Corps during the war,
and of the signal corps
company during the
summer camp of 1928
and 1929. The latter
pictures were taken at
Fort Sheridan, Illinois,
and shows the signal
company as composed of
men from Illinois, Min-
nesota, Wisconsin and
Michigan. There are
several interesting fea-
tures of the picture, one
in particular will be the
fact that the men ex-
plaining the various
films were in the film it-
self.
While the smoker is intended expressly for signal
corps basis students, the chapter extends a cordial
invitation to any students or faculty members who
would be interested. The meeting will take place
in Rooms 314, 316, and 318 of the Michigan Union.
It is expected that there will be about two hundred
men present at this time.
Army and Navy Club
The Army and Navy club held its regular bi-
yearly meeting on December 13th. The speaker of
the evening was Col. Paul V. McNutt dean of the

FAMOUS ARCHITECTS
IN HISTORY
—Sir William Chambers
THE works of any great personage—diplomat,
scientist or artist—better serve to commemor-
ate him in his true capacity than the most
lengthy and detailed biography, or the most per-
sonal memoir. The essentials of his life's history,
as far as the succeeding generations are actively
concerned, consist of the
underlying causes for his
ultimate and consummate
effect upon human society
and the subsequent reac-
tions. These causes find
themselves most perfectly
expressed and most ac-
curately pagenated in the
resulting works of the in-
dividual. The study of the
code of Hammurabi, the
ancient law-giver, reveals
a complete and faithful
record of the basic ele-
ments in his wise and
fruitful life; the printing
press of Gutenburg, with
its crude and clumsy
mechanism, expresses the
very fundamental charac-
ter of the untrained, me-
dieval mind which created
it; and the Mona Lisa of
Da Vinci, that immortal
masterpiece, portrays in its light, almost divine
touch of life and beauty, the delicate, esthetic na-
ture of the artist. Thus, the architect, through the
workings of his genius as recorded in the resulting
buildings, finds his true biography and greatest
memorial.
The Somerset House
Sir William Chambers, the greatest of all Brit-
ish architects from the time of Wren, left to this
world an immense heritage of architecture, brim-
ming with his personality and his ideals. From
this rich legacy we gleam the more pertinent facts
of his life and character and discover distinguish-
ing traits rarely treated by biographers.
The imperial garden at Kew, with its imnumer-
able pavilions, pagodas, shelters and fountains,
was the first principle work of Chambers. From
an examination of this work, we see that he had
spent considerable time in
the Orient and had assimi-
lated a full measure of
eastern architecture for the
buildings betray a distinct
Chinese influence inter-
mixed with a western
classicism. Circular pa-
vilions, replicas of old Ro-
man temples and arched
bridges, although Renais-
sance in conception, were
modified by the invading
oriental element, produc-
ing an intricate type of de-
tail and a strange, mys-
terious character. His
youth, his lack of experi-
ence and education are all
well stamped on these
early works. He had the
touch of a child, untrained
and whimsical at play with
house building and gar-
dening, producting a fan-
tastic, fairy-like expression of his puerile mind. His
affinity for the eastern type of design he further
proved by publishing two very important papers,
"The Design of Chinese Buildings" and "A Dis-
sertation in Oriental Gardening'' which, to the pres-
ent day, remain as authentic works.

TO determine more easily the strength of

the balls under extremely severe conditions.
The balls are placed "three-in-line" to obtain
minimum contact areas.
On a one-inch ball the testing machine im-
poses a unit pressure of a million and a quarter
pounds per square inch before the crushing
load is reached!
Note, however, that under normal bearing
loads close-curvature raceways reduce this unit
stress approximately 420 percent and greatly
increase resisting capacity.
Add to this enormous strength the fact that
the friction-coefficient of a steel ball traveling
under heavy load is practically no greater than
that of starting . . . and you have some of the
reasons why New Departure Ball Bearings are
so often selected wherever utmost efficiency and
endurance are prime considerations.

The greater part of the buildings designed by
Chambers were for some governmental purpose,
indicating that he may have been the Royal Archi-
tect in good standing with the king. Such was the
case for he had known the king intimately since
youth, having instructed him in drawing and paint-
ing. His fascinating personality, both as artist and
man, had, from the first, attracted royal favor and
insured for him financial success as well as an un-
usual opportunity for architectural fame.
After having designed and erected several im-
portant imperial palaces, town halls and city man-
sions and having enjoyed an overwhelming popu-
larity in consequence, he set about on the greatest
project of his whole life—the Somerset House. In-
vestigating the principles involved in the design and
considering the motives that inspired them, we are
able to decipher the history of the second great
era of his life, the era of maturity. He had lost
that light and airy spirit of his youth, and settled
down into a state of conservatism and logical rea-
son. In this capacity he even exceeded his fellow-
architects who had tired of stiff traditionalism and
had declined into a spell of the over-elaborate and
the decadent. Chambers, however, clung tenacious-
ly to his ideal, remaining the last of a long line of
British architects who has stood for a simple, di-
rect and expressive interpretation of the Renais-
sance.
The Somerset House contained the governmental
offices of London and was required to portray some-
thing of the spirit of this function in the design.
This Chambers analyzed very ingeniously suc-
ceeded in producing a remarkable example of true
civic spirit. The building, with its powerful re-
straint and majestic propriety, signifies that British
Imperial principle of strength, glory and prosperity.
His choice of a modified Roman precedent rather
than the current Baroque style further imbibes into
the structure the feeling of masculine strength and
invulnerable power.
Numerous problems confronted the architects in
the Somerset House as can be seen from the un-
usual conditions of site and its relation to the
adjacent river. The grounds were of varying levels
and of irregular disposition, occasioning the intro-
duction of a system of stepped terraces and un-
aligned facades, which, when executed by the master
mind of Chambers solved the question to a nicety.
A heavily rusticated basement, surmounting the
terraces and elevating the main structure, cor-
rected a detrimental effect of the down-river per-
spective which would have made it appear as low
and insignificant. A view from Thames at a mile
distant now gives it an aspect of majesty and
grandeur and produces an interesting skyline in re-
lation to the Cathedral of St. Paul and the other city
churches. The facades of the building and especial-
ly the Strand front have the merit of possessing im-
posing solidity yet do not lack architectural trans-
parency, revealing the main disposition of the plan
and the varying importance of the many rooms.
This materially increases the significance of its own
formal harmony and makes it worthy of praises that
have been accorded it. The Strand elevation is one
of the smaller parts, the ensemble consisting of a
number of buildings, but the fine proportions and
the exquisite detail of this little unit has made it
famous in the history of architecture as one of the
immortal gems.
Writers of authority on architecture, since the
days of its construction, have conceded the Somer-
set House the title of the finest British civic build-
ing ever designed. It is Chambers' only bid to fame
in an architectural sense although he is known as a
fine writer and a fair artist. His great literary work
is the "Treatise on Civil Architecture" which still
remains a handbook of classic design and is known
by every architectural student throughout the
world. His ventures into the field of graphic arts
were not as successful as in literature but a few of
his drawings and paintings still exist serving to il-
lustrate his boundless ambition and his great versa-
tility.
His friends were many, both among the aristoc-
racy and the citizenry, for his amiable character in-
vaded everyone with whom he came in contact.
Upon his death in 1796 they bestowed upon him
the signal honor of a great civic funeral, laying him
to rest in Westminster Abbey. The public appre-
ciation of his sterling character and his brilliant
genius has never dwindled and in the future will
only grow greater, for his is the lasting kind of
fame.

Since its recent acquisition by the Architectural

Drawing," has enjoyed an increasing popularity among
the pen artists of the University. Its interest is not
only with architects but with illustrators and cartoon-

including all branches, in the field of pen and ink. Its
possession and use as either a text-hook or reference
is an asset to any art student, irrespective of his

AMONG those who have attained the heights
of engineering glory, Michigan has many sons
of whom she is justly proud. In every field
of engineering you may find them; and in the auto-
motive industry, especially, are illustrious names of
Michigan graduates to he found.
It is indeed difficult to select
any one engineer who has so
well acquitted himself in engi-
neering since graduation as to
be outstanding, not only from
the standpoint of present posi-
tion, but from the standpoint
of actual engineering accom-
plishment as well. However,
Michigan has one son of whom
she is more than proud, a man
who entered her portals as a
farm-bred boy, and after four
years of work worthy of a Tau
Beta Pi, left his Alma Mater
to become in a short time one
of the stellar lights in the auto-
motive firmament.
On October 1st, 1883, Edi-
son Hale Hunt and his wife,
Harriet Evelen (White) Hunt, proudly dusted off
the family Bible, and inscribed therein the name,
Ormond E. Hunt. Little did the inhabitants of the
farming town of Saranac, in Ionia county, Michi-
gan, suspect that the newest arrival among them
would one day prove to be a leading engineer in the 1
greatest organized industry that the world has ever
known.
Mr. Hunt's early training and education was re-
ceived in and around Saranac, until, at the age of
twenty, he journeyed to Ann Arbor, and there en-
Ormond E. Hunt
tered the University to study Mechanical Engineer-
ing. The professors who were upon the campus at
that time well remember the serious young man who
so well studied and passed the examinations given
him, and who won the signal honor of election to
Tau Beta Pit before his gradua-
tion in 1907.
Shortly after "graduation, Mr.
Hunt embarked upon his engi-
neering career, as materials man
with the George A. Fuller Com-
pany, to leave shortly after to
enter the employ of J. Rus-
sell Pope, the architect, with
whom he worked as Superin-
tendent of Construction. A year
later, he returned to his former
employer as Superintendent of
Construction, holding this posi-
tion until two years later, when
his first chance in the automo-
tive industry came, in the form
of a position in the drafting
room of the Packard Motor
Corporation.
From 1909 on, Mr. Hunt's
graphical progress is directly upward and Fate
seems to have ordained that his diligence be re-
warded by rapid and worthy promotion. With a
small initial position in the Packard organization,
Mr. Hunt started his automotive career by shortly
becoming the head of the drafting department, and
this proved to be a step toward the office of Body
Engineer, which he held until becoming Assistant
to the Vice-President in charge of engineering.
Not satisfied with this series of successful raises
in position, Mr. Hunt was soon promoted to As-

OXWELDING
PROVED BY TEST
Oxwelded pressure vessels constitute an outstanding
example of the results which can be obtained through
intelligent application of the oxy-acetylene process.
Introduction of oxy-acetylene welding into the pro-
duction of large pressure vessels has resulted in in-
creased dependability, and noteworthy contributions
to the knowledge of the best methods of design.
Never before has it been possible to test full size
pressure vessels actually to destruction. With oxwelded
construction, however, it has been possible to test each
design until the plate itself failed and to correct any
weaknesses discovered in design or materials. Test
pressures of three times the working pressure are
standard for oxwelded pressure vessels.
From time to time the oxy-acetylene industry is
in the market for technically trained men. It
offers splendid opportunities for advancement.

sistant to the Chief Engineer, a position which he
held until 1915, when he moved his interests to the
offices of the Chief Engineer in charge of the car-
riage division.
The advent of the war called Mr. Hunt from au-
tomotive to aeronautical interests, and he served his
country as Assistant to the District Manager of the
Bureau of Aircraft Production, stationed in Detroit.
The need of a new and efficient motive system for
aircraft proved to be the next engineering interest
of Mr. Hunt, and it was he who helped to develop
and build the justly famous Liberty Motor, holding
the position of Chief Engineer as an ultimate climax
to his wartime activities.
The Armistice made The World War a thing of
the past, and Mr. Hunt turned his engineering re-
sources and interests to the production of Mercer
Motors, acting as Chief Engineer of this company
during 1920 and 1921, ultimately becoming Vice-
President in charge of production.
Late in 1921, Mr. Hunt entered the services of
the Chevrolet Motors Corporation, his past experi-
ence and work obtaining for him the high position of
Chief Engineer, a position which he held until the
spring of 1929, when he resigned to accept promo-
tion to the office of Vice-President of the General
Motors Corporation, of which Chevrolet is a branch.
Although all his business interests lie in Detroit,
Mr. Hunt finds it advantageous to live near the
beauties and changeable weather of Ann Arbor, re-
siding in his beautiful home upon Geddes Road,
from which a short drive will take him to the spac-
ious and well kept greens of the Barton Hills Coun-
try Club. Besides his interest in slicing, hooking,
and putting, Mr. Hunt takes an active part in the
activities of the Detroit Athletic Club, and although
it is mixing business with pleasure, he still finds
motoring and automobiles a very interesting hobby.
Mr. Hunt married in 1910, and is the father of a
prospective engineer, and three daughters, Harriet,
Virginia, and Agnes. He remarried in 1929, and
between business and business trips, spends a quiet
life at home.
We are proud to find that Mr. Hunt wrote an
article for the Biggest and Best Engineering Maga-
zine in the spring of 1916, and it goes without say-
ing that his interest in the engineering college, and
its magazine has never waned.

Trying to pilot a plane without compass

as trying to pilot your course through

You find many a man after college
switching from job to job — "I

Fortunately most men have a natural
aptitude for one type of work rather

We are pleased to hear from Mr. R. R. Tinkham,
who is Superintendent of Lighthouses, with the

bered as the editor in chief of The Technic a num-
ber of years ago, when that organ enjoyed one of its
best periods. This old Grad is well able to criticise
the magazine, and his constructive criticisms, as
well as his compliments to make up, cover and ar-
rangement, are all welcome to the editorial staff
that is largely dependent upon the graph of monthly
circulation for judgment upon these matters.
Mr. Tinkham advises that there are numerous
opportunities in his line of work, some of which
should be especially interested to the graduating
engineers who have not yet made full plans for
the future. The technical stall is small, and the
chance for advancement is directly proportional to
the aptitude shown by the neophyte engineer.
Those interested in Mr. Tinkham's work, and in
his advice, are personally requested to write him at
Honolulu, Hawaii, or for general information, to the
U. S. Civil service, at Washington.

me some of the hours of the deepest and purest
satisfaction, I would say that Beebe's zest for ad-
venture, and romance is not unlike that of his young
contemporary. The great difference lies, of course,
in the worthy ends which unify and dignify Beebe's
sensational methods of observation. Personally, I
feel that he has so powerfully affected my imagi-
nation, that the world can never be the same to me
that it was before I read Galapagos, Edge of the
Jungle, Jungle Peace, and especially Beneath Tropic
Seas. The seas, the skies, the reeking jungle are all
forever transfigured and transformed. I wonder if
anyone has so perfectly recorded the impressions
and sensations experienced in flight over jungle and
mountain as he has in A Seashore a Mile Up. And
even in the swift rush of his plane, he always some-
how keeps one aware of the limitless sweep of the
processes of nature.
"Even in the brief glimpses allowed me I had
caught sight of dark-mouthed caverns and deep-cut
crevices. And I thought of the time, millennums
ago when any evening among these same mountains
would echo the call of the giant owls whose bones
now lie in the cavern debris. And I visualized these
mighty eagle-like owls pouncing upon the prehis-
toric foliage; and then came to my mind's eye the
strange, unwieldy ground sloths which we know
lived there. What would I not give in exchange for
five minutes of co-existence with them!"
On almost every page one finds some expression
of the wonder and awe he feels as he contemplates
evidences of the miracle of the evolutionary proc-
ess. In suggesting a study of the development
of the embryo in a hens' egg, he says:
"If a New World was adumbrated by Columbus'
balanced egg, perhaps a new sphere of interest may
emanate from yours. Look within the shell with as
much awe as you feel when you gaze up at the
stars, or when you enter holy ground, whether
Buddhist, Mohammedan or Christian. For in the
latter case you are concerned with centuries of hu-
man efforts at sincerity, the stars lead your eyes
through billions of miles of space, and the embryo
in the hen's egg opens a vista to millions of years
in the past.
"When, in the midst of the tiny coagulation, you
can detect the primitive streak, you have seen one
of the real wonders of the world—a structure which
links birds, animals, man himself, with the lowliest
of jelly fish. Then, day by day, watch the new
characters develop—the increase of segments from
the first to the thirty-sixth, the great elliptical eyes,
and the Third Cyclopean eye. So strange is the
embryo in shape that it is difficult to consider it as
a living thing until suddenly one day the palpitat-
ing heart is discovered, and we know that in spite
of all the paddle-shaped hands and feet, the gills,
the astonishingly long tail and beakless mouth, that
eventually a fluffy, yellow chick will evolve and
emerge from the shell.
"When we have followed this marvel through the
short three weeks of embryonic life, and realize that
every bird in the world, from hummingbird to
ostrich, has passed through identical stages, we re-
turn to a singing wood thrush with new compre-
hension and appreciation."
It is because studies like those of Fabre and
Beebe, whom I have used merely as examples of
the new humanists in the field of science, stir my
imagination, enlarge my world, deepen my sense of
reverence in the presence of wonders I cannot fully
grasp,—it is because they thus change me and my
feeling and appreciation of the world, that I get
from them something of the same pleasure and
deep satisfaction that I find in reading the best
poetry.
For those who wish to orient themselves with
reference to the new theories which are developing
in the various sciences, I would suggest first the
need for some survey book which will give the per-
spective and feeling for the background against
which to project these new ideas. The very best
book of the sort I have found is one by a brilliant
young professor at Tufts College whom I chanced
to meet two years ago, just as his book was coming
from the press. The Seven Seals of Science by Joseph
Mayer traces the development of the sciences,
showing that they form a well defined structure
with mathematics at the bottom; and that each later
science was built upon those that went before, that
psychology is only now in process of becoming es-
tablished, and that the social studies if they are to
be worthy of the name of science must build upon
the natural sciences. It is well worth a careful
reading. Tivo Thousand Years of Science by R. J.
Harvey Gibson is also a useful book for reference
although it is much less coherent and much more
difficult to read.
As an aid to an understanding of the new hypo-
theses which are so completely changing our think-
ing regarding the physical world, I have found
The Nature of the Physical World by Professor U. S.
Eddington of the University of Cambridge most
helpful. In all honesty, I should admit that a great
deal of the new sciences is quite beyond me as yet,
but such books as Professor Eddington's are as-
sisting me in my effort to adjust myself to ideas
which still seem quite fantastic. Bertrand Russell
has also done much to interpret, in a popular form,
some of the new concepts. His A,B,C, of Relativity
may throw some light on the Einstein theory for
those to whom Eddington's exposition may be some-
what too technical.

tendant with the operation of gasoline engines on
small cruisers and tenders. Gasoline vapor is about
four times as heavy as air and creeps down into the
bilge where it lies until an open flame ignites it.
One company which was very much interested re-
ported that out of a shipment of ten such boats last
year, six had already been blown up or burned
due to gasoline leaks. It would also require only
one fuel on Diesel powered ships for both Diesel
engines and its various tenders and auxiliaries.
A new type of engine, having the advantage of an
expansion ratio somewhat greater than its com-
pression ratio, has been undergoing test and de-
velopment.
A series of mufflers were tested for quietness and
power losses on a well known low-priced engine.
With the help of some quick acting clamps and a
big pair of asbestos mittens a red hot muffler could
be removed and replaced by a different one with-
out stopping, or in any way changing the engine
operation. We could then be sure that a change in
the power output was due to the muffler change,
which could be made in a few seconds.
A series of engine performance tests were made
for a bus manufacturing company to settle a slight
disagreement between them and the engine builder.
This was interesting in that the engine was so large
it placed a 50% overload on our largest dynamo-
meter.
A new type of manifold heating is now being
studied and developed for a well known low-priced
car. It seems to offer a real improvement under
certain operating conditions. Other phases might
be discussed if space permitted.
Students who have had training in the "cow-
shed" may be found in every major experimental
research laboratory in the automotive industry.
Work of this nature provides the student a practical
background which gives him a good start on a job
in the experimental test department, the usual en-
trance to most engineering organizations of the in-
dustry.
The laboratory building is poor. The test appa-
ratus is good, but subject to serious depreciation in
such poor housing. The operating equipment may
be anything we wish. The industry has been so
generous that we have been obliged to discourage
gifts and loans for lack of suitable housing. When
it snows out of doors for a day, it rains in the auto
laboratory for a week—as the snow melts on the

lowered about six inches. This six inch "well" pro-
vides leg room by allowing the rear seat passengers
to put their feet under the front seat. This is in-
convenient, but necessary, if more than two passen-
gers are to be carried in such a small car. In some
models of the Austin, the rear seat provides room
for children or luggage but not for adults. When
the wheelbase is 100 inches or more, leg room is
not such a problem, although the narrow tread
often limits the capacity to two passengers per seat.
Much progress is being made in this direction, a
great deal of it through American influence. The
writer recently rode in a small Opel (German) ex-
perimental car. This car, a former product of the
Opel Motor Works, recently acquired by General
Motors, had sufficient room for a person six feet
tall in either front or rear seats, and w-ould carry
three persons in fair comfort on the rear seat. Its
wheelbase has approximately 100 inches and its
tread about 50 inches. This room was achieved
without the use of wells, and on a chassis powered
by a six cylinder engine.
Body construction is featured by an attempt to
achieve extreme lightness. Fabric bodies have been
very popular, but are passing out of use in favor of

wood and steel and all-steel construction. At the
recent Paris Salon only about eight or nine models
had fabric bodies. Interior appointments are usual-
ly very simple, especially in the cars of the Austin
class. Cars of the Renault size are likely to be
quite luxurious, but on many the equipment is al-
most negligible.
Probably the most interesting thing about the
small European car is its midget power plant. These
power plants are often not even in scale with the
size of the car they power. To the American mo-
torist, accustomed to lifting the hood and finding
the space underneath well rilled, it is something of
a shock to find in the European car an engine which
the American disdainfully calls "wheelbarrow-size".
It is for economic reasons, which will be discussed
later, that such small power plants are used.
We find that in the very small cars there are en-
gines of one, two, four and six cylinders with piston
displacements ranging from 21 cubic inches on the
one cylinder CM. (French) to 149 cubic inches on
the Citroen C-4.
Considering first the Austin ''Seven" motor,
which powers what is probably the most popular
car in England, it is found that it has a bore of 2.2",
and a stroke of 3", which gives a piston displace-
ment of 45 cubic engines in its four cylinder, L-
Head engine. This engine has a "Treasury rating"
of 7.8 horsepower and develops a maximum of 10.5
brake horsepower at 2400 R.P.M. Its most unique
feature is the use of roller bearings on its two bear-
ing crankshaft.
The two-cylinder, opposed engine of the A.BM.C.
(English) has a rating of 12 horsepower and de-
velops 40 horsepower at 3500 R.P.M. with a bore of
2.7'" a stroke of 3.6", and a piston displacement of
80 cubic inches. It also has a roller bearing crank-
shaft. This engine has a tendency to be very
"rough" and to "whip" severely at certain speeds.
Its top speed is rather high and it is designed for
use in a 102" wheelbase chassis for sport use.
The data available on the one cylinder CM. is
very incomplete, but it is of the air-cooled type,
bore 2.83", stroke 3.34", with a displacement of 21
cubic inches. It is used in a 78" wheelbase car,
which is popular in France.
The Singer (English) engine has a four cylinder,
2.2" by 3.4" engine of 52 cubic inches displacement.
"Treasury rating" is 7.8 horsepower while the max-
imum developed horsepower is 16.5 at 3200 R.P.M.
The Citroen (French) four cylinder design con-
forms closely to American engine practice. It is a
2.83" by 3.93", 149 cubic inch engine of nine rated
horsepower, developing 30 brake horsepower at
3000 R.P.M. It powers what is probably the most
popular of the French cars.
The Opel (German) four cylinder car is very sim-
ilar in its characteristics to the four cylinder
Citroen. Its 2.36" by 3.54", 62 cubic inch engine
develops a maximum of 16 horsepower.
The Renault Monasix is a six cylinder, 2.28" by
3.57", 90 cubic inch engine rated at 12.5 horsepower
and developing about 35 horsepower. It powers
what is probably the most popular light six in
France.
The compression ratio used in these small en-
gines varies between 4.5 and 5.5 to 1, and the aver-
age is slightly higher than American light car en-
gine practice. As is indicated by the examples
given, the engines are very small, the high power
output being obtained by running them faster than
our average practice. Most of our four cylinder
engines peak at 2000 to 2400 R.P.M. while Conti-
nental practice is to peak them at about 3000 R.P.M.
This high rotative speed is not conducive to dur-
ability. It must be remembered, though, that the
average small European car does not receive more
than one-half the mileage received by our average
small car in the same period of time.
The transmission systems of these small cars are
generally of the four-speed type, especially in
France. English light cars are nearly evenly di-
vided hit heir use of the three and four speed trans-
missions. At present the four-speed gearbox is
rapidly gaining in favor. The real reason for such
extensive use of the four-speed sets is the low avail-
able engine power. To make the best use of this
power, a four-speed gearbox is almost a necessity.
The differentials of these cars are generally of the
bevel gear type, although spiral bevel gear is rapid-
ly coming into use. The chief disadvantage of the
plain bevel type is its noisy, rough operation; how-
ever, it is easier to machine.
The braking systems in use are almost univers-
ally of the four-wheel, internal expanding of in-
ternal shoe type. In this respect the European
manufacturer may be said to have a slight edge on
the American light car builders, in that he has bet-
ter protected his braking system.
In general, the chassis weight of these cars aver-
ages about half the weight of American cars in a
similar division. The Austin is one of the lightest:
it weighs only 900 pounds.
The general performance of these small cars is
really quite remarkable, when the fuel economy ob-
tained in considered. The Austin "Seven" will go
about 45 miles per gallon of gasoline and will at-
tain a top speed of from 40 to 45 miles per hour.
The other cars have very similar performance char-
acteristics, dependent of course, upon weight, de-
sign and horsepower output. The two cylinder

Three 160 H.P. CP Diesel Engines Direct Connected to CP Vertical Air Compressors
LYONS and Slattery, Inc., well-known contractors, started work early in
1929 on a section of the Eighth Avenue Subway extension under Grand
'Concourse, Bronx. The power plant, located in Poe Park, is shown in
the illustration above and consists of three CP Diesel Engines, 160 H.P. each,
direct connected to CP Vertical Air Compressors. This equipment was pur-
chased as a result of conclusive evidence, submitted from the records of other
CP Diesel Engine users, that such an installation would effect a saving over
purchased electric power sufficient to pay for the entire plant within a short
time. The purchaser has expressed complete satisfaction with its performance.
The plant is surrounded by apartment houses and operates so quietly that it
has created much favorable comment.
If you want quiet, dependable, low-cost power let us tell you more about

A.B.C. sport car has a top speed of about 60 miles
per hour and can go 30 miles on a gallon. The
Renault Monasix is a very smoothly performing
car. Its performance characteristics equal or sur-
pass those of some of our light cars.
The price range of these small cars is from one to
one and a half times that of American cars of a
similar comparative class. Without question, if
these cars were put on a real production basis, they
could be sold for less than American cars, for their
material cost is low. With American car character-
istics as they are, the American manufacturer may
still continue to invade the foreign market and sell
his products, even at the higher price caused by
very high tariffs, for at the same price, the Ameri-
can car offers more in comfort and performance.
Durability of the small American car is better than
that of the European small car, even though the op-
posite is true in the high-priced car class.
Now that we have seen that the small European
car presents such an interesting contrast to what
the American public is pleased to call its small cars,
it is apropos to present some of the reasons for this
striking difference. A knowledge of these reasons
helps to temper an}- decision one may make, re-
garding the relative progress being made in auto-
motive development on the two continents. The
factors entering into or causing this contrast are
largely economic, the chief among them are fuel
cost, license costs, and production costs.
Fuel cost is one of the major reasons why the
low-priced car is so small. Practically all the gaso-
line fuel used in Europe must be imported. By the
time the fuel has gone through the necessary cus-
toms payments, and shipping charges have been
added to the initial cost of purchase at some Rus-
sian field, the cost per gallon has become almost
prohibitive. The cost per gallon averages from 35
to 60 cents, depending upon the country in which it
is purchased. This alone is enough to cause the
building of the very small cars which are most
popular all over the continent. For, leaving com-
fort out of consideration, it is very poor economy to
drive a car weighing 3000 pounds around when a
car weighing 1000 pounds will do the same work.
Since engine size decreased with car size, the small
car was a logical step toward lower fuel costs, for
maximum fuel economy is obtained when the en-
gine is working under three-quarters to full load,
and this condition is found in the small car powered
with a small engine.

From small shops to vast factories . . . from
blacksmith's forge to six-ton electric furnaces
... from Joule's theory of heat to superheat...
from guesswork to science . . . from waste to
economy—these hint the revolution in indus-
try since 1855.
The growth of Crane Co. through these years is a
significant reflection of the growth of all indus-
try. From a one-man shop founded three-
quarters of a century ago, it has grown to a
world organization, meeting in its own factories
the power and production problems that have
faced other manufacturers. Supplying the pip-
ing materials that have released power, effected
economies, and increased production every-
where, it has of necessity met and solved pip-
ing problemsastheyhavearisen inall industries.
Now in its 75th anniversary year, it serves all
industries with the materials developed, the
knowledge and experience gained. To engineer-
ing students, its customers of the future, it offers

Upon returning to school this fall, the students of
the Engine School found the second floor hall of the
West Engineering Building transformed into an in-
door skating elysium. Many of the returning stu-
dents, uninformed concerning the treacherously
slippery surface of the new skating pond, embarked
unwittingly down its glassy course, only to discover
themselves experiencing a sensation very similar to
that of the pedestrian who steps on the time-honored
banana peel.
The B. &amp; G. boys are to be congratulated upon so
closely approaching the ideal frictionless surface.
Here, at last, Engineering Mechanics instructors
have a concrete example of a perfectly smooth sur-
face, which might be put to good use in demonstra-
tions before E. M. 1 classes.
We assume that the ulterior motive behind the
construction of this beautiful terrazzo floor is to
awaken students on their way from one class to an-
other. Imagine the half-awake student, on his way

ting out of control. We knew of no more effective
method of making one fully awake.

The Small European Car
(Continued from page 30)
The cost of licenses must be considered when
buying a car for use on the continent. Our license
charges are insignificant, when compared to those
in most European countries. For instance, in Mich-
igan, the license cost on a 2500 pound car, let us say
a Chevrolet sedan, is about $13.00. In England, a
license for the same car would cost about $125.00
for the license charge is a pound sterling per rated
horsepower. This rated horsepower, known as the
"Treasury rating," corresponds very closely to our
N.A.C.C. rating. In France there is a similar con-
dition of excessively high taxation. This naturally
has led to the use of engines of very small bore and
stroke, for the rating is determined as a function of
the bore and number of cylinders. The use of such
small engines has naturally limited the size of the
cars in which they could be used.
Production costs are the final measure of how
much can be purchased for a given amount. No-
where is this more true than in the automotive in-
dustry. Admitting that the size of the car must
be governed by the above factors, the production
costs are the thing controlling the cost of the car.
Searching into this question, it is found that the
cost of the small European car is much above any-
thing that is paid in America for an equally good,
larger, and usually a superior product and that,
therefore, the production costs must be higher than
in America. They are, and for one principal reason.
This reason is that quantity production has been at-
tempted by only a few makers. Citroen, Renault,
Austin, Opel, and Morris are the most outstanding
examples of comparatively large scale production
cars. Upon investigation, it is found that the yearly
output of any one of a group, comprising about
ninety percent of the European manufacturers, is
less than the daily output of either of our two lead-
ing makers. In fact, the yearly output of many
makers is numbered in the hundreds. Let it suffice
to say that the combined output of the 150 odd
manufacturers of cars in Europe is only about 15
percent of the output of our 30 odd companies.
Chevrolet alone in 1929 produced twice as many
cars as were produced by all the European makers
in 1928.
It is a known fact that the automobile is a maker
of wealth, and that consequently the standard of
living is raised by it. That its effect has not been
felt to any great extent in the European countries
is shown by the statement of a woman prominent
in foreign circles. In her conversation with an
American, she is reported to have said, "What!
You allow your workingmen to drive and own
cars?" It is so over most of Europe. The ordinary
working man cannot afford to own a car, for the
wage scale is not sufficiently high, or the car cost
sufficientcly low. If the wage scale is to be higher,
the manufacturer must sell more cars, so he can
produce more economically. If the wage scale is
raised the working man can buy cars, so that the
answer to the whole problem is one of production.
Quantity production will spell the death of many
small makers, but it will mean better cars and a
better standard of living. It is not too great a
prophecy to make, that within a few years, the
larger European makers will show more markedly
the fruits of their copying of American production
methods and their purchases of American produc
tion machinery, and their slogan will also be
"Adopt, adapt, and product."

The braking system is quite complete. The foot
brake, which operates on all four wheels, is of the
internal hydraulic type. The braking effort is di-
vided, so that the front brakes take 60% of the
duty and the rear brakes the remaining 40%. The
hand brake is of the internal mechanical type and
is applied on the rear wheels only. This emergency
brake is placed well forward, and in the center of
the floor in the front of the car. The front seat is
adjustable, fore and aft, and the steering column is
adjustable vertically. The car is equipped with four
Houdaille shock absorbers, which add to the riding
comfort considerably.
Due to the absence of the drive shaft found on
all rear-drive cars, it is possible to keep the height
of the car top down to surprising low height of 58
to 61 inches. This not only gives the car distinctive
lines, but also keeps the location of the center of
mass low,—one of the many safety features of this
unique front-drive car. These exclusive advantages
in safety, easy handling, comfort and durability
have already won a host of friends for the new Cord,
and in the words of E. L. Cord, President of the

statement of fact that this car requires no selling

forthcoming and may soon, with its brisk, clean strokes
under the hand of the master, dominate the field of
smaller work. The pen is well suited to the larger
drawings also, in his opinion, but requires a height of
skill rarely attained by the average delineator engaged
in architectural presentation. The clever suggestions
and little tricks of penmanship that the student is ever
seeking are well represented and serve as the most
valuable feature of the whole volume.
There seems to be in Ellwood's conception of the
art, no necessity to discriminate between that which
is required of the architect illustrating his design and
that which is the result of a summer's sketching in the
field. Surely, somewhere there is a line to be drawn
between the conventional, stiff-handed, office methods
of delineation and the free, recreational spirit of the
note-book version. Both types are pre-requisites to
the accomplished draftsman and should certainly be
taught as a means toward that end, but if the difference
between the two extremes is not thoroughly under-
stood, confusion will probably ensue through a un-
desirable combination. With a grain of salt and a
lookout for this fallacy, the contents of the book are
very digestible and should induce a keen appreciation
for the pen art both as an architectural instrument and
as a pleasant diversion.

from the 25-gallon tank is supplied by two vacuum
tanks and a vacuum pump driven off the rear of the
campshaft.
Power plant mounting is also quite unconven-
tional, being of the five-point type. At the front
the two engine legs rest on U-shaped diagonal
braces between the radiator cross-member and the
frame, insulated by means of rubber washers. Rear
engine legs on the bell housing attach to brackets
riveted to frame side members, but in such manner
that attachment serves mainly to stiffen the frame.
Further examination of the chassis reveals a
three-quarter floating rear axel, a three-speed syn-
cromesh transmission, and a two plate clutch. The
motor is of cleaner design and the chassis is finely
finished, the running gear being ground and

Accurate Control of Materials
INDUSTRY today demands closer and closer control of every
operation and every material employed in manufacturing. The
specially developed Bausch and Lomb Metallographic Equipment
illustrated above affords microscopic precision in the observation
and photography of metal or other opaque specimens. It gives finer,
more accurate results than were ever possible before.
In developing such special optical equipment to speed production
and increase precision in many different fields, Bausch and Lomb
have contributed largely to modern industrial progress.
Your own production problems may be open to solution through
some special optical instrument. Bausch and Lomb scientists will
gladly cooperate in developing it.

Indiana Law school, and former national com-
mander of the American Legion. Because of the
demand made by members and their friends, it was
decided to hold the main talk of the evening in
Natural Science auditorium to accommodate the
crowd expected. Col. McNut gave a very interest-
ing discussion of Naval armaments, and the coming
conference to be held in England in January. The
talk proved very popular, and the speaker remained
fully an hour receiving the congratulations of the
audience, and answering questions they had in
mind. Professor Hobbs, the president of the local
organization, extends to anyone interested in Na-
tional Preparedness, a cordial invitation to attend
the next meeting of the club. This meeting will be
held in the latter part of February, the definite date
will be announced later.

Scabbard and Blade
Scabbard and Blade, national military society,
held its annual fall initiation on Saturday, Decem-
ber 14th. The following men were taken into the
society at this time:
P. A. Kunkle, J. A. Rye, D. W. Hickox, W. J.
Bird, B. W. Johnson, W. H. Fouch, N. E. Haase,
W. G. Gordon, W. M. Duckwitz, C. W. Johnson,
Jr., J. E. Lester, G. L. Johnson, R. D. Gordon, Keith

The initiation banquet was not held on Sunday,
as is the usual custom—it was decided to hold it
later on.

Phi Lambda Upsilon
The Honorary Scholastic Chemical Society, Phi
Lambda Upsilon, has been carrying out a fairly in-
tensive program this fall holding its regular meet-
ings once a month at which various members of the
Faculty have spoken. Considerable interest has
been evidenced by the members and several very
splendid meetings have been enjoyed. Election to
membership is on the basis of scholarship alone and
at the beginning of the second semester the names
of those chosen this year will be announced. Mem-
bers are selected from both the students of chem-
istry and of chemical engineering so a goodly
number of chemical engineers are included in its
ranks. The Society also offers a scholarship of
fifty dollars to the student of Junior standing who
has the highest rank in scholarship in Chemistry.
For the past two years the award has been given to
an engineer of which fact we can well be proud. The
officers of the organization for this year, include:
H. Y. Jennings President
R. C. Gibson Vice President
Albert Hershberger Secretary
C. S. Hart Treasurer
A. I. E. E.
On Tuesday afternoon, December 10th, about 30
Juniors. Seniors and Faculty members of the Elec-
trical Department left to inspect the new Delray
Plant of the Detroit Edison Company. The new
plant, which is the very latest in design has been
explained in detail in an early issue of the Technic.
After the inspection trip was over, and the members
of the party from Ann Arbor had succeeded in find-
ing one Bernard M. Cain, better known in Engineer-
ing Circles as "Barney" Cain, they proceeded to a
banquet held in the Service Building of the De-
troit Edison Company. Alex Dow, the president of
the Detroit Edison Company addressed the society
in the auditorium of the same building following the
banquet. At this talk, he gave the reasons for vari-
ous details of design, that are considered, by some,
as being rather unique, in view of the modern ten-
dency towards larger units at high pressure and
temperatures. One interesting detail, that perhaps
has not been stressed in the article on the Delray
plant, was explained—namely that of the smoke
stacks. Mr. Dow said that he had received more
comment on the smoke stacks, and their design, than
on all the rest of the interesting details put to-
gether. The reason he gave for their unique contour
was the fact that they "just looked nicer than plain
smoke stacks."
Professor Lovell will address the next meeting
of the A.I.E.E. His subject will be on his recent
trip to Europe. This will be ladies' night for the
society. The meeting will be held in Detroit.

and excellent equipment
although the third is frequently over-
looked by those who acclaim.
Though rarely so spectacular,
records in the fields of science and
industry require the same char-
acteristics. They are equally mile-
stones of progress . . . the index
of advancement.

National Committees of forty-seven countries includ-
ing all the great States, joined the movement.
The World Power Conference, with its three official
languages, English, French and German, forms another
bond of peace between the nations.
The first Plenary Conference held in 1924, fully ap-
preciated the desired aims. To it is due the clear and
concise manner in which they were formulated.
The modern world is faced with four groups of
problems:
1. Engineering.
Available power is to be found stored up by nature
in concentrated form in coal, in oil, and in natural gas,
while continually the sun is providing new sources of
waterpower. Mankind utilises these sources of chemical
and physical energy in order to generate heat from
prepared fuel, and power to drive machinery. The out-
put from these sources of developed power is now used
in one form or another in every industry, in locomo-
tion, and in the home. Power, in fact, is now distributed
in an ever-widening radius, traversing frontiers, and
even passing from one continent to another. Power
developed in one place is utilised in another to generate
power in a new form. Power produces clothing, food,
light and heat. Power transports us, our goods and our
thoughts. Power lengthens and enriches our lives:
The minimum waste of power, the most reliable
methods for its utilisation, and the broadest field of
application, these are the aims of the power engineer.
2. Economics.
The more widespread the generation, distribution and
utilisation of power, the greater is the demand for
highly skilled workers, and the greater the demand for
and the reward gained by capital. Every year the
demand for power increases. Rationalisation and
mechanisation speedily promote the demand for mach-
inery, tools and furnaces, for all of which power is
necessity. The world market for power is offering ever
wider opportunities, and in addition, is providing a
fruitful field of investment for capital. Dividends and

of the Society. On December 2, Mr. C. E. Eveleth
who is the Vice President of the General Electric
Company gave a very interesting talk before a
large audience on "Human Relations in Corporate
Industry." Mr. Eveleth is a very engrossing speak-
er and through his connection with such a large firm
as General Electric was able to present a very splen-
did talk.
The Student Branch also sent a delegate to the
Annual Convention of the Great Lakes Section of
The Institute which was held in Chicago on Decem-
ber 2, 3, and 4. W. C. Doane, 30E, represented the
local chapter and reported a very interesting and
instructive trip. In addition to the various meet-
ings, trips of inspection to various power houses,
telephone exchanges, and the like were held. Rep-
resentatives of all the Student Branches Were there
so Doane was able to bring back a great deal of
helpful material.
o
A. S. M. E.
The Mechanicals and their faculty held their an-
nual r. f. in the form of a banquet on Wednesday
night, January 11th, at Lane Hall Tavern.
Byron Wells, (of Michigan Theater Fame),
held the post of Toastmaster, after the food had
been duly demolished.
Although the program referred to him as the
"Timer", we think some of his points needed clean-
ing.
"Supercharger" Cheney, the first speaker, got off
a joke that we hadn't heard lately, and then offered
a brief review of the activities of the student
branch of the A. S. M. E.
"Hotshot" Hawley, the second speaker, gave a
brief history of the student branch, and then told a
little ditty that our. grandfathers used to laugh at.
Professor Anderson, down on the program as
"Detonation", modestly explained that he was "the
big noise", and then gave the boys the dope on the
representatives of industrial concerns who come
here in the spring to interview Seniors who are in-
terested in employment. These men are all men
of wide experience, and "Andy" hopes that all grad-
uating Seniors will avail themselves of the oppor-
tunities to talk to them.
After Prof. Boston had taken care of the "Ex-
haust" in the form of some very interesting mate-
rial on the annual meeting of the A. S. M. E., which
was held in New York last fall, and Dean Sadler
had set forth "Controls", a philosophical treatment
of the problems of the engineer of today, Professor
Hobbs showed himself to be a remarkable "Fender".
He produced a remarkable collection of slides,
which depicted experiences on arctic expeditions,
both his own and others. He demonstrated very
clearly the great difference in arctic exploration
methods of yesterday and today, since the advent
of the airplane. The talk which accompanied the
showing of the slides proved very informative.

wages derived from the supply of power are dependant
upon the development of the market for power. These
markets produce new capital and provide fresh oppor-
tunities for the employment of labor.
The opening of new markets for power, the im-
provement of such markets so as to provide a profitable
field for investment; these are the aims of the power
economists.
3. Administration.
High voltage lines for electric power, high pressure
mains for gas and oil, and express railless transport by
motor-cars and aeroplanes offer limitless fields for the
utilisation of power. The industrial users of power
become freer in the choice of their factory sites. The
decentralization of the population into rural areas, with
all its attendant benefits for body and mind, is facili-
tated. Power is at the service of all. It knows no bar-
riers. State problems and problems of power economy
are linked up.
Wise legislation, the protection of health and the
more extended use of power; these are the aims of
power administration.
4. Education.
Power resources harnessed to human needs are used
night and day by every individual. He does not always
understand them. He has to learn to control them and
to use them to the best advantage in every human
activity. He must learn to value power economy and
power engineering as the very basis of his civilisation.
New aims to be achieved must not only be demonstrated
but understood. Engineering science is the science of
civilization. The pure science of to-day is the engi-
neering science of to-morrow.
To make mankind of to-day the wise ruler of his
soulless servant; to fuse technical and human education
into one harmonious whole; these are the aims of the
new education.
Power Distribution and Utilisation.
The generation of Power by Water and Fuels was
the principal subject considered at the Sectional Con-
ferences in Basle (1926), London (1928), Barcelona
(1929), and Tokyo (1929). The most prominent fea-
tures to be dealt with at the forthcoming Second Plen-
ary Conference in Berlin will be the Distribution and
Utilisation of Power.
Power Resources of the World.
Valuable data concerning the power resources of the
world and the best methods of developing them for
the benefit of mankind, have been prepared as the

result of previous conferences, and are to be found in
various publications.
Water Power.
Irrigation and the extension of canal systems open
up vast and hitherto undeveloped areas. The power
derived from and required by such undertakings pro-
motes and cheapens the supply of power. All the latest
developments with regard to the extension and utilisa-
tion of water power and water storage, recent develop-
ments in the construction of storage reservoirs, water
turbines and pumps, and experience in matters concern-
ing the financial side, are contained in the Transactions
of the various meetings of the World Power Confer-
ence. The program of the Second Plenary World
Power Conference will include papers on new methods
of organisation with a view to the most economical con-
struction of plant and the most economical conditions
of operation, such as are afforded by combined opera-
tion, on the financing of such schemes by special credits,
on the influence of legislation and government policy
regarding water power development (taxation and sub-
sidies, etc.)
Fuels.
The 1930 Conference will treat this complex of
problems with special reference to the distribution of
fuels among their various possible uses. Questions
which will be dealt with include the coal mining in-
dustry as a basis for national gas supply, the close
connection between gas and its by products in both
regard to production and disposal, particularly in re-
spect of coke, and the influence of turnover on the price
level of gas and coke, and on the cost of producing gas.
Discussions on the important technical and economic
questions affecting the distribution of, especially over
long distances, will prove of great interest. On the
subject of liquid fuels papers are expected on the trans-
port and distribution of gas, on oil mixtures and ad-
mixtures, on the selection of liquid fuel for petrol and
heavy oil engines, on the latest technical and economic
experiences with Diesel engines in electricity works,
etc.
IV—Subjects for Discussion
The development of Power Supply and Power Utili-
sation is the main subject around which discussion will
centre at the 1930 Conference.
Progress may be looked for in such directions as:
New Fields for the Application of Power.
Efficient Utilisation of Generating Plants and Dis-
tribution Networks.
Improvement of Load Factor.
Storage of Power.
Advantageous interconnection of different Power
Producing Plants.
Large Central Plants and Large Power Distribution

RESEARCH
A manufacturing company, like an individual, never stands
still. It must constantly seek ways to improve its products or
it will soon start to go backward.
Allis-Chalmers has made it a policy never to be satisfied
with designing and building good machines. They must be built
better. Not only are exhaustive tests made to bring out any
weaknesses in design or construction and to get data on opera-
tion of machines before they are offered to the public but con-
tinuous study and field tests bring out points where further
improvements may be made.
Working with the manufacturing and engineering depart-
ments and supplementing their work are research engineers
whose duty it is to develop new kinds of iron and steel, insula-
tion for electrical machinery, and other materials that will give
to Allis-Chalmers power, electrical and industrial machinery
longer life and trouble-free service.

haustive study and investigation of
scientific manufacturing problems crit-
ical to the progress of forward look-
ing industries.
Through this Department the manu-
facturer may secure the service of
trained scientists, special laboratories,
library facilities and testing equipment
of exceptional sort, and the sustained
and thorough quality of research work
which is to be found in a great uni-
versity.
Under the present generous patent
arrangements, clients of the Depart-
ment may, by the payment of a some-
what higher service charge, secure the
benefits to be derived from all inven-
tions, patents and patenable processes
resulting from the investigations made
in their behalf.
All problems submitted to the De-
partment should be addressed to the
Director. Such problems will be care-
fully studied and only those will be
undertaken in which it is felt that the
Department may be of service to the
prospective client. The regular service
charge for such work is thirty per cent,

The Blue Ribband
The Mythical Speed Trophy for Atlantic Vessels
By IVAIV J. WANLESS, '30E
THE present position of the LTnited States in
the matter of Trans-Atlantic transportation is
not one to fill the people of our nation with
pride. The trend, however, is to improve this con-
dition, and the reasons are entirely logical. In
transacting the ma-
jority of the busi-
ness, and supplying
the greater part of
the passengers, it
is only just that
the United States
should lead in fa-
cilities for ocean
transportati o n;
however, of the
first - class Trans-
Atlantic passengers
about 7 8% are
American and of
the c a b i n-c lass
about 76%. Of this
total number only
12% are carried in
American vessels.
The reason for this is fairly obvious. About
1820, in the days of the "clipper ships," American
built and operated vessels carried over 89% of all
foreign, and especially, European trade. The ad-
vent of the steamship, and the replacement of steel
for wood construction, arrived at the same time the
A VIEW FROM THE AIR OF
AIRPLANE CARRIER. THE
MARINE POWER HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED IN THE SHIP
TO MAKE IT THE HIGHEST-POWERED, AND THE FASTEST
SHIP AFLOAT.
Westward movement began. Investors were able,
then, to get a much higher rate of interest on
internal investments, and consequently the amount
of capital invested in shipping decreased. The for-
eign nations, especially Britain and Germany, devel-
oped large mer-
chant fleets and ob-
tained a bulk of the
traffic until in 1910
only 8% was car-
ried in American
ships. The World
War f o ii n d the
United States to-
tal 1 y unprepared,
and then, to fill the
needs of a mer-
chant fleet, when
that of other coun-
tries was diverted,
a shipping board
was formed which
built an emergency
fleet to meet the
shortage of ships.
Even with this extra tonnage suddenly added, post-
war found us in a condition which was almost as
bad as before, since the vessels built during the
war were all small, and relatively slow. Recently,
Congress began to realize the seriousness of the
situation and passed the Jones-White Merchant
THE U. S. S. LEXINGTON, AN
LATEST DEVELOPMENTS IN

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Marine Bill, to aid ship owners in the construction
of their ships. This bill provided funds, making;
it possible for the owners to borrow money up to
three-quarters value of the ship, for purpose of
construction, at low interest, and also gave in-
creased compensation for mail-carrying, placing a
bonus on high speeds and large displacements.
Besides the Jones-White Bill, Congress recently
passed an amendment to the Merchant Marine Act
of 1920, reducing the rate on Shipping Board Loans
from 5j4%, to read the same interest as in the
Jones-White Bill, that of the current interest on
government investments or a reduction of about
2% in interest rates. In the smaller classes, build-
ing has been stimulated and in a few years America
will have a firm foothold here.
There is, however, a larger and more important
class. This is the fleet that fights for the Blue
Ribband, the symbolic prize for speed and service
across the Atlantic for passenger vessels. To date,
the United States has not held this trophy, which
should mean so much to our nation. So far, the
bulk of the competition has been between Germany
and Great Britain, the former with her Kaiser Wit-
helm der Crosse, the first ship to cross with an aver-
age speed of over 20 knots (23 miles per hour),
the Kronprinz Wilhelm, and others, and Great Brit-
ain with the former Lusitania and the previous rec-
ord holder, the Maitretania.
The knowledge that Germany was to make an-
other bid for "Blue Ribband" honors led Britain

to commence building another vessel to compete
with that of her rival, and this vessel, the Oceanic,
is now Hearing completion and will be launched
some time this year. France, too, has not been
idle in her shipbuilding, having commissioned since
the war the He de France, and several other large
liners, and are now constructing a vessel for the
"Blue Ribband," with the possibility of a sister ship
if the first proves successful.
Germany's post-war activities are well known
since the Bremen has made its first trip and come
into the possession of the coveted trophy, and there
are possibilities of the presence of another German
ship on the American run this year as the Europa.
the sister ship to the Bremen, is almost repaired
from the damage it suffered in the disastrous fire
of last year.
ENGINE AND BOILER ROOM LAYOUT DIA-
GRAM WHICH CLOSELY APPROACHES THAT
OF THE STEAMSHIP BREMEN.
These vessels are among the finest examples of
engineering achievement in the world today, since
the work of many branches of engineering has
helped in making the ships a success.
Naturally, the portions of the ship which hold
the greatest interest for the engineer are the engine
and the boiler rooms, and here the careful research,
and general thoroughness that typifies the Germans
as great engineers, are shown to advantage. The
choice of propulsive power was arrived at with
some difficulty. In order to attain a high economy,
the Turbo-Electric type of drive, as used on the
U. S. S. Lexington and Saratoga, was discarded from
the first, as under the most favorable operating
conditions the consumption of fuel shown is .82#
of oil per shaft HP, while for the standard Diesel,
or geared turbine drive, the figure is nearer .7 to
.75 #/SHP. Of these two, the geared turbine has
been used more prevalently for higher powers, but
recent diesel advancements in the saving of weight
(a very important item in ship design), the develop-
ment of higher power per cylinder, and the de-
crease in fuel consumption, made it imperative that
this type of drive be seriously considered. The
plan of layout, tentative, provided for the use of
20 diesel motors each capable of developing 6750
HP, making a total of 135,000 HP in the ship. This
power was to be distributed to the four shafts in
amounts of 26,000 HP, on the two outer shafts, and
39.000 HP on the inner ones. The diesels were
to be mounted in pairs, working through hydraulic
couplings, and there were to be four diesels to an
engine room.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
The Michigan Naval Tank
By EDWARD M. BRAGG, Professor of Marine Engineering
ANUMBER of the Technic devoted to the
Department of Marine Engineering would
hardly be complete without an article on the
Naval Tank. That is the feature of the Depart-
ment of Marine Engineering which appeals most
to popular imagination, and doubtless most people
think that the Tank
ought to produce
many a "story," in
the journalistic
sense.
Research work in
a Naval Tank is no
different from re-
search work in gen-
eral, and consists of
about 99% drudg-
ery and possibly
1 % thrill, or
"story." The tow-
ing of models at
speeds ranging
from one to three
miles per hour for
countless miles
does not give rise
to many thrills in
this age of speed.
The time of the
Tank is divided be-
tween routine testing and research work. The re-
search work is usually initiated by some member
of the staff and the results are published in the
proceedings of the national society. Most of the
routine testing work comes from builders who have
already decided upon the lines of the vessel and
merely wish to know how much power it will take
to drive the brute. A little experimental work
before the lines were decided upon might save from
5 to 10 per cent of the total power, but most of
the builders have not been educated up to that
point as yet.
There have been a few instances lately where
work of a research character has been desired by
the builder or naval architect. One of these was
in connection with the design of a large motor
yacht for Mr. Kettering, of the General Motors.
The owner wished the rolling of the yacht to be
as little as possible. Gyroscopes have been used
in several instances to reduce rolling on yachts,
but the larger the yacht the heavier the gyroscope

LINE, AND 125 FEET LONG OVER ALL. THE TOTAL DIS-
PLACEMENT IS 143 TONS, INCLUDING 85 TONS OF LEAD,

has to be in order to be effective. It was thought
that the rolling might be reduced by means of fins,
or rudders, so operated as to give the vessel a rota-
tion in the direction opposite to that imposed upon
it by the waves. These rudders would be oper-
ated by a hydraulic pressure system under the
control of a light
gyroscope.
Submarines are
caused to submerge
or emerge by
means of horizon-
tal rudders which
may be moved up
or down. If the
rudder on one side
were put up and
the rudder on the
other side down,
the submarine
w o u 1 d be rolled
over. This was the
idea of the design-
er, to replace a
massive gyroscope,
which by its own
weight would pre-
vent rolling, by a
light gyroscope
which would con-
trol several vanes along the side of the ship and
prevent rolling by their "rudder effect."
It was necessary first to determine the line of
flow of water along the side of the ship at the
places chosen for these anti-rolling rudders, in order
to determine the zero setting of the rudders, and
then to determine the rolling moment produced by
setting the rudders at various angles with the zero
position.
The experiments showed that the rolling effect
of the rudders varied in general with the speed,
as was to be expected, but for certain ranges of
speed was practically constant, which was not as
anticipated. Further, they showed that while the
forward rudders were quite effective, this effective-
ness decreased as they were placed nearer the
stern. The flow of water became somewhat un-
stable towards the stern and did not offer much
resistance to deflection, so that rolling rudders
placed aft were of little use. As it was impossible

MISS AMERICAS. VII AND VIII. AT THE FINISH OF THE 1929 HARMSWORTH TROPHY RACE, WHICH
WAS HELD ON THE DETROIT RIVER AT THE DETROIT YACHT CLUB.
The American Harms worth
Trophy Defenders
Uv L. VERNE AXSKL «3IE
THE British International Trophy for motor
boats, better known as the Harmsworth Trophy,
was presented by the late Lord Northcliffe, (then
Sir Alfred Harmsworth), in 1903, for annual inter-
national competition. Each competing country is al-
lowed a maximum team of three motor boats. The
only stipulations made by the donor are, that no boat
shall exceed forty feet in
length, nor be constructed
with fins or planing surfaces
to enable it to use air pres-
sure to lift it out of the wa-
ter. The course shall be not
less than thirty, nor more
than forty nautical miles, and
the course shall be so arrang-
ed that the turn angles ex-
ceed 120 degrees. The length
of each lap shall be not less
than five, nor more than ten
nautical miles.
The first race took place in
Oueenstown, England, and
since then it has been held in
the country holding the tro-
phy. The first race was won
by the Napier I. owned and piloted by S. F. Edge of
England. His average speed was 19.53 miles per hour.
Since 1903 there have been fourteen competitive races
for the trophy. England has won five of the events.
France has won one, and America has won eight.
America's first victory came in 1907, when E. J.
Schroeder raced the Dixie I on the waters of the
Solent, winning with an average speed of 31.78 miles
per hour. In 1908 the Dixie II, owned by Schroeder,
COMMODORE GAR WOOD (AT THE MICRO-
PHONE) AND ORLIN JOHNSON AFTER WIN-
NING THE 1929 HARMSWRTH TROPHY RACE.
successfully defended the trophy with a speed of 36.09
miles per hour. This race was held in Huntington Bay,
L. I. The next race was held there in 1910. and was
won by the Dixie III, owned by Messrs. Melville. Herk-
sher, &amp; Burnham, who entered the Dixie //' the next
year, and successfully defended the trophy with a speed
of 40.28 miles per hour. The next year. 1912, Sir E.
Mackay Edgar of England
won the event with Maple
Leaf IV, his speed was 43.18
miles per hour. This event
concluded competition until
1920.
In 1920 a Michigander,
who has since revolutioned
speed boat racing, entered
two boats for the Detroit
Yacht Club. This man was
none other than America's
Si&gt;eed Boat King, Commo-
dore Gar W ood, who spent
$100,000 in construction of
two twin-engined h y d r o-
planes. Miss America I and
Miss Detroit IV. He defeat-
ed the English and French
teams on the waters of Osborne Bay, and set a new
world's record of 61.51 miles per hour. The next year
Sir Edgar again challenged, and sent the Maple Leaf
VII to Detroit, but due to unfortunate circumstances, he
was unable to provide any competition, and Commo-
dore Wood won the trophy for the second time at the
helm of Miss America II.
About this time, both American and British sports-
men became interested in this fascinating sport, and


Page Nine
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
began to build boats to race on the team. Among the
leading British challengers was Miss Barbara Car-
stairs. In 1928 she financed the construction of two
high-speed boats, which were entered for her through
the challenging club, the Royal Motor Yacht Club, of
Hythe, Southampton. These boats were powered by
Napier-Lion engines. The Napier engine was used by-
Captain Malcolm Campbell, when he set a world's
record of 206.95 miles per hour. The Napier Engine
is a W type engine of twelve cylinders, arranged in
three banks of four cylinders each. These motors
develop 900 horsepower, and weigh only 835 pounds.
The bore is 5 Yz inches, and the stroke is 5 )/$ inches.
This engine is unique in that it has a compression ratio
of 10 to 1. The hulls of Miss Carstairs' boats were
constructed by Messrs. S. E. Saunders, Ltd., and the
engines by D. Napier and Son. Ltd.
The American entry, which was designed, con-
structed, and piloted by
Commodore Gar Wood,
was powered by two
twin-six Packard marine
engines, designed by
Commodore Wood, and
built to his specifications.
This boat, known as the
Miss America VII. was
built at the historic Al-
gonac home of the Miss
Americas in fourteen
days after her predeces-
sor was cracked up in
speed trials just before
the Harmsworth Trophy
Race. During the trials,
the hull was unable to
withstand t h e terrific
strain to which it was
subjected, at a speed in
excess of 90 miles per hour, and gave way; the boat
sank. The boat was raised, the engines were recon-
ditioned, and a new hull constructed to replace the
former. This boat, the Miss America I'll, not only
won the 1928 Harmsworth Trophy Race but set a new
world's speed boat record of 93.12 miles per hour.
Miss Carstairs' boat, the Bstelle I, capsized during one
of the early heats of the race. Another American boat
was entered, the Miss Los Angeles, a multiple-cylinder
hydroplane, but this boat was unable to stand the pace
set by the Miss America I 'II.
In 1929, Miss Carstairs brought a faster and better
boat than the year before, and the Miss Los Angeles
was again entered. The Bstelle IV, Miss Carstairs'
boat, was powered by two Napier-Lion engines, and it
was much faster than the Bstelle I of a year before.
The American entries were. Miss America VII, Miss
America VIII, and Miss Los Angeles. The latest of

OFFICIAL TIME SHOWS THAT THE BOAT IS GOIXG
MORE THAN 93 MILES PER HOUR.
the Miss Americas was powered by two twin-six Pack-
ard engines, which developed over 2.100 horsepower.
The shafts on each of the motors points toward the
bow, and terminates in a gear box; a shaft connects
each propeller, which are placed at the stern of the
boat, to the engine through the gear boxes. Since all
starting equipment must be carried on board all Harms-
worth entry boats, the Miss America VII had but one
starter which was on the starboard motor, which was
also equipped with a clutch, while the portside motor
was direct drive. In starting the motors the starboard
motor was started with the shaft out of gear, and then,
after this motor was operating properly, the clutch was
let in, and the ignition turned on in the portside
motor. The action of the moving water on the pro-
peller turned the motor over and started it. As the
J larmsworth trophy race is run according to English
rules, stakes to the starboard, steering is accomplished
by letting the clutch out
on the starboard motor,
as well as by turning the
rudder, which is a bow
rudder placed well for-
ward.
Each boat carries two
passengers, one to steer,
and the other to manipu-
late controls. In the Miss
America VIII, the steer-
ing was governed by
Commodore Car Wood,
and the controls by Orlin
Johnson, who has raced
with Wood for more
than eight years. In the
British entry, the steer-
ing was allotted to Miss
Barbara Carstairs. The
Harmsworth race is run
in heats, racing is continued until one country has won
two heats. There were only two heals run in the 1929
race. During the first heat, the Bstelle VI hit a board
and bent a shaft on one of the propellers; the Miss
America VII, Miss America VIII, and the Miss Los
Angeles all finished. The second heat was run faster
and was more colorful. The Miss America VII, and
Miss America VIII both averaged better than 75.28
miles i&gt;er hour, finishing one hundredth of a second
apart. The Bstelle J'I averaged 64.089 miles per hour,
finishing third, while the Miss Los Angeles finished
fourth. This race, because of its international entries,
aroused a great deal of public interest and thousands
of spectators viewed the event; according to the survey
made by the Detroit News, more than 450,000 people
attended the meet.

Notes on the Watertight
Subdivision of Ships

MANY people have some misconception con-
cerning the purpose of the "watertight sub-
division of ships." Briefly stated, it is to
localize any damage so that the amount of water
which might be admitted would not be sufficient
to overcome the reserve of buoyancy. If one could
know beforehand just where the damage would
occur, what its extent would be, how deeply the
vessel would be loaded,
and what would be in
the flooded compart-
ments, the task would
be very simple, and it
would be safe to say
that a vessel could be
designated so that un-
der these conditions
she would not sink.
Such powers of proph-
ecy are not possible,
and it is necessary to
arrange the subdivision
of the vessel so that all
reasonable contingen-
cies are provided for,
bearing in mind contin-
ually that the subdivis-
ion must not be such
that it would decrease
the earning power to a
greater degree than the
safety gained.
The floodable length,
or maximum length
of a n y compartment
which may be flooded
without causing the vessel to sink, is a percentage
of the length of the vessel and is;
(1) Directly proportional to the freeboard (dis-
tance from the waterline to the bulkhead
deck),
(2) Inversely proportional to the permeability
(percentage of the gross volume which may
be occupied by water) of the flooded compart-
ment,
(3) Inversely proportional to the block coefficient
(ratio of volume of displacement to a block
whose length, breadth and depth are equal re-
spectively to the length, beam, and draft of
the vessel),

(4) Directly proportional to the sheer (rise of the
deck, forward or aft, above the lowest point),
and
(5) Because of the sheer and the change in cross
sectional area at different positions along the
length of the vessel, dependent upon the fore
and aft position of the compartment in the
vessel.
If, as was stated
above, we could tell be-
forehand just where
the damage would oc-
cur, we could place our
bulkheads so that they
would be just forward
and aft of the damage,
but since we cannot do
so, there is a good
chance that it will oc-
cur at a bulkhead, dam-
aging it and flooding
two holds. To guard
against this possibility,
it is necessary to divide
the floodable length in-
to two compartments,
and if this is done
throughout the vessel,
we will have one in
which any two adja-
cent compartments
may be flooded. A ves-

floodable lengths vary at different positions in the
ship's length. The vessel shown is "three com-
partment" throughout, and in some places four and
rive.
The fact that the floodable length is a percentage
of the length of the vessel makes it impossible,
other factors being equal or proportional, to give
the same degree of safety to a small vessel as to
a larger one, because the length of holds in a small
vessel would be too short to be of any value for

The Retiring Staff
As we sit here in our swivel chair, at work upon our
last issue of the Technic, we are inclined to become
somewhat retrospective. As we look back upon our
work of the past year, we can see many errors of judg-
ment, but we can also see where we have made im-
provements over the Technic of previous years. The
retiring staff has instituted an improvement which has
been anticipated for many years, a cover in color, and
has modified the make-up of the Technic to conform
to the best modern standards of practice. In addition,
we have successfully brought the Technic through its
second year as a monthly magazine. This fall we pub-
lished the Engineer's Song Boole, and although it was
not received with quite as much enthusiasm as we antic-
ipated, we feel that it was a success, and will become
a tradition of our Engineering College.
We hope that the New Staff, which begins its activi-
ties with the next issue of the Technic, will profit by
A Co-operative Book Store Plan
Students have long deplored the high cost of books
and supplies. Many loudly proclaim that the Ann
Arbor book stores must be fast becoming the largest
money-makers in the world. Loud and vehement
have been these protests, yet no steps have been
taken, until now. to curb these expenditures.
Several prominent engineering students are en-
deavoring to establish an Engineer's Co-operative
Book Store here at Michigan. The plan is similar
to those already in effect at a large number of our
American Universities, and would result in saving
our engineering student body thousands of dollars
every year.
The average engineering student spends more than
fifty dollars every year for books and supplies. The
most conservatively estimated figures on the "co-op
plan" show that this would be cut down to twenty
dollars a year, two-fifths of the present cost.
Opposition to the plan will, of course, be met on
all sides by those who are endeavoring to make the
plan a reality. University officials will throw up their
hands and exclaim that the plan is financially im-
possible. Campus calamity howlers will bemoan an-
other source of student political graft. Ann Arbor
book store owners will offer protests on grounds of
unfairness. But, in spite of all this, the plan will
eventually become a reality. It possesses too many
merits to remain forever dormant.
We hope that every student will get behind this
plan and push. In dollars and cents, it means more
to the student than any student project which has
appeared on our campus for many years.

Try out Invitation
Another semester of the school year is getting under-
way as this issue of the Michigan Technic goes to
press. It marks a milestone in the progress of the
Technic, as well as that of the student. A new staff
will continue the work of the retiring staff. The new
staff will be the forty-eighth to publish the Technic,
which is not only the oldest student publication on the
Michigan campus, established in 1882, but is also the
oldest engineering publication in Engineering College
Magazines Associated, a national organization of tech-
nical college publications.
The new staff offers many opportunities for the en-
gineering student who is interested in extra-curricula
activities. Many former Technic men have gone into

COLLEGE NOTES
({uarterdeek. 1930
LAST month one of the oldest engineering so-
cieties on the campus attained its majority.
Twenty-one years ago, or in January 1909, a
group of students in the Naval Architecture and
Marine Engineering Department of the Engineer-
ing College formed the Quarterdeck Society of the
University of Michigan. This society has the dis-
tinction of being an Honor Society, in that its future
members are selected from the Junior Class of the
Department of Naval Achitecture and Marine En-
gineering who are qualified, not only from the
standpoint of good-fellowship, hut who have also
attained a high schol-
astic standing.
In the past this society
was noted for its canoj
regattas on the Huron
River and other social
functions, but at this
time these lighter en-
deavors have died out
and today the Quarter-
deck is of a more seri-
ous and technical na-
ture. Its meetings are
extremely interesting
in that they are entirely
student conducted. At
different times various
members write papers to be read before the society, recount choice anecdotes
These papers are on subjects relative to the field of which serve to show that the chosen profession is not

nality. At least once a year he is asked to gather
together enought data for the preparation of his
paper. This means he does an unlimited amount
of reading and with such a fine library at his dis-
posal, as is at the Univeristy of Michigan, a world
of information can be gained. In the preparation
and presentation of his paper, the student is under
no faculty supervision and must conform to no fixed
rules, except those he imposes upon himself, be-
cause of this he will feel at perfect liberty to try
out ideas of his own, both in the composition and
theory and thus learn their worth as valued by
his fellow students. Papers presented so far this
year cover a wide field of subjects, ranging from
"Refrigerated Ships,"
"Navigating Instru-
ments," "Welded Ship
Construction" to "The
Aerodynamical Theory
of Sails."
Numerous banquets
are held during the year
at which time the various
faculty members of the
Department of Naval
Architecture and Ma-
rine Engineering are
present en masse. It
is then that Dean Sad-
ler, Professors Bragg,
Adams and Lindhlad

interest to themselves and to their fellow members.
Following the reading of the papers, a general dis-
cussion ensues, which is participated in by all the
members.
This type of program gives the student an excel-
lent opportunity to try out and expand his origi-
might lead one to believe.
During the recent years the student body in
Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering has
not been as large as was formerly in pre-war times.
This might be attributed to two reasons, first, the
miraculous and sudden growth of aviation which


Page Thirteen
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
offered to prospective students subjects for study in
a field that was both novel and new and second, the
steady decline of the American Merchant Marine.
Today aviation has ceased to be novel and the re-
vival of shipbuilding' has begun, America has again
taken her place among the leading Maritime Na-
tions of the World. Ships amounting to millions of
tons and, according to the latest news bulletins,
requiring the services of an additional 10,000 men,
will be built with the next
few years. To success-
fully do this, a nation
must have more than the
desire to accomplish, it
must have a large crops
of highly trained men,
skilled in the design and
construction of steel
vessels.
Tau Beta Pi.
At the Annual Conven-
tion of Tau Beta Pi this
Fall in Iowa City several
very important measures
were passed and one of
them in particular has had
its effect on our Campus.
Previously the organiza-
tion had four scholarships
which were awarded to
members of the society
throughout the country'
At the Annual meeting, the number of them was
increased to six and the stipend to seven hundred
and fifty dollars. It was also decided that these
could be granted to men who would finish in Feb-
ruary rather than in June and thus enable them to
begin their advanced work immediately upon grad-
uation. Thus it has come about that one of the
Senior Engineers at the University of Michigan who
is graduating this February has been selected from
a group of applicants from all over the country as
the recipient of one of these fellowships. The for-
tunate gentleman is Karl Kammermeyer, a student
in Chemical Engineering, who having come from
V
Germany not many years ago has shown remark-
able ability and success in his work. The local
organization feels particularly proud of Karl and
the honor which has been bestowed upon him and
the Technic extends its heartiest congratulations.
o
Triangles.
The Junior Honorary Society, Triangles, has se-
lected a new group of officers to carry on the work
of the organization dur-
ing the second semester.
These men are:
In The
Spotlight
Robert Grunow
In every organization you
will find among the leaders
those who thrust themselves
forcibly into things and make
a great show of their worth,
and then you will find another
class of individuals who unob-
trusively exert a most profound, and even more force-
ful influence than those who appear so self important.
Among those in the present Senior Class who seem
to fall naturally into the second group, we find Bob
Grunow. To look at this fellow one would never sus-
pect that he is one of the best Cross-Country men on
the Campus. But as a matter of fact Bob has been
running on the team ever since he was first eligible
as a Sophomore. Unfortunately this past Fall he was
forced to undergo an operation for appendicitis, and
as a result, his athletic activities were curtailed. But
not only on the cinder path has Bob shown his superi-
ority, he has been very active in Class activities. As
a Sophomore he was initiated into Triangle, and then
in the Fall of his Junior year the Class honored him
by selecting him to be its President. This office he
faithfully filled and then served to crown the activities
of the year by being selected to membership in the
Senior Society, Vulcans. The Civil Engineers have
also honored him by making him a member of their
Society, Web and Flange. This year Bob has been
serving as the President of Vulcans. His social life
has included membership in the Trigon Club.

FAMOUS ARCHITECTS
■&gt; HISTORY
THE modern American line of architects, as dis-
tinguished from the Jeffersonian type, had its
beginning about 1870 with the first activities
of that remarkable genius, Henry Hobson Richard-
son. As the first to affect a break-away from the
over-popularized English Renaissance architecture
and to make it a sub-
stantial a n d lasting
success, Richardson in-
augurated a regime of
unprecedented freedom
in design and expres-
sion. Although he had
given the classical style
thorough examination
and study, he could dis-
cern in it but little val-
ue as applied to mod-
ern requirements. In
his sincere belief, the
architecture of the ear-
ly medieval period bet-
ter served the purpose,
giving a solidity and
simplicity of structure
and a certain flexibility
of plan. Irrespective of the fact that this theory
in its direct interpretation has now been completely
exploded, he shall always be remembered for the
indirect influence toward freedom that he created
in his successors and for the many buildings he
actually erected. In their particular class, they
rank among the masterpieces of the profession.
Richardson was born at New Orleans in 1838 to
a family which was essentially Southern in every

MASTERPIECE
characteristic, but which failed utterly, perhaps
fortunately, to imbibe much of its spirit into the
young offspring. He passed the years of his youth
with his family but early in his twenties he deserted
in order to continue his studies at Harvard, aspir-
ing toward civil engineering as a profession. The
culture and the refinement of the East and par-
ticularly of Boston made for a very decisive reac-
tion in Richardson, causing him to alter his plans
and to turn his attention toward architecture. His
training in preparation for the fulfilment of his
ambitions entailed six
years study in Europe,
principally at the Ecole
des Beaux Arts at
Paris, and several
months' apprenticeship
on his return to Amer-
ica. While visiting the
historical monuments
of France, he devel-
oped into an ardent ad-
mirer of Northern
Romanesque Architec-
ture, gradually acquir-
ing an acute distaste
for the Renaissance
style.
Once more in the
United States, he re-
solved to establish him-
self in the eastern section, foreseeing great oppor-
tunities arising from the aftermath of the Civil
War. He became associated with a well-known
architect by the name of Gambrill and set out on
his life work. His earlier works include a number
of parish churches, minor libraries and city banks,
all indicating the formulative period of his life
when he was carefully feeling his way before swing-
ing into full stride.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
The zenith of his fame came comparatively early
in his career with the design of the Trinity Church
at Boston, which, to the present clay is the city's
greatest pride. By this time he had severed his
business connections with Gambrill and set out
alone in competition with the greatest architects
of the country, winning, in this case, by a wide
margin. The building was of generous dimensions
and presented a problem of the first order, both
in plan and in general appearance. His solution
is reached through an adaption of his favorite style,
the French Romanesque, which, despite its histori-
cal background, stimulated the constructive and
creative powers of the designer.
The church, as it stands today, retains but a few
of the features originally presented in Richardson's
competition drawings, for, as the work progressed,
the designs underwent constant revision through
his dissatisfaction with the resulting effects and
his great determination to do his uttermost, pro-
ducing in the end a much greater work than was
anticipated by either architect or building commit-
tee. The effect of the structure, situated as it is
on a great city square with its well proportioned
tower and gable masses, is one of great beauty and
grandeur, never failing to inspire even the casual
observer. As has been written by his celebrated
biographer, Van Rensselaer, it has a "remarkable
union of richness and breadth, a singular charm
of color and noble dignity.
Following his widely acclaimed success with
Trinity, he fourd himself completely swamped with
commissions for work from all parts of the coun-
try. At Albany he did considerable work on the
New York State Capitol Buildings, producing a
very appropriate civic spirit and architectural
strength. A cathedral church of tremendous mag-
nitude and unusual beauty was also designed for
Albany but the plan never materialized. The Court
House in Pittsburgh and the Field Building in
Chicago were his two last projects which, at his
death in 1886, were just approaching completion.
His hopes were high for these two structures for
he believed them his best, having spent several
years in their preparation.
Richardson left behind him not only many note-
worthy buildings but also an influence that has
lived on to the present day. It has produced an
army of admirers and copyists who have infested
the country with a swarm of poorly done, "Richard-
sonesque" railway stations, town halls and public
libraries. However bad may be their effects, they
serve to well commemorate the man who, through-
out his life, strived to free the architectural pro-
fession of a worn-out classic which he earnestly
believed faulty in conception and misapplied in
practice. Appreciation of his attempts were echoed
in Europe during the closing days of his career for
he received the unusual distinction of honorary
membership into the Royal Society of British Archi-
tects. However, few realized, at the time, the true
importance of the strong impression he produced
upon the world, but as time has disclosed, he gave
the first impulse to the present-day movement in
purely modern architecture.
THE ARCHITECT'S!
BOOK SHELF,
DURING the first years of this century, when
formal classicism was being so highly ex-
alted and the architectural world, as a result,
was lazily reclining into a state of strict obedience
to the precedent, Mr. Jackson, a progressive Eng-
lish architect, published this book on Reason in
Architecture. As one of the first of a great line
of propagandists for modern architecture, he saw
in this popular adherence to the antique a formid-
able impedence to artistic progress and proceeded
at once to do his share in the attempt to reduce
the obstacle. He realized the utter futility of any
endeavor to instantaneously revolutionize the field
of design so he attacked the subject in a more
moderate and tactful manner, formulating a really
ingenious campaign of action. As far as can be
ascertained, the book was to be the first of a series,
each expanding on the preceding and gradually
becoming more radical.
At the outset, he allied himself with the conven-
tionalists by praising the old, historic styles and
their underlying principles, especially observing
their perfect harmony with their native environ-
ment. Then, by resorting to history and showing
how each change in the social and political life of
the past had altered its art, he rebukes them for
their neglect to heed this fundamental precedent
in not allowing their modern life determine a mod-
ern art. To be a true classicist, Jackson maintains
that one must be consistent in his reverence of
antiquity, he must penetrate the whole fabric and
extract the basic reason that is there involved,
using it as a foundation on which to build the pres-
ent. Here architects had failed at their own game
by not properly applying the lesson learned through
history and by refusing to permit the natural de-
velopment of their style.
In this manner, the author succeeds in attract-
ing the interest of the offender without openly
insulting him and placing him on the defensive.
His first few chapters comprise a mild discourse
on archaeology and convention preparing, in his


February, 1930
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
diplomatic style, for the more extreme contents of
the following pages. He chooses the capital as a
representative element in architecture, carefully
studying its development from Greek to Gothic
form and using it to illustrate this theory of social
expression in style and general reason in archi-
tecture. He further proves his point by a discus-
sion of the Gothic portal and vaulting system and
of their evolution from their classical parent. By
slow, logical steps he explains how each minor
change in society had effected the design and con-
struction of the various parts of the building until,
at the time when the revival of foreign, classic
forms descended upon the scene and clothed a mod-
ern. Christian civilization in archaic, pagan dress.
With this change, architecture loses its elementary
beauty and reason.
Having gracefully reached this point in his argu-
ment, he is now able to cast aside his guise and
proceed in an open, sincere fashion to further con-
demn the classical tendencies of the day. He goes
beyond mere opposition to the prevailing architec-
ture for he commends the immensely unpopular
attempts in steel and concrete and forecasts a com-
plete change from a sham masonry construction
to a purely structural system. In 1905, when this
book was being written, very few good examples
of openly expressed steel were in existence and
their success was uncertain, yet, Jackson saw by
his knowledge of what had gone before that this
type of design was forthcoming. His foresight was
remarkable for now, after twenty-five years have
elapsed, the principle that he nurtured is just com-
ing into its own and promises beyond all doubt
an encouraging future.
Aside from the well-formulated theories and in-
teresting predictions, the book boasts of a wealth
of literary value. The author expresses himself in
an individual, entertaining manner although he
avails himself of only the plainest construction and
the simplest vocabulary. As a piece of technical,
cultural and recreational reading it is difficult to
equal and almost impossible to excell.

The Aeronautical Society is in the air now, really.
The Airplane Section which seemed so hard to or-
ganize is an actual fact. The members of the Sec-
tion can fly any of three rented ships at prices
ranging from $17 for instruction per hour to $10
per hour for solo. And although one has to wait
some time for a permit from the University due
to red tape, the Society has obtained the services of
a very obliging doctor who gives the Department
of Commerce physical examination and presents the
candidate with a temporary permit to fly at the
time of the examination.
The Glider Section is as active as ever despite
the fact that they had several bits of bad luck and
have encountered some difficulty in keeping a ship
on the field. Thanks to the cold weather they are
operating on the ice now and things are going much
faster.
The Society has had speakers at the last two
meetings. The first was Ensign Randecker who
spoke on "Air Squadrons at Sea." The other was
Mr. Carl Fritsche who spoke at the last meeting on
the latest thing in lighter than air craft, "The
Metalclad Airship." Mr. Fritsche brought three
reels of excellent movies showing the construction
of the ship the ZMC-2.
Speaking of movies the Society has been making

participates. Eugene Fromm, the most enthusiastic

Edward Milton Bragg
IT IS seldom that the Alumni News section of this
magazine, which is devoted to the lives and inter-
ests of the alumni engineers of Michigan, turns the
spotlight of glory upon another than a graduate of the
University. However, the editor makes exception to
one who is wrell known to the graduates of Naval Arch-
itecture and Marine Engineering
from the University, one of the guid-
ing lights, who, though not a Michi-
gan graduate, has devoted twenty-
seven of the best years of his life to
the teaching of Marine subjects at
the University of Michigan.
In 1874, when five-masters and
huge side-wheelers were realities,
and not the titles of gaudy paintings,
the little New England town of Chi-
copee, Massachusetts, stopped pay-
ing tribute to the Father of His
Country for the day, and hastened
over to the Bragg homestead to con-
gratulate Warren Sylvester Bragg,
and his wife, Mary Charlotte
(Shores) Bragg, upon the arrival of a baby boy, who
was subsequently christened Edward Milton Bragg.
Mr. Bragg received his early training and interest in
ships, and problems nautical, during his period of
primary schooling in New England, and as this interest
grew, he resolved to make of it a life work. Conse-
quently, he entered Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology in the fall of 1892, and four years later gradu-
ated as a member of the first class to have ever had
the opportunity to major in Naval Architecture and
Marine engineering as a complete four year course,
at the institute.
After Graduation in 1896, Mr. Bragg continued his
work in the Institute as an assistant instructor in

Marine engineering, until 1898, when he left to enter
the services of Wm. Cramp and Sons of Philadelphia,
as a naval draftsman. In 1902, Mr. Bragg left this
position to spend two years with the Wm. K. Trigg
Company, of Richmond, Virginia, from which he went
to the New York Shipbuilding Company at Camden.
New Jersey. From 1907 to 1908
the Newport News Shipbuilding
and Drydock Company retained his
services, while upon the faculty of
the University.
In 1903, Mr. Bragg came to Ann
Arbor to take up work in the De-
partment of Naval Architecture,
and Marine Engineering, and has
been in the department ever since,
having become during that time, the
head of the department, receiving
this promotion when Dean Sadler,
of the Combined Colleges of Archi-
tecture and Engineering, took his
title, in 1928.
Professor Bragg is well known
throughout the profession, not only for his work at
Michigan, but for the authority he has well shown in
his very numerous printed articles. Magazines carry-
ing these works include the International Marine Engi-
neer, and the official organs of the Society of Nautical
and Mechanical Engineers, and The American Society
of Nautical Engineers.
Among the better known articles of Professor Bragg
are his papers on marine power plants, including an
Investigation of Pressure on Main Bearings and Crank
Pins of Marine Engines, and a series of Articles upon
Marine Engine Design, published in the International
Marine Engineer. Desirability of Using Higher Mean
Referred Pressure appeared in the organ of the Society

Professor Bragg married
Helen Elizabeth Brooks at
Gloucester, Massachusetts,
July 2, 1907, and has two
children, a son and a daugh-
ter. The Braggs live on Fer-

It is rumored that every
fourth year, Professor Bragg
steals quietly away from his

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
OXWELDED INDUSTRIAL PIPING
PRODUCTION in industrial plants and in the pro-
cess industries is dependent to a marked degree
upon satisfactory piping. In most instances the type of
joint used in a piping system is a determining factor in
operating efficiency.
The oxy-acetylene welded joint has been proved by
innumerable tests and by thousands of practical installa-
tions. It has many advantages—simplification of design
and construction, economy of installation, permanent
tightness, ease of insulating and dependability under
the most severe operating conditions. These are of out-
standing importance for high and low pressure steam
lines, refrigeration piping, gas, water, compressed air
and all other types of piping installations.
A properly made oxy-acetylene weld is an integral
part of the pipe itself. It has the same characteristics of
strength and ductility. It is 100 per cent, efficient.
From time io time the oxy-acetylene industry
isinthe market fortechnically trained men. It of-
fers splendid opportunities for advancement.

Blue Ribband
(Continued from page 6)
This plan was finally abandoned in favor of the
turbine drive with single reduction gears. Here
problems were introduced in the question of gear
design, for the HP of 130,000 is distributed equally
between the four shafts making the load per shaft
32,500 HP. The Bremen transmits her power to her
propeller shafts through a set of three pinions,
while the Europa uses only two. In this latter case,
the load per pinion is over 15,000 HP. Since the
propeller speed is near 200 RPM, and the diameter
of the gears is about 14 feet, a pitch line velocity
of 8,800 feet per minute would be reached, which
is extremely high. Since the RPM and the dia-
meter cannot be decreased, the width of face of
the gears must be such to keep the tooth pressure
within reasonable limits. Using the standard prac-
tice, this gives a width of face of about 105 inches,
which is used. These gears are the largest made
up to the time of the installation of the machinery,
1929, and it is doubtful if this size has been ex-
ceeded since.
The turbines themselves are of the combination
impulse and reaction type, with a high pressure,
an intermediate pressure, and two low pressure
rotors. The turbines run at 2,000 RPM, and work
through a reduction ratio of 10:1 to turn the wheels
at 200 RPM. At this speed of rotation, the Bremen
has a speed of 28 knots (32.2 miles per hour), and
this was reached on the usual trials, and in the
first trip across the Atlantic, when the crossing
was made in four days, seventeen hours, and forty-
two minutes, or an average sea speed of 27.83 knots
(32.05 miles per hour). Professor Bauer, the de-
signer of the machinery on the Bremen and the
Europa, made the crossing, and he states that this
speed will be exceeded, and the average trip will
be made slightly in excess of 28 knots. This is
greater than the fastest time made by the Maure-
tania, which was 26.90 knots (30.9 miles per hour).
Though this is a marked advance in ship con-
struction and powering, the change is not as great
as was expected. Authorities in this country looked
forward to a speed in the vicinity of 31 knots (35
miles per hour), and when a set of plans were
presented before the Shipping Board several years
ago, a designed speed of 33 knots was indicated.
At the time these ships were proposed, the money
market was not in a sufficiently stabilized condi-
tion to float a loan for the cost of construction of
the vessels, and this, with other economic reasons,
caused the matter to be laid aside for awhile. Re-
cently, the United States Lines, the purchasers of
the Leviathan from the Shipping Board, in accord-
ance with the contract made with the purchase
of the above and several other boats, started to
expand their fleet and the construction of these
four-day liners is again contemplated, pending the
decision made in regard to several mail-carrying
contracts. These vessels will probably be changed
slightly from their original design, but the essen-
tials will remain the same. The design commit-
tee, headed by Dean H. C. Sadler of our own engi-
neering school, submitted plans similar, somewhat,
to those of the Lexington and Saratoga but with
added improvements. An article on these boats
appeared in the May, 1928, issue of the Technic.
In this article Dean Sadler gave the general out-
line of these proposed boats. Summing up the prin-
cipal dimensions, they were:
Length over all 1.000 ft.
Breadth 100"
Depth 78.0"
Draft 32"
Horse Power 200,000
Passengers 600
It can be seen that these vessels are designed
somewhat larger than the two German boats, and
the increase in HP gave an increased speed that
approaches 32 knots (37 miles per hour). Among
the outstanding features noticed in these plans, is
the fact that accommodation is to be provided for
only 600 passengers. This was the direct result
of the report of the committee on economics, who,
after a most careful survey of the Leviathan and
other large boats, determined this as the most satis-
factory carrying load, being one that would show
a reasonable profit per trip, with a minimum of
expenditure. At this low figure, the possibility
that the ship would sail each time with a full load
would be increased and thus the steward's depart-
ment where most of the expense occurs could be
operated on a most economical basis. The num-
ber of passengers indicated does not include any
steerage passages, for these boats are to cater to
the highest class of passenger traffic, since they
offer the best of service. Perhaps the most out-
standing feature of these boats, outside of their
high speed, is the fact that they are planned as
airplane carriers, and bring about the fuller co-
operation of ships and airplanes. These planes that
would be carried were intended to be used for the
expressing of all fast mails, while the ship was still
at sea and transporting of passengers to and from
the ship and shore.
The German magazine "IVerft Kecderci Hafen," in
the issue for December 7, 1929, gives an article on
Four-Day Boats, and declares that the problem of
design for these boats has not yet been solved.
In this article general plans were given for liners
of this type and, oddly enough, they outline a type
very similar to that which the Committee of De-

sign proposed over two years ago. The fact that
Germany has at present her fast boats, does not
mean that the constructors of Germany are any
better than those in the United States, but the situa-
tion is more of the difference in the state of mind
and attitude of the German people. Instead of
remaining passive until times of national peril, a
program of steady advancement is continually fol-
lowed so, as soon as was feasible after the war, a
new Merchant Marine was planned, and the Bremen
is a result of this program. The interest that the
people themselves take in the progress of their
nation was shown at the launching of these two
vessels, the Enropa and the Bremen. A national holi-
day was declared to give everyone a chance to see
the inauguration of Germany's new Blue Ribband
fleet, and that the people made use of this oppor-
tunity is evinced in the fact that over 200,000 peo-
ple saw the launching of each of these ships, and
the President of the German Republic delivered
the address at the second of the launchings, that
of the Bremen. It is more this type of national pride
and patriotism that helps to keep a nation great,
than the type that we see practiced at home.
The ability of the American engineers in the field
of construction of fast vessels is well illustrated
in the two latest additions to our Navy, the Air-
plane Carriers "Lexington" and "Saratoga." These
vessels are the fastest in the world today for any-
thing near their tonnage, and they represent to-
gether more power than is in any other three ships
of any foreign navy. These ships are 888 feet long
and are driven by four turbo-electric units, each
consisting of a turbo-generator and two motors.
The total Horse Power developed is about 200,000,
which is enough to supply power and light for a
city of about 700,000 inhabitants. This manner of
stating the power of these ships recently led to
an amusing incident on the Pacific coast. The
mayor of Tacoma read of the power, and remem-
bered the above figure at the time of the great short-
age of electric power in Tacoma. due to the lack
of water power, caused by an unusually dry sea-
son. He wrote to Washington for permission to
use the Carrier in this novel way, and after con-
siderable difficulty obtained the desired permission,
so for the first part of this winter the noblest ves-
sel of our fleet has been serving as an emergency
electric station for a large city. That this was

Watering 87,000 horses
On Horseshoe Lake near Oklahoma City, in a business-
like, compact building, 87,000 horses (figuratively speak-
ing) are stabled ... nearly three for every family in Okla-
homa City. For with the completion of a new unit of the
Oklahoma Gas &amp; Electric Company's power station at
this point, the total generating capacity was raised from
46,930 to 87,130 horsepower.
To keep these "horses" up to full working condition,
and do it cheaply as possible, is no small job. Just the
water required is 86,400,000 gallons daily, the equiva-
lent of eight days' supply for Oklahoma City.
The new generating unit was made necessary by the ex-
pansion of industrial activity throughout Oklahoma and
particularly by the increased use of electric power by
the oil industry. For it, improved valves, fittings, and
piping, so vital to efficient and economical power pro-
duction, were supplied by Crane Co. Thus in these
modern times does progress in one industry bring progress
in another.
No matter what branch of engineering you enter after
graduation, you are likely to find Crane piping materials
essential tools of your profession. In the Crane book,
"Pioneering in Science," is told the story of Crane re-
search in metallurgy, with important scientific data and

actually done without taxing the generators or even

cation of the amount of power that these monsters

The representatives of many nations are meet-
ing and discussing the question of disarmament.
At present, the British and Germans have a num-
ber of fast boats that could be, if necessary, con-
verted into cruisers carrying six to eight inch guns.
These boats with their high speed would be in-
finitely more valuable than the many tons of smaller
and slower merchant ships that we have at pres-
ent and would rank with the small 6" gun cruisers
to which England wishes to restrict us. Our need
for cruisers with large cruising radii is emphatically
more than that of Britain. We have too few naval
bases to operate from. Our opinion of national
defense is, therefore, twofold. We must have long
range eight-inch-gun cruisers, and we must have
an adequate merchant marine to support, to work
in conjunction with, and be a part of our navy in
time of trouble.
The contemplated building by the United States
Lines is only a portion of the program being car-
ried on in this country at present. Besides plan-

ning the two four-day boats, two more vessels
similar to the Leviathan are under consideration, so
that a first-class, as well as a de luxe service, can
be efficiently maintained. The Export Line and the
Ward Line are also building new vessels, so that
within the next few years the tonnage of Ameri-
can ships in foreign trade will easily be doubled.
The most pleasing aspect of the whole building
campaign is that it is not a spasmodic outbreak,
but the natural development of a nation whose com-
merce has been suppressed. For years dependent
on outside tonnage for the exportation of our pro-
duce, the feeling of independence will tend to stimu-
late business internally as well as externally, and
greater prosperity will be the result. Our British
friends often joke about the $3,000,000,000 experi-
ment the United States carried on through the Ship-
ping Board during the War. It is plain, however,
that the money was well spent, for the double pur-
pose was served in providing the nation with ships
at a time when they were most needed, and started
a feeling for the need of an independent merchant
fleet, which is at last becoming a reality.

to get enough anti-rolling effect in the forward
rudders without making them undesirably large it
was finally decided to put in an ordinary gyroscope
weighing about seven tons. Thus, by experiment-
ing upon the model there was effected a great sav-
ing of time and money.
Another interesting piece of work which has been
carried on in the Tank lately is in connection w-ith
bulbous bows. The public has had its attention
directed to this question lately by the performance
of the well advertised "Bremen." Probably few
realize that bulbous bows have been in use in our
Navy for years and practically all our battleships
and cruisers have this type of bow. Some of our
larger coasting steamers also have the bulbous bow.
Opinion has been divided as to the superiority
of the bulbous bow over the ordinary bow. Some
of the English Tanks claim that they could get no
advantage in its use. Certain tests in our own
Tank did not show an appreciable difference.
The U. S. Shipping Board appropriated a cer-
tain amount of money for experimental work and
Admiral Taylor, U. S. N., Retired, was chosen to
map out a program. One of the problems that he
selected was that of the bulbous bow, and he asked
the Michigan Tank to carry on the work.
We have just completed the tests upon nine
models, three without any bulb, three with a mod-
erate bulb, and three with a pronounced bulb. A

More Sports
From the Michigan Daily, we find that the com-
ing sport around the campus is kidnapping stu-
dents. As yet the villains have not been caught,
but their identity has been ascertained. These brig-
ands swoop down on some poor student, and before
he is able to utter a cry, the henchmen have thrown
him into a cab, and he is sped off in the direction
of Ypsilanti. These bold men that perform these
dashing deeds must be Engineers, for when any-
thing extraordinary is done around the campus, an
Engineer has to do it.
What is troubling most of the students, is why
these culprits do not start kidnapping the Profes-
sors who have the bad habit of giving these blue-
books at five minutes' notice. Eet us hope they
will use a little more foresight and discretion in
the future.
Round the World with Mr. Thermo

We will start from the Boiler House, where I
was very busy baiting my Steam Trap. Suddenly
my old friend, Mr. Azimuth, came up, slapping me
on the shoulder said, "Well old Phi, you have won
the Tail Bete contest for scientific cribbing. So
we walked outside, and there sat my brand new
Carnot Cycle, baboon tires and High-hat Snubbers
and everythin'. Well, I just jumped right into the
ole saddle and was oft* in a cloud of boiler scale.
I just shoved her right up to 1.53 miles per hour,
and in about three hours rounded the corners of
the Palmer Field House. I nearly made the Var-
sity-Hockey players forget their game but many
miles had to be covered before dawn. It was just
growing dark when I pulled my trusty steed to
a halt in front of the East Engineering Building.
They had the flood lights on the field and the re-
ception committee composed largely of Meridians
and Asymptotes were on hand to congratulate me
on my record breaking trip. The Professors had
formed in a line and were handing out little Blue-
books tc&gt; all the younger Engineers. At the end
of the second day I sighted the Engineering Arch.
I pulled my trusty steed down to a halt and got
down and whipped out my slide-rule, extracted a
few square roots and fed my trusty steed much
to the amusement of some passing coeds.
I nearly had my cycle up to 1.8 this morning.
The closest that I have been able to come to that
terrific pace is 1.7689. I have calculated that in
about five light years I will be able to reach the
Armory. There I will be able to study the ways
of Ann Arbor.
The things to which I owe my success are Lucky
Strikes. They keep you thin so that you can see
with both eyes through any keyhole. It has been
a great pleasure to tell you collich poies about my
trip. Thank you—but don't forget that the key-
note of engineering is a slide-rule and a set of Tom
Swift books.

fine model, appropriate to high speed, was used
and the results show that for certain moderate
speeds a moderate bulb may be superior to no bulb,
and at certain high speeds, a large bulb may drive
10% easier than the other types.
This was confirmed by other experiments upon
two motor yacht forms, in which one had the ortho-
dox form and the other was somewhat radical, with
a moderate bulb. The orthodox form drove 6 or
7% easier at the lower speeds, but the radical form
drove 20 to 25% easier at the higher speeds.

medium, water. An airplane in flight moves through
one medium, air. In both cases a form which is
blunt forward and tapered aft will drive easier
than when pointed forward and blunt aft. A ship
moves through two media, air and water, and its
progress gives rise to surface waves which do not
exist in the case of the submarine, if it is sub-
merged a distance equal to about one-fourth of its
length. These waves drain off energy from the
ship, and we find that a ship must be sharp for-
ward instead of blunt, and sharp aft. In fact, at
certain slow speeds more of the length has to be
devoted to the aft taper than to the forward taper,
in order to drive with least resistance. If some of
the displacement can be taken away from the part
of the ship forward, near the waterline, and given
a submarine shape near the keel it may, at high
speeds, cause the form to drive easier.
An entirely different problem was presented in
the case of two models recently tested. A syndi-
cate of New York men wished to build a yacht to
race for the Upton cup next summer. They were
undecided as to whether they should use a certain
model, or one two feet shorter on the waterline
and a foot broader, the two being of almost the
same displacement. It is usually thought that the
Tank cannot be of much assistance in the case of
sailing vessels, as they are inclined from the up-
right condition due to the pressure of the wind on
the sails. This pressure causes a transverse inclina-
tion and a longitudinal inclination as well.
These two models were tested in the upright
condition and did not show much difference. When
tested at two different degrees of transverse inclina-
tion the longer model showed up slightly better
than the shorter, and when tested with a combined
transverse and longitudinal inclination, the longer
model showed up considerably better. Not only
did it drive easier but it took less of a heel while

running which meant that it would not "spill the
wind" as much as the shorter model. Two views
of this model are shown in the accompanying illus-
tration.
A little consideration shows this result to be
quite reasonable. When any ship shaped body is
moving through the water it is surrounded by a
saucer shaped depression. In order that the ship
may progress there must be a flow of water from
immediately in front of the bow to the stern where
the passage of the ship would leave a void. This
passage of water along the side converts some of
the static head into velocity, with a resultant low-
ering of the level. The passage of a short, broad,
shape will cause a greater fall in the level than
will the passage of a long, narrow shape. In the
case of vessels that stand upright it merely means
that the keel when moving is nearer the center of
the earth than when at rest. That is why steamers
have to go slowly over shallow spots. In the case
of a sailing ship we have another effect due to the
fact that the ship is inclined by the pressure of the
wind upon its sails and has to lie in this saucer
shaped depression which its passage through the
water has produced. The deeper the depression the
further over the ship will incline. Two models
which have the same righting moment when in-
clined to a certain angle at rest, will not sail at
the same angle when this inclining moment is act-
ing upon them when in motion. The shorter and
broader model will incline further than the longer
and narrower model.

speed race for motor boats, it has been a factor of great
importance in the improvement of design and construc-
tion of fast and dependable motor boats. The Harms-
worth Trophy Race commands a position in the motor
boat world parallel to the position held in the automo-
tive world by the International Speedway Races at
Indianapolis. The racing cars at Indianapolis pioneer
new developments in the automotive industry, in much
the same manner as new developments in the motor-
boat industry are pioneered by the Harmsworth event.
It was inevitable that sportsmen the world over
should come to the winner of the Harmsworth Trophy
with pleas to build boats for them. Thus the Harms-
worth Trophy race has created a demand for fast and
dependable boats. Gar Wood began to build a few
boats a year, for a few friends, now he is building

Just as close control counts in the performance of
a skilful diver, so too is this same quality of im-

Jenkins Valves are noted for the close control of
fluid flow they make possible. The high quality of
Jenkins design and construction always assures a
valve that opens wide for a full flow and closes
leak-tight. Jenkins globe, angle, cross and gate
valves make possible also perfect regulation of the
volume of flow in any fluid service.
Jenkins are made in bronze and iron, in standard

and Commodore Wood has devoted the Algonac plant
to the construction of custom built boats, designed to
attain speed in excess of 90 miles per hour.
Commodore Wood's prophecy that it is possible to
build boats that will go 200 miles per hour, and his
determination to produce the fastest boats in the world
in his Algonac plant, where he has assembled the finest
craftsmen, the best designers, and motor technicians he
could find, leaves little doubt in the minds of American
sportsmen that the Harmsworth Trophy will be well
defended this year. However, this year, Great Britain,
the present holder of the world's record on both land
and air, will enter some very fast boats, and Major H.
O. D. Seagrave will pilot a boat which will be powered
with Rolls-Royce Super-Marine motors. This motor
was used in the last Schneider Cup Race, and it was
constructed secretly. Very little is known about the
motor, but it is rumored that the compression ratio
is in the vicinity of 13 to 1, and that a special anti-
knock fuel is used. Very few American motors have
compression ratios that exceed 7 to 1.
Miss Carstairs will also enter a boat, and the third
boat on the English team will be constructed by the
British Power Boat Company which is backed by the
British government. Undoubtedly this race will attract
even more people than previous races, since the Amer-
ican public have become motor boat enthusiasts. Dur-
ing the last Motor Boat Show held at New York City,
in January, 1930, the paid admission of the first week
exceeded a quarter of a million. This was a greater
attendance than the Automobile Show drew. A nation
of motor boat fans eagerly awaits the coming event,
which promises to surpass, both in thrills and attend-
ance, previous Harmsworth Trophy Races.

the carriage of many kinds of freight. On account
of this, and also because the number of bulkheads
required for proper watertight subdivision is greater
than that required simply to give to the vessel the
necessary transverse strength, weight is added re-
ducing the carrying capacity of the vessel and
increasing her first costs. Thus any government
would be unfair to its shipping interests, if it had
more stringent regulations for watertight subdivis-
ion than did the others. This question is, there-
fore, one for international regulation.
In 1912 the British government issued an invita-
tion to the various maritime powers to a confer-
ence, in order to draw up such an International Con-
vention for Safety of Life at Sea. This Convention,

Notes on the Watertight Subdivision of Ships
(Continued from page 38)
which was signed in January 1914, dealt not only
with watertight subdivision, but also with radio,
iceberg patrol, hydrographic information, life-sav-
ing appliances, and many other details of opera-
tion and construction. The World War prevented
general ratification, and after the War, Naval
Architects and Builders found that many of the
provisions were not practicable. Study of the diffi-
culties continued, and in the spring of 1928 the
British Government issued an invitation for another
conference. This conference drew up a second Con-
vention which was signed last spring, and is now
awaiting ratification by the signatory powers.
A short description of some of the more impor-
tant provisions of the Second Convention in regard
to watertight subdivision is in order in this dis-
cussion.
(1) The Convention provides for a gradual in-
crease in safety as the length of the vessel increases,
and as she becomes less of a pure cargo carrier
and more of a passenger vessel. This is done by
fixing the maximum length of any compartment as
a fraction of the floodable length. This fraction is
called the "Factor of Subdivision," and is given by
two equations, one for a cargo vessel, and one for
a passenger vessel of the highest class. These
equations contain the length of the vessel in the
denominator, and each one is associated with a cer-
tain "Criterion of Service Numeral." For a vessel
whose "Criterion of Service Numeral" is between
that of a cargo carrier and a pure passenger ves-
sel, the appropriate "Factor of Subdivision" is
obtained by interpolation between those given by
these equations. "The Criterion of Service Numer-
al" increases as the vessel becomes more of a pass-
enger carrier, and varies directly as the sum of
the volumes of machinery and passenger spaces,
and inversely as the total volume of the ship—all
volumes being taken up to the deck to which the
watertight bulkheads extend.
(2) The vessel is divided into three portions,
the machinery space, and the space forward and
aft, and an average permeability is assigned to each
one. These permeabilities are given by simple for-
mulae. Attention was called to the fact, earlier in
this article, that we cannot tell at the time of con-
struction what kind of cargo will be in any par-
ticular hold at the time of an accident, so that the
permeability figures are probable averages. In the
case of the machinery space the problem is easier,
although even here is it doubtful as to how full
the bunkers may be.
The Committee which prepared data for the use
of the American delegates to the Convention made
full size tests regarding the permeability of the
machinery spaces of two small Shipping Board ves-
sels which were to be scraped, and also tests and
investigations upon cargoes of all kinds. These
tests showed that the formulae proposed in the
tentative draft of the Convention gave values too
low in the case of the machinery spaces, and a
very good average in the cases of the spaces for-
ward and aft. The formula for the machinery
space, as incorporated into the Convention, was re-
vised in the light of the data presented by the
American Delegation.
In conclusion, a few words must be said of the
wonderful work done after the First Conference by
a Committee appointed by the President of the
British Board of Trade. This Committee devel-
oped Cross Curves by which the floodable lengths
for any vessel may be obtained by a few hours
work, instead of a laborious calculation. These
curves give the floodable lengths for an assumed
standard form in percentages of the length of the
vessel, and as functions of the five governing fac-
tors mentioned above. The floodable length so ob-
tained may be corrected for the departures of the
vessel under consideration from the standard form.
In almost all cases, the corrections benefit the ship,
i.e., the floodable lengths are greater after cor-
rection than before. The existence of these curves

Military Explosives
Lt. Col. H. W. Miller. O. R. C.
Professor of Mechanism and Engineering Drawing
ANY discussion of the history of military
explosives would probably not be complete
without some mention and explanation of
certain substances employed in warfare prior to the
discovery or invention of what we call black gun
powder. Certain writers have assumed that the
mention of the use of wild fire
in the reduction of Mecca in
the fifth century and the fre-
quent mention of the use of
"Greek fire" in the defense of
Byzantium or Constantinople
in the eighth, ninth and tenth
centuries might indicate that
the users of these substances
were acquainted with the com-
position of gun powder. There
seems such excellent reason to
believe that saltpetre, an essen-
tial ingredients of black gun
powder, had neither been iso-
lated in usable quantities or
perhaps even recognized as a
separate substance before 1200,
that any assumption that any
group of peoples made use of an explosive before
the isolation and recognition of the properties of
saltpetre has hardly any foundation.
Saltpetre is formed in the decomposition of
animal and vegetable matters. The climate of parts
of China and particularly of India is very favorable
DURING the late World War
Lt. Col. H. W. Miller was
chief engineer in charge of heavy
artillery for the Allied Forces.
The Order of the Legion of
Honor was conferred on Col.
Miller for his meritorious ser-
vices. Since the war he has made
an extensive study of the Paris
Gun, which the German Army
used for the bombardment of
Paris, and has written a very in-
teresting book on the amazing
facts he has discovered; he calls
the book "The Paris Gun." An

for the formation of saltpetre. Marco Polo, who
was in China from about 1274 to 1291, describes the
making of salt in the city of Chan-Glu. This salt
must have been largely saltpetre, but according to
him it was used only in the preparation of food,
There are numerous records to the effect that the
Arabs, Chinese and Egyptians
had recognized saltpetre as a
substance of peculiar properties
as early as the year 1200. The
Egyptians called it "Chinese
snow." This might indicate
that it had its origin in China.
The Mongol conqueror Chingis
brought Chinese engineers with
him in 1218 to reduce the forti-
fications of the cities of Persia.
Apparently they were using an
explosive mixture of saltpetre,
sulphur and charcoal. There is
a record of the use of some
variety of explosive in the
siege of Kaifungfu in 1232. By
1259 the Chinese had pro-
gressed to the point of using
the mixture of sulphur, charcoal and saltpetre in a
tube to produce the effect that we now know in a
Roman candle. In 1249 Roger Bacon wrote an
account of the manufacture of saltpetre and gun
powder and describes the use of gun powder in
warfare.

From the above and much more information that
is available, it would seem that the reports of the use
of explosives before the year 1200 have little if any
basis of fact. Competent writers seem to agree that
the term "wild fire" was employed to designate
certain incendiary mixtures containing resins,
bitumin and possibly naphtha. It seems agreed
that Greek fire was applied to naphtha itself. It
was employed through the medium of a squirt gun
or as we would now designate it, a flame thrower,
in setting fire to enemy ships in the harbor of Con-
stantinople. Saltpetre may have been used in some
of the incendiary mixtures to cause them to burn
more fiercely. It is said that the Arabs used salt-
petre in their fire brands in 1250. It is reported that
the Moors ''launched stones and darts from
machines, a n d
missiles of thun-
der and fire," at
the siege of Nie-
bla in Spain, in
1257. From this
time on the de-
velopment in the
use of the mix-
ture of sulphur,
charcoal and
saltpetre in the
proportions o f
1-2-6, and of the
making of ves-
sels or tubes in
which to use the
mixture appears
to have been very rapid. By 1350 the knowledge
of the art of making cannon and their use in war-
fare seems to have spread all over Europe and there
were craftsmen who had perfected themselves in the
making of tubes of bronze and wrought iron for
use particularly in the reduction of the walls of
cities.
There are some interesting facts with reference
to the use of black gun powder in early cannon that
are worthy of mention. It was apparently learned
at an early date that the thorough mixing of in-
gredients was essential to satisfactory service. It
was found that if the ingredients were mixed and
sent to the field in the mixed form, they had a
tendency to settle out to such an extent that if
great care were not taken to shake up the entire
contents of powder cask before using any of it,
the powder which would be removed from the top
of the cask might have but little explosive power.
There were developed, therefore, in connection with
cannon, master gunners whose business it was to
superintend all operations in the use of cannon.
They superintended the placing or laying of tubes
on timber foundations, pointing the guns in both
direction and elevation, and in particular the mixing
of the ingredients of the powder which more fre-
quently were brought to the field separately. The
resultant mixture was in a true sense a powder, and
this term has persisted until the present day. The
loading of some of the larger cannon was so labori-
ous that not infrequently they were left loaded for a
long time. The enclosed powder would frequently
cake from moisture that would get past the imper-
fect wadding, and it was highly dangerous to
attempt to fire a cannon that had been left loaded
for a number of months.
The providing of an ample supply of saltpetre for
military uses became a very serious problem. In
France special officers termed "saltpetre commis-
sioners" were appointed in 1540 to search for salt-
petre for various
purposes. This
decree was re-
newed in 1572
vv hen France
was faced by a
serious war.
Most of the salt-
petre used in
England prior to
the 16th century
w a s imported.
Regulations
similar to those
of France were
put into effect in
1550. Sharp com-
petition develop-
ed between saltpetre workers and soap boilers for
wood ashes which were practically the only source
of potash in England. In 1534 saltpetre searchers
were given preemption of the ashes over soap
boilers by royal decree, on the ground that salt-
petre for war was a greater necessity than soap for
the public. The importation of saltpetre from India
began in about 1600 and by 1700 as much as five
hundred tons per year were being brought from
that source.
Just when the development of the mixing of black
gun powder ingredients had progressed to the point
of making it into grains and polishing the grains is
not known. One begins to find records, however,
shortly after the introduction of small arms in about
1500, of the existence of what was termed priming
powders. This apparently was a hard, granular
powder in which the original mixture had been
moistened, dried in cakes, broken, sifted, and the
grains of a certain size shaken in a cloth container
for the purpose of polishing them and rendering
them relatively smooth and round. From this time
on one finds the art of molding powder, or at least

What Shall I Read?
Parkman's Histories
By •!. Raleigh &gt;'elson. Professor of English
IWANT to share with the readers of these columns
one of my literary passions. For more than a
quarter of a century Parkman's Histories have been
one of the sources of my keenest enjoyment and my
deepest satisfaction. As I look back over that experi-
ence, I regret the years when Parkman was only a
name to me, an item in a list of facts,—birth, death,
published works,—to be remem-
bered as evidence of my having
had a course in American Litera-
ture. I thing I rather resent the
fact that no teacher of mine in
either history or literature induc-
ed me in college days to taste and
see for myself the quality of
these priceless volumes. I had
been teaching a full decade, when
a friend who loved Parkman
touched me with the contagion of
his own enthusiasm and I began
to read the Histories for myself.
I should hardly be doing my full
duty to those who look to these
pages for suggestions for their
reading, if I did not call to their
attention the opportunity here
afforded for a literary adventure
bound to be both profitable and
delightful.
John Fiske, perhaps our most eminent historian, has
said in commenting on the theme of Parkman's series
of historical studies:
The struggle between the machine-like socialistic
despotism of New France and the free and spontaneous
political vitality of New England is one of the most
instructive object-lessons with which the experience of
mankind has furnished us. The depth of its significance
is equalled by the vastness of its consequences. Never
did Destiny preside over a more fateful contest; for
it determined which kind of political seed should be
grown all over the zeidest and richest political
garden-plot left unfilled in the world. Free industrial
England pitted against despotic militant France for the
possession of an ancient continent reserved for this
decisive struggle, and dragging into the conflict the be-
lated barbarism of the Stone Age,—such is the wonder-
ful theme which Parkman has treated. When the
vividly contrasted modern ideas and personages are set
off against the romantic though lurid background of
Indian life, the artistic effect becomes simply magnifi-
cent. Never has historian grappled with another such
epic theme save when Herodotus told the story of
Greece and Persia, or when Gibbon's pages resounded
zrith the solemn tread of marshalled hosts through a
thousand years of change.
The struggle between France and England for the
North American Continent was one of the most critical
and dramatic in all history, and quite as momentous in
its ultimate result as the struggle
between (jreece and Persia, or be-
tween Rome and Carthage. Of
the maritime nations attracted to
the New World as a field for
colonization at the end of the
fifteenth century, Spain was un-
successful because she had no
faculty for colonization, the
Netherlands confined their efforts
to one limited cosmopolitan
colony in an especially favorable
location. Thus by the end of the
sixteenth century France and
England were left facing each
other squarely as rivals for the
control of the great new contin-
ent. An understanding of the
details of this struggle and a
realization of its significance
gives one a new appreciation of
the source of political ideals of
the early influences that determined their practical
form.
Parkman devoted his whole life to the treatment of
this one theme. As Fiske has said "Altogether about a
half century was required for the building of this
grand literary monument." The Conspiracy of Pontiac
appeared in 1851 : the final volume in 1892. He had
not only a philosophical attitude toward his material,
but he was a naturalist and something of a poet, at
least in temperament. The patient research begun in
his college days at Harvard, pursued through years of
physical suffering, in the face of the terrible handicap
of practical blindness is one of the most heroic examples
in the annals of American historical scholarship. One
can surrender himself to the literary charm of Park-
man's work without any secret wonder as to its reli-
ability. He is accurate in the most minute details.
All this, I admit, sounds rather informing. .My
readers are probably not specially keen to do much
delving into the results of historical research. For-
tunately he had, in addition to his rare qualifications as

PARKMAN'S HISTORIES is
the theme of Professor Nel-
son's discussion this month. His
keen interest and enthusiasm is
apparent to the reader. Professor
Nelson feels the powerful appeal
made by Parkman in his numer-
ous histories and in his own di-
rect and forceful way he intro-
duces the Technic readers to these
"priceless volumes." Professor
Nelson invites you to relive the
struggles and experiences of the
empire builders of New France
and NeW England, told as only
Parkman can tell them in his

mentary evidence into a vivid
story of human passions and

The Paper Industry
llv Ward O. Wheeler. MO E
SIX thousand years ago the Egyptians saw the
need for some conveniently portable medium on
which to keep records. They found an answer
in papyrus, made from a kind of reed grown along the
Nile River. At about the same time, the Chinese
developed a paper from the inner bark of the mulberry
tree. These two primitive forms of paper served for
many hundreds of
years, the next
development being
parchment, made
from the skin of
animals. The ease
of making and
handling parch-
ment in rolls
caused the gen-
eral use of this
form of paper.
After parchment
came the process
of making paper
from rags, in
which process the
fibres were torn
apart and made
into sheets entirely by hand. With many improvements
in quality and the methods of manufacture, this form
of paper is still used extensively. Just before the
year 1800 the idea of making paper from other kinds
of fibres was conceived. It is the development of this
MODERN PAPER MACHINE AS VIEWED FROM DRY END.
FINISHED PAPER COMING FROM CUTTERS.
idea, together with the process of making paper from
rags, which is the foundation of our industry as it now
exists.
The newspapers, books and magazines we read, the
correspondence we carry on, the records we keep, and
the wrapping we do, are all directly dependent on the
paper industry. Few of us. however, realize just how
this paper is made. We know that logs and rags have
some connection with a paper mill, but beyond this we
have little conception of how a sheet of paper is formed,
or why one kind of paper should differ from another.
All of the paper which we use today is made by inter-
locking, in some manner, fibres of a certain sort to-
gether into a sheet. The industry may well be divided
into two parts:
the preparation
of the fibres from
the raw materi-
als, a 11 d the
manufacture o f
sheets from
these fibres. The
raw material is
first taken to the
pulp mill, where
it is converted
into a fibrous
mass, known as
pulp. This pulp
is then taken to
the paper mill
a n d is there
Fabricated i n t o
sheets. These two mills are entirely separate and should
be treated as individual units. In fact we find many a
paper mill apart from a pulp mill, and vice versa. Let
us consider, first, the making of the various kinds of
pulp, and then how these pulps are converted into the
many types of paper with which we are familiar.
In the making of pulp from rags, great care must l&gt;e
taken in sorting the raw materials. This sorting means
the separation of the rags from all foreign materials,
such as metal, sticks and stones, as well as sorting the
rags themselves, according to kind and color. All cot-
ton and linen rags may be made into some grade of
paper. The rags come to the mill in bales. These
may be rags which have been gathered by the ragmen,
but the greater part of them are trimmings from the
textile factories. These rags, after being separated
as mentioned above, are cut into small pieces by means
of mechanical rag cutters and then passed through
dusters. The dusters remove much of the loose dirt
and the action also opens the rags so that the chemicals
may react more uniformly. The dusted rags are
charged into rag-boilers, and a solution of caustic soda,
or soda-ash and caustic lime, or a milk of lime, is added.
The mix is then subjected to a steam pressure of about
fifty pounds per square inch, for from six to eight
hours, after which time the pressure is released and the

pulp is blown out. The pulp is washed and if white
pulp is desired, it is bleached. Some form of chlorine
bleaching is generally used
There are several methods of making pulp from
wood; the mechanical processes in which the wood is
ground into fibres, or the chemical processes in which
the fibre is freed by cooking, either with caustic soda,
sodium sulfide, or calcium and magnesium sulfites.
These chemical processes are known as the soda, sulfate
or Kraft, and sulfite processes, respectively. In any
of the wood processes, which may use spruce, balsam,
hemlock, pine, and poplar woods, the first operation is
the removal of the bark. The logs are sawed into
lengths varying from eighteen inches to three feet, and
are then barked, either by hand, using a draw-shave, or
a revolving wheel with knives set in the face, or by
means of a machine known as a drum-barker. This is
a large revolving drum made of angle iron and fed
continuously at one end. A slight pitch causes the logs
to travel down the
full length of the
drum, into which
streams of water
are continually
flowing. The fric-
tion and agitation
of the logs causes
the removal of the
bark. After em-
erging from the
drum the logs are
freed entirely of
the remaining
bark by hand.
The logs are
now ready for use
in either the me-
chanical or chemi-
cal processes. In
the mechanical
process, the logs
are charged into pockets of a cast iron frame, which
encases a large fine-grit grindstone. The logs lie
parallel to the axis of the stone and are pressed down
against its face by means of a shoe driven by hydraulic
pressure. The stone revolves with a peripheral speed
of about three thousand feet per minute, and turns in
a pit of water, which cools the stone and keeps the
wood from burning. The pulp thus formed is a very
short, fine-fibred pulp, and is known as yrouudzvood.
The pulp is generally divided into two grades, and to
this end and to separate the pulp from the slivers and
sticks of wood, resulting from the grinding, rotary
screens are employed. For screening the pulp is placed
in very dilute suspension in water. The fine pulp which
passes the screen is used for newspaper and book
papers, and the coarser pulp for wrapping and wall-
papers. Before use or storage, however, the pulp must
be removed from the suspension, and sometimes it is
even made into rough sheets. This is done by running
it into a vat in which a screen of 65-mesh wire is
revolving. The water runs through the screen and is
drained from the inner part of the cylinder, while the
pulp remains in a thin layer on the screen A piece
of heavy wool blanket, called a felt, is pressed against
the cylindrical screen by means of a couch-roll, and
picks up the layer of pulp. The pulp may afterwards
be removed from the felt by means of pressing a board
against it, in which case the pulp contains about ninety-
four percent water, or the felt may be in the form of
a belt, which passes over a series of rolls and suction
boxes, and finally between two press rolls, the top roll
of which is of maple and to this the pulp adheres. A
certain number of layers are allowed to build up on the
maple roll and then they are cut off by passing a
pointed stick across the face of the roll. The sheet
thus formed con-
tains about 33 per-
cent pulp and may
be folded and stor-
ed in this state.
For use in any
of the chemical
processes, the
barked logs are
chipped, by feed-
ing them against
the face of a
revolving wheel,
carrying heavy
knives, which cut
chips from the
ends of the logs
averaging about
■Hi 'w H by 1 inch
in size. The chips
are screened and
stored in bins.
In each of the chemical processes the chips are
charged into digesters, which are so constructed as to
withstand the liquors and pressures employed. The
liquor is then added and they are heated to various
pressures by admitting live steam.
The soda process uses poplar and similar woods. The
digesters are made of one inch steel and are sometimes
as large as fifty feet high by ten feet in diameter.
Caustic liquor is added until a strength of 8 to 10
degrees Baume is reached. The mix is cooked at
about 80 pounds pressure for from eight to ten hours,
after which the liquor is recovered, the pulp washed
with water, removed and screened. Again if white pulp
is desired, it is now bleached. Soda pulp is a soft fine
pulp used for opaque papers, especially that for books

Motor Fuel Research
By George Granger Brown
Associate Professor of Chemical Engineering
ALTHOUGH there are more than 25,500,000
registered automobiles, consuming more
than 12,000,000,000 gallons of gasoline per
year, in the United States, surprisingly little exact
information is available concerning the desirable
characteristics of the fuel as
related to engine perform-
ance. Until very recently
large quantities of "high
test" gasoline was sold at a
premium of from 4 to 6
cents per gallon over the
standard price for regular
U.S. motor grade gasoline.
This high test gasoline cost
more to produce, was sold at
a higher price, and frequent-
ly gave less miles per gallon
than the standard product.
At present the high test
gasoline has largely been
replaced by a premium anti-
knock gasoline. One won-
ders what will be the next
appeal to popular demand
and for which we are to pay
a premium.
There is no intention to imply that high test
gasoline, or anti-knock gasoline may not in many
cases be actually worth the extra price asked, but
rather to challenge the reader to ask himself
whether or not he really knows why he now buys

anti-knock gasoline instead of high test gasoline;
or why he buys anti-knock gasoline instead of
ordinary gasoline; or perhaps why he buys ordinary
gasoline instead of the widely advertised anti-knock
variety; or, if he does not buy gasoline at all, what
kind would be purchased if he were operating a
car.
About four years ago the Natural Gasoline Asso-
ciation of America started a
research program which was
carried out largely in the
Department of Chemical
Engineering with the object
of finding out what charac-
teristics of motor fuel are
most desirable from the
standpoint of performance of
modern motor cars. As a
basis for this study a large
number of road tests involv-
ing practically all types of
modern automotive equip-
ment have been made in an
effort to define the condi-
tions under which fuels are
actually used.
Perhaps many of you
have seen the car, the rear
view of which is shown in
Figure 1, in front of the East
Engineering Building during the past two or three
years. Externally, it has the appearance of a
normal, innocent, passenger car, but the rear view,
as shown in the figure always arouses the curiosity
of the uninitiated. This was particularly the case
when first used in making a trip through Canada.
The U. S. Customs inspectors became greatly in-
terested in the 50-gallon tank carried in the rear.
After considerable explanation and some inspection,
they wrere convinced that the tank really was for
the purpose of carrying gasoline samples for test,
and not concentrated anti-freeze solutions.
Although the outside of the car might appear
interesting because of its unusual tank, the inside
is even more so. Figure 2 gives an idea of the
number of valves located under the rear seat for
the purpose of controlling the flow of fuel from the
tank at the rear of the car. The special tank was
divided into six compartments, each of which held
8 gallons. In making a series of road tests, six
different samples of gasoline were placed in these
tanks and the valves, as shown in Figure 2, were
used to switch from one sample of gasoline to
another while the car was being driven under con-

stant conditions on the road. Not only was it
possible to change fuel samples while the car was in
operation, but the method of feeding the gasoline
could be changed. The fuel could be fed through
the vacuum tank and thence by gravity to the
carburetor, or through an electrically driven pump
under pressure to the carburetor, in order to see
what difference these two methods of fuel feed
might make.
For purposes of getting representative data on
the temperature conditions encountered in actual
driving, six thermocouples were placed in the fuel
line and carburetor to determine the temperature of
the gasoline under different driving conditions. Dial
thermometers were also placed so as to record the
temperatures of the air surrounding the carburetor,
entering the carburetor, and also the atmospheric
temperature in front of the car. In order to deter-
mine approximately the car performance, an accel-
erometer which measured the acceleration given to
the car by the engine, was mounted on the dash in
addition to the standard equipment.
This car, which was literally a laboratory on
wheels, has been driven about 16,000 miles in all
kinds of weather and with all kinds of fuel.
Tests on other types of cars have also been made
to find out the extreme conditions under which
fuels are operated. Careful tests were then made
in the laboratory on the same motors as were tested
on the road, and under the same conditions as were
found to exist when used in general service. These
tests were supplemented by an extensive series of
special laboratory tests to find out what character-
istics of the fuel gave the best performance under
the different conditions.
The present discussion is limited to fuel volatility
characteristics by the available space.
The ordinary method of estimating the volatility
of a motor fuel is by the Engler distillation, or that
specified by the American Society for Testing
Materials (Fig. 3). This method consists of distil-
ling at a specified rate 100 cubic centimeters of the
fuel from a glass flash of specified dimensions. The
flask contains a side arm through which the vapors
pass to a condenser. A thermometer inserted
through the cork indicates the temperature of the
vapor leaving the flask. The distillation curve is
drawn by plotting the temperature indicated on the
thermometer as a function of the amount of con-
densate collected in the receiver. Because of the
universal use of this test, it is important that fuel
characteristics as determined by the A.S.T.M. dis-
tillation be directly related to easy starting, accel-
eration and power output of motors under all con-
ditions of use.
Starting tests have been made for the past year in
the cold room in the Highway Laboratory. These
tests consist of counting the revolutions and re-
cording the time taken to obtain the first explosion
when starting the motor in the usual manner with
the electric starter with different fuels and with
different choke settings. It is perhaps interesting
that we have found that the number of revolutions
required to start at a specified temperature with a
certain fuel is constant regardless of the speed at
which the motor is cranked if the air-fuel ratio
supplied by the carburetor is kept constant. The
fact that it is frequently impossible to start a car in
cold weather with a given fuel unless it can be
cranked at a sufficiently high speed is due to the
characteristics of the carburetor which supplies a
richer mixture at the higher cranking speed, and
probably not due to the necessity of carrying the
liquid fuel particles up in the air stream through the
manifold to the cylinders. By relating the number
of revolutions required to start at different tem-
peratures to the distillation characteristics of the
fuel, we find that approximately the ease of starting
a cold motor at 65° F. is indicated directly by the
per cent of the fuel vaporized in the A.S.T.M. dis-
tillation below 200° F., and the ease of starting a
cold motor at 35° F. depends in a similar manner
upon the amount of fuel distilled below 150° F.,
and at 20° F. to the amount distilled below
120° F. These relationships are not exact, but they
are sufficiently approximate for the present discus-
sion. Usually satisfactory starting can be obtained
if 10 per cent or more of the fuel is vaporized at the
indicated temperature.
Once the motor has been started, the next ques-
tion is to keep it running in a fairly satisfactory
o &lt;o o

manner with or without use of the choke. Usually
the choke is pushed in part way as soon as the
motor starts, and the throttle is opened. If the fuel
possesses sufficient volatility so that an explosive
mixture is always supplied to the cylinders at any
single choke setting, the car may be driven even

The Honor System
Ever since its inception in the Engineering Col-
lege a number of years ago, self-appointed campus
critics have declared The Honor System as im-
practical, and altogether radical in its fundamental
principles.
We have no fault to find with the basic principles
underlying the Honor System. However, we do
note glaring flaws in its administration. The Stu-
dent Honor Committee, that body whose duty it is
to investigate cases of violation of the Honor Code
and recommend suitable punishment, has been
guilty of some unforgivable malpractices in the ad-
ministration of its duties.
Instead of throwing its meetings open to the
student body, which they represent, their meetings
are held behind closed doors, securely locked
against intrusion. Surely, there is no reason for
such secrecy. As representatives of the student
body, their duty is to fulfill the wishes of the stu-
dent body, in cases of Honor Code Violation: not
to set themselves up as an all-powerful tribunal,
whose word is law, and whose opinions are beyond
question.
If the Honor System is to retain the respect and
co-operation of the student body, there must be no
partiality shown in rendering decisions against
violators. Nothing can engender enmity toward
the Honor System as surely as injustices in its en-
forcement. Students can not be expected to
respect the Honor Code, and conform to its stan-
dards, if injustices are known to exist in its ad-
ministration. We hope that the Honor Committee
will "mend its ways in the future", and endeavor to
maintain a more strict conformity to justice, rather
than to personal opinion.

On Posting Marks
It was indeed enlightening to read the bulletin
boards this February after final examinations had
been taken. We could not help noticing that Jim
Smith had maintained his usual A average. And,
poor George Jones had received two D's. The pro-
fessor was evidently too busy to send out the penny
post cards that the students had inserted within the
covers of their final blue-books or, his time was so
taken up that he could not be bothered answering
the telephone calls from the worried students. In-
stead, he must announce to the world that Bill
James did not pass the course. The student's down-
fall is a thing that should be known to all. Does it
create a great incentive for the student to try harder
and work more diligently? Should college students
be shamed into doing their work? Should they be
made the object of the pointed jests of the wise-
cracking students? A person's mark is more or less
a personal thing. It should be the student's privilege
to disclose his mark when he is questioned con-
cerning it. No man relishes the thought of having
his ignorance broadcasted. Every person has a cer-
tain amount of pride although it cannot always be
perceived at times.
It is the desire of the Technic that those Pro-
fessors who post the marks of their courses will
discontinue the practice. The Professors would not
trifle with a live, high tension wire. Is not the
inferiority complex of a student as powerful a thing?
The mental attitude of a student can aid or hinder

The Paris Gun
THE PARIS GUN, By Henry W. Miller. 228 pp. New York:
Jonothan Cape &amp; Harrison Smith. $3.75.
At last a real engineers' romance has been writ-
ten. The lady's name is Bertha, and she set Paris
agog in the most impressive fashion in which it has
ever been done. Although she was a rather noisy
individual, a shroud of mystery has surrounded her,
since her disappearance in 1918. The lady in ques-
tion is none other than the "Big Bertha", which
fired shells on Paris from a distance of seventy-five
miles, during the great German offensives of 1918.
The story opens in Paris in the spring of 1918,
with the first bombardment by the great German
gun, known as the "Big Bertha", or as "The Paris
Gun". The complete mystification and incredulity
of the Allied Forces that a gun seventy-five miles
away was firing on Paris, and their efforts to secure
information regarding its construction and location
provides an insight into the machinery of war which
becomes an intense pleasure. In a flowing narra-
tive style, the reader is told about the development
and construction of both the big gun and the shells
which it fired. Next comes the authentic informa-
tion on the second, third, and fourth great German
offensives, and the part which the great gun played
is vividly portrayed from both the Allied and Ger-
man sides of the front. The final curtain is rung
down on the great drama with the signing of the
armistice.
It required ten years of painstaking search in
every part of Europe to obtain the information in
the book. All written information on the design,
construction and operation of this great gun was
carefully assembled and hidden away after the war.
For anyone to reveal any information about the gun
was declared high treason, punishable by death.
But Col. Miller, who served during the war as
Chief Engineer for the heavy artillery of the
American Expeditionary Forces, did not allow his
interest in the great gun to be dampened by this,
and worked unceasingly, until he had ferreted out
complete information concerning it.
The book is very well illustrated, which adds
much to the picture of the war which the book
presents. The illustration which appears on page
6 of this issue of the Technic is one of the illustra-
tions in the book.
New Staff
The Chemical number of the Technic is the first issue
to be put out by the new staff and they have met and
conquered a great many of the difficulties incident to
beginners in the publication world. The whole-hearted
support of the old staff and former editor enabled the
present staff to combat these difficulties and they wish
to thank them for their untiring efforts and good advice.
—The Editor.
Tryout Policy
Due to the unusual response to the annual call for
tryouts this year, the selection of assistants on the
Technic will be very competitive. Thirty-five men have
reported for assignments in the past two weeks and the
majority have been given either routine work or have
been placed under some member of the staff. Appoint-
ments for next year's staff and assistants will be made
from this group. Selections will be governed entirely
on the basis of merit. The business assistants will be
selected from men who have sold the most ads and
student subscriptions and the editorial assistants will be
chosen for their ability to write and organize technical
material for publication. Many new and unique
methods will be employed to obtain student subscrip-
tions and a trip to Denver, Colorado, to attend the En-
gineering College Magazines Associated Convention,
will be given to the tryout securing the greatest num-
ber of paid subscriptions. Several new systems of
securing both advertising and articles of a technical
nature will be instituted so that more men can com-
pete and serve the Technic than have done so in the
past. The business department is undergoing a com-
plete revision and will soon be operating efficiently
with its new personnel. An advertising campaign is
under way now which will require the services of six
or eight tryouts and many other enterprises will enable
the tryout to occupy his spare time advantageously.

COLLEGE NOTES
CHEMISTRY IN MODERN WARFARE
AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY LECTURE
AVERY pertinent subject, one that should be
of especial interest to every one of us, was
recently discussed here by Major General
Harry A. Gilchrist, chief of the chemical warfare ser-
vice of the army. The extremely interesting lecture
was given at the natural science auditorium, under
the joint auspices of the university and the local
chapter of The American Chemical Society. The
Major General spoke about the application of chem-
istry in warfare with especial emphasis on gases and
smoke screens. He started the talk by giving a
brief history of the use of gas as a weapon in the
Greek and Roman armies and carried its develop-
ment down to the world war where it was first
applied in a scientific manner by the Germans. A
vivid impression of the potency of gas as a weapon
was created when Mr. Gilchrist made the statement
that if the German Army would have had a suffi-
cient supply of gas when they made their first sur-
prise attack on the allies, the duration of the war
would probably have been a matter of a few months
instead of four long years, for in those days the
allies had no means of self protection.
A new era has dawned in regard to both the
defensive and offensive methods of using gas in
warfare and it appears that gaseous warfare is not
so inhumane as is commonly supposed. Scientific
investigation has done much toward discovering
means of combating gas and the speaker is of the
opinion that with the intelligent application of
known approved methods the gas attack would be
far less destructive than the use of explosives. Re-
search is being conducted at Edgewood Arsenal con-
cerning the methods of manufacture, employment,
and physiological treatment of various gases, the
most common ones being phosgene, chlorine, lacri-
mators, mustard, and others of the mercapton type,
has been made because of the difficulties involved.
&gt;eing done about the
Some investigation is also
possibilities of carbon monoxide but little progress
in keeping the gas close enough to the ground so as
to be effective. Methods of attack are being studied
in regard to effectiveness, concentration, distribu-
tion, and weather conditions. Extensive work has
been applied to the study of smoke screens as de-
fense mechanisms and some exceptionally good
pictures of screens were shown during the lecture;
the effectiveness being readily appreciated when
presented in this manner.
The lecture had a particular value because it
eradicated some erroneous impressions, held by
many of us, concerning the humaneness of gas dur-
ing the last war. Gases have many different physio-
logical effects, some being toxic and others non
toxic; they are also corrosive to animal tissue or
non corrosive depending upon the particular gas in
question. Some are lung irritants, some nerve irri-
tants, while others act on the olfactory or visionary
organs so as to produce unpleasant odors or tem-
porarily obstructed vision. The ideal in view of the
scientist is to produce a non toxic gas which will
disable the human body for a sufficient length of
time so that the individual who is suffering will
require the attendance of two or more people to
enable him to recover. This method, it is thought,
will keep so much of the fighting force out of the
fracas and will consume so much effort and expendi-
ture of money that the enemy will be forced to
withdraw, not because of casualties, but because
they haven't the economic means nor stamina to
meet the severe conditions imposed by this method
of attack. Some enlightening and authentic data
on the deaths caused by gas during the world war
indicated that of all the cases entering the British
hospitals to be treated for gas only 3 per cent died,
while of those entering to be treated for wounds
otherwise imposed 36 per cent died. The ratios as
applied to the American army were 3 per cent and


Page Seventeen
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
12 per cent in the same order. Other figures show-
ed that only one half of one per cent of the total
casualties in the war were caused by gas. This
disproves the idea that we had that gas caused such
a large percentage of horrible deaths and begins to
awaken us to the fact that the evil wasn't as bad as
we thought.

Aeronautical
There is a great bustle in the aeronautical de-
partment where repairs are being made on the wind
tunnel which was put out of operation a few weeks
ago by a bursting propeller. The accident was not
the result of carelessness, but happened because of
a lack of information concerning the active life of
wood propellers in wind tunnel service. The normal
life of a wood propeller under ordinary flying con-
ditions is about fifty hours and it was thought that
the propeller would last several times longer in the
tunnel, as the strain is much less. The knowledge
gained by the recent accident will prove valuable to
the department and the new propeller will be pro-
perly discarded before its useful life is over. Pro-
fessor Powlowski expects the tunnel to be in
operation in several weeks.

The wind tunnel research that was being done

Professor C. O. Wisler,
of the civil engineering
department, has been
working on a very in-
teresting problem for the
American government, a
problem of considerable importance.
The Rainy River flows northwesterly from North
Lake to the Lake of the Woods and forms part of
the international boundary between Canada and
The United States, along the northern part of Min-
nesota. Applications to use the power rights of
this river have been made to both the Canadian and
American governments and it is Mr. Wisler's job
to investigate the possibilities of the development;
the findings are to be reported to a joint committee
of the two nations. The project, being international,
encompasses a variety of problems which must be
settled before the rights are let as many power
rights now in operation will be directly affected.
The major issues that are being studied by Prof.
Wisler are: the amount of available water power,
advantages to others if storage is attempted, value
of storage, and cost of development, a bit of work of
no mean labor.

Daniel H. Burnham, 1846-1912
TIIK lives of some men are often, and in no
little part, actively concerned with the lives
of their personal associates. Such a man was
Daniel H. Burnham, America's great plan architect,
and the group of his intimate accpiaintances, com-

"boss" tenacity and
candor. The firm
prospered and, when Sullivan introduced steel, it
accepted the new medium joyously and employed
it in three important Chicago buildings, the Rook-
ery, the Monadnock. and the Masonic Temple.
Hence, when Chicago decided to have the
World's Fair of 1893, Burnham. then a well-known
success, was chosen as the "master builder." To
prepare, in three years, a World's Fair excelling the
Paris Exposition of 1885, was no small task, but
with the aid of such masters as St. Gaudens, Olm-
stead, Hunt, McKim, and countless others, work
began and continued so smoothly and harmoniously
under Burnham's efficient control that enthusiasm

completed with almost no friction. Burnham's
office turned out designs for over sixty minor
palaces and proved his power as a designer as well
as an executive.
All was finally done—and on all sides glowing
terms of praise were
pronounced. The Fair

Everything bore the

ceived many honors in consequence, among which
was the presidency of the American Institute of
Architects.
Amid all the progressive features of the exposi-
tion there protrudes one retrogressive error. Up to
the time of the Fair, the West had seen relatively
no classical architecture and hence, with Sullivan's
introduction of steel, was well along the lines of
developing a style which, happily, threatened to be-

Garages And Their Development
The Architect's New Problem
By Louis Kamper, Architect
THE automotive industry, a score of years ago
but an infant struggling for existence, is now-
growing into robust, corpulent maturity, ex-
panding, consuming, and overwhelming, until it
threatens to burst its bounds and escape in indus-
trial and social disaster. The unprecedented pro-
gress of the automobile is creating an ever-increas-
ing number of problems which must be met and
solved if that progress is to continue and its
detrimental effects
avoided. Such problems
as the establishment of
highways, the control of
city traffic, and the park-
ing of vehicles, if not
treated with as much
consideration as the
manufacture of the auto-
mobile itself, will be-
come impeditives to in-
dustrial advance and in-
jurious to social welfare.
The present inability of
these factors to keep
pace with the bounding
strides of the industry
has a 1 r e a d y claimed
many lives in accidents,
dissipated millions of
dollars in lost traveling
time, and is now causing
a great deal of incon-
venience in parking and
storage. 11 is this incon-
venience in parking and
the search for some remedy that is today command-
ing the interest of architects and engineers the world
over, promising a development that will solve the
problem both economically and aesthetically.
From the architectural standpoint, the garage
offers opportunity unlimited. Its new function, its
employ of new materials, and its important econo-
mic status assure an entirely modern style, different
from those in the past not only in form, but in spirit
and character as well. In the hands of the architect
of today and tomorrow lays the responsibility of
the nourishing and the developing of this new style

which, though now in its first stage, may ultimately
evolve into a great and powerful architectural ex-
pression of modern industry.
To insure the financial success of the garage pro-
ject several items must be brought under considera-
tion and carefully analysed. In general, the cost of
buildings of six stories or less should never exceed
the price of the land upon which it stands, assuming
that the value of the property will be directly pro-
portional to the desira-
bility of its location. In
the majority of existing
garages this ratio has
proven constant and reli-
able. The class of rentals
will also, to some extent,
determine the size of
investment and the
amount of dividends.
Of premier importance
to the garage is the effi-
cient planning of the
building and the choice
of the location. Close
proximity to a group of
apartments, theatres, or
office buildings will
greatly augment the
volume of regular busi-
ness as well as provide a
source of transient trade.
The planning of the
building itself is, doubt-
lessly, the most compli-
cated, yet the most im-
portant, of all the processes involved in the estab-
lishment of a garage system. The magnitude of the
project is determined by the size of the peak load
under which it is to operate at any time. Sixty per-
cent of the full capacity may arrive within a half
of an hour's time and require immediate attention.
The handling facilities and the parking space must
be sized to accommodate this concentrated, peak
load without delay or a loss of business wlil result.
A study of the hours during which certain groups
will use the garage may lead to an arrangement of
combining the commercial traffic of the clay with

the recreational of the evening and the permanent,
monthly storage.
The type of v.ertical transportation is the heart
of the whole garage system and should he chosen
with care, treating it in relation to the size of the
building, as the floor spaces occupied by the various
styles differ greatly and will effect the rentable area
of the building. Of general use, at the present time,
is the ramp method, employing the theory of the
inclined plane as a means of inter-floor travel.
There are several types used, chiefly the straight-
way ramp and the staggered floor system. In the
latter, the floors of half of the building are a half-
story above those of the adjacent part, thereby
shortening the ramp length and increasing the efti-

ciency to 51 percent over the 45 percent of the
straight-way ramp. Elliptical and spiral types have
also been built but have not proven entirely suc-
cessful, due to difficult handling of the cars. These
systems give an efficiency of 40 percent. One
superiority they have, however, it that they remove
the vertical transportation from the parking aisles
which must be kept as clear as possible. A novel
arrangement, known as the rotor-floor, has also
been employed, enjoying considerable success to
date. It consists of a large metal disc which rotates
and distributes the cars without the use of aisles,
increasing the efficiency and facilitating manage-
ment. The elevator, of relatively small use today
but of great potential advantages for the future, is,
perhaps, the most interesting of all the modes of
vertical travel. By law, every garage must be
equipped with one or more emergency elevators,
but, aside from this, few installations of importance
have been attempted due to their slow and cumbrous
nature and the big labor upkeep. Efforts to use
two-way and automatic types have failed to date,
only serving to discourage many elevator advocates
and to retard progress generally. Through recent
experiment and research, we have devised a scheme
whereby the existing objections seem to be obliter-
ated, opening the way for development in a new

I^BOOK SHELFJ
Domestic Gothic of the
Tudor Period
By Sidney E. Castle,
International Casement Co., Publishers
Domestic architecture scored an undisputed tri-
umph in the Tudor Age of England. Never, in the
history of the world, had any style more completely
succeeded to provide that homelike character and
comfort spirit than had English Gothic. Today, the
architect has been quick to realize the fine domestic
value of the Gothic style, particularly of the Tudor
period, and has used it as his material exemplar and
as his guiding inspiration in the design of his build-
ings and houses. That any style, having lived its
life centuries ago midst a civilization demanding
different requirements and offering distinct, indi-
vidual influences, can be, with impunity, reinstated
in a modern age is questionable and has been de-
clared even impossible by many authorities, but the
fact remains undisputed that, of all the styles that
have gone before. Domestic Tudor has more in
common with the requirements and influences of
our present-day life than any other. The commu-
nities to which it was fashioned and the materials
of which it was built differ, undoubtedly, from ours,
but their diversity is less complete and their appli-
cation less objectionable. To date, attempts at
modern home architecture have so utterly failed to
give that desirable fireside quality that the employ
of Tudor form seems perfectly justifiable and
proper.
With this belief in mind, Sidney Castle, an emin-
ent British architect, undertook to compile a com-
prehensive collection of Tudor forms and charac-
teristics, attempting to portray in his work, not
only the material view, but also the thorough under-
standing of the controling spirit and the basic
thought. In this he has succeeded admirably. The
early section of the book he devotes entirely to a
well-formulated discourse on ''The Spirit of Domes-
tic Gothic." enumerating the various influences and
interpreting the wealth of inspirational content. He
continues with a study, firstly, of the larger house
and then the smaller, touching slightly the historical
background of each of the important examples and
elaborating on their architectural values and their
forms of construction. From the manner in which
he treats the subject of the small, country homes,
it can be seen that Castle has spent many years
among them, studying them, sympathizing with
them, and loving them, for his work is genuinely
ardent and intimate.

Architectural Construction
in Earthquake Regions
By WILLIAM H. IIOKIIS, Professor of Ueology
THE Pacific coast region of the United States is
included in one of the great earthquake belts of
the globe, and earthquakes of the first order of
magnitude have occurred in the eastern part of the
country; notably throughout the St. Lawrence Valley
in 1663, over the lower Mississippi Valley in 1811, and
in South Carolina—the so-called "Charleston Earth-
quake"—in 1887. Because with the exception of the
Pacific coast region the quakes have come at such long
intervals, the latest of them more than two score of
years ago, the idea seems
a "frame" house a considerable outlay will be required
to construct a frame which will be sufficiently strong
to firmly bind together into one rigid whole the several
floors, the roof, the staircases and the walls, which will
otherwise be thrown into vibrations of different time
periods and, moving in different directions at the same
time, will act as battering rams and rack the building to
pieces. Hence something more than the light sills and
"toenailed" studding characteristic of our American
residences is called for. The relatively heavy staircases
must lie very firmly held,
to be widely held that we
in the eastern part of
this country need not
concern ourselves about
our security from this
danger. There is really
no warrant for this feel-
ing of security, though
it is little likely that
many of us will go to the
expense of building our
homes and our office
buildings so as to with-
stand destructive earth-
quake shocks.
Wherever a city has
been partially destroyed by an earthquake we are bet-
ter equipped for laying out the city plan for earth-
quake protection for the destruction reveals the danger
zones. Buildings should, so far as possible, be kept off
lines of active faults and loose ground such as "filled"
areas, which might therefore be utilized for parks and
boulevards. For large structures such as office build-
ings, steel and reinforced concrete are suitable building
materials, but as in all structures of whatever kind,
neither care nor expense should be spared to supply a
rigid frame within which all heavy parts should be
firmly joined together—the structure should be made
"monolithic." In high buildings special care should be
given to the first three stories, for experience shows
that the earthquake shocks seldom go with much ampli-
tude above the third story. Stone or brick masonry is
the worst building material known for the reason that
it is nearly impossible to give a stone or brick structure
a "monolithic" property.
For smaller buildings wood is in general well suited,
though open to the danger from fire which has so gen-
erally followed as an aftermath of earthquakes whether
in an ancient or a modern city. If lumber is used for

TION TO BATTER DOWN THE WALLS.
both above and below,
and the floors and roof
must be most firmly tied
to the walls. Diagonal
braces to the studding
will be very important to
prevent the collapse of
the structure like a house
of cards under shock.
In masonry buildings
arch-work and heavy
cornices are to be avoid-
ed, although the former
has been very common
within the tropical earth-
quake districts where ar-
cades built out over the sidewalks in front of shops
have offered a walk shaded from the tropical sun.
Factory chimneys are by earthquake shocks usually
sheared off from torsional movements and at consider-
able heights above the ground; but I know of no way
of preventing this unless a steel or concrete frame were
to be built up around the chimney to a height of at
least 50 feet.
Because of the danger of a general conflagration
after the quake, the mains which bring the water sup-
ply to the city need very special protection. If an
active fault intersects the main, as did the San Andreas
fault the water main of San Francisco before the de-
structive earthquake of 1906, this main must have a
special device to meet the danger of its being sheared
off. Some form of flexible and extensible pipe similar
to a hose must be introduced or else a reserve supply
of water must be stored on the city side of any possible
active fault.
Railway lines, pipe-lines, curbs, and other continuous
lines crossing a district are flexed by the earthquake.
Railway lines are kinked up or sideways or in both ways.

IX every field of the modern engineering world,
there is a constant need of the knowledge of the
chemical engineer. Consequently, the output
of well trained men from the chemical engineering
department of the University of Michigan is yearly
increasing, and Michigan is proud of the large per-
centage of her sons that have
more than made good in their
chosen field. Among the many
who are outstanding, are several
who were granted degrees of
Bachelor of Science in Chemis-
try, but who graduated before
the College of Engineering was
definitely made a separate unit
of the University. We take
occasion to laud these men, who
have made outstanding contri-
butions to the world of chemis-
try, and the world at large. We
feel that these men are unques-
tionably more to be considered
as the lauded alumni of the En-
gineering College than of the
Literary school from which they
originally graduated.
Among the chemical engi-
neering alumni whose work is
known where ever civilization is established, is one
whose name has been often before the eyes of the
profession, a man well remembered upon the
campus for his interests in campus activities, and
for his success in his engineering studies.
In 1902, the Central High School of Buffalo, New
York, sorrowfully handed to one of its best Stu-
dents, a stamped and ribboned diploma bearing the
name of Marcus T. Eathrop. In the fall of that
Marccs T. Lathrop
same year, the young man entered the University
of Michigan, to major in Science, and graduated in
1905, to return at the beginning of the following
year to complete courses to give him his degree in
chemical engineering. The 'Ensian of that date
proudly proclaimed that Mr. Eathrop had served
upon the Frosh Frolic Com-
mittee, upon the 1905 J-Hop
Committee, and had held the
position of Toast-master at the
Senior Banquet, his graduating
year.
Fate ordained that Mr. Lath-
rop begin a specialized career
with the Franklin Motor Com-
pany, a position which he held
during the years 1906-07, having
attained the office of Chief of the
Metallurgical Department, and
Assistant Chief Engineer, before
leaving to enter the services of
the Holcomb Steel Company,
where he carried on his work till
1911, as Metallurgist and Chief
Mechanical Engineer. In 1911.
Mr. Lathrop entered the ser-
vices of the Timken Roller
Bearing Company, a firm which
was destined to become all powerful in its field due
largely to the efforts and researches of Mr. Lathrop.
Starting in as Metallurgist, Mr. Lathrop soon at-
tained the position of Assistant Factory Manager,
and not satisfied with successfully holding that of-
fice, quickly found promotion successively to the
offices of Factory Manager, Assistant General Man-
ager, and Vice-President and General Manager; and
lately has become President of the Timken Company.

Mr. Lathrop's special interest, and most outstand-
ing work has been in the development of the manu-
facture of electric steel, a field that absorbed his
attention when relatively new, and a field that fate
had ordained to become an outstanding part of the
engineering construction program. His first experi-
ments of note were carried on while in the employ-
ment of The Holcomb Company in the days when
electrically created steel was considered a nice
experiment but scarcely in the field of commercial
importance with the cheaper and at that time more
easily manufactured crucible steel However, in the
face of traditional opposition against a new regime
of manufacture, Mr. Lathrop carried on his research
until his work has at last become not only more
important than the older methods of manufacture,
but the product is universally conceded to be far
superior to the crucible steel. The authorities of
Timken graciously acclaim Mr. Lathrop as the one
who has been 100% the cause of the enormous
growth and progress of the Timken Company.
Mr. Lathrop. besides serving at one time upon
the faculty of the university, is prominent in the
American Society of Mechanical Engineers), the
American Chemical Society, the Society of Auto-
motive Engineers, and the Iron and Steel Institute
of Great Britain.
The Technic has always been indebted to the
chemical engineering department of the University,
but it is without thought of this obligation, indeed,
that we take this opportunity to follow the upward
curve of the success of perhaps the outstanding
graduate of the department, and indeed, one of the
outstanding alumni of the College of Engineering.
It is with real pleasure that we take this opportunity
to present to our readers an outline of the career of
one of whom our profession should be justly proud,

NOTHING ROLLS
LIKE A BALL
Ball bearings are the bearing "jewels" of industry—
and represent man's greatest triumph over friction,
wear and waste. For they are built on the principle
of the rolling ball-and nothing rolls like a ball. No other
moving object is so friction free—none so strong at
every point. The steel ball has no weakest spot.
New Departure Ball Bearings are self-contained
units in which steel balls of marvelous accuracy and
enormous strength roll freely and smoothly between
grooved race rings. Both balls and raceways are made
of high carbon chrome alloy steel, the most uniformly
enduring bearing metal known.
Strength, silence, compactness and endurance—
these are attributes of the New Departure Ball Bear-
ing. Their initial cost may be more than that of other
types of bearings—but they are worth more.Their in-
herent freedom from friction saves power, reduces
wear and lengthens the life of motor cars, electric
motors, machine tools, farm machinery, and every
kind of mechanism into which they are engineered.

of forming powder into grains, progressing to the
point where in 1800 it was being formed in grains
and the various sizes were being used for specific
purposes. During all of this time, however, no
progress had been made in the discovery of any
new combinations and even as late as our own
Civil War the only combination for use as a pro-
pellent in a cannon was this same original 13th
century mixture of sulphur, charcoal and saltpetre.
Considerable progress was made, however, between
1850 and 1860 in the molding of this black powder
into grains of predetermined size and shape. This
was because there was beginning a recognition of
the importance of controlling the rate of the burn-
ing of the powder. The molding of the powder into
grains of considerable size reduced the burning
surface to such an extent that the combustion was
not nearly so rapid as with smaller grains and the
pressures within the still very weak cast iron guns
were kept within the strength of the metal.
Unusual progress was made in the art of making
cannon in the period from 1855 to 1870. At the
close of the Crimean War, during which the per-
formance of British cannon can hardly be said to
have been creditable, a British iron manufacturer
named Armstrong was assigned the task by the
British crown of determining what might be done
in the making of cannon from wrought iron. He
was assigned also the development of a satisfactory
breech loading cannon. A Mr. Witworth, a manu-
facturer of fine tools, was requested to undertake
researches to determine how cannon and small arms
could be rifled. A Mr. Bessemer was asked to
undertake research to find a more satisfactory ma-
terial than cast iron for making cannon. The re-
searches of these three men and their associates
began a development that very quickly left the
crude properties of black powder far behind. Until
this time the black powder had been superior to the
cannon. The metallurgists, artisans, and designers
had now7 gone far ahead, and the next move was up
to the powder chemists.
It was discovered in 1845 that ordinary cotton,
when treated with a mixture of nitric and sulphuric
acids, was changed into a substance highly inflam-
mable and powerful as an explosive. Attempts
were made to use it as a propellent in cannon but
both its manufacture and use roved prohibitively
dangerous. It was not until 1886 that a method was
found of converting this modified cotton termed
"gun cotton," into what we now know as smoke-
less powder. The gun cotton was colloided and the
resultant paste formed into squares, rods, cylinders,
sheets and grains. The burning of this colloided
gun cotton was satisfactorily uniform and the rate

of burning could very easily be controlled through
formation into grains of different forms and sizes.
In 1890 cordite, a mixture of gun cotton and nitro-
glycerine, was invented and has been in use in
European armies ever since. The powder chemists
had now caught up with the metallurgist and artisan
in the making of cannon.
In 1893 an Army officer, Munroe, patented for
the United States a powder which he called indurite,
consisting of gun cotton, freed of its nitrates and
colloided by a special process. This was rolled into
strips and dried by the action of steam and hot
water. In 1894 a lieutenant, Bernadou, of the United
States Navy, took up the work and in 1897 patented
a powder more uniformly nitrated than that of
Munroe and colloided in a different manner. This
is the service powder in the United States at the
present time and is almost identical to that produced
by the Russian, Mendeleff, in 1890. This is the
service powder used in both cannon and small arms
by our own troops during the World War and since.
The German Armies used cordite throughout the
war as did also the French and British Armies. The
American powder is always formed into grains;
British and German powder practically always into
tubes resembling macaroni; while the French pow-
der is used in sheet form and resembles heavy card-
board.
High Explosives
Among the earliest known high explosives are the
fulminates of gold and silver which have been
known probably since 1600. The credit for their
discovery is generally given to a Dutchman named
Drebbel. It was not possible to put either to any
practical use in artillery, however, because of their
extreme sensitiveness. During the 17th century
these were frequently made by traveling entertain-
ers, fakers at country fairs, and were detonated in
small quantities for the amusement of spectators.
It was in 1814 that an inventor named James Shaw,
of Philadelphia, devised a steel cap or cup filled
with fulminate of mercury and used it as a primer.
Until this time cannon had been touched off with
what was termed a match, and small arms had been
fired through the use of a match, first applied by
hand and later by means of a lock. This was fol-
lowed by the flint locks, hammer and wheel. All
of the earliest American rifles, termed Kentucky
long rifles, were provided with flint locks. The in-
vention of Shaw was a really great one. as can
readily be understood by all who have any appre-
ciation of the inconvenience and inefficiency of the
flint lock. This primer very quickly came into
general use and it was this development, that is, the
safe use of fulminate of mercury, that was directly
responsible for the development of breech loading
small arms.
From the earliest known use of hollow earthen
spheres, termed shells, in the 16th century, until
almost the end of the 19th century, the explosive
was the same black powder as that used to propel
the shell. The fuses employed to set off the black
powder were extremely crude. They likewise con-
tained black powder mixed with earth or some
other ingredient to make them burn more slowly.
The huge cast iron shells employed in our own
Civil War were filled with black powder and the
fuses were conical wooden tubes driven in with a
mallet and sawed off just before firing to the desired
length to cause them to burst at the proper time. If
the shell burst after it struck, it served as a sort of
demolition mine. If it burst in mid-air, the result-
ant fragments of the shell had a shrapnel effect and
this was the first form of shrapnel.
High explosives which could be used as burst-
ing charges in shells were not developed to the
point of being available for practical use until
1885, when a French chemist, Turpin, pointed out
the advantages of picric acid which had been dis-
covered in 1771 in connection with the dyeing of
silk. This was adopted by the French government
for use in shells under the name of melinite. It was
used in Great Britain under the name of lidite and
continued to be used by them even in the World
War. Ammonium picrate, which goes under the
name of Explosive D in the American Army, came
into use in the American Army in about 1901. It is
as insensitive as picric acid itself and is therefore
excellent for armor piercing shells. It does not
detonate even under the terriffic shock from the
impact of an armor piercing shell with 12 inch
hardened armor plate. This is one of the necessary
qualities of a shell for use against armor plate.
It must not detonate until caused to do so by the
primer after it has passed through the armour.
TNT was first made in about 1880 and in 1890
its manufacture was taken up in Germany for use
as a commercial explosive. In 1902 it was adopted
for filling shells and other military uses. It was
adopted in America in 1904. England did not use
it to any great extent until the World War.
Tetryl, which is made from benzine, was discov-
ered in 1880. Its making is very tedious. It is a
more powerful explosive than TNT, picric acid or
Explosive D and it is also somewhat more sensi-
tive. It is not dangerously sensitive, however, and
is highly suitable for use in detonators and as a
primer for high explosive shells.

Production Costs
Industry must be equipped to meet sterner competition. This
means Industry must be "Timken Bearing Equipped," and to you
student engineers, future guardians of the nation's industrial
prosperity, will come the opportunity to still further broaden
Timken's scope for economical production.
For Timken can carry this responsibility as no other bearing be-
cause Timken carries all loads capably—radial or thrust, or both.
Lifting friction's load from power, production piles up into peaks.
Maintenance cost swerves sharply into valleys. Lubricant ex-
pense clings closely to zero.
Exclusive with Timken are these distinct advantages—Timken
tapered construction, Timken POSITIVELY ALIGNED ROLLS and
Timken-made steel.
It is through these advantages that Timken cuts production costs
... through them "Timken Bearing Equipped" has become a uni-
versal guide for replacement of all types of industrial machinery

through the various mechanical developments in the
making of black powder from the crude mixture of
the 13th century to grained blasting and priming
powders as developed in the last century. Before
black powder passed out as a common propellent, the
use of mercury in percussion caps had become quite
common both on muzzle loading guns and later on
the breech loading type. In the latter case of course
the fulminate caps were pressed into the bases of
the paper or metal cartridge cases. Black powder
as a propellent was followed by various develop-
ments of gun cotton under the names of smokeless
powder, cordite, and so forth, which in their more
refined forms"are still in use.
Beginning about 1870 more powerful explosives
were substituted for black powder in, first, the
spherical shells, but more generally in the cylin-
drical types, and we are still using the same ex-
plosives, more refined as to manufacture and there-
fore as to stability, uniformity in operation and
safety in storage. A great deal of research has been
conducted in the last ten years to render some of
these powders flashless for use at night, and, since
the demand for increased range in our cannon has
become incessant, much research has been devoted
to powders that may be used safely and uniformly
at much higher pressures. The powder used in the
German long range guns for the bombardment of
Paris operated safely and with fair uniformity at
pressures as high as 70,000 pounds per square inch.
The smokeless powder commonly used in the
American Army could not be safely used at this
pressure. Black powder is still in use in large
cannon as a priming charge, that is, a small bag
of black powder is very generally put in as a base
charge because it ignites and burns more readily at
low pressures. It is probable that it will continue
to be used in this manner for many years to come
because smokeless powder does not burn readily at
low pressures and it is difficult to ignite a charge
of smokeless powder from any type of primer that
we have found practicable to use in our cannon. o ■

Cheaper power! Groping after this modern touchstone to
wealth, deluded inventors slaved over perpetual motion
machines . . . informed inventors evolved the turbine . . .
broad visioned men harnessed the rush of waters . . . en-

While, step by step, this progress has taken place, the
many men who have contributed to it could not know
what far-reaching results it would have. Now the ultimate
boons grow clear. Water power development becomes a
national policy, steam bids fair to rival water power for
cheapness, economically produced power brings more
plentiful goods, lights houses and hauls crowds in cities,
is carried to rural sections to lift washday drudgery from
farm women's shoulders.
Among the many industrial victories that are behind this
revolution, none is more important than wider knowledge
of piping materials and better materials. One of the highly
prized chapters of our history is the contribution that Crane
research and valve engineering has made to the general
advance. The results of this research are embodied in a
Crane book, Pioneering in Science. It is a fascinating story

fragmentary evidence into the most luminous and life-
like pictures. His interest in the human figures of his
story, his sense of the dramatic, his powerful appeal
as a narrator, his use of vivid, dynamic detail give him
the quality which has made the "New Biography" of

denly intrigue the popular reading public. Fiske,—I

to have come in person first from the scenes he de-

and its fierce light glowing in his eyes. No one who
enjoys a thrilling story vividly told need hesitate to
adventure in these romantic records.
His pictures of Indian life are not only fascinating in
their picturesque quality but are thoroughly authentic.
They were based on his intimate acquaintance with these
considerable remnants of the Indian tribes still left in
his day on the Western Plains and around our Cireat
Lakes. He lived in their villages, he took the trail with
them on their long hunting expeditions, he studied the
evidences of their past. On the basis of this experience

he has given us the greatest and most reliable picture of
human society as it existed in the Stone Age that is to
be found anywhere in historical literature. His Indians,
unlike those of Cooper or Prescott, are men of flesh
and blood. He presents them without either vilifying
or idealizing them. One needs to read his Oregon
Trail to appreciate what his contribution of these studies
in primitive life cost him.
The Histories present the great drama of the
struggle between France and England in an unbroken
sequence of events. The Pioneers of France in the
New World begins with the Hugenots in Florida and
their tragic struggle against the colonies of Spain.
Then follow the Jesuits in North America, and La Salle
and The Discovery of the Great Northwest. The narra-
tive pauses, in The Old Regime in Canada, to analyze
the French methods of colonization. Then the story
proceeds from one climax to another through Fron-
tenac and New France under Louis XIV, A Half Cen-
tury of Conflict, Montcalm and Wolf, and ends in Tin-
Conspiracy of Pontiac. Fiske's summary of the series
is so comprehensive that I again venture to quote from
his essay on Parkman,
In the first volume we see men of the Stone Age at
that brief moment when they were disposed to adore
the bearded new-comers as children of the Sun; in the
last we read the bloody story of their last and most
desperate, concerted effort to loosen the iron grasp with
which these pale faces had seised and were holding the
continent. It is a well-rounded tale, and as complete as
anything in real history, where completeness and finality
arc things unknown.
For more than twenty-five years I have read and
reread my Parkman. Perhaps my interest has been
somewhat determined by some personal circumstances.
As a very small boy I listened to my mother's thrilling
narrative of her life among the Ojibways on Lake
Superior. As a seventeen year old girl she had left
school in Ann Arbor to go to a lonely little mission
station that was for those days as remote as the Klon-
dike. Her tribute to the courtesy and chivalry of her
primitive friends left a lasting impression on my young
mind. As an older boy, I lived in the romantic setting
of one of the great outposts of the Astor Fur Trading
Company at Prairie du Chien. Here I knew personally
Indians, Half-Breeds and French, trappers, traders, and
farmers. Most of my summers for years have been
spent around the Great Lakes, with an occasional visit
to Quebec and the lower Saint Lawrence. It is per-

Parkman's volumes of intense interest and value to me.
But to anyone who realizes how much richer life
seems, how much more perspective it has when it is
lived with a consciousness of the past out of which it
came, Parkman is a priceless source of pleasure.

Those Boulevardiers that frequent the Great
White Way received a most inspiring performance
at the Little Round House Theatre, on the 30th
of January. The All-talking, Technicolor Picture,
"The Art of Living," produced by the Michigan
Engineering Society, under the able leadership of
that Director of Directors, Ferdinand N. Menefee,
is one that will live forever in the minds of play-
goers. H. C. Sadler acted as the "Master of Cere-
monies" in the most capable manner. The clever
interpretation of the theme song "The Engineer"
will never be forgotten. Such catchy lines as:
"The Engineer came down the track,
His heart was all serene,
He awoke as he passed the fatal block,
But, thank God—the light was green."
will be sung by college poies in years to come.
The first scene opened in a large banquet room
of the Union Hotel, the locale being Ann Arbor.
The room was filled with men from all walks of
life. Bald-headed Engineers could be seen at each
table eating and enjoying food as they had never
enjoyed it before, (probably the first real meal in
some time). At one end of the hall was a large
table, seated at one end of which was Welcome,
this part very cleverly played by Prexy. "Men of
Michigan—Engineers, we must march onward,"
yodelled Prexy and as of yore the Engineers picked
up their approximation slabs and scuffled out.
The next scene opened in the little Round House
on the Washtenaw Division of the University Line.
We see the characters all assembled on the stage
groping in the darkness for their lines. Finance
rushes forward :—Ah-aha-boop-boop-a-doop, I am
Finance.
"You Engineers must conquer me
I rule the world of destineee—Wheee"
Business:—"Zing, Hear Ye, Hear Ye;
You Engineers must all be brave
For I will make you all—My Slave, Grrrrrrrrrr.
Builder:—"Engineers depend on me
I build Libraries by the sea,
Where you rest your weary wiles
And leave it all with gracious smiles."
Chorus:—"The greatest men that rule the Land
and Sea
Are the Engineers by gee."
One of the most outstanding performances of
scientific magic was performed by the Interlocutor.
Even before his appearance in this picture he had
won for himself the renown of the world. He is one
of the only men in the world that has been able
to make a woman talk when she knew she was not
able. He was most modest when the reporters
asked him about it all. He only replied: "I thought
it best to let her talk after having been bottled up
for two years. It was indeed an interesting ex-
plosion."
Those who missed this picture should make a
special effort to see it when it appears in a.return
engagement, January 30th, 1931. It is a picture
that can never die. The songs will make it be re-
membered forever. Who can forget, "The Engi-

WHAT SHALL I READ?
(Continued from page 34)
Introduction to the Pioneers and the other from The
Conspiracy of Pontiac which may seem to give an
intimation of the flavor of Parkman's style.
The French dominion is a memory of the past; and
when Zi'e evoke its departed shades, they rise upon us
from their graves in strange, romantic guise. Again
their ghostly camp-fires seem to burn, and the fitful
light is cast round on lord and vassal and black-robed
priest, mingled with wild forms of savage warriors,
knit in close fellowship on the same stern errand. A
boundless vision grows upon us; an untamed continent;
vast wastes of forest verdure; mountains silent in
primeval sleep; river, lake, and glimmering pool; wil-
derness oceans mingling with the sky. Such zvas the
domain which France conquered for Civilization.
Plumed helmets gleamed in the shade of its forests,
priestly vestments in its dens and fastnesses of ancient
barbarism. Men steeped in antique learning, pale with
the close breath of the cloister, here spent the noon and
evening of their lives, ruled savage hordes with a mild,
parental sway, and stood serene before the direct shapes
of death. Men of courtly nature, heirs to the polish of
a far-reaching ancestry, here, with their dauntless hardi-
hood, put to shame the boldest sons of toil.
This memorable but half-forgotten chapter in the
book of human life can be rightly read only by the
lights numerous and widely scattered.
They were the pioneers of Northern America. We sec
them among the frozen forests of Acadia, struggling on
snowshocs, with some zcaudering Algonquin horde, or
crouching in the crowded hunting-lodge, half stifled in
the smoky den, and battling with troops of famished
dogs for the last morsel of sustenance. Again we see the
black-robed priest wading among the white rapids of
the Ottawa, toiling with his savage comrades to drag
the canoe against the headlong water. Again, radiant
in the vestments of his priestly office, lie administers the
sacramental bread to kneeling crouds of plumed and
painted proselytes in the forests of the Hurons; or.
bearing his life in his hand, carries his sacred mission
into the strongholds of the Iroquois, like one who
invades unarmed a den of angry tigers. Jesuit explorers
traced the St. Lawrence to its source, and said masses
among the solitudes of Lake Superior, where the boldest
fur-trader scarcely dared to follow. They planted mis-
sions at St. Mary's and at Michilimcickinac; and one
of their fraternity, the illustrious Marquette, discovered
the Mississippi, and opened a new theatre to the bound-
less ambition of France.

and magazines. Softness, therefore is a necessary
quality in this type of pulp.
Sulfate or Kraft pulp is made from the wood of
pines. The process is very similar to the soda process.
with the exception that the liquor used contains about
4 parts of sodium sulfide to 7 parts of caustic soda.
The fibres obtained are by far the strongest of the wood
fibres, but they are very hard to bleach, consequently
this pulp is used for most of our wrapping papers.
Sulfite pulp is made by treating spruce, balsam, or
hemlock with calcium and magnesium sulfites and an
excess of sulphurous acids. The chips are charged into
a digester made of a steel shell and an acid refractory
brick, which resists heat and acid. The liquor is then
added until a concentration of from 4 to 6 degrees
Raume is attained. These digesters are run at different
temperatures and for various lengths of time. Cooks
are completed in from six to seventy-two hours de-
pending on the method of operation used. The pulp
after cooking is blown from the digester against a
bronze plate, known as a target. The cooking liquor
is washed out with clean water and the excess water is
drained out through the perforated bottom. The pulp
must be thoroughly washed to prevent discoloration,
and then, if whiteness is desired, bleached with chlorine.
The pulp may be used directly or stored by running
over a wet machine as described in the formation of
groundwood. The pulp from this process is a long-
fibred, semi-harsh, pulp, used in the manufacture of
book and magazine papers and many writing papers.
There are also pulps now being made from straw,
corn-stalks, and many other raw materials, but at the
present time they are not important factors in the pulp
industry. Straw, however, finds one large use in the
making of straw-hoard.
The first step in making the paper from the pulp is
the beating of the fibre in a machine known as the
heater. The principle of this machine is to pass the
pulp between a roll, carrying steel knives about J 2 inch
thick, and a bed plate, covered with similar knives,
which action rubs the fibres, hydrates them, and breaks
them down into shorter lengths, with torn ends, which
gives them greater cohesion and consequently a stronger

Dynamite clears the way for modern engineering wonders
The
Cascade
Tunnel
America's longest
railroad tunnel built
with the aid of
DYNAMITE!
Alittle more than a year ago, the Great Northern
Railway trains began running through the Cascade
Tunnel . . . a tunnel that pierces the Cascade Mountains
for nearly eight miles out in Washington State.
Engineering skill had finished another great job ... in
record time. And dynamite helped to make it possible.
Du Pont Dynamite was used in driving the pioneer
tunnel ... in sinking a 622-foot shaft so that blasting
attacks might be carried on from four primary faces.
This mighty tunnel shortens the route . . . eliminates
troublesome grades and expensive snow-sheds . . . makes
passenger and freight service more efficient.
The first train breaks through the paper barrier!
It is only one example of the use of dynamite in modern
construction. Dynamite is indispensable in building
highways, bridges, skyscrapers, dams, subways. It is a
powerful tool which modern engineers could not well
do without.
The du Pont Company has had 128 years' experience in
making and improving explosives ... in testing them
for all types of blasting operations. A wealth of informa-
tion about explosives . . . and how to use them . . .
is contained in the Blasters' Handbook, a copy of which
will be sent you free upon request. It is not a textbook
. . . yet it supplements your studies. You will find it
valuable now . . . and tomorrow. Write for your copy.

sheet. The different ingredients are also added while
the pulp is still in the beater; resin and alum are added
to those papers which it is desired should he impervious
to liquids, and clay to those which are to have a smooth
finish. Coloring matter may also he added at this
stage.
After removal from the beater, the stock is passed
through what is known as a Jordan engine. This is a
cone-shaped casing, lined, longitudinally, with bars
similar to those in the beater, and into which a cone-
shaped plug also lined with similar bars, is fitted. This
plug revolves and may be adjusted according to the
amount of pressure to be applied. The action of the
Jordan engine is to cut the fibres down to a uniform
length.
The pulp is now ready to be run onto the paper
machine. An endless belt of fine wire mesh, 75 mesh
to the lineal inch, runs over a series of brass rolls and
suction boxes. The pulp runs out onto this wire and
a transverse shaking action helps to cross the fibres
and knit them together until it is carried to the press
rolls at the end of the belt. These are brass rolls held
together under a high pressure. The sheet is carried
between them on a felt, which reverses between the
presses so that each side of the paper will pass next to
the press.
After the sheet has passed the presses it is carried
into the driers, which are steel drums three feet or
more in diameter, and are steam-heated. From ten to
sixty of these driers may he used, and the sheet is
carried around about two-thirds of the circumference
of each, by means of a canvas belt. When the sheet
emerges from the series of driers, it is complete.
Roughness is removed by passing the sheet down
between a series of steel rolls known as the calender
stack. The bottom roll of the stack is the only power
driven roll, the others being turned by friction through
the sheet of paper as it passes through. The resulting
slippage is the action which polishes the sheet. Further
polishing, giving a very high finish, may be attained by
passing the paper through a super-calender, which
is similar to the calender with the exception that it
alternates hard-pressed-paper rolls with the steel rolls.
The paper adheres to the paper roll, but slips on the
steel, thus polishing it to a high degree. The finishing
of a sheet of paper depends, of course, on the use to
which it is to be applied. .Many papers are rolled
without any calender action at all. The finished paper
may be cut into sheets or rolled from either the driers
or the calender as desired.
The manufacture of rag papers differs from the
above procedure only in the fact that the drying is done
in a loft instead of over drying drums.
The size and importance of the paper industry to-
day can be conceived only when we realize that it is
the ni-ith largest industry of the country.

MOTOR FUEL RESEARCH
(Continued from page 13)
with a cold engine in a reasonably satisfactory man-
ner. If, however, it is necessary to continually
change the position of the choke with changes in
car speed, throttle, or other driving conditions, in
order to prevent stalling of the motor, the perform-
ance must be considered as unsatisfactory. Modern
cars are equipped with carburetors that supply an
additional charge of gasoline as soon as the throttle
is suddenly opened. These accelerating devices are
of particular advantage when driving a cold motor
as they usually make it possible to drive the car
with one choke setting within a few seconds after
the motor has been started, if the 10 per cent point
on the distillation of the fuel is not higher than
indicated above. Although it is possible to drive
the car under such conditions, satisfactory perform-
ance even with use of the choke is not obtained un-
less the fuel has sufficient volatility to supply a
mixture sufficiently rich to give approximately
maximum power when the throttle is suddenly
opened.
When considering starting of a cold motor, all
parts of the motor are approximately at the atmos-
pheric temperature and it is not necessary to make


Page Forty-Five

AN TECHNIC
any particular allowance for different engine char-
acteristics. However, as soon as the motor has
been started, differences in engine characteristics
become very noticeable. Some motors heat up
rather rapidly, and others not equipped with radia-
tor shutters or large manifold heaters take a much
longer time to become warm. For these reasons
it is not possible to state definitely the fuel require-
ments necessary to give satisfactory performance
with or without use of the choke unless we know
the temperature existing in the manifold of the
motor.
The results of an extensive series of tests indicate
that the temperature of the mixture in the intake
manifold of the motor may be related to the atmos-
pheric temperature as a function of the time after
the cold motor has been started, as indicated in
Figure 4. For example, with an atmospheric tem-
MINUTES AFTER STARTING
FIG. 4.
perature of 40° F., the mixture temperature in a car
equipped with radiator shutters will be about 70"
above atmospheric, or 110° F., two minutes after
the motor has been started. If the motor, however,
is not equipped with radiator shutters, but allows
the cold outside air to keep the air under the engine
hood cool, the mixture temperature will be about
80° F. at approximately the same time after start-
ing.
The effective volatility may be defined as the
air-fuel ratio supplied by the carburetor divided by
the air-fuel ratio burned in the cylinders immedi-
ately after the throttle is opened. The effective
volatility, as determined on a number of different
types of manifolds and motors, has been found to
be dependent almost entirely upon the temperature
of the mixture in the intake manifold. It has also
been found that the intake manifold is capable of
distributing up to 30 or 40 per cent of the fuel as a
liquid, depending upon conditions. Figure 6 gives
the relationship between the temperature of the 10

ratio, as a function of mixture temperature by the
straight line in the lower part of the figure. A
similar relationship between the temperature of the

per cent effective volatility in a 12 to 1 air-fuel

tures by the curved line next above. The upper two

THE lubrication system of the Standard

surance of a long lifetime of efficient per-
formance.
Filtered oil is automatically supplied
to all bearings within the column and in

assuring ample lubrication. A gauge on the
side of the column indicates the pressure.
A separate pump—-cam driven—supplies
oil to the knee mechanisms.
This assuranee of plenty of oil to all

Forty-five per cent effective volatility in an 8 to 1
air-fuel ratio is sufficient to make possible the opera-
tion of the car, by use of the choke. If the fuel
shows a lower effective volatility, it will be neces-
sary to choke the carburetor to a greater extent so
that a mixture ratio less than 8 to 1 will be sup-
plied by the carburetor. Such a mixture will be so
rich that it will become necessary to immediately
release the choke in order to keep the car running
steadily, as an 8 to 1 ratio is the richest mixture
that can be burned in the engine.
As soon as the manifold has become heated to
such a degree that the fuel has an effective volatility
of 55 per cent, which is related to the 35 per cent
point on the A.S.T.M. distillation, as indicated in


Page Forty-Seven
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Figure 5, practically perfect performance can be
obtained with the choke set at one position, if the
carburetor is equipped with accelerating devices;
or. if the carburetor is not so equipped it will be
just about possible to drive the car with one choke
setting.
This temperature, or rather the time at which this
mixture is reached, usually determines the end of the
warming up period, as it is possible to drive a car in
a fairly satisfactory manner without use of the
choke if the fuel has an effective volatility of 55 per
cent or more. For this reason the 35 per cent, point
on the A.S.T.M. distillation has been found to have
particular significance in indicating the length of the
warming up period.
As soon as the mixture temperature is sufficiently
high to indicate a 60 per cent effective volatility of
the fuel being used, practically perfect performance
can be obtained without use of the choke if the
carburetor is equipped with accelerating devices;
or, fairly satisfactory performance without use of
the choke if the carburetor is not so equipped. For
this reason the 55 or 60 per cent point on the A.S.
T.M. distillation indicates the end of the warming
up period on aviation motors or cars not equipped
with accelerating devices. Those motors equipped
with accelerating devices supply approximately an
8 to 1 air-fuel ratio immediately after the throttle is
opened, when the carburetor is adjusted to supply
a 12 to 1 air-fuel ratio under steady driving con-
ditions. For this reason a fuel showing 60 per cent
effective volatility under the operating conditions
will deliver a mixture ratio of about 13 to 1 to the
cylinders during the first stages of acceleration.
This mixture ratio is sufficiently rich to give prac-
tically maximum power or entirely satisfactory per-
formance. In fact it may be stated that modern
automobiles are built to operate with fuels between
(&gt;o and 70 per cent effective volatility.
If the fuel is completely vaporized under operat-
ing conditions, the accelerating device causes a
mixture ratio of 8 to 1 to be supplied to the cylinders
during the accelerating period. Such a mixture is
too rich for maximum power and causes a loss in
acceleration and increased fuel consumption as
compared with a gasoline which is not completely
vaporized. This is probably the most important
reason why the use of "high test" gasoline has de-
creased so rapidly in recent years as modern cars
equipped with accelerating devices have rapidly
replaced the old cars manufactured before the war
which were not equipped with acceleration devices.
However, this important point is frequently over-
looked and fuels of low end point indicating com-
plete volatility at low temperatures are frequently
considered superior for motor car operation. Al-
though absolutely necessary for satisfactory opera-

Accurate Control of Materials
INDUSTRY today demands closer and closer control of every
operation and every material employed in manufacturing. The
specially developed Bausch and Lomb Metal lographic Equipment
illustrated above affords microscopic precision in the observation
and photography of metal or other opaque specimens. It gives finer,
more accurate results than were ever possible before.
In developing such special optical equipment to speed production
and increase precision in many different fields, Bausch and Lomb
have contributed largely to modern industrial progress.
Your own production problems may be open to solution through
some special optical instrument. Bausch and Lomb scientists will
gladly cooperate in developing it.

tion of aviation motors, such fuels will not give the
best performance on modern motor cars for thje
reasons given.
As stated at the beginning of this discussion, a
low temperature for the 10 per cent point on the
A.S.T.M. distillation indicates easy starting at low
temperatures. This easy starting is made possible
by the fuel vaporizing readily at low temperatures.
Although necessary for easy starting, this character-
istic may cause serious trouble known as vapor-
lock if the fuel lines or carburetor become heated
to such a high temperature that the fuel begins to
vaporize before it is sprayed into the air stream
into the manifold. The fuel lines and jet of the
carburetor are designed to carry liquid fuel and not
vapor. If the fuel vaporizes, it becomes impossible
to supply a sufficient quantity of fuel in the mixture
to maintain proper engine performance. For this
reason the probable maximum temperature in the
fuel lin,es or carburetor is of great importance in
limiting the easy starting characteristics which may
be given to the fuel by lowering its 10 per cent point.
Extensive road tests indicate that the probable
maximum temperature may be estimated by adding
one-half the atmospheric temperature in degrees F.
to loo. For example, if the atmospheric tempera-
ture is 8o°, the probable maximum temperature of
the fuel in the fuel line will be 100 plus J/2 of 80,
or 1400 F. If the atmospheric temperature is —20°,
the probable maximum fuel temperature will be 100
plus y2 of —20, or 900 F. Therefore, the 10 per
cent point should be not lower than about 100 plus
one-half the average atmospheric temperature in
order to insure reasonable freedom from vapor lock.
In order to summarize the results of these in-
vestigations, the following table has been prepared
which is self explanatory.
Volatility Suggestions for Practically Constant
Engine Performance as Indicated
A modern motor car equipped with exhaust-
heated manifold, hot spot, carburetor accelerating
well, and radiator shutters is considered in making
these suggestions.

GARAGES AND THEIR DEVELOPMENT
(Continued from page 20)
direction. The plan is to have a battery of fast,
automatically controlled elevators spread the entire
length of the building, as illustrated in the sketch,
and fed by several large doorways. The driver will
place his vehicle on the elevator, lock it, and leave,
while the elevator will speed it to an unoccupied
compartment and, by a tilting, butterfly-like, track
device in the elevator floor, which is tripped at the
landing, the car will coast out into parking position
on another set of balanced, butterfly rails. The ele-
vator will automatically descend to the charging
floors, of which there may be any number, and
await the next client. To return the car, the eleva-
tor will rise to the signalled floor, trip the butterfly
rail, receive the car which would be set in motion
by the tilting device, and bring it down to the out-
bound platform. The single process requires about
a minute's time, all without the use of manual labor
save for the controlling attendant, who could pos-
sibly care for a battery of ten or twelve elevators.
The arrangement saves space, giving an efficiency
rate of approximately 60 percent; saves labor, the
big expense item in the garage; saves time; and
allows the owner to lock his car. The floor system
may be composed solely of the rails upon which the
wheels rest, or it may be of some light, thin material,
as steel sheets, to catch the dripping oil and falling
dirt. Tests have been made of this new principle
which assure its practical value and, hence, its
financial success. In relation to the multi-storied
streets of the future, this scheme is particularly well
adapted, allowing loading to take place at any
level.


Page Forty-Nine
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
There are several details of garage construction
which are regarded as standard whether the old
systems or the new be used. Parking compartments
of 7 feet by 15 feet are usual and require column
spacing of 21 feet for three-car bays, these having
proven, in the majority of cases, the most satisfac-
tory. The columns themselves, if rectangular or
slightly elliptical, will save space and allow freer
management of the automobile. To the loading
floors particular attention must be paid in order to
allow room within for those cars which arrive at
the rush hour and must await their turns. This
will eliminate undue traffic congestion, caused by a
waiting line in the street. Although it is wise to
provide a large number of entrances and exits, in
order to accelerate the rate of loading during peak
hours, it must be remembered that additional doors
require additional attendants and increases the pos-
sibility of automobile thievery. The entrances should
be isolated from any street intersection where traffic
tie-ups might occur and constrict the opening.
Waiting rooms and toilets, as in railway depots,
should be provided for passengers who are detained
while their cars are being delivered or serviced.
Filling stations and general accessory sales-rooms
are also necessary elements in the design.
In many foreign countries, astounding advances
have been made in the design of garages, during
the last decade, rather casting American results in
obscurity. France and Germany, especially, have
taken great pioneering steps in the creation of park-
ing methods, heretofore untried, in an attempt to
better the relative inconvenience and impracticabil-
ity of the present system. Paris is undertaking the
construction of great civic garages, utilizing base-
ment and underground areas and such space as
could not be used otherwise. Its engineers have
now under consideration a plan to reclaim the entire
subterranean area beneath the streets in the district
o fthe Church of the Madeleine and to construct
there a multi-story garage system following the
course of the avenues which surround the church
and providing an enormous acreage of parking space,
centrally located and easily accessible. Sweden and
Switzerland have made several innovations in spiral
ramps and other special equipment. And Japan,
although yet comparatively young in its automotive
development, has risen to the occasion and con-
structed several good garages.
American progress in automobile storage has
been decidedly retarded in proportion to the im-
mense industrial achievement, but, in view of the
popular interest inspired during recent years, this
'condition cannot long persist. The day is Hearing

when our cities will operate hugh, municipal gar-
age systems, employing either underground areas or
the non-productive space in the lower floor of tall,
business buildings. Each sizable theatre, apart-
ment, office building and department store will
probably own its own private garage in conjunction
with the main building, providing parking space for
their tenants and clients. The architectural require-
ment created by such a development is so large
and so exacting that, in the minds of some, the
future architect will not be able to grasp it and
properly treat it. Hov\ever, the opportunity is
there, not alone in garages, but in all other in-
dustrial buildings as well, commanding the archi-
tectural profession and especially its younger gen-
eration to a new era of new life, of new effects, and
of new creations.

ARCHITECTURAL CONSTRUCTION IN
EARTHQUAKE REGIONS
(Continued from page 22)
pipes arch up out of the ground, curbs are tilted up.
etc. These all indicate that the area of the earthquake
district has been reduced during the earthquake. Only
above loose ground where deep and wide fissures have
appeared are rails pulled apart and this is through sag-
ging in to the fissure.
Bridges of all kinds betray a similar evidence of a
shortening of distance along lines which cross the dis-
trict, and the measure of the contraction is apparently
greatest in valleys. Sometimes the bridge piers or
abutments bend in at the bottom toward each other
while held apart at the top by the rigid girder; at other
times the piers break across well up from the bottom
and the parts below the fracture slide in toward each
other whole the upper parts tilt backward; or again,
the girder is on one pier thrown by the shocks out of
its seat, and this pier then slides in beneath the girder
sometimes by a large proportion of its length—a fifth
or more. Probably the simplest way of designing the
bridge so as to meet this danger would be to build large
abutments and provide a horizontal plane of special
weakness within them well up from the bottom on
which the pier may shear off with the girder still re-
tained in essentially its original position upon still erect
though sheared piers. Repairs could easily be made after
this movement.
Nothing is more certain than that earthquakes will
recur where they have already been, and it is the part
of folly to ignore the warnings of the past and pretend
that not earthquake but fire was the real cause of the
calamity, as was done at San Francisco. Experience
shows that cities have been very slow to learn the les-
sons of experience, and in Southern Italy, cities have
been in some instances destroyed by earthquake more
than once before the lesson has been learned to move
"off the tracks" and find a site of relative security.
Such change has, moreover, not been brought about by
any conscious thought of possible improvement, but
only because it was found easier to move than it was
to clear away the wreckage of the disaster. However,
some cities, whatever their danger from earthquakes
must of necessity be rebuilt where they now stand and
this is notably true of San Francisco. The part of
wisdom is then to lay out the city so as to avoid the
places of special danger, so far as may be possible, and
to construct with due regard to the laws which have
already been worked out for earthquake districts.

the Fair reduced this modern progressiveness to
dim obscurity for twenty years after. But Burn-
ham had not done this intentionally. In seeking
impressiveness he had lost sight of the expressive
element. Sullivan's cause was lost, at least tem-
porarily, and he with others wept bitterly and
criticised savagely.
The Fair brought the McKim classical influence
upon Burnham to a great extent, this being ex-
pressed in his Post Office and Union Station in
Washington. Despite this fact, McKim himself,
criticized the latter very sharply, and perhaps, un-
justly. In the same city, Burnham made several
important contributions to the McMillan City Plan
which was then under legislative consideration.
However, his greatest work was realized as the
result of his aptitude for city planning. As senior
member of the firm he and his sons had formed,
he traveled extensively, visiting the principle cities
of the American continent and assimilating a com-
prehensive understanding of civic art. Returning to
Chicago, he found the influences of his earlier
works lived on, especially in the Outer Drive de-
velopment of the Lake front. He soon became an
authority on city planning and in that capacity he
had few peers, ranking unusually high in his chosen
profession. Despite all his national work, he did
not forget his firm work and continued to create
new architectural wonders everywhere by his many
innovations. The Flatiron Building in New York
illustrates this creative ability and also his extreme
love for steel construction.
After many years of real, progressive work he
died a famous man, honored on every side. His
art of city planning still lives and, undoubtedly, will
continue to live until the cities themselves perish.
He will be most generally remembered for his
masterpiece of direction at the World's Fair in 1893
which, while it may be his greatest triumph, is also
his gravest error.
THE ARCHITECTS BOOK SHELF
(Continued from page 20)
The more definite value of the book, however,
can be better associated with the clever, instructive
illustrations, which, for the most part, are the
author's own pen sketches. The sincere Tudor
spirit he produces in his text is magnified many
times in his well-understood sketch-studies which
abound in large proportions throughout the book.
The various houses and their many details are all
carefully delineated, each a little composition in
itself, delightful and inspiring. By virtue of these
authentic well-chosen sketches, supplemented by
photographs of some of the larger houses, the book
becomes a valuable reference for any architect or
artist, whether his interest be or not with the Tudor
style, for the intrinsic worth of his pen and ink
renderings applies to all art. And as a piece of
recreational reading, the work boasts unusual excel-
lence, written in that quaint, interesting style that
only an historically inclined Englishman can master.

fore The Supreme Court of The United States in

The Boulder Dam Project
JOHN E. OHLSON, '32E
IN the present age of engineering marvels, if the
reader is to he aroused to more than a passive
interest in current projects, it becomes necessary to
speak in superlatives. The proposed Boulder Dam,
when completed,
will l&gt;e by far the
highest yet con-
structed.
This project is
the logical out-
come of many
years' study of
the behavior of
the Colorado
River and the
problems associ-
ated with its flow.
They are: the
ever- increasing
need of water for
irrigation pur-
poses, the utiliza-
tion of the flow as
a source of power,
and the matter of
flood control. Al-
though it has been
only within the
last fewr years that the greatest forward steps in the
advancement of the project have come about, the first
investigation by geologists and engineers can be traced
back to 1901. From that time on, as proposals for the
diversion of water for irrigation purposes assumed a
more tangible form, the water rights of the several
states of the Colorado Basin became involved. To
resolve this difficulty, in 1922 the so-called Seven-State
compact was
drafted, the sign-
ing states being
Wyoming, Colo-
rado, Utah, New
Mexico, Nevada,
Arizona and Cali-
fornia. This com-
pact specified how
the flow of the
stream was to be
used, how water
rights were to be
determined, a n d
how disputes were
to be settled.
However, the fol-
lowing year saw
Arizona with-
drawn.
Also in 1922,
the first attempt
was made to se-
cure legislation
in congress favorable to the construction of a dam at
Boulder, or Black Canyon. The bill was the victim of
much postponement and filibustering, so it was not
until 1928 that it made its way through the House of

Representatives. The Senate, however, was fearful of
the feasibility of the project and saw fit to stop its
passage. In its place a resolution was passed instruct-
ing the Colorado River Board to make a comprehensive
survey of the situation, reviewing the previous plans
and estimates, and to submit its report by December.
This was duly effectuated, and the bill, modified after
the suggestions of the Board, was again presented,
passed, and received the President's signature on De-
cember 21. Appropriations must be made year by year
for the furthering of
the construction, but
l&gt;efore these are
available, certain
conditions must be
met.
The Flood
Problem
The Colorado
River drains an area
of about 244.000
square miles, and
has a total length
from its source to its
mouth in the Gulf of
California of about
1700 miles, with an
average fall of 4.5
feet per mile. The
average rain fall on
the drainage area is
about 10 inches,
w i t h large tracts
receiving but 5
inches, and the
average run-off is
less than \]A inches.
The principal source
of its flow is the
melting snow on the
mountains of the up-
per basin, and this
snow, melting at its
greatest rate in June,
brings about the
normal flood season. These floods are not unusual in
magnitudes up to 200,000 second-feet of flow and
careful investigation shows that that of 1884 probably
reached 380,000 second-feet. On the other hand, the
flow has often been observed as low as 1,200 second-
feet. It is easy to imagine the perplexing time that
farmers, dependent on irrigation, must experience. To
eliminate the extremes the proposed dam must obviously
control a huge amount of water. Towards this end, the
structure proposed in the Congressional bill is to "create
a storage capacity of not less than 20,000,000 acre-feet."
The dam planned will store 26,000,000 acre-feet.
It would be well to reiterate here, the site had been
specified in the bill to be at either Boulder Canyon or
Black Canyon. The Boulder Canyon proper is located
just above, or, rather, just to the east of the sharp
southward bend of the Colorado on the division line
lietvveen Arizona and Nevada, whereas Lower Black
Canyon is perhaps twenty miles downstream. Either
site would be admirable in the absence of an alterna-
tive. Of the two, however, the Black Canyon site has
advantages, chief of which are: the gorge is narrower,
the rock slightly
easier to work and
tunnel, yet showing
less faults than that
at Boulder, and the
surrounding country
is a trifle more ac-
cessible. In detail,
the canyon walls at
this site rise to about
900 feet above the
level of the river, and
the central part of
the gorge is from
110 to 127 feet deep
below low water.
The cross-section of
the gorge at the dam
site is 350 feet wide
at the crest of a dam
which would im-
pound 26,000,000
acre-feet of water.
The surrounding
country is rugged,
yet the terrain above
the 1500 foot con-
tour, where the
quarries, railway
yards, shops, and
camps will be locat-
ed, is open and it
can be developed for
such use within a
reasonable figure.
The foundation rock is a volcanic breccia, or tuff, well
cemented into a tough, durable mass which is ideal in
every essential for tunneling and use in construction
work. Good gravel and sand is available and a railway
from Las Vegas to the site would pass near several
sources. Las Vegas, Nevada, is the nearest town
located on a railroad, and is about twenty-five miles
from the site.
The Boulder Dam
The dam proper is of undisputed interest. The
structure proposed by the Bureau of Reclamation is of

What Shall I Read?
Dollar Editions
By J. RALEIGH NELSON, Professor of English
CIRCULATING libraries have made lwoks easily
accessible everywhere in this country. One
hardly finds a town of a thousand or more
without its public library. It may be only a store on
Main Street transformed and dedicated to its new use
by some one's taste—a few growing plants in the
windows, a few pictures on the walls, and books allur-
ingly displayed,—but it is more
often a snug little building em-
bowered in the village trees at
some strategic corner. There are
even travelling libraries and ex-
tension services which carry
books to remote and isolated cor-
ners where no permanent collec-
tions can be maintained. These
libraries, with their book lists,
their book talks, their book dis-
plays, have been one of the potent
influences working for popular
education. One has only to ob-
serve the types of men and wo-
men who haunt the public libra-
ries of great cities like Chicago,
Boston, or New York, to realize
how genuine and how universal is
the interest in books and how
much in the course of a few gen-
erations it must affect the general standards of intelli-
gence. The present popular movement for adult edu-
cation began really only as a recognition and an at-
tempt to direct consciously the training of people past
school age. Fifty years before the phrase adult edu-
cation was coined, reading clubs, magazine clubs, ladies'
library associations, and circulating libraries, were pro-
viding books for their members, and men and women,
often with no more than a high school diploma, were
supplementing their limited education by reading. Mr.
Carnegie's libraries, in most cases, merely housed and
made possible the extension of collections of books
that had been growing up with the communities which
they served for years.
With the increase in the public library services,
making books available to everyone at practically no
expense, it has been only natural that book collecting
as a private enterprise should decline. Other circum-
stances also have contributed to reduce the place of
the library in the average private home. The cost of
books has been enormously increased. Whereas twenty
THIS month Professor Nelson
points out that, with the pre-
valence of circulating libraries
and the decline of book collecting
as a private enterprise, the dollar
editions of recognized works
present a possible solution of the
present problem for book lovers.
Each month Professor Nelson
presents a carefully chosen line
of books for the convenience of
the Technic readers who have
but a limited amount of time to
devote to non-technical reading
matter.

years ago the latest novel cost a dollar and a quarter,
it now costs from two and a half to three dollars.
Then, in an age when the majority of people live in
small apartments or in tiny bungalows, there is no room
for an accumulation of books. A few dozen volumes
effectively—often ostentatiously—displayed may serve
as an evidence of ones intellectual past, but the
library as a private institution
has gone. It is also true that in
this restless age when no one
remains more than a year or two
in the same place, books are a
real burden. When one has
packed and unpacked his books a
dozen times or more in as many
years, he gladly contributes his
entire collection to some local lib-
rary, and determine never to buy
another book that he can borrow.
Yet there is nothing quite like
the satisfaction of buying a book
for ones very own. I remember
this quotation,—I presume it is
displayed conspicuously some-
where in every library in this
country, but I remember it as I
looked up at it so many hundreds
of times as I sat in the reading
room of the Chicago Public Library: He who loves a
book, never lacks a friend. Now I don't believe any
one can ever love a book borrowed from a public li-
brary. He may respect its sentiments, admire its dic-
tion, or profit by its teachings, but if love there be, it
must be a very pale Platonic emotion. Such a book
is after all only a visitor and sojourner in the home,
not a member of the intimate family circle. When
you buy a book, you sit down to read it with an en-
tirely different feeling from that you experience when
you turn pages already soiled and crumpled by other
fingers. It is becoming a part of your life; you will
mark the places to which you may wish to return; you
will note some of your reactions to its appeal along
the margins; it will take its place upon your shelves,
ready to your hand whenever your mood calls for it
again.
Fortunately the enormous increase in the dollar edi-
tions of really good books has made it possible for
one to indulge in this luxury of book buying without

ARCHITECT'S DRAWING OF HANGARS AND BUILDINGS OF A MODEL AIRPORT
The Civil Engineer
in Air Transportation
By C. A. SCHWARZWAELDER and K. E. KRATZ
THE Civil Engineer today is interested in the field
of air transportation, not only in the design and
construction of airports but also in the analysis
of traffic. As soon as the stage
of pioneer development of air
transportation has passed, it
will lie necessary to study the
possibilities of traffic expan-
sion and increased economical
operation.
The prediction of future air
transport business is based on
principles somewhat different
from those involved in the pre-
diction of future growth in
any other utility field. Air
transportation is still in its
infancy and has no statistical
background of any valuable
duration. It is necessary,
therefore, to analyze the traf-
fic from the basic factors in-
volved. The present article
will confine itself to this phase
of the subject.
The Field of Airplane
Transportation
For many generations man
has looked to the sky with
hope and envy, and today is
realizing his ambition in air
transportation. While the air-
plane is used for photography, crop dusting, forest
patrol, taxi service and sight seeing, the field of air
transportation includes none of these. Transportation
Captain Schwarzwaelder and K. E.
Kratz are graduate students in trans-
portation and at the present time are
engaged in making a study of the pos-
sibilities in air express traffic, for their
masters' thesis. With the aid of Pro-
fessor W. C. Sadler they have prepared
this interesting article, which may be
regarded as a result of their investiga-
tions to date.
Mr. Kratz is a graduate of the Uni-
sity of Nebraska and Captain Schwarz-
waelder a graduate of Lehigh Univer-
sity. For the past five years Captain
Schwarzwaelder, in the quartermaster
corps of the U. S. Army, has been sta-
tioned at Boiling Field, D. C, and dur-
ing this time has had considerable ex-
perience in airport design and main-
tenance. He has been detailed, for the
past year, to take a course at the Uni-
versity of Michigan in transportation
and allied subjects.
The War Department, in order to
further the education and training of
the commissioned personnel of the
army, details the officers to various col-
leges and universities throughout the
country for special instruction in the
branches of government work in which
they are specializing. —The Editor.
denotes primarily the carrying of persons and goods
from place to place and is classified as air mail, air
passenger and air express services. The World War
furnished a great impetus to
aviation, and, from necessity,
the airplane became at once of
practical use. Mail had been
carried by airplane as early as
1911, but it was not until May.
1918, that the first regular air
mail service in the world was
established. This run was be-
tween New York City and
Washington, D.C. The first
service was tried as a practical
experiment, but today air mail
is well patronized, and the
volume of business is steadily
increasing.
More and more the public is
using air lines as a means of
transportation. The growth
of passenger air transport was
necessarily slow as the traveler
had to be educated to this
means of transportation. Ex-
periments in reduction of fares
were made by different com-
panies the first part of the
present year, principally to find
out if the small amount of
traffic was due to fear of flying
or the high rates. Since the reduction went into effect,
increases have lieen reported as high as 400 per cent.
During the year 1927 there were 829,917.845 revenue

passengers carried by the railways in the United
States. During the same period there were only 8.679
revenue passengers carried by air transport. This
striking contrast emphasizes the possibility of future
air passenger expansion. Since aviation is already
established as a carrier of mail and passengers, it is
likewise destined to play a vital role in the transporta-
tion of valuables and merchandise. The attitude of the
railway express companies seems to bear out the pre-
diction that the air express is a promising field for
development. This is evidenced by a statement of
President Robert E. M. Cowie of the Railway Express
Agency, in which he remarked that the Railway Ex-
press Agency was interested in commercial aviation,
not only as a source of profit, but also for the influence
it will have in the expansion of the rail business by
opening new markets.
In comparing air trans-
port of merchandise with
rail, the speed and mobility
of the airplane are the chief
factors. The tunnels,
bridges, curves, and gradi-
ents of the railway are
eliminated, and the air line
is the direct route between
destinations. The use of
the airplane on a short-cut
line is becoming rapidly
more universal. An example
of this is shown in the air
line from Cleveland to
Detroit which, by flying
over Lake Erie, makes the
actual air distance 95
distance of 171 miles.
ANALYSIS OF TRAFFIC GROWTH.
miles as compared with a rail
On a time basis this amounts to
55 minutes as compared with 4 hours. Another short-
cut line would be from Grand Rapids to St. Paul. This
would shorten the actual distance and eliminate the
delay of the Chicago transfer. A similar principle in
air transportation is the transfer of mail, passengers,
and merchandise from ocean liners, a day out from New
York City, to seaplanes for quick transport to inland
stations.
The railroads received heavy financial aid and land
grants in their infancy and the air lines are receiving
some help today. In Europe the air lines are subsidized
directly by the governments, but in the United States
they receive only indirect subsidies such as lighting of
airways, air information, etc. However, the Watres
Air Mail Bill, now before Congress, would base com-
pensation on mileage rather than weight. This measure
would extend the carrying of air mail to passenger
lines to bolster their income with guaranteed sums for
space contracted by the government.
At the present time only a small fraction of one per
cent of the total express is carried by air. However.
air express offers an exceptional opportunity for
extensive development, and faster transportation
will not only save interest on money in transport
but will facilitate the distribution of all shipments
whose nature demands the highest possible speed
of delivery. By the use of air express the mer-
chant is able to carry a smaller stock of goods.
This is in accord with the current practice of "hand to
mouth" buying. The fact that the Railway Express
Agency apparently favors this means of transportation
shows the reliability of air transport. Moreover the
decrease of accidents and the increase in trips com-
pleted tend to prove to the shipper that this is a sure
method of transportation. Aviation insurance today
has complete coverage in one contract so that property
shipped by air express is fully covered against damage
or loss. This fact should induce the public to ship by
air. High grade service re-
quires not only fast trips
but frequent trips. On ac-
count of the greater speed
of a plane it is possible for
one plane to make two
trips, whereas a railroad
would have to furnish two
trains to give the same ser-
vice. Increased frequency
of trips would tend to de-
velop business.
Methods of Traffic
A nalysis
In making an analysis of
the traffic possibilities of air
transportation in general, or
for a specific air line, it is impossible to make an exact
estimate of the amount of traffic that may be expected,
but a careful study along these lines is essential for a
satisfactory solution of the problem. It is easy to pre-
dict future expansion on a "straight line" basis when
the saturation point has already been reached and the
future requirements of the utility have been recognized.
This method is used in the extension of water, sewer,
electric lines, telephone and hydro-electric systems, and
is based upon the present and probable future change
in population. In planning an air route this principle
of straight line expansion, as a prediction for traffic
possibility, is not applicable and a different method of
attack must be used. We must, therefore, return to a
consideration of the basic factors.
A second method of predicting traffic is that used in
the railroad field. This deals with an examination of
the nature of the territory served, of industries and
towns, and the existing lines. This method is not ap-
plicable to the air transportation field, however, because
it requires operating statistics, extending over a long
period of years.

The Detroit-Windsor Tunnel
By JOHN J. WHITE, .JR., *32A
MAN has proven himself increasingly capable of
formulating fanciful dreams to fire his imag-
ination, and today with the aid of the heritage
of modern developments in science and invention, he is
proving himself just as capable in devising ways and
means of executing his grand schemes. Greater and
more difficult construction projects are continually being
undertaken which of necessity must be preceded by new
methods to handle them successfully.
In the new vehicular tunnel
under the Detroit river between
Detroit and Windsor, Canada,
and now nearing completion we
find just such a project which is
the culmination of centuries of
engineering development as well
as many years of careful research
and planning by the engineers in
charge to connect Detroit with
Canada by the means of a mile
long highway tunnel. Because of
the peculiar conditions surround-
ing its construction and the mag-
nitude of the undertaking, it was
found advisable to employ entire-
ly new methods of handling the
construction work. Accordingly,
engineers of the Canadian Bridge
Company conceived the unique
plan of constructing the entire
tunnel on dry land in tubular
sections each of which is sealed,
launched and then floated into
position to be sunk in its place
on the bottom of the river. How-
ever, the design and general physical features of the
entire tunnel are based on a great number of engineer-
ing innovations.
The whole length of the tunnel is divided into five
major sections. Starting at the Windsor end of the
tunnel where the Canadian terminal buildings are lo-
cated in the heart of the business section, open cut and
box section construction carries the roadway downward
on about a 4 per cent grade for about six hundred
feet, this is known as section 1. The land section of
the tunnel proper is twelve hundred fifty feet long and
is known as section 2. Section 3 is the under river sec-
tion and is approximately 2250 feet long. On the
Detroit side are sections 4 and 5. Section 4 is the land
section of the tunnel proper on that side and is about

company in charge of the construction oj

tunnel. Mr. Scens started work for this
company as a draughtsman in 1904.
500 feet long on a 5 per cent grade, while section 5
is the open cut and box section construction running
for 600 feet at a 5 per cent grade to the Detroit terminal
buildings.
Great interest is being evinced in operations on
section 3 or the under river section as it is generally
considered to be the most hazardous part of the con-
struction and also because a considerable part of the
work is done above ground where it can be watched by
interested parties. This section
is being placed in a dredged
trench in the bottom of the river,
the trench being of such a depth
that the completed tunnel section
can be covered with about four
feet of earth backfill in levelling
off the river bed. The trench has
a sand bottom which is brought
to proper grades before the nine
tube sections are lowered.
Each tube section is a complet-
ed unit 250 feet in length with
an inside diameter of 31 feet and
an outside diameter of 35 feet
formed about 3 ^" steel shell
and strengthened by external dia-
phragms every 12 feet in the
length of the tube, these dia-
phragms being octagonal in
shape, of plate and angle con-
struction, and protruding about
two feet beyond the shell proper.
All of the steel tubes were
fabricated, erected and launched
at the Canadian Bridge Com-
pany's plant at Walkerville, Ontario, six miles up the
river from the site. Approximately 3500 tons of steel
were involved in the shell contract and approximately
1000 tons of interior steel fittings, beams and castings
were supplied by the same company. The sections are
built up of 24-foot strips of steel plate electrically
welded together with General Electric welding machines.
Each tube section is constructed on regular launching
ways, much as is a steel ship and, as soon as it was
made watertight and sealed at both ends, it was
launched.
As it was essential that these sections l)e absolutely
watertight when launched, the Canadian Bridge Com-
pany did a large amount of welding of the shell joints.
All longitudinal joints were butt-welded, both for

strength and watertightness; no riveting being done on
these joints. The circumferential joints, which occur
at four and eight foot intervals, were lap-riveted and
then welded for watertightness instead of being calked.
After the shell units were completed on the huge 450
ton tube, heavy steel bulkhead framing was placed in
each end, covered with heavy timber and waterproofed
on the outside. This made the shell unit completely
watertight so that it could be launched and kept dry
after being sunk.
After each tube was launched, it was towed to the
Canadian Steel Corporation slip where it was tied up
for work by the general contractor. An eighteen inch
lining of heavily reinforced concrete was first placed in
the tube and timber form work, supported by the dia-
phragms, was put on the outside. An exterior covering
of concrete, two feet thick at the thinnest point, and of
4200 cubic yards, was then placed on the outside of the
tube sections. As there is only about 25 feet of water
in the slip, only a part of the exterior concrete on the
lower half of the tube, could be placed in the slip. The
tube was then towed to approximately its final location
in the river and at this point the work continued of
placing exterior concrete until the tube section was
practically ready to sink of its own weight. It was then
accurately placed in final position over the trench, this
location being accomplished by means of transits on the
shore, and elevated targets attached to the tube. Up
to this point the interior of the tube was absolutely dry
and the sinking was then accomplished by hanging
concrete weights on the outside of the tube.
After the first tube section had been lowered to final
position the remainder of its concrete coating was placed
by the tremie method, and connection was made to the
shield driven land section. Another tube section was
then towed to position, lowered and connected to the
tube section in place. This connection is made by means
of guide lip plates and castings on the ends of the tube
sections, the final tie being made by pins. A field
welded plate collection is also made on the inside of the
joint between tube sections for watertightness, and by
the tremie method, three to four feet of concrete is
placed around the joint on the outside. After two
tube sections had been placed in the river bed, and
connected, the first section was entered and interior
finishing work was done. As each additional tube sec-
tion was placed, the bulkheads were removed from the
preceding section and interior work completed.
This is the first time in the history of tunnel con-
struction that this particular method has been used.
The Michigan Central tube section of only 18 feet in
diameter was sunk to the river trench by filling with
water and all interior concrete lining was done after
the tubes were in position and dewatered. Pre-cast
concrete tube sections have also been used in tunnel
construction, this method requiring very expensive dry-
dock facilities. On the Detroit-Canada Tunnel the
floating steel shell has been used itself as a floating dry-
dock, and a large amount of interior work has been
done before the sections were lowered to the river bed.
This feature together with the large amount of welding
used on the steel shells make the construction decidedly
unique.
The approaches, the land sections of the tunnel, are
shield driven and are being bored by the largest hydrau-
lic tunneling shield ever used on the American contin-
ent. It is 32 feet in diameter, sixteen feet long of
steel construction, and the shell plates are built up to a
thickness of 2^". The shield weighs about 350 tons,
and is forced ahead by thirty hydraulic jacks, each of
which is of 150 tons capacity. As the shield moves
forward the tunnel lined with steel shell plates inside
of which a concrete lining about two feet thick is being
placed. A departure from general methods of construc-
tion has been adopted for these sections also in that
forged steel plates are being used inside of the tunnel
cast iron sections.
The tunnel proper is 28 feet wide in inside diameter
and has a twenty-two foot roadway with 13'6" clear-
ance from roadway to ceiling. The fresh air duct is
under the roadway, the fresh air being carried from
this duct, by flues on both sides of the roadway, and
released at the sides of the tunnel just above the road-
way. The duct for exhaust air is located between the
suspended ceiling and the top of the tunnel. There is
Two tube sections on launching ivays, one of which is
completed, ready to be launched, and with water tight bulk-
heads in place. The left tube shows the steel framing for the
bulkhead.
a two foot walkway along one side for inspectors and
guards. The width of the roadway will permit the
operation of two lanes of traffic continuously with
ample space for a third lane in case of an accident or
fire.
Work on the tunnel is fast moving towards com-
pletion. The ninth and last tube will be submerged in
a short time, while the shield driven portion on the
Canadian side is being proceeded with steadily with the
idea of joining up with the last tube as soon as possible
after it is submerged.

The Fraudulent Correspondence School
One of the social problems of the present day is the
unscrupulous exploitation of the youth of the country
by fake correspondence schools. This problem should
be of special interest to engineers, as there are more
fake technical and trade schools in the engineering pro-
fession than in any other profession. The principal
reason for this is the fact that the practice of engineer-
ing is not properly safeguarded by law and ethics.
Most of the other professions are protected by laws
that require a certain standard of proficiency as a
prerequisite to practice. Not so in the engineering
profession. Here a person may set himself up as an
engineer without even so much as a high school edu-
cation or training in the fundamentals of engineering.
The fake technical and trade schools throughout the
country know this and have been taking advantage of
it by concentrating their efforts on getting students to
enroll in their engineering courses.
There is a glamor of romance about engineering that
appeals to the average young man. It is. therefore,
only natural that many of them fall for the alluring
promises made by these fake schools in soliciting their
enrollment.
The extent to which correspondence schools are
operating in this country is shown by the fact that there
are four times as many students enrolled in corre-
spondence schools as there are in all the colleges and
universities. And the revenue from correspondence
tuition fees is one and one-half times as great as the
revenue from fees in all the college and universities in
the country.
We do not say that all correspondence schools are a
fake. There are legitimate correspondence schools that
are filling a long-felt need in our educational system of
today. These are doing good work and should be en-
couraged. It is the schools that are exploiting the
youth of the country without giving anything worth
while in return that are a menace to the social order
of today.
Engineering is the one profession that is dealing with
the HEALTH, SAFETY, COMFORT and WEL-
FARE of the masses. As such it should be ever kept
on a high ethical plan, free from the incompetency re-
sulting from improper and insufficient training. One
way to insure such a status to a certain degree, at least,
is to require a standard of qualifications as a prerequi-
site to the practice of engineering by the enactment of
a registration law for engineers. However, until the
registration of engineers becomes nation-wide it is
going to be difficult to stop the pernicious activities of
the fraudulent correspondence schools operating in the
technical field.
The American Association of Engineers, with head-
quarters in Chicago, Illinois, is anxious to do its part
in behalf of the young men and women of America.
It wants to see full value given for money received.

Plans and arrangements are already l&gt;eing drown up
for a vast reunion and program to be held in celebra-
tion of our golden jubilee. It is hoped that a great
number of the former editors and members of the edi-
torial staffs as far back as 1882, will be able to attend
this reunion, to recount their various experiences and
wonder at the vast changes which have taken place
since their time. Among the former editors we find
some of the foremost engineers and statesmen in the
country, the most notable, perhaps, being the Hon.
Robert P. Lamont, secretary of commerce. Banquets
and conferences will be held and it is intended that they
be social as well as historical gatherings.
A huge oak plaque is being prepared, with the seal
of the Technic in bronze, at the top, and below it fifty
bronze plates, engraved with the names of the editors
and their staffs, one for every year of the magazine's
existence.
The policy of the magazine has ever been a pro-
gressive one. Each year some new and improving
feature has l)een added, and it will be with pride that
those of us at the helm today will be able to point out
to those, who have labored in the past, each of these
innovations as they appeared.
o
The tryouts are to be congratulated for the way the
majority of them stepped in and helped the commit-
teemen in making arrangements for the Slide Rule
Dance, held on April 4, in the Michigan Union Ball-
room. The revival of this age-old traditional function,
sponsored this year by the Technic was very success-
ful, both socially and financially, and its success was
due in no small part to the zeal and ardor which the
tryouts displayed as members of the various commit-
tees. Directly their work in this respect has no bear-
ing on their journalistic success, but it is a criterion,
and a good one, as to how much ambition and endeavor
they have, to work for the magazine in other ways,
more directly applicable to the welfare of the publica-
tion.
The tryouts, the future staff members of the
Technic, have been watched and tried, perhaps more
than they realize, and in the May issue, the last issue
of the year, those who are to remain in the service will
be lined up as assistants in the positions, which, as the
staff sees it, they are most fitted to assume. Success
to the coming editors.
o
The recent prohibition poll, taken on the campus by
the Michigan Daily, one of many of a similar nature,
taken throughout the country, has raised both vehement
protestation and hearty commendation. The fact how-
ever, that the majority asked for neither absolute re-
peal nor yet rigid enforcement, but desired the happy
medium, the adoption of the Ontario Liquor Control
plan, should appeal to the reason of either party, wet
or dry.
Bad as conditions may have been before prohibition—
and here, it must be admitted, most of us have to rely
on hearsay and biased opinion—only one in the throes
of "Pussyfoot" emotion would claim that they are any
better now. Police forces throughout the country have
become corrupted almost beyond recovery; deaths by
alcoholism and arrests for drunkenness are steadily on
the increase; there are more speakeasies in the country
than there ever were saloons. Dr. C. C. Little, ex-
president of this university, in a recent address brought
the results closer home to us. He stated that the only
difference that prohibition has made to university men
is that they are drinking strong liquor, often poisonous,
now, instead of the less harmful beer, and that univer-
sity women are now drinking heavily, where none
drank before. It does not seem possible that any one
can be so blind as to overlook these terrible conditions,
which are becoming worse and worse every day. Yet
the student body, who are just coming into their right
to vote and have a say in the matter, do not ask for
complete repeal, a return to the open saloon. It seems
to be the clearest form of logic, and the student body,
clear sighted and unprejudiced, have seen it: We can-
not return to the open saloon but still less can we
continue on the path to destruction, we are now travel-
ling; ergo, there is only one way to turn, and that is
the middle course.
The Ontario Liquor Control plan places the manu-
facture and sale of the beverages under government
supervision; liquor stores, open only from eight to six
o'clock in the daytime, are stationed by government
decree, and are operated under the civil service. A
permit must be obtained from the government in order
to obtain the bonded liquors, and the amount purchased
by each permit holder is rigidly restricted. In our
country such a plan would eliminate the immense sum
of money spent yearly in prohibition enforcement, in
fact would turn money into the treasury from permits
and sales, which money now goes to bootleggers and
criminals; and what is more important, it would sub-
stitute good liquor, in reasonable amounts, for the
bootleg and poisonous liquor which our university men
and women are drinking in such wholesale quantities
now. These same men and women are the future lead-
ers of the country and yet they are being allowed to
become embittered toward the government, and are
being taught the essence of lawlessness. Surely, such
a system as the Ontario Liquor Control plan, which has
succeeded so well in our sister country, is the middle
course, and the student body, sincere and clear visioned,
should be applauded for wishing to take it.

COLLEGE NOTES
JUNIOR ENGINEERS' BASKETBALL TEAM
THE under classmen have been having a pretty
time trying to keep themselves noticed with this
mob of job seeking, cane waving, due collecting,
seniors taking up all of the room in the halls of the
engineering buildings, so the juniors, who were
especially griped
with this flagrant
trespassing, de-
cided that they
had better get
out and let peo-
ple know that
they were still in
existence. Here's
what they did.
They dashed out
and galloped off
with just about
every possible
point in the
Inter-class ath-
letic competition
by winning the
deciding basket-
ball game for
their alma mater. We think that the team deserves
some credit for their good work so we are giving you
readers a break by allowing you to gaze upon the noble
warriors. Handsome cusses, aren't they?
The gang has not only won the basketball champion-
ship but has taken firsts in volley ball, bowling, and
relay, giving them the advantage in four out of six
sports. This puts them on the top rung of the compe-
tition and with their 500 points the boys who have
helped pile up this lead can justly feel proud of them-
selves. The fellows really did have a water tight de-
fense and in the last two games only one basket was
scored against them from the floor. The deciding
games were played with the sophomore engineers, the

MALCOLM, G. LAWTON JOHNSON. BOTTOM ROW—JAY BOUW-
MAN, CARL TUSCH, STUART DAVIDSON, LOUIS ZANOFF. MGR.
sophomore "lits", the freshman engineers, and the
junior "dents," the victors trounced their opponents by
scores of 18-0, 13-12, 41-0, and 10-7 respectively. Ex-
cellent teamwork was displayed throughout the whole
series, this was the medium of their success as indi-
vidual starring was not too dominant. Carl Tusch
played a con-
sistently good
game while Mal-
colm worked
very nicely as
jump man and
Bouwman inter-
cepted oppon-
ents' plays at
guard. David-
son and Harth
alternately held
down the other
guard positions
and with "Hot
Shot" Johnson
and Bullard as
eagle eyed for-
wards, the team
was completed.
It looks as if the inter-class sports title will find its
resting place with the junior engineers this season. We
hope that all of the boys are seniors next year because,
after all, most of the staff consists of juniors and we're
all with them.

ABOUT TRANSPORTATION
The University of Michigan's Engineering College,
in our estimation, is just about the most progressive
school of its type in these United States and to sub-
stantiate our attitude we're going to tell you about
another feather in its pedagogical hat. The administra-
tion showed keen foresight and proficiency when it
initiated the combined Engineering-Law course and

now it has made another seven league step when it
organized a general transportation course singularly
modern because it encompasses the entire field. Michi-
gan has the unique position of being the only college,
with the exception of Boston Tech, which has the
facilities to create such a course and she is the first
school to take advantage of these wonderful oppor-
tunities. We have a department of railroad engineer-
ing, highway engineering, a naval department, an aero-
nautical department, and an automotive department,
all of the necessary essen-
tials to give the engineer-
ing student a basic training
in the various scientific as-
pects of the different sys-
tems.
The new course is avail-
able this semester but it
will probably get into full
swing in the fall term.
The usual four years will
be devoted to the course,
the first two years being
spent in the general funda-
mentals of engineering and
the other two years being
set aside for transporta-
tion engineering. The cur-
riculum will consist of
various courses in techni-
cal design in some one of
the departments of aero-
nautical, marine, electrical,
mechanical, or civil engi-
neering, accompanying this
there will be a course in
the fundamentals of ac-
counting, courses in eco-
nomics, fundamentals of
law and government,
business administration,
and courses in the co-
ordination and operation
of transportation properties. The course was not
planned as just another item to put in the catalogue,
but was carefully designed to meet a real and vital
demand that is becoming apparent in the transporta-
tion world: the need of men who understand the basic
requirements of design, construction, and maintenance
of transportational mediums. A great deal of their
future work will be in the co-ordination of the various
existing systems.
The co-operative trend is ever becoming more and
more popular in the industrial field and we now find
that the most progressive rail systems are beginning
to combine with or obtain control of the secondary
systems of transportation, notably the bus and aeronau-
In The
Spotlight
Charles W. Doane
We have with us in this issue
a satellite of the electrical de-
partment, one Charles W.
Doane. a gentleman who has
emerged from the shadow of
Detroit's millions and has
climbed into the rays of our illustrious spotlight. Chuck
entered the engineering school several years ago as a
freshman and immediately distinguished himself as being
a hard worker by winning a Phi Eta Sigma key. For
a time following this he retired to the business of going
to school and we find him emerging again as a versatile
and active member of A.I.E.E. He was elected chairman
of the organization, a position corresponding to presi-
dency, and most of his spare time has been spent in
putting A.I.K.E. on the map. He has done some excel-
lent work for the society and has had some dandy speak-
ers on the programs during the past year. C. W. has
gotten to be quite a delegate and has represented the
electrical group no less than two times at the student
conventions, one at Chicago and the other at Pittsburgh.
Charley is also a member of the Engineering Council,
where he serves his class and exercises his judgment for
the best interests of the student body.
Doane is a member of Phi Sigma Kappa and has made
many staunch friends on the campus due to his quiet
reserve, his intelligence, and his likeable disposition. We
also think that he's a great fellow but we have a
sneaking suspicion that he cast a dry ballot at the recent
straw vote held on the campus. He should have known
better.
tical lines. The Pennsylvania Railroad is an outstand-
ing example of this policy and at the present time they
have large sums of money invested in the Transcon-
tinental Air Transport Company, Pickwick, Greyhound,
and Yellowway bus systems and in a number of
trucking lines. The question of whether such a course
is justified or not is easily solved when the financial
and economic status of our transportation system is
examined, and when we begin to realize what wonder-
ful opportunities await the properly trained man, in
this work. The total
wealth of the United
States is estimated at
$320,000,000.0000 and ac-
cording to the best avail-
able figures $44,125,519,-
000 of this sum is invest-
ed in steam railways, street
and electric interurban
railways, telegraph sys-
tems, telephones, pipe
lines, automotive vehicles,
documented vessels, aero-
planes and landing fields.
This sum does not in-
clude industries allied to
transportation such as
automotive or locomotive
manufacturing industries
or improvements in rivers
and harbors and many
other similar items. The
capital invested in trans-
portation, then, is approx-
imately one eighth of the
total wealth of our coun-
try, this indicates the
amazing extent to which
developments have been
made in less than a single
century. What will the
future of these vast sys-
tems be? Who will con-
trol this great amount of capital? The answer is the
best men who have had the most comprehensive tech-
nical and administrative background.
PACKARD'S DIESEL ENGINE
A great deal of interest was shown in the new diesel
aircraft engine which was formally announced by
Packard Motor Co. at the Detroit Municipal Airport.
Several planes of well known manufacture were
equipped with the motor and gave demonstrations of
their performance, the results being very satisfactory.
The motor was developed by Captain Woolson, of the
Packard Co., during a three 'year period, of research

Famous Architects in History. VII
Louis H. Sullivan, 1856-1924
MAN has always marveled at great feats of phy-
sical strength and endurance—at Napoleon, in
his last struggle against the European coalition,
—at Cromwell, resisting the arms of the English
crown,—and now, at the heroes of the World War—
even glorifying and exalting. But little has man ex-
tolled the far more con-
sequential achievements
of mental and spiritual
strength—the deeds of
those who fight not
with their hodies lj)ut
with their minds. For
the warrior there is
brilliancy, the thinker,
obscurity.
In the shadow of this
obscurity lies the in-
trinsic worth of the in-
vincible Louis Sulli-
van, who, alone in his
idealistic principles and
convictions, fought a
world of adversity and
prejudice yet never re-
linquished his stand.
He came when archi-

POSITION OF 1893. CHARACTERISTIC OF THE WORK

philosophy. While yet young, he had formulated a very
definite point of view toward architecture, a new, radi-
cally modern point of view, and ever after he clung
tenaciously to it, never deviating, even under crushing
pressure, from his chosen path. As Frank Lloyd
Wright says, Louis Sullivan's great value as an artist-
architect, dead or alive,
lies in his firm grasp of
principle.
He believed that the
spirit of Classicism was
extinct with a new era
of art dawning, a new
life, intolerant of the
forms of an amortized
civilization. He visual-
ized in the future the
tremendous potentiali-
ties of steel construction
in architecture and was
the first to treat it in
its true capacity. The
sky-scraper, as it exists
today, had its inception
fifty years ago in Louis
Sullivan who sensed
the upward rush of the
steel frame, the su-
him, during the well-known period of General Grant
Gothic and Classical Revival, when men, seemingly
alive, aspired only to the dead glory that was Greece,
to the Grandeur that was Rome or to the exuberant
spirit of the Middle Ages. In his youth, Sullivan,
with his fellows, were taught that the best songs had
been sung and all truths told and that it was for them
to follow, not to lead. But here he was an unwilling
student and refused to assimilate the principles he
deemed faulty, prefering to pursue his own ideals and
preme, soaring loftiness of the new office structures,
and who cast aside the restraining horizontal elements
of the past styles, bringing into entity the strong verti-
cal line which gives the tall building its rising exulta-
tion and progressive spirit.
As the first manifestation of the new movement.
Sullivan built the Wainswright Building in St. Louis,
a ten-story, steel frame structure. Although relatively
insignificant in size and certainly lacking of many

The Ancient Weather Vane Art
The Metal-Worker's Contribution to Architecture
By LYLE F. ZISLER, »3SA
OLD, dusty, worm-eaten hooks, with bindings torn
and pages yellowing with age, seldom inspire
the usual reader with a great deal of interest
and enthusiasm, but when, by accident or by intentional
search, he becomes acquainted
with the true value of many of
these books, both as pieces of
worthy literature and as historic-
ally authentic records of past
events, he more carefully exam-
ines them and often gleans from
them pertinent facts unobtainable
in modern works. Research in a
number of these antique volumes
lead to the discovery of the
unique history of that famous,
little monument, the weather vane
whose introduction occurred over
two and a half centuries ago and
whose presence still persists in
many buildings. In fact, it is
now enjoying a rather spirited revival as a decorative
element of ultra-smart residences. The account of the
life and development of the weather vane art, from its
first days in ancient times to its present stage of exist-
ance, forms a decidedly instructive and entertaining
story.
The direction of the wind was of utmost importance
to the ancient mariner, the success of whose voyage
depended entirely upon the good humor of the elements,
necessitating the invention of some form of indicator
by which he might ascertain the character of the blow.
The first vanes were probably set up by the seafaring
peoples of the Mediterranean nations about 600 B. C,
being attached either to the masts of the ships or to the
house tops near the quays. The Tower of the Winds,
at Athens, built in 100 B. C. was the first meteorolo-
gical observatory to be established in Greece, serving
principally to give the time of the day by its dials or
its water-clock, and to point out the direction of the
wind. The vane at the peak of the roof was a revolv-
ing figure of the wind god, indicating with its trident
one of the eight sculptured panels on the tower repre-
senting the dignified symbols of the eight winds. Au-
4*
thorities have it that there were a number of similar
structures built by the government in many of the
Grecian cities, especially those of marine inclinations,
in order to promote commerce and colonial extensions.
The Romans carried further
the development of the weather
vane art, which had evidently
lost to them its former religi-
ous import and had now be-
come more domesticated.
Farmhouses and many urban
homes in Rome, Florence and
Bologna wore vanes with no
other apparent function than
to indicate the wind direction
and to provide a touch of or-
nament. In Constantinople,
during the Roman regime,
there was built an enormous
vane in the form of a colossal
column surmounted by a
carved, rotating figure pointing with outstretched
ar.ms. This monument could be seen from great dis-
tances, serving admirably the sea-going vessels in the
harbor and the land caravans on their way to the
East.
It was during the medieval ages, however, that the
history of the weather vane art became most vivid,
being developed in connection with heraldry and church
building. There prevailed two principal types—the
"cock" form and the "flag" or "pendant" form—each
serving its respective office on ecclesiastical and domestic
buildings and bearing certain, definite, emblematic
meanings. For several centuries the cock type of vane
appeared exclusively on churches and monasteries, in-
dicating its renewed religious significance. The banner
type was commonly used on feudal castles and farm
estates, allowing the application of heraldic devices and
intricate decorative forms. The weather vane had be-
come, by this time, a veritable work of art and crafts-
manship, as was the case with most of the accessories
of the medieval building. In France and England the
nobility alone was allowed the use of heraldic vanes,
these being bestowed upon them with much royal pomp
and ceremonv.


April, 1930
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
The usual form was an unfurled flag, wrought in
metal, with pierced or etched designs applied. Often
colors were applied to more closely represent the
banner antecedent. During Tudor times in England
many deviations were made of the general type, em-
ploying perched birds, rampant lions and symbolic
dragons. Intricate forgings were built to the vane
proper as additional enrichment of the building's sky-
line as satisfaction to the enthusiastic metal-worker.
With the Renaissance came a new group of variations
of the traditional vane forms, including the quaint ship
model, the long, spiny grasshopper, the fish and other
animal subjects, and, chiefly, the simple pendant and
arrow type. Wren and Gibbs in England and Bul-
finch in America are responsible for many of the
original vane designs of this period.
Today, the idea of the weather vane still persists, but
in a different office, for it has now become, in most
examples, merely decorative. Home owners, in an at-
tempt to produce the picturesque, domestic atmosphere
of the medieval country home, have unceremoniously
borrowed the old, traditional forms. As a result, there
are reproduced everywhere about us a multitude of
weather vanes which, although perhaps unethically
plagiarized from the old styles, and non-functionally
applied to modern buildings, are nevertheless excellent
in general design and peerless in metal workmanship. o
FAMOUS ARCHITECTS

artistic virtues, it presented an undisputed criterion of
the architectural unity of vertical form and of struc-
tural expression. The frame bears a protective casing
of masonry, yet there can be felt through it, as if it
were only a transparent mist, the strong growth of steel
within. Ornament was sparingly applied at strategic
points, exhibiting to full advantage the fresh originality.
Sullivan believed that concomitant with the new
structural element there must come a new form of
decoration allied and in sympathy with it. This need
was promptly satisfied by his creative imagination, re-
sulting in a swirling, plastic ornament which interested
the eye with its playful, fanciful character but which,
when too promiscuously employed, became annoying
and oppressive. This, it has been admitted, is the chief
fault of his later work.
The Chicago Auditorium was his first civic commis-
sion, coming during those first years of his association
with Dankmar Alder when his ability was little known
and his success uncertain. However, with the creation
in this building of a truly artistic work, he established
for himself both professional prestige and financial
independence which allowed him in the future greater
aesthetical freedom and opportunity for progress. The
auditorium was successful in every way, especially in
acoustics, which many consider the most desirable for

The Autobiography of an Idea
By Louis Sullivan
American Institute of Architects, publishers
In this day of minute specialization it is most grati-
fying to discover a versatile character as was Louis
Sullivan. We reverently marvel at the great Da Vinci,
artist, architect and engineer of the Renaissance never
suspecting that in our own age we have a comparable
genius, similarly talented in many fields. Sullivan, in
addition to having many of the attributes of Da V inci,
was also an author and in this capacity he attained re-
markable excellence.
The "Autobiography of an Idea," his self-history,
gives a very comprehensive resume of his entire life,
containing his many revolutionary ideas and principles,
presented as only he could present them. His manner
of presentation is enough to warrant the reading of this
book, while the subject matter is, beyond doubt, of
genuine worth. Although at times we sense the egotist
in the man. his superior accomplishments far outshine
these lesser faults.
Some have looked upon Louis Sullivan's attempts in
the literary field as mad adventures that would result in
no real good, but the fact that literature, in its basic
conception, is the expression of life in words of truth
and beauty, the written record of man's spirit, his
thoughts, emotions, aspirations, and his whole history,
and that Sullivan possessed these thoughts, emotions,
and aspirations with the power to express them truth-
fully and beautifully, is reason enough to justify his
enterprise. He possessed a rare sense of beauty which
he found he could not confine to himself but must find
an outlet for it. True, his architectural works were an
outlet for this feeling within him, but he deemed it in-
sufficient and therefore, turned to the medium of the
written word.
In his literary efforts, Sullivan was no less a genius
than in architecture. His style was purely analytical, no
detail is forgotten ; facts and circumstances are compiled
as a mason would lay bricks, each item fitting into its
proper place. A remarkable coherence is the result. As
though he was attempting to focus the eye of an ob-
server upon a certain point of interest on a building,
he attracts the attention of the reader to well-emphasiz-
ed, important ideas in his book. He is direct and con-
fident—although at times dogmatic—in presenting his
thoughts. Every phase of his subject is attacked just
as he sees it to exist. He quotes no one as his con-
temporary and offers no excuses for his radical views.
As time goes on a certain disdain for his writings

ALUMNI NEWS
E. P. Goodrich
LESS than thirty years ago, just when that im-
mortal hook of the evil engineer, "Soldiers of For-
tune," was having such tremendous success, the
young man who entered an engineering school, and did
not elect the numerous courses leading to a degree in
civil engineering, was
thought to have been
fast asleep when Dame
Fortune knocked. How-
ever true this may have
been, the fact remains
that a very large percen-
tage of all the engineer-
ing students of that tiniL'
were preparing for civil
engineering, and a huge
supply of well trained
men was yearly gradu-
ated, and, as never he-
fore, there was a demand
for all the civil engineers
available.
With such an amount
of strong competition in
the profession, with so
many youths newly
graduated, making great
strides forward, only a
chosen few of the acknowledged very best could ever
hope to achieve that glory which is the reward of the
successful engineer. Nevertheless, of the many who
have made their names famous, several proudly acclaim
Michigan as their Alma Mater. These men may be
found in State executive positions, in the presidential
advisory body of the United States, and in every branch
of interesting and progressive engineering development.
To chronicle one, and refrain from mentioning others
is, indeed hard; but we believe that there is a civil
engineer, graduated from Michigan, to whom special
honor should be given, and we present a short sketch
of the varied and successful career of one of the most
famous engineers that has ever been enrolled with
our alumni body.
Decatur is a small
town in southwestern
Michigan, and looks like
very little in the atlas,
despite the fact that the
Michigan Central Kail-
roa passes through it.
Nevertheless it is inter
esting, for here, on May
seventh, 1874, there was
born to Edward P., and
Mary Hall Goodrich, a
son, Ernest P. Goodrich.
Little did the proud par-
ents realize that this in-
fant would one day he
famous as a foremost
civil engineer.
The youth prepared
himself for higher train-
ing in his home town,
and at the age of twenty,
set out to brave the experiences of the Michigan State
Normal College, at Ypsilanti. We believe that going
to Ypsi is the only mistake in this admirable career, but
then, Mr. Goodrich realized this mistake (at least most
Michigan men thing that Ypsi is a mistake) for after
graduating from Normal, and teaching for a short time,
he entered the University to study engineering. He
received his Bachelor of Science degree in 1898, and
three years later, took the higher degree of C.E.

Shortly before receiving his last degree, Mr. Good-
rich took the marriage vows with Miss Mildred Louise
Weed, of Detroit, and Mr. and Mrs. Goodrich now
reside in Brooklyn, New York.
Upon leaving college, Mr.
Goodrich embarked upon
the sea of engineering by
becoming structural design-
er for the still young De-
troit Edison Company. His
fate, however, was not to
remain in one-position long,
for in less than a year op-
portunity knocked, and he
went to Washington, D.C.,
to assume the position of
assistant to the army engi-
neer in charge of public
buildings and offices, in the
District of Columbia. His
experience and success in
this capacity soon stood
forth favorably for him,
and it was very shortly an-
nounced that President Mc-
Kinley, then in office, had
specially appointed Mr.
Goodrich to the naval ser-
vice, with rank of Lieuten-
ant, and authority to re-
organize the department,
which was in rather bad
shape after the Spanish
American war. Mr. Good-
rich was stationed at
Brooklyn Navy Yard, and
it was while here that he
got the first intimation of
the career ahead of him in
civilian life; a career des-
tined to make his name fa-
mous, not only in the sphere

When the Bush Terminal
Company, of New York,
determined to extend their
big South Brooklyn plant
to include what is probably
the largest privately owned
steamship and railway ter-
minal in the United States,
they cast about for an engi-
neer qualified to plan and carry to completion such an
enormous project. Mr. Goodrich, though still associated
with the navy, was offered the position, and accepted
the biggest project of construction that had, to this time,
William Aiken Starrett
William Aiken Starrett is the son of
parents of sturdy stock, coming from a
family of builders, spiritual as well as
material. Both parents were of clergial
families, and the son received his early
training under their care, to go later to
receive ministerial training at Princeton.
However, changes took place, and the
youth found himself at Ann Arbor,
studying Mechanical Arts, finishing his
degree in 1895. The demand for mem-
bers of the profession being at ebb at
the time, the young man established him-
self by working for the firm of George
A. Fuller, without embarrassing either
himself or the firm by asking for a salary.
However, his work was not without re-
ward, for within a year he became the
firm's superintendent in building a proj-
ect in New York City, a project that set
a record in steel construction, for 16
stories were erected in twenty-five days
under the supervision of the young en-
gineer.
After a time, Mr. Starrett turned to
government work, and planned and built
cantonments, until the time when the de-
partment for which he was working
placed the control of letting contracts in
his capable hands. During his office,
more than a hundred millions of dollars
in contracts have been signed by him.
Practically all war construction contract
debts are assigned to him for adjustment.
Besides his position with the govern-
ment, Mr. Starrett has been president of
the Fuller Construction Company, and
vice-president of the Thompson Starrett
Corporation.
Due to political opposition, he was in-
dicted upon a charge of maladministra-
tion of office, but this charge was aban-
doned in 1925, to the credit of Mr. Star-
rett.
It is interesting to follow the develop-
ment of a selfmade man such as Colonel
Starrett. Let his example be followed
by the many neophytes who aspire to
the engineering profession.
been offered to him. His success established him as
consulting engineer with the Bush people, a position of
no mean proportion.
With his work in the navy as a foundation, Mr.
Goodrich seems to have ac-
quired a taste for projects
dealing with waterways,
and waterfronts, for we find
that some of his biggest
works after completing the
Brooklyn Terminal are con-
cerned in matters marine.
Specializing in cement con-
struction particularly adapt-
ed him for this work, and
what is probably the largest
all-concrete retaining wall
in the United States, situ-
ated at St. George, on Sta-
ten Island, was constructed
under his guidance and care.
Numerous other works of
note include two harbor
improvement developments
in the Philippine islands,
and an investigation of the
harbor facilities of the city
of Valpariso, in Chile.
South America. Aside from
the work upon water facil-
ities, Mr. Goodrich is noted
for his numerous success-
fully planned and construct-
ed buildings in and around
New York City, among
them the project upon
Thirty Ninth street, which
will stand as a tribute to
the ingenuity and skill of
the master engineer.
A few years before the
late war, Mr. Goodrich was
actively interested in the de-
velopment and reclaiming of
the large tracts of meadow
lands adjacent to Newark.
New Jersey, which, up to
this time, had been thought
utterably unsuitable for
building development of any
size. More recently, Mr.
Goodrich has been retained
as Consulting Engineer in
the orient, having gone abroad to replan and supervise
construction of Nan-King, the new Chinese capital, in-
cluding the laying out of the city proper. While in
China, Mr. Goodrich spent a short time in investigating

True to the inevitable tradition of the civil engineer,
Mr. Goodrich never found opportunity to settle down
in one place, until lately, when he opened offices in New
York as consulting engineer. During his colorful

THE OLD SPIRIT
The Salvation Army has long had a slogan concern-
ing a certain party who might be down, but never out.
We have always received this idea with a grain of salt;
but recently, the circumstances surrounding one of our
alumni has caused us to believe that there is a lot in
that well worn adage.
Seven weeks after taking the nuptial vows with Miss
Elizabeth Meysenburg, of Chicago, Waldo C. Twitchell,
'06-10E, started on a belated honeymoon, and forgot to
watch the road, even as you and I. At any rate, the
Twitchells did not have much luck, for a speeding
truck ran into them, and stopped the honeymoon then
and there, because the groom found it necessary to call
in medical attention, having suffered his legs crushed
and broken in 19 places. Mr. Twitchell is still under
medical care, but has not once ceased his work, or his
good humor, and therein lies a tale.
So many of us can learn a great lesson from this
man, affectionately known to his friends as "Twitch."
How many of us worry about problems so utterly petty
in comparison with that of our alumnus as to be in-
significant? After all, should we not be proud of the
deportment of a brother engineer who has "carried on"
under impossible conditions? We think so, and we
are glad to wish Mr. Twitchell a very speedy recovery,
and to hail him for showing so much of that which we
would all be glad to possess in any degree, "THE OLD
SPIRIT!"

BOULDER DAM PROJECT
(Continued from page 8)
the gravity type, curved in plan. It was first intended
that the allowable stresses be as high as 40 tons per
square foot. ■ The River Board, however, must have
heen in sympathy with the Senate which doubted the
feasibility and safety of the project, for it questioned
this value. Up until twenty years ago, maximum per-
missible stresses were held to 20 tons per square foot,
but modern practice, urged on by the demand for high
dams at a reasonable figure, has raised this figure to
30 tons. To this the Board agreed.
But a moment's reflection is necessary to appreciate
why it is imperative that the dam ]&gt;e constructed on
ultra-conservative lines. A two and one-half years'
normal flow, (this will be explained later from gaging
data), will be backed up by the dam. In the event of
failure,' the downstream towns of Xeedles, Topock,
Parker, Blythe, and Yuma would doubtless be destroy-
ed, and the levees of the rich Imperial agricultural dis-
trict of California would be annihilated. As most of
the land lies below the river level, the water would find
its way into the Salton Sea, tearing such a channel that
it would be impractical, if not frankly impossible, to
ever re-establish the Colorado in its normal course.
The possibility of such a terrible disaster could never
be countenanced, and to this end, considerable experi-
mental work has been carried on by the Bureau of
Reclamation in the matter of the dam section, more
than thirty sections having been examined by the trial
load method.
R. J. Walter, Chief Engineer of the U. S. Bureau
of Reclamation explains, "The assumption usually
made in the design of arch dams is that part of the
horizontal water load is carried by the vertical canti-
lever action, and the remaining part of the horizontal
arch action, the distribution of the load, being based on
the criterion that the deflection of the arch elements
must equal the deflection of the cantilever elements at
corresponding points. Heretofore, the usual procedure
in determining the load distribution had been to bring
the arch and cantilever deflection together at the crown
section of the dam, and to assume that, for such a

Already many American business men are

The future possibility of talking directly
with almost anyone in the world who has
access to a telephone is enough to stimulate
any man's thinking—not only from an
engineering standpoint, but because of its
significance to American industry.

distribution, an equally satisfactory agreement of de-
flections exists at other parts of the structure. How-
ever, the Bureau of Reclamation has been continuing
the mathematical studies until the arch and cantilever
deflections are in agreement entirely around the dam,
at 6 to 10 different elevations and 10 to 20 vertical
cross-sections."
The dam will be about 700 feet high, although this
figure has not been definitely fixed, and it will contain
approximately three and a half million cubic yards of
concrete. Once the river diversion, and foundation
and abutment excavation are accomplished, the con-
struction will assume the aspect of a huge mass-
concrete manufacturing job which is estimated will take
two years and eight months.
The nature of the outlet works can best be under-
stood by a perusal of the drawn plan of the project.
The size of the valves and feeder tunnels, and the total
capacity of the valves are still tentative, and may be
subject to material alteration. As now planned, the
only openings through the dam will be the outlets at
river level, for passing the low water flow of the river
while the diversion tunnels are being plugged. The
spillways will be of ample capacity, to conform with
the conservative design of the dam, and will discharge
any flood up to 500.000, or so, second-feet without over-
topping the dam. As can be seen from the drawing,
they will be of the glory-hole type, about 50 feet in
diameter.
Lying immediately adjacent to the dam will be found
the power house, whose installation will consist of
twelve 85,000 h.p. turbines, and twelve 75,000 kva.
generators with exciters and accessory equipment neces-
sary to the operation and maintenance of the plant. The
calculated output of the plant will be 1,000,000 h.p. on
a 55 per cent load factor. In other words, the plant is
expected to deliver 3,600,000,000 kw. hours each year.
The disposal of this power must, under the provisions
of the Congressional bill, be disposed of under contract
by the Secretary of the Interior before any money for
the beginning of construction is available. This has
already been oversubscribed two or three times, and it
will be a matter of tact to dispose of it without causing
a dispute among the interested states, municipalities
and corporations. At 1.63 mills per kw. hour, the ex-
pected revenue will be $6,000,000 a year. As con-
trasted to the cost of the dam, $10,600,000, and the
power plant. $38,200,000. it will 1 )e seen that the pro-
ject will pay for itself within fifty years. The dam is,
emphatically, not being paid for by taxation.
The plans for river diversion call for upstream and
downstream cofferdams with diversion tunnels on
either side of the river, designed for a maximum diver-
sion of 200,000 second-feet. This figure was decided
on by the Colorado River Board after careful investiga-
tion, and the tunnels will be used as power and spillway
conduits after plugging. It was originally planned to
make the crest of the upper cofferdam 79 feet aliove
low water level, but for safety's sake, the provision of
50 foot tunnels will permit a 55 foot cofferdam to l&gt;e
used. It is planned to build the cofferdams, pump
out the intervening space, and remove some 530,000
cubic yards of sand, gravel and boulders to reach bed-
rock, in one low water period of nine months.
The Delta and Imperial Valley
Once the dam is in place, it is interesting to examine
its effect on the flow of the Colorado. The normal
flood season of the uncontrolled river causes damage
that cries for elimination. Gagings have been made
over a period of years, notably at Yuma, and from the
information secured there and at other river stations,
the flow at Boulder Dam has been calculated to be any-
where from 10,000,000 to 13,000,000 acre-feet a year.
Evidence points to the latter figure as l&gt;eing that of the
present day. This vast volume of water naturally
picks up silt from unforested areas during flood sea-
sons, and that has been estimated to be about 137,000
acre-feet a year.
This silt is deposited in the delta of the river where
the fall is small, and its deposition has the effect of
making the channel fluctuate violently. If it were not
for the careful control exercised, the river would
quickly erode the Imperial Valley levees, but, as it is,
the situation is becoming more acute each year. Al-
ready the bottom of the river in the dangerous zone is
nine feet above the level of the surrounding land.
The completion of the Boulder Dam will provide the
remedy for this, but it also involves the filling up of the
Boulder basin. Without the construction of upstream
dams, it would take about 190 years for the silting to
be complete. However, there are upstream projects in
plan that will reduce this, and at the end of the fifty
year period, by which time the dam will have paid for
itself, at least 75 per cent of the power will still be
available.
The last point to treat with is the use which will be
made with the water aside from power. It has not l&gt;een
mentioned heretofore, but in the Boulder Dam bill
passed by Congress, provision is made for an Ail-
American canal, to carry water for irrigation purposes
from Laguna Dam at Yuma to the Imperial and
Coachella Valleys in California. This will obviate the
difficulties attendant to the upkeep of the present Im-
perial canal much of which lies within Mexico. The
All-American canal will have a ten mile stretch across
an area of sand dunes, which are decidedly windswept,
but the investigating board agreed to the feasibility of
the project. This will cost an additional $38,500,000.
Further, the dam will serve as a storage basin for
the tremendous $200,000,000 aqueduct that is l&gt;eing
planned by the southern coast cities of California, the

extravagant expenditure. As the price of books in-
creased, publishers found it necessary to stimulate
trade by providing cheap editions of books of recog-
nized merit,—standard works, or contemporary books
which had passed their first popularity. The result is
what is sometimes facetiously called the Ford of the
book business,—the dollar edition. Fortunately com-
petition for the enormous mass of this trade has been
so keen that nearly, if not quite, a score of editions
are now available which list everything from the Iliad
and the Odyssey to the best seller of a year ago. More-
over the books are attractively made; press work, pa-
per, binding, are often not to be distinguished from
those of more expensive editions.
Of course to appreciate the opportunity afforded the
book lover by these dollar editions, one need hardly
be so naive as to imagine that the publishers have been
animated by purely altruistic motives. They have
shrewdly guessed that if one has once tasted the satis-
faction of buying his books as he reads them, he will
continue to buy books no matter what they cost. They
count on human weakness, for the love of books is
like the love of drink, or of antiques, or of oriental
rugs. A real book lover can no more resist an at-
tractive book than can the collector of antiques a rare
old Chippendale chair or an ancient rug of Tabriz.
But while the Ford idea of mass production and
mass sales of a cheap product invades the book busi-
ness, why should one not take advantage of it and
establish a habit of collecting books which will he an

Never-ending search for truth
Today, in a locked room in the Crane laboratories, can
be seen a cherry-red bar of metal. In a specially de-
vised air-tight cylinder, under constant temperature of
16oo° F., at fixed stress, it is being given the I ooo hour
"flow" test. At the same temperature, at various stresses,
it will be given the same test for the same time-period.
The tests are being made at the request of an oil man
who has asked for valves for an experimental still, to
operate at I 5000 and 2500 pounds. Can he have them?
At the end of the exhaustive tests, Metallurgist L. W.
Spring will be able to tell "him, exactly, authoritatively.
Since the first Crane chemical and testing laboratory
was founded in 1888, thousands of similar questions so
vital to safe and economical industrial progress, have been
asked and answered. The contribution made by Crane
metallurgists to scientific knowledge of the reaction of
metals under high pressures and temperatures is known
and respected throughout the world, is familiar to every
oil man who has used the cracking process and every
engineer who has to do with piping.
The truths discovered and scientific data collected are
embodied in a book, Pioneering in Science. This is a
reference manual invaluable to engineering students.

Power^the Force Behind
Modern Civilization
Mightiest of all the mighty forces behind modern
civilization is Electric Power. For Electricity ex-
tends its benefits to all. With power great enough
to turn the huge wheels of industry, it is so easily
controlled, so convenient, and so low in price,
that the housewife may use it to heat her iron, to
run her sewing machine, or to operate her vacu-
um cleaner.
Rex Equipment has done much to bring the price
of electric power within the reach of the house-
holder and the small business.
Rex Coal and Ash Handling Systems, Rex-Steams

Screens do their part in reducing Power Plant
costs, and lowering the price of electric power.
Rex Equipment for the mechanical handling of

Transitory Slants
It was Field Day down in Hades and the engineers
had come for miles around to take part in the festivities.
The feature prize of the day was a ton of coal to be
given to the man who had loved the most women in his
sojourn on earth.
The first man to present himself was old Attababie,
who in his day had taken unto himself a dozen wives,
and was considered no slouch with the dames around
Galilee.
Then came one Ali Ben Doing, himself a mean baby
with the wenches, who produced a photo of himself
with his harem of a hundred hot mamas.
"You guys can go home," sneered a fella named
Solomon. "Every day for two years was my wedding
day, and seven hundred dames called me sweetheart."
He was just about to wheel away the ton of coal when
a gruff voice stopped him.
"Who the heck are you?" roared Solomon.
"Listen, you piker," said the bozo, "I was an iceman
in Salt Lake City for twenty years!"
—Minn. Techno-Log. o
He: It is so dark in here I can hardly see my hand
before my face.
She: But John, you hand isn't before your face."
— o
We also have with us the absent-minded professor
who, on leaving his home, banged his wife and kissed
the door.
o
"What was that you said, George?" she asked as she
unfastened her dress, "say it again, please, dear." She
let her dress fall to the floor. "Oh, George, will you,
please?" She took off her shoes and then her stockings.
"Are you sure it will be all right?" She stepped over
to the davenport and sat down. A long pause ensued.
"Promise you won't tell a soul—" Her silk under-
things fell at her feet. "All right, George—goodbye."
She hung up the receiver.
o
"That will be enough out of you," said the milkmaid
as she moved on to the next cow.

When his daughter returned from the girl's college,
the farmer regarded her critically, and then demanded:
"Ain't you a lot fatter than you was?"
"Yes, Dad," the girl admitted. "I weigh one hun-

The father stared for a moment in horrified amaze-
ment, then shouted, "Who in thunder in Jim?"

THE SLIDE-RULE DANCE
"Say, Ed, got your problems for tonite?"
"What do you mean?"
"Oh, I just wondered if you had all your dances
filled."
"Oh, so that is what you mean? Why, yes and no.
I have an independent variable here tonite."
"Well, you know at these functions that the vari-
ables mean a lot. By the way, how is that blind entity
that George procured for you?"
"Well, I guess she is all right. Anyway, I look at
the proposition this way. Take an infinitesimal element
of volume and integrate between the limits of 2 heels
and a lock of hair. Now, if the computed volume falls
within the limits of 98# per sq. in. and 118# per sq.
in., the working stress can be assumed to be 108#
per sq. in. This factor is about right for it only takes
110# per sq. in. to push a wheelbarrow. This dame I
got falls in the 124# class but her foundations are so
firm that a great working stress can be utilized. I
have not as yet been able to get a word in edgeways
with her so I don't know much about her. But while
she was talking I took this slip stick on the program
and computed her windload. This was within limits
considering the weight of the superstructure. Well, let
me tell yuh, Ed, that's the way to analyze these coeds,
ain't it?"
"Yeh, it's alright, Boy."
"Well, guess I'll look up the Horse. Say, gosh this
floor is slippery. What was the idea, Ed? Did you
want me to cut myself if I fell down? It looks about
as shiny as George's forehead. Well, see yuh later."
"You bet."
"Hello dear. Did I keep you waiting? Oh, I am so
sorry (rats). Let's go over and hear this act. Yeh,
that's Wilross, the ventriloquist. Bill's the one with
the mustache.
"Shh—don't make so much noise. I want to hear
the dummy."
"Oh, stupid, that is Bill talking."
"I know it but the dummy is sitting on his knee, isn't
he?"
"Yes, which knee?"
"Shh—listen to the dummy—
(Dummy)—"Say I saw Ed Xell the other day while
he was getting a manicure."
Will—"Is that so? What did he say?"
Dummy—"He said that he had just bought $20,000
worth of fire insurance."
Will—"Gee, that's funny."
Dummy—"Oh, I don't know, guess he knows where
he is going."
Will—-"Say, Pemberton, when was Ed getting the
manicure?"
Dummy—-"Oh, on Thursday."
Will—"Why the dance wasn't until Friday."
Dummy—"Well, he wanted the shine to wear off of
his nails and he had to take a couple of baths between
times. It sure must have been tough on Ed, I should
imagine.—Say, Bill, let's go home—Goodnight, folks."
"Well, honey, how did you like that?"
"That was cute, wasn't it?"
"Not bad for a beginner."
"Isn't Bill good looking, though?"
"Oh, that was the dummy on his knee."
"Fresh! Let's dance."
"Gee, but that music is terrible. Don't you think so?"
"Yeh. Guess this is the first time they have played
outside of Chi."
"You're right, the noise of the bullets won't drown
out their music here. Well, that's one dance over. Do
you dance much? No, but you love to swim? Well,
we will have to go swimming sometime soon. Gee, I'm
tired."
"Hurry up now, they are going to have the Grand
March (somebody didn't know it was April). Well,
there they start."
"Who is leading the march?"
"Why, that is L. Verne Ansel."
"Oh, so that is what is behind that red riblxin. I
was wondering. Is that the whole committee?"
"Sure, that one on the end is a tryout. Say, by
golly, they aren't coming down this way. Must lie they

AIR TRANSPORTATION
(Continued from page 9)
The growth of transportation may be divided into
two parts, "expansion within the field itself" and
"normal growth." An expansion "within the field it-
self" is shown by the increasing automobile registration.
Thus, as people have become more "motor vehicle
minded," automobile registration has increased by leaps
and bounds, and this expansion may be expected to
continue until the automobile field is saturated. After
that condition has been attained automobile registration
will probably realize a steady conservative expansion.
The railroad growth is what may be termed "normal
growth." That is, the number of miles of line are
practically fixed and the development of business is
merely the slow steady development due to an increasing
population. At present the field of aviation is far from
the saturation point and the analysis of its traffic must
be made from the view-point of growth within the
field itself. The increase in traffic for air mail, pas-
sengers, and express is shown in the above chart. At-
tention is called to the curve showing the railroad
freight, as an example of a normal growth. It is anti-
cipated that the other curves will show a sharp increase
in traffic as organization in air transportation becomes
more efficient and the public becomes more air-minded.
In a study of traffic possibilities for an air route, a
determination should be made of how much the public
is willing to pay for time saved. Using another com-
parison with the railroads we find that the traveler is
willing to pay the excess fare charged for the addi-
tional speed of "glass surface" trains, such as the 20th
Century Limited and Broadway Limited. The saving
of time benefits not only the traveler, but the shipper
of merchandise as well. Express is high speed freight
service with store-door delivery. A study of railway
express and railway freight will indicate the value the

"Loop" eighteen seconds apart—discharging 1500 pas-

Safe, fast service requires cars kept in condition. Profits
for the road makes low upkeep essential. And alert
management has found numerous ways to speed repairs,
and swell profits—with compressed air.
Air spray painting has reduced hand labor from sixteen
hours, to two hours, per car. Compressed air cuts out
rivets, sets new ones, drills, sandblasts, runs a disc
sander on flat surfaces, tests brakes, hoists materials.
And now, the management has taken another step in
economy. After using Sullivan single stage compres-

public places on this faster service. The trend today is
to reduce costs wherever and whenever possible, by
saving time, and it is this principle which has produced
the large volume of business handled by the railway
express. The same method of approach may be used
in comparing the air express with the rail express, and
is decidedly the most logical method of predicting the
volume of air traffic.
Selection of Appropriate Air Equipment and
Terminal Facilities
The proper selection of equipment is one of the im-
portant decisions which must be made, if the success
of an air transport line is to be assured. The first
question to consider is whether lighter-than-air or
heavier-than-air equipment should be used. Large
dirigibles for use in air transport are very expensive to
build and operate, but they are capable of carrying large
pay loads for long distances without stops for refueling.
Again, dirigibles are more reliable in case of motor
failure, due to their ability to stay aloft. However, for
the same expenditure which would be required to build
and operate one dirigible, a large fleet of planes could
be built and operated. This would permit faster and
more frequent service than would be possible using
lighter-than-air equipment. Consequently, it does ap-
pear that for over-land transportation the airplane is
the more suitable, while the lighter-than-air equipment
is better in long distance over-water transport service.
Since heavier-than-air equipment is used exclusively,
at the present time on air transport routes in the United
States, further discussion of the selection of equipment
will be limited to this class. For the proper choice of
equipment certain fundamental requirements must be
laid down. These may be enumerated as follows.
Safety and reliability.
Singleness of function.
Economy
The first requirement, that of safety and reliability, is
of prime importance if air transport is to compete with
other forms of public transportation.
Due to the limited markets in the past, it has been
necessary for the manufacturers to build planes which
could \k used for more than one purpose. It has been
proven by the past experiences of the air mail operators
that the same plane cannot be used efficiently for trans-
porting both mail and passengers. Also, that planes
designed for mail service cannot be used satisfactorily
for photographic work or taxi service. For economic
operation in any class of air transport work, planes of
special design for that work must be used. So we have
the second requirement—singleness of purpose.
The third requirement is that of economy. The
function of air transportation is to provide fast, safe,
and reliable transportation at reasonable cost. Fast
transportation at reasonable cost necessitates economic
operation. This will require striking a balance between

TURNING IDEAS
INTO REALITIES
The well-lighted and completely equipped chemical labora-
tory pictured below is the scene of many interesting and
valuable developments in modern chemical manufacture.
Here the ideas of many of our men pass through the experi-
mental stage to actuality.
Each of our one hundred and ninety graduate chemists,
mechanical engineers, and physicists has at his command the
faculties of this marvelous chemical laboratory. In addition
he has access to a remarkable physical laboratory, a complete
library, and a machine shop for experimental purposes.
Facilities like these foster individual initiative. Because they
are unhampered in their work, and left free to carry out their
own ideas, many of our men have developed new processes
that have attracted world-wide comment. Thus Dow offers
unlimited opportunities by providing the means and the in-
centive for creative work. The result is an increasing number
of new and better processes that have gained recognition
throughout the world.

high cruising speed, large pay-load, and low operating
and maintenance cost.
Thus far only the general requirements have Ijeen
discussed. The question then arises what type of air-
planes best satisfy these requirements. Three general
classes of traffic are recognized, namely, mail, express,
and passenger. For mail and express traffic the im-
portant factors to consider are high percentage of pay
load to gross weight, safety, cruising speed, and low
operating cost. Of these probably high pay load and
economy of operation are the most important. Safety
is important, of course, but not to the degree that it is
in passenger transportation. Large pay load and
economy of operation are best obtained by single-
engined open cockpit biplanes, judging from the num-
ber of mail and express lines using this type of equip-
ment. Single-engined monoplanes could be used for
light express or mail service, but the single-engined
biplane is very popular. This popularity is probably
due to its lighter construction, as the biplane is less
efficient aerodynamically than the monoplane. How-
ever, as the load increases, three-engined cabin mono-
planes will probably prove to be the best. A large tri-
motored monoplane will combine large pay load with
good aerodynamic efficiency and, with three engines, the
reliability will be increased.
In passenger transport the plane requirements are
somewhat different from those in mail and express
transport. Safety is the prime requisite, then high
cruising speed, comfort and low operating cost. Where
light, fast planes could be satisfactorily used on mail
and express lines, heavier planes, having large cabin
capacities and possessing a high degree of inherent sta-
bility, must be used on passenger lines. On the main
lines large tri-motored all-metal monoplanes will prob-
ably best fulfil the requirements. On the less important
feeder lines higher, single-engined, cabin monoplanes
could be used to advantage. Some designers are pre-
dicting that large twin-engined biplanes will play an
important part in the development of air passenger
traffic in the future.
Another consideration, entering into the selection of
air equipment, is the choice of land-planes, amphibians,
sea-planes, or flying-boats. If the route lies entirely
over land, land-planes of course should be selected. If
the line runs through parts of the country in which
heavy snows are common, provision should be made
for replacing the wheels with skis for winter operation.
In case the route lies partly over land and partly over
water, such as the Cleveland to Detroit or the Grand
Rapids to Milwaukee routes, amphibians are the most
satisfactory. If the line lies along the ocean or along
the shore of one of the Great Lakes, sea-planes should
prove the most economical, but on long or heavy traffic
routes the flying-boat should be selected.

It has been said an airway is on the ground. The
truth of this assertion can be seen when one considers
that everything which has to do with an air line, except
the actual flying of the plane, is done on the ground.
Even while the plane is in the air the pilot follows
ground markings to keep him on his course. Since so
much of the business of an air line is transacted on the
ground, it is apparent that good terminal facilities are
important. In fact the importance of the location of
an air transport terminal is several times as important
as it is for railroad or marine operations. The cities
which have been chosen as terminals of the air line may
have several airports, anyone of which might prove
satisfactory. In deciding which one to select, several
factors must be taken into consideration, such as:
Distance from the business center of the city.
Proximity of surface transportation facilities.
Proximity of air or surface transportation terminals.
Government rating of airports.
Meteorological conditions.
The distance from the business center of the city
should be as short as possible. Some form of quick
surface transportation should be available, in order
that the time saved by air travel will not be lost in
getting to the business center. Joint terminals have
many advantages over scattered individual ones. They
facilitate the interchange of traffic, offer material
economy in construction and operation, and better op-
portunity for trunk line connection to business centers.
A comparison of the government ratings for the dif-
ferent airports will determine readily which airport is
best from the standpoint of general equipment and
facilities, effective landing area, and night lighting
equipment. Another element to consider is the
meteorological conditions at the different airports, par-
ticularly the fog and visibility conditions. Even though
an airport may be highly satisfactory from other stand-
points, if the number of days of fog or low visibility
per year are large it should be disregarded and some
other location selected.
In case an airport has been found that is satisfactory
in all respects, except distance from the business sec-
tion, the main terminal may be located at this airport
and a "shuttle service" provided between this terminal
and an airport nearer the center of the city. Under
those circumstances the large transport ships will land
at the terminal and the passengers, mail or express will
be transferred to smaller planes and flown to the inner
airport. The administration and operation offices, han-
gars, shops and general activities could then be centered
at the suburban airport terminal. A typical airport has
been designed by Alexis Lapteff, '30A, showing how
facilities must be provided for the interchange of traffic
between air, rail, and highway at the air terminal of
the future.

Brown &amp; Sharpe Cutters stand up well on all types

service," or it may be located on a large landing area
constructed over downtown railroad freight yards with
land-planes used for the transfer. Unless radical
changes are made in the present equipment it is doubt-
ful whether the tops of large buildings will ever be
used to any extent for the landing of planes. It is an
admitted fact that the air over large cities is very
"bumpy," and if a plane of the present type should
attempt to land on a building roof, even one of large
area, the updrafts between the buildings would create
a dangerous situation.
Financial Considerations
In financing any air transportation company certain
costs must be taken into account. These are investment
costs, operating costs, and working capital. In order to
obtain a maximum percentage of profit it is necessary
to make the revenue from available traffic as great as
possible and at the same time, reduce operating and
investment costs to a minimum. Moreover, volume of
business will affect revenue, and any proportionate in-
crease in expenditures, will give a larger percentage of
profit, providing investment remains the same. The
cost of equipment will depend upon the volume of busi-
ness anticipated and the route selected. The class of
traffic, mail, passenger or merchandise, will be a factor
in the choice of equipment. If small fast planes are
used and a short-cut line contemplated, one plane can
make several round trips, thereby reducing the num-
ber of planes required and furnishing better service.
Here, again, the volume of business is a factor. The
cost of operations may be divided into fixed, mainten-
ance, and traffic, in which the scale of operations is the
determining factor. The cost of terminals will prob-
ably not be a factor in considering the costs of a pro-
posed route, as public opinion today favors govern-
mental ownership of airports. However, rental of
buildings and hangars and shop space will be required.
The cost of airway facilities is one of the indirect sub-
sidies furnished by the government and need not be
considered as an expense to the organization.
It is probable in the future that practically all air
transport companies will be incorporated, because their
size will require more capital than an individual will
care to handle and the risks involved should be shared
by a number of persons. The air transportation busi-
ness of the future will be on the basis of a common
carrier instead of a private carrier. The police power
of the states can be used to require very strict super-
vision of airplane operation on the basis of safety and
private welfare. In other words, it is not probable that
air transport carriers will be able to classify themselves
as private carriers and use this as a subterfuge to se-
cure private contracts as is done by some motor truck
companies. The very nature of the large number of
small air shippers will probably preclude air carriers
from handling large private contracts. The strict regu-
lation which is bound to follow will act as an incentive
for increased air business.

Conclusion
The expansion of air transportation will follow a
development somewhat similar to that of the railroads,
and the investigator will devote study to increasing the
volume of business, to more efficient operation, and to
the organization and location of air lines in the field
of greatest possibility. The Civil Engineer by research
in the growth of railroads, and with their statistics as
an aid, can draw comparisons with air transportation
and by these comparisons predict the best possible
methods of increasing air traffic. It would appear that
aviation will not enter the field in direct competition
with other facilities but, on the contrary, will find its
place as one of the principal assisting agencies in the
whole scheme of transportation.

which persist today, will disappear, and the literary
world will rescind her unappreciative attitude.
When a man writes as Louis Sullivan does, with his
straight-forward, clear-cut, and artistic style, he should
not be neglected or overlooked by this ever-increasinglv
rapid and variable world, but should be carefully ex-
amined and studied for the good he may have created.
We find many other men no less his equal as an author,
but to only a few of these can we accord the credit due
Louis Sullivan, a man who not only expressed himself
copiously in architecture but also turned to an entirely
dissimilar outlet for his ideals, hoping to perpetrate the
work he had produced as an architect and the principles
he had evolved as a philosopher.
To those who aspire to the higher things of life,
those who live to achieve, this l&gt;ook will serve as a
guide, pagenating the trials of the genius, his endeavors
and his successes. Dealing with the problem in such a
methodical, practical manner, the book might well be
dubbed "Sullivan's Handbook of Success."

opera of any existing building. With the Columbian
Fair at Chicago in 1893, Sullivan experienced a new
advance in his architectural career. /Daniel H. Burn-
ham, the master architect in charge of the work, en-
dowed Sullivan with the signal honor of designing the
Transportation Building, one of the largest and most
important structures of the group. Here the imagina-
tive artist expanded within him and gave birth to a
great work which, although it was not in the class with
permanent civic buildings, displayed that quality of
good taste and durability that most exposition architec-
ture lacks. Many criticize this somewhat over-ornate
structure as frivolous and non-architectonic but Frank
Lloyd Wright again defends his friend and teacher
with the following statement in a recent book: "It was
a 'picture-building'—but one with rhyme and reason
and, above all, individuality; a real picture, not a mere
pose of the picturesque." The Transportation Building
will, undoubtedly live long on its many merits.
During his earlier days he had worked almost ex-
clusively in pure trabeated architecture, seeing in it an
element of stability and power lacking in the archated
forms. Later he reconstructed this theory and em-
ployed the arch in many forms which, due to his master-
touch, lost nothing in strength. The Transportation
Building and several later buildings were designed in
this form. By virtue of his masterful work on the
Fair, Sullivan attracted a large clientele from all parts
of the country, receiving many profitable commissions
for buildings which, although significant in magnitude
and excellent in design, failed to surpass his earlier
achievements and are, therefore, of little interest in
the study of his development. His later life he largely
employed in writing, attempting to preserve the prin-
ciples he had so carefully formulated in his youth and
to which he still adhered.
His life's history, which he calls "An Autobiography
of an Idea,"* he completed shortly before his death,
leaving it as his testimonial of his intense devotion to
his art. He was a frequent contributor to the archi-
tectural journals, at home and abroad, making his in-
fluence felt by all who read them. This influence still
exists in its full potency in the middle west.
With his untimely passing in 1924, the architectural
world lost a man who had perhaps done more for his
profession than any one other American, one who had
effectively resisted the continuance of the stagnate,
unregenerate period of Classicism, one who had dared
to isolate his ideas from the set moulds of antiquity, one
who strove to create, not to plagiarize, and above all,
one who succeeded to substantially ameliorate the de-
cadent civilization of which he was a part. Louis Sulli-
van, master architect and profound thinker, sinks back
into obscurity but his ideals live forever.

Nine years ago the University
of Pittsburgh, then a hundred
and thirty-six years old, faced
an urgent need for larger quar'

campus was almost out of the
question, for a city had built
up around it. The logical direc'

the air.
American business had long
before faced the same situation,
and met it with the skyscraper.
But no conventional business
building would satisfy here.
Chancellor John Gabbert Bow'

express the essential self of the
steel center of the world, a
structure with more power,
more spirit of achievement and
reverence in it than had ever
before been attempted. A great
architect put his soul into the
making of the plans. Leading
suppliers were called on for the
materials for the realization of
Chancellor Bowman's dream.

Recent Developements in High
Temperature Control
By C. V. IMONRAD, iirad.
MANY attempts have been made during the
past few years to find a suitable method of
producing and controlling temperatures in the
range between that possible with steam and with
hot furnace crises, between
400° F. to 800° F.
The critical temperature of
steam (temperature above
which no pressure will con-
dense the vapor) is around 690°
F., and the corresponding pres-
sure is 2860 Ib./sq. in. Boilers
are in operation at present up
to 1400 lb./sq. in. in large cen-
tral stations, but these must be
very carefully designed and the
cost is very great. For this
reason most commercial plants
do not desire to use much over
150 lb./sq. in. in their steam
lines, as the initial installation
cost increases very rapidly
above this pressure.
It might be thought possible
to use superheated steam at
low pressures to obtain the desired temperatures,
but a careful study of the problem shows that this
is not feasible. It has been recognized for over
fifty years that the main resistance to heat flow
from a metal wall to a moving fluid (generally
turbulent) is that of a very thin film of fluid at the
THE control of steam and hot
furnace gases has for a long
time been a perplexing problem
for the Engineer. The Author in
this article has given us a concise
review of the more intricate prob-
lems connected with this subject
and presented an account of the
latest cardinal accomplishments
in this field. The invocation of
new materials as heating mediums
appears to be the means by which
a suitable solution of the problems
can be accomplished. The discus-
sion of the feasibility of the use
of diphenyl as presented in this
article should prove of great inter-
est to Engineers in all fields of
work.
—The Editor.
the heat must pass by pure conduction. Thus if
heat passes from one fluid to another through a
metal wall it must pass by conduction through one
film, then through the wall, and finally through the
second film, from which it is
removed by convection currents
in the main stream. Although
these films are extremely thin
the thermal conductivity of
most fluids is so low that the
major resistance to the heat
flow is found in these films. In
most cases the resistance of the
wall is negligible since the
thermal conductivity of metals
is very high. This fact has not
been recognized universally
until rather recently, and in fact
even now some investigators
wonder why the use of a copper
tube instead of an iron one in
a condenser does not have an
appreciable effect on the heat
transfer. It has been known
for a long time that copper
has a greater thermal conduc-
tivity than iron.
In general, therefore, there are three resistances
to the flow of heat from one fluid to another. These
resistances act very similarly to those in an electric
circuit and may be handled by the same general
methods in calculation. The available temperature

flowing to the amperage, etc. Thus, if one of the
resistances in series is very high, all, or practically
all, of the temperature difference is across it. With
a given temperature difference over all the resist-
ances, an amount of heat will flow corresponding to
the total resistance, and the temperature difference
will be divided inversely proportionately to the re-
sistances. In most cases it is customary to evalu-
ate the reciprocal of the resistance, or the conduct-
ance, which is called the heat transfer coefficient.

The heat
transfer coeffi-
cient varies
greatly accord-
ing to the type
and properties
of the fluids or
other substan-
ces used, but
some idea of
the values to be
expected may
be obtained
from the fol-
lowing.
(1) Condensing steam to metal wall 1500 to 3000
(2) Hot gas to metal wall 2 to 50
(3) Superheated steam to metal wall.. 2 to 50
(4) Wall to non-boiling liquid 25 to 500
(5) Wall to boiling liquid 100 to 1500
The high values found in the case of condensing
steam is due to the fact that the entire resistance is
due to the film of condensate which drains by grav-
ity very quickly. All the other cases involve much
thicker films of fluid. If the coefficient is calculated
for a J^-inch copper wall it is found to be equal to
the thermal conductivity divided by the thickness
or: 220X18X 8=21120.'
It is apparent that if heat is being carried from
condensing steam to a gas through a copper wall
the resistances of both the steam and the wall may
be neglected, and the entire resistance assumed to
be that of the gas film. The same assumption may-
be made in the case of a liquid being heated or boil-
ed with steam, although in this case the assump-
tion is not valid.
If. however, superheated steam is used to heat a
liquid the reverse is true if the vapor does not con-
dense, and the major resistance is that of the steam
film. The amount of heat flowing is very much
less than when steam is condensing, and the
amount of surface required is correspondingly
greater, resulting in greater initial cost of equip-
ment. In addition, only the specific heat of the
steam is avail-
able, and this
is so low that
the vapor
changes very
greatly in tem-
perature, a n d
the desired
control of tem-
perature is lost.
With conden-
sing steam the
tern perature
control is very
good, since it
condenses a t
constant tem-
perature, giv-
ing up only th'"
latent heat of
vaporization.
In the same
way the use of
a hot gas for
heating a liquid
means usually
that the surface
must be much
larger than
when condensing steam is used, unless the gas is
extremely hot. If too great temperature differences
are used, local overheating often takes place, and in
many cases the product is spoiled.
At present many plants use a rather high-boiling
oil which is heated and circulated past the desired
heating surface. The only heat given up by the
oil is the specific heat and the oil changes greatly
in temperature from one end to the other of the
apparatus. The coefficient of heat transfer from
the oil is rather low, the power costs high, and the
temperature control poor.
Electric heating is used to a large extent in cer-
tain parts of the country, when very accurate con-
trol of temperature is desired, but this method is
too expensive for general use.
Since condensing steam gave such very high heat
transfer coefficients, and accurate control of tem-

What Shall I Read?
Victor Hugo's "fLes Miserable***
By J. BALEIGB XELSON, Professor of English
IX choosing Les Miserables for this last talk on
hooks for the year, I have been prompted by a
desire to share with the readers of these columns
an experience that has given me increasing satisfaction
as I have repeated my reading of this great book
periodically from year to year, returning to it with
fresh interest as I caught more of its meaning and
purpose. I have put, in as con-
densed and definite a form as
possible, what I have come to
understand to be its significant,
unifying idea. Those who have
not read the book may be saved
much confusion by getting first
this feeling of central theme;
those who have read it may find
it interesting to check their own
impressions against mine to see
how well we agree as to what
Hugo was attempting to do.
The interpretation of Les Mis-
erables is made especially difficult
by its massive proportions. ■ One
cannot read the five great books
of which it is composed at a
single sitting. It is an experi-
ence that must extend over days
or weeks. While the interest in-
herent in the story is sufficient to
carry one over the necessary in-
terruption's in his reading, the
idea that unifies the incidents and
episodes is apt to be lost. To
make matters worse there are the great digressions,—
the Battle of Waterloo, the Convents, the Sewers of
Paris,—treated at a length which appears quite out of
proportion to their importance, and having, at first
thought, no very close relation to the development of
the plot. They lie like insuperable barriers across one's
path, halting the narrative and interrupting one's prog-
ress with the story. One either reads them without
considering their relation to the plot for their philo-
sophical, social, or political significance, or he omits
them altogether in order to get on with the action.
One is also often vaguely aware of a certain illy-de-
fined symbolism that is confusing unless one has, to
begin with, a notion of the author's initial purpose.
In the first place, one may infer much by considering
the title and the preface in which it may be assumed
the author has intended to convev as immediately and
VICTOR HUGO is one of the
most famous writers of the
French Romantic Period. He has
given many priceless volumes to
the literature of that age. His
books are often shunned by read-
ers because of their great length.
To the reader who has had the
perseverance to complete one of
these large volumes, the main
theme of the work has often been
lost in the flowing descriptions.
This month, Professor Nelson
has given us a vivid review of
the principal themes that are em-
bodied in "Les Miserables." We
know that his review will be wel-
comed by those Technic readers
who delight in reveling in the
flowing descriptions of Hugo's
works, since now they may keep
in mind the star of thought to
light their way through the end-
less catacombs of Hugo's great-
est work.

directly as possible his germinal idea. Les Miserables
is a study of the unfortunate classes—so much the title
tells the reader. The three social problems with which
it deals, the preface indicates, are the degradation of
man by poverty, the dwarfing of childhood by physical
and spiritual night, the ruin of woman by starvation
and social injustice. The implied purpose of this
study of the three great problems
of society is to indicate a cure.
The first book, Fantine, states
these three problems, suggests a
possible solution, and indicates
the opposition to be expected
from organized society. Jean
Valjean, the escaped galley slave,
degraded and embittered by so-
cial injustice; Fantine, the
woman deprived of her virtue by
the lack of responsibility of man;
Cossette, the child dwarfed by
poverty,—for such human prob-
lems, the book suggests, there is
but one remedy, an awakened
social conscience. Jean Valjean
represents the extreme case of a
man who has become incarnate
hate. The wrongs he has suf-
fered have made him a "danger-
ous man," ready to steal or mur-
der, or do anything to avenge
himself. Into his black soul
shines the white vision of the
Bishop, who is the incarnate
realization of the ideal destined to reform the social
order,—the compassionate, brotherly man. At once
begins the evolution of the social conscience of Jean
Valjean, which is destined to transform the convict
into a replica of the Christ. The thesis—it is hardly
so explicit or formal as that—is clear: the spirit of
brotherhood, exercised consistently is contagious; it
spreads from man to man; it stirs a response in even
so depraved a heart as Jean Valjean's, and begins re-
generation; it is this self-propagating spirit that will
finally permeate and redeem society. In the sinister
figure of Jovert, the police inspector, the symbol of
the relentless operation of the authority of the estab-
lished order, one sees also the greatest obstacle to the
coming of the new social ideal. The spirit of the man
touched by the new impulse of social compassion and

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Motion Analysis by
the Stroboscope
By JESS J. CARMICHAEL, '3IE
FIG. 1—TIME EXPOSURE OF OIL DROPS IN RAPID FLIGHT.
FORTUNATELY, for man, the blurring effect
produced by a moving body warns him of dan-
gers, but on the other hand, it is a serious handi-
cap to him in studying motions of machines. Who is
it who can say positively, that a given push rod follows
a cam smoothly over a complete cycle; or who can tell
at a glance just how much belt slippage there is, for
instance, between
a vacuum cleaner
motor and the
beating or sweep-
ing brush it is
driving? If a
tachometer is put
on either the mo-
tor or the brush,
decreased speed is
the result due to
the added load of
the tachometer it-
self, and accurate
measurement i s
impossible.
Yet with the
stroboscope it is
possible to obtain
quickly and accurately the speed of the driving motor
and of the brush itself, affording accurate computation
of the belt slippage. As for the cam and push rod,
astonishing results are obtained. Here it is possible
to look directly at the parts in question and actually
see that the cam and push rod seem to stand still and
then, at the will of the operator, slowly proceed through
their cycle of operation or even seem to move back-
ward, hence enabling the observer to determine exactly
what happens just before a particular instant in ques-
tion, and also what happens at the following instant.
This means that if the change in curvature of a cam
is so abrupt as to cause the push rod to jump as it
passes this point, the observer will actually see the
push rod standing out in thin air, so to speak, and can
keep it there: then at will, he can let it progress still
farther and determine exactly where it again lands back
on the profile of the cam. This exact information al-
lows him to change the design, giving him an oppor-
tunity to check the results, and enabling him to sense
the conditions that obtain instead of just guessing
at them as would otherwise be the case. He thus
experiences something beyond the ralm his sense
of sight had previously allowed him to enter.
The principle of the stroboscope is not new but
with the application of the neon light which is a
comparatively recent development, new and greater
possibilities of its application to different fields arise,
due to the increased simplicity of control and its
portable features. The operation of the stroboscope
is dependent on the property of the eye to retain an
image, much in
the same way
that motion pic-
tures are just
brief glimpses of
slightly different
pictures, which,
when following
closely enough in
succession, seem
to be one picture
of continuous ac-
tion. With the
stroboscope,
h o w ever, the
idea is to supply
the eye w i t h
these brief
glimpses only at
the instant that particular part of the machine con-
sidered is at a specified point in its cycle. At other
times the machine is invisible. To effect the appear-
ance of a body at rest, these glimpses must occur no
earlier in the cycle or later, but at exactly the right
instant to catch the fan blade, gear tooth, crank
pin, or what not, in precisely the position it held at
the previous instant on the preceding cycle. These
repeated glimpses give the eye the impression that
the crank pin remains at that particular spot, much
as the effect produced when light from a concen-
trated source is reflected off the sides of a hexagon
nut on the end of a shaft, making the nut appear to
be standing still while the shaft turns.
The first practical instrument of the type of a
stroboscope was produced by Plateau (1801-1883).
of Ghent. Belgium. It has also appeared in a num-
ber of ramifications, some of which are toys, such
as the phenakistoscope. the thaumanatope, as
Stamfer's Stroboscopic Discs of 1846, and as the
modern kinematograph. All of these use the
glimpse effects, but the great difficulty with effects
produced heretofore in stroboscopic observations
was of a mechanical nature. One method is the use

of a tuning fork with slotted wings fitted on the
prongs. As the prongs vibrate, the slots periodically
interrupt the vision of the observer, however in this
case the difficulty lies in the necessity of supplying
a large number of tuning forks with given known
frequencies. In one type, a disc with an aperture
rotates in front of the observer's eye, but the diffi-
culty of adjustment and inconvenience of observing
objects from all angles makes this method cumber-
some. The Ashdown Stroboscope has been used
with considerable success in various places, for in-
stance in spinning mills for observing the speeds of
rotation of spindles and for detecting any defects in
spinning processes. The Heteroptic Shutter is a com-
bination of two apertured cylinders, one rotating
within the other, the one inside rotating at the slower
speed. Inside is placed a light. The inner cylinder
regulates the frequency of light emission while the
other cylinder regulates the time of exposure. This
method is capa-
ble of "stopping ft
motion" up to
40,000 R. P. M.
Still another
method is the
use of an elec-
tric arc which
is supplied by
alternating cur-
rent. Since the
sine wave sup-
ply has zero
magnitude twice
each cycle, the
arc is out or
dark twice each
cycle, making
two light cycles
per cycle of the
alternating sup-
ply. The difficulty with the arc is that the light in-
tensity during on periods is not constant and hence
gives a blurring or hazy effect. Also, adjustments
are not effected easily. A rotating mirror is used in
another type of stroboscope and reflects a beam of
light which travels over the moving object.
Now we come to the application of the neon lamp,
or gas-discharge lamp. If an increasing potential is
applied to this lamp no current flows until a certain
critical voltage is reached, at which instant a dis-
ruptive discharge or glow discharge takes place,
with the emission of light. After the glow starts,
the current continues to flow with the accompany-
ing emission of light until a definite lower critical
voltage is reached at which instant the current
stops flowing and the lamp is dark again. The
exact values of the starting and stopping voltages
depends upon the characteristics of the lamp and

hence are a detail of design. It is apparent that
the solution of the problem of motion analysis is
solved in this flashing of the lamp at the proper
intervals to catch the crank pin mentioned above,
in exactly the same position each time. If the
frequency of the lamp is exactly that of the rota-
tion of the machine the effect is the appearance of a
body at rest. It can be seen also that if the fre-
quency of the light is just a little lower than that of
the rotating body, the point in question will be just
a little farther advanced in its cycle each successive
flash. This gives the effect of continuous slow ad-
vancing motion. Moreover, if the frequency of the
flashes is one flash per minute less than the R.P.M.
of the rotating machine, the machine appears to make
one rotation forward per minute. This shows, then,
that it is easily possible to measure the speed of the
machine accurately to within a fraction of a revolu-
tion per minute, provided the frequency of the alter-
nating supply is
known with the
same degree of
accuracy. In
case the fre-
quency of the
flashes is a little
greater than the
speed of rota-
tion, each suc-
cessive flash
comes just be-
fore the point in
question has ad-
vanced as far as
before, and the
effect is an ap-
parent backward
rotation of the
machine. Ac-
cordingly, the
operator can apparently swing the object back and
forth over a small range and concentrate his observa-
tion on detailed movements.
It only takes a little imagination to picture a host
of uses to which this instrument can be applied
not only in the design of machine details, but even
for observing the action of non-rigid bodies and also
the action of liquids or finely divided articles such
as sand or grain under certain conditions of agita-
tion or movement. Wave motion in vibrating
strings, wires, etc. can be analyzed. In Figure (1)
is reproduced a picture taken of oil drops being
expelled under pressure through a hole in a thin
outer sheath surrounding a rapidly rotating shaft
provided with an oil line through its center. The
oil supply is at the opposite end of the shaft and the
path of the oil is down the center until it reaches

The Delray Power House No. 3
By J. K. SALISBURY, &lt;.r»«l.
MANY years ago the Detroit Edison Company
erected just west of Fort Wayne in West
Fort street, a power plant, known as the
Delray plant. This was a most strategic location, since
it was in the center of a rapidly growing industrial dis-
trict, and on the Detroit river—which, at that time, was
very free from foreign material and offered an ex-
cellent supply of circulating
water for the condensers.
This item is always of prime
importance in selecting a site
for a steam turho-electric
power plant.
Five 3.000 Kilowatt turbo-
generators were installed in
this plant. Later these were
removed to make room for
four 9,000 Kilowatt vertical
turbo-generators, which were
the last word in design at that
time.
The use of a condenser to
create a vacuum on the low
pressure end of the turbine en-
ables one to more completely
utilize the energy in the steam.
It can easily be shown that there is as much available
energy in steam between an atmospheric pressure of
15 lbs. per sq. in. and 1 lb. per sq. in. abs. as there
is between 100 lbs. per sq. in. and 15 lbs. per sq. in.
abs.
Some years after this first plant was built it became
necessary to add to the system capacity. Delray Power
House No. 2 was then built. The metamorphosis of
the steam turbine was progressing rapidly, and several
units were installed in the 15,000 Kilowatt range, as
well as a new boiler plant containing the largest boilers
in the world at that period. Superheated steam was
fed to the turbines at about 200 lbs. per sq. in.
Soon these turbines proved inadequate to serve the
fast growing demand for power, another 150.000 Kw.
plant was built at Connors Creek, and a new horizontal
type 30,000 Kilowatt machine was installed at Delray.
This was the tenth turbine. The Tiorizontal machine
avoids the disadvantage of the vertical machine: the
necessity of using a large thrust bearing. Larger units
being more economical. No. 10 was soon used prac-
quired the addition of some of the older and less
economical units, or when No. 10 was down for re-
pairs. Meanwhile the Marysville and Trenton Channel
plants were erected.
In 1927, the boilers in Power House No. 1, having
become obsolete, they were abandoned completely and
the boiler room was dismantled. At this time plans
began to take shape for a new
ultra modern plant—Delray
Power House No. 3. This
was to be erected near the site
of the original power plant—
but somewhat nearer the river.
Cinders were used to fill in
and reclaim the land which
was partially submerged, and
to level off ground on the
water front. It is on this
land that the very last word
in steam plants has been
erected.

feet lielow the surface. Con-
siderable research was neces-
sary to determine a method of pouring concrete at this
depth without the inflow of water from the river. There
were many other problems to solve, each demanding the
most careful deliberation. There was, for instance, the
problem of powdered fuel. In recent years, a number
of powdered fuel plants have been installed. The use
of powdered fuel enables the operator to reach high
ratings of the boiler in a fraction of the time re-
quired with stoker fired boilers. High efficiencies are
er.sily obtained. There are, however, a number of very
serious disadvantages, such as the ash problem, the
added expense of preparation, etc. The fuel fed to
the burner is as fine as flour. W hen the powdered coal
is burned a large portion of the particles of ash re-
main suspended in the gases of combustion and are
carried out the stack in the solid form. This produces
a powdery Hue gas which settles like a sand storm over
the surrounding community. The stoker fired plant
neither requires elaborately prepared coal, nor does it
produce this dirty deposit of ashes on the surrounding
community. In a city of the character of Detroit it

is almost mandatory that stokers he used. I f powdered
fuel is used, dust-collecting apparatus must he placed
in the stack or flues to remove the fly-ash. This in-
stallation is an added expense, whereas with stokers
the cinders and ash may he easily collected and sold.
After a far-reaching survey of conditions and economy,
it was decided to have the hoilers at Delray stoker
fired.
The plant is similar in many respects to the Trenton
Channel plant. The turbines in both plants are of
50.000 Kilowatt capacity. The rotors are interchange-
able. This arrangement is very desirable as it obviates
the necessity of carrying a number of spare rotors in
reserve. One or two is sufficient for both plants.
Delray No. 3 has at present 100.000 Kilowatts of in-
stalled capacity. Provisions are made whereby an ad-
dition may be built on the end of the present building
and the plant capacity increased to 300,000 Kilowatts.
The boiler room steel work has been built in such a
way that pulverized fuel equipment may be installed
al a later date if developments in this field make this
change advisable.
When the waterways are navigable the coal for Del-
ray No. 3 is shipped from the West Virginia and Ken-
tucky fields to Toledo. Ohio, where it is loaded on coal
barges and shipped to Detroit. Experience at the
Marysville plant has proved the economy of this pro-
cedure.
When the coal arrives in Detroit it is unloaded by
self-unloading barges and taken to the breaker house in
cars. Here the cars are unloaded by enormous car
tippers into the unloading pit. An overhead traveling
car which is provided with a pneumatic hammer, and
which was previously used in the other power houses
has been made available also, giving an emergency
method of breaking up frozen coal. Coal is then car-
ried from the pit to breakers which handle more than
500 tons per hour. These reduce the larger lumps to
a size suitable for burning in the stoker. A cyclone
separator takes the dust-laden air from the breaker
room, and removes a large fraction of the suspended
material. From the breaker house a bridge runs to
the power house proper at an angle of 190" with the
horizontal. Belt conveyors transport the coal up this
incline for a distance of 450' to a hopper and thence
to distributing conveyors. These distribute the coal
uniformly to three 1.000 ton bunkers.
From the bunkers the coal is passed down a gravity
feed chute to the stoker hoppers. The stokers are of
the Tayl &gt;r type, built by the American Engineering
Company. They are without exception the largest
stokers in the world. They are composed of 15 re-
torts and are 57 tuyeres deep, giving a total grate sur-
face of 611 sq. ft. Coal can be burned at the rate of
34,000 lbs. per hour. This gives a combustion rate
of 55.6 lbs. of coal per s&lt;j. ft. of grate surface per
hour. This means that beat will be liberated at the
rate of 32,000 B.t.u. per cu. ft. furnace volume per
hour. A maximum load of 350,000 lbs. of water
are evaporated per hour, or 10.3 lbs. water per pound
of coal, averaging 13,300 B.t.u. per pound. The steam
leaves the superheater nozzle at 409 lbs. per sq. in.
gage and 700 F. total temperature. This represents
a total heat content of between thirteen and fourteen
hundred B.t.u.'s per pound.
The clinkers and ashes fall from the stoker onto
two large rolls—clinker grinders—which have projec-
tions on their periphery and rotate at a speed of from
1/9 to 3 revolutions per hour.
The draft equipment consists of two forced draft
fans for each boiler, producing a static pressure of
12.5 inches of water and delivering 65,000 cubic feet
of air per minute each. These fans force the air
through n tube type air preheater which utilizes the
hot exhaust gases, to heat the air to about 350 F. This
system has the two-fold advantage of reducing the tem-
perature of the stack gases and increasing the temper-
ature of the incoming air. The loss due to raising the
air from the entering temperature to the stack temper-
ature is the largest single loss in power plant operation.
It is dependent on the difference in temperature at these
two points. There is also an induced draft fan for
each boiler, capable of handling 223,000 cubic feet of
gas per minute against a head of 13.9 inches of water.
The fans are located in the pipe gallery which is above
the boiler room. Air for combustion is taken from
openings through the floor, and is warm due to radia-
tion from the boiler and steam mains. This reduces
the radiation loss.
The stack gases are also drawn through an econo-
mizer of the counterflow type. The economizer re-
claims some of the heat in the stack gases by heating
the water fed to the boiler.
A large number of automatic dampers are installed
to maintain a uniform fuel bed. These are somewhat
of an experiment yet, but are expected to be highly
successful.
The boilers are of the four drum Stirling type—a de-
parture from the old practice of using the type W
boiler. The water is heated and steam generated in the
tubes which connect the drums. In addition to this
water heating surface there is another very important
steam generator, viz.. the water screen. This is a com-
paratively recent development in the field. The water
screen consists of numerous tubes which completely
surround the combustion chamber. The tubes are pro-
tected by a refractory block for about 1/3 the distance
from the fuel bed to the first bank of tubes. The re-
mainder of the length is unprotected. The water screen
rely on the radiant heat of the fuel bed for heating
the water. Besides absorbing an enormous amount of
heat for the surface exposed the water screen protects
the refractory lining of the furnace and permits very

To the Seniors
In this, the last number of the Technic for the
year, I feel that I cannot let the occasion pass with-
out wishing every possible success to those seniors
who are leaving us in June to go into the great
world outside.
It is almost inevitable at such times to dwell
upon those things in life that tend towards success,
and to offer all kinds of gratuitous advice, which
may or may not have much effect. Page upon page
has been written about the Engineer, his training,
his methods, his personality and what not; so that
even a resume of these would take more space than
a very efficient editor would allow me.
In the past few years my contacts with the vari-
ous industries, particularly through their represen-
tatives who come to look over our students as
possible material for their organizations, have im-
pressed upon me one or two very significant facts
which show the modern trend of thought underly-
ing their selection of men.
Some of you have doubtless sensed these ideas
in your talks with these men, but in any case, it
may be helpful to pass on to you certain things
that have seemed to me to be significant.
While investigation and analysis have shown that
high scholastic standing in University work is a
dominant factor in predicting the future success of
a man in after life, this fact taken alone without
consideration of what underlies it is apt to lead one
astray. In almost all cases it simply shows that
a man has a good, alert mind, has taken his work
more or less seriously, and consequently has made
a success in the first stages of his career. Industry
is, therefore, on the lookout for just such promising
material with the hope that a start well made will
mean a greater chance in the latter part of the race.
But this is not all. In any walk of life, today,
particularly in our modern type of civilization, it
is almost an absolute necessity that an individual
become part of a group. The success of the group,
as represented, say by a particular industry or or-
ganization, depends upon the hearty cooperation
of all members composing the group, and each and
all cultivating a loyalty to the institution as a
whole. While I think that no one would advocate
a man sinking his entire individuality in that of the
organization, still I am affaid that those who ad-
vance the theory that nothing should be done in
the early stages of life to spoil a youth's individual-
ity, oftentimes lose sight of the practical facts of
life, and tend to turn out a produce that is least
fitted to our modern existence. Such a course in-
evitably leads to priggishness, selfishness, lack of
cooperation or thought for one's fellowmen, or in'
other words, to a self-centered individual who prob-
ably has to go through a sad experience in after
life before the errors of his former ways become
apparent.
Closely allied to the above is that almost unde-
finable thing called Character. In most cases it is
preceded by some kind of an adjective, or often a
negative, in order to describe the possession or lack
of certain traits. Nevertheless, we all have an in-
stinctive feeling for what character means, and by
close observation and interest in those whom we
know to represent this quality in its highest sense,
we may learn much that will be of benefit to us
permanently.
I would, therefore, leave these two thoughts with

A {great man, a great friend
and a great teacher
• t •
The passing of Associate Dean George W. Pat-
terson is a great loss to the College of Engineering
and to the University. Fie was a rare man, a splen-
did teacher, especially happy in his contact with
students. He possessed superlatively that combi-
nation of qualities which mark the real gentleman.
His gentle heart made him sympathetically pa-
tient with student irregularities, with which his
duties as dean compelled him to deal. He was a
Father Confessor. The student left him with a
heart buoyed up, and a renewed determination.
Not the least of his services to the College and
to the University was his attention to social respon-
sibilities. Not a function was missed at which his
presence seemed to him necessary. His charm of
manner made him the perfect guest and the perfect
host.
He was a happy speaker at banquets where alum-
ni sometimes take liberties. As a member of the
Athletic Board, he attended an Engineers' Banquet
in Chicago to speak on football. While explain-
ing the disadvantage to Michigan because of Stand-
ard Time, which made the men late on the field
for practice, some beloved old graduate spoke up
and said, "Say, Professor, is this a talk on foot-
ball or astronomy?" Everybody shouted, Patterson
grinned, and kept right on.
Our offices adjoining, I was thrown into daily
contact with him through the years of his dean-
ship. It was a splendid intimacy, coming at the
end of a rare friendship extending over nearly forty
years.
His duty made clear to him, it was performed
forthwith. To illustrate:—late one evening a tele-
phone message came from the Clerk of the Court
in Grand Rapids, requesting someone from the
University to advise the Court in an electrical mat-
ter. I called Professor Patterson, who had gone
to bed, and told him what was wanted. He caught
the one o'clock train that night, reported at Court
in the morning, discharged his duty, and was back
at his desk in the afternoon.
And so the story could go on with any number
of incidents revealing the beautiful character of
George Patterson. I shall miss him greatly. He
was a dear friend.

After an intimate acquaintance with George Pat-
terson, both as a colleague on the faculty and as
my associate in the administration of the College
of Engineering, I can truly say that I always con-
sidered him one of the outstanding men, not only
in this College, but in the University. Besides being
a man of marked ability as a scientist, his knowl-
edge extended over other and wider fields of learn-
ing, which added considerably to his influence and
effectiveness with the students. His lovable nature
and fine character endeared him to all who were
privileged to know him. We all mourn his loss,
but he will ever remain to us as an example of the
finest type of an American gentleman.

Vernon Praschen, and Jim Candler. These men
have been the backbone of the present organization.
The inertia that the group has acquired during the
past year should be enough to give it an excellent
start as a permanent organization since a great deal
of interest has been shown in the idea, both by stu- dents and by out-
side interests.
Professor Robert

astounding revelations made by the future novices
of the debating society.
Four years ago Professor F. N. Menefee, of the
engineering mechanics department, along with an
interested group of fellows, organized the original
debating society. The life of the organization was
at low ebb most of the following years due to an
insufficient lack of student interest. Last year,
however, the society was rejuvenated by a group
of engineering students including Ed Nell, Haig
Iskiyan, Ray Schmidgall, Kenneth Koon. Russell

tion. It has pledged to, "develop an engineering
platform among the engineering colleges of the
United States, not only to develop speakers but to
keep engineering subjects before the general pub-
lic." The purpose has not been forgotten and dur-

Edward R. Nell
Some individuals are liked for their
friendliness, their honesty and integrity,
some for their intelligence and achieve-
ment, while others are admired for what
is called sheer personality.
It is not often that a combination of all
of these desirable qualities is found in the
same person but it is our sincere belief
that in Edward R. Xcll there arc incorporated these, and other,
attributes which make him one of the best liked and most out-
standing men among the engineering undergraduates at the Uni-
versity of Michigan. Ambition and vivacity mark him as a man
who should succeed in the every day world as he is a person of
ideas and enthusiasm.
Ed began to publicly display his abilities when he was Alumni
Editor of the Michigan Technic and it can be safely said that
he was the best we've had, for, through his efforts, he created
the largest alumni subscription that the Technic has ever enjoyed.
The following year we find Ed as Managing Editor of the maga-
zine; here he introduced several new and constructive policies,
notably the colored cover design and a new type of set up. Ed's
efforts also produced the Michigan Engineer's Song Book.
The Engineering Exposition, of a few years back, was a brain
child of his, but the idea was just a little too big to be handled
by the students and, hence, the plan wasn't approved by the
faculty. The Engineering Debating Society has been graced with
Ed's membership for some time and he has proved himself excep-
tionally versatile in presenting his ideas; some of his defeated
opponents will reluctantly vouch for that. This year he graduated
into Sigma Rho Tan, the royal order of the stump, where he
is now one of the big moguls; he was also one of the group
which helped organize the society last year.

Our official observer at the engineering bench re-

been worked out by the engineering students and

Famous Architects in History. VII
Charles Follen McKim, 1H47-1909
IN ACCORDANCE with that "Law of Associa-
tion," of which psychologists are forever re-
minding us, we are unable to mention the sub-
ject of architecture in America without bringing to
the mind a distinct, vivid picture of that great
architect, the late Charles Follen McKim. His
name is affixed to the history of his art in bold,
permanent letters —
indelible to the attack
of succeeding ages as
was Phidias in sculp-
ture and Rembrandt
in portrait painting.
McKim dominated
the field of architec-
ture in America for a
period of forty years.
The use of a style of
design as well estab-
lished as was Italian
Renaissance and as
well supported as it
was by McKim, was
destined to succeed,
and succeed it did,
for the art world was
in the midst of a great
movement of classical
revival and was dis-
posed to encourage and not to resist. It would be
in no wise embarrassing to borrow that epitaph
in St. Paul's Cathedral, at London, inscribed to
Wren, its architect, "If you seek his monument,
look about you," and dedicate it to McKim in his
Boston Public Library or his Columbia University
Library. It is here we find the real McKim, the
McKim that rivals Wren, the McKim with the
conservative, beautiful and indominable personality.
THE LIBRARY OF THE COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY
AT NEW YORK, McKIM, MEAD &amp; WHITE, ARCHI-
TECTS. THE ERECTION OF THIS BUILDING
MARKED ONE OF McKIM'S GREATEST SUCCESSES.
Despite that he lived at the time when his coun-
try was being torn asunder by the conflicting forces
of the Civil War, McKim did not possess any of
those warlike, unduly patriotic traits that would in
the least connect his memory with that of those
bitter and tragic years. He was born in Isabella
Furnace, Pennsylvania, in 1847. He inherited, in
generous measure, the
admirable character-
istics of his parents,
who were reputed
throughout the section
as honest, progressive,
moral-conscious folk.
McKim's severity in
taste and in judgment
has been attributed to
the fact that his fa-
ther was a leading
abolitionist and poli-
tical reformer and his
mother a strict, ortho-
dox Quaker. H i s
parentage is also ac-
countable for his in-
tense determination
and will-power, both
in personal and busi-
ness affairs.
McKim's childhood was uneventful and little of
importance can be attached to it. From letters writ-
ten later in his life we are able to conclude that his
home was of decidedly moderate means and simple
in every respect. His mother, a woman of attractive
appearance and personality, had gathered about her
a circle of friends of like nature, people of learning
and culture. His father, by his position, had also a

The Artist and His Subject
By JEAN PAUL SLUSSER
ONE of the most common sources of misun-
derstanding between the artist and the public
has to do with the matter of subject. The
layman is forever making the mistake of seeing no
further into a picture than its subject, and of liking
it or disliking it as a work of art according as he
enjoys or is indifferent to the thing it depicts. Thus,
nearly everyone is instinctively attracted by the
representation of a pretty woman, or of a boat
under full sail, or of a wood interior. Yet there are
good and bad renderings of these facilely appealing
subjects, and much
of the world's best
art is concerned
with material much
less obviously pre-
possessing.
The layman's er-
ror consists in tak-
ing it for granted
that things already
beautiful in them-
selves—things such
as flowers, young
animals, the nude
human figure, etc.
—or things already
completed as art
works, such as
parks, cathedrals,
fountains, statues,
etc., must of neces-
sity be the best
subjects for art.
True, some of the objects in the first category have
been greatly used in art, but when successfully,
they have been used under circumstances and for
reasons other than the layman supposes. For the
layman, art is all too easily a matter of the subject
and its ability to satisfy the desires of ordinary
living. For the artist, art is an affair of the rela-
tionships between the mass, line and forms of
things as he is able to see and express them in
terms of color. The artist has his preferences in
the matter of subject—by all means—but his pref-
VILLAGE STREET—BY THE AUTHOR.

FASHIONED MIDDLE WESTERN HOUSES OFFER THE

TRICATE WASHES AND REPAY HIM FREQUENTLY,
TOO, WITH BEAUTIFUL COLOR AND TEXTURE.
erences are based usually upon considerations of
form rather than upon those of sentiment or of
biological instinct. Thus a heavy woman is quite
likely to offer the artist more form-possibilities
than a slim one, a seamed and furrowed face more
opportunities for plastic handling than a smooth
one, the soiled and baggy clothes of working-people
more matter for treatment in art than the smooth
and formal garments of the well-to-do.
It is the artist's task not so much to copy things
in themselves finished and beautiful as to discover
beauty where none
was obvious before,
and to confer
beauty by finding
harmonious rela-
tionships between
the various parts
of his subject. No
real artist is inter-
ested in playing
merely the part of
protographer or of
copyist to his ma-
terial. It is the
creative act, the
process of relating,
harmonizing, a n d
organizing that
really concerns
him. He is happy
before a table cov-
ered with a variety
of objects, or a hel-
ter-skelter backyard, or a face full of tell-tale lines,
because the situation demands something from him.
It is his perception of the relationships possible
among the forms before him that brings order out
of chaos and confers beauty where none had existed
before. In all this he is not deceived by the con-
ventional values of ordinary living—he sees the
world with wide-open eyes as form and color, and
moving in his own vivid and colored universe,
chooses without embarrassment, as a child might.

the objects that interest him, regardless of their
rating with other people.
Cezanne gave the clue to much in the artist's
procedure with his famous remark that all the
forms in nature can be reduced to certain simple
geometric shapes, as the sphere, the cylinder and
the cone. He saw that, formally speaking, a napkin
dropped upon a table can have the same magnifi-
cence, because built upon the same underling
shape, as Mont Blanc. Many of his still-lives have
the heroic qualities we associate with great archi-
tecture. An apple by Cezanne, as one modern critic
puts it, may be more important than a madonna
painted by many another artist. There are, to be
sure, other values in art besides the purely formal
ones, but it is these formal ones that the workman
in the artist, like the workman in the architect, is,
during the process of creation, most tangibly con-
cerned with.
In this matter of subject the young student of
art is often at something of a loss. His head is
usually full of prejudices and false ideas which he
has picked up from those around him, and he
does not begin to be himself in his work until he
has taken stock of all these preconceptions and
finally established a set of values that apply fully
for himself. One superstition that used to be more
common than it now is in this country was that
one could only find material fit for painting by
going to New York or Paris or Italy. Now there
are excellent reasons for going to all of these places,
but this particular reason is not one of them. The
little houses on the Cote d'Azur may have more
exotic connotations for our young artist than the
frame cottages in his native town, but when' he
comes actually to paint them he will find that they
are based upon the selfsame forms as the houses
on Main Street, and very likely are less interesting
in detail than the latter. Trees are trees and hills
are hills wherever one goes. Quite as paintable
people inhabit Kansas as Tuscany, though it re-
quires sharper eyes to see it. But the glory of the
innovator attaches to the artist who discovers the
interest and beauty of the native scene. So many
people have sketched in Venice that one should
almost apologize for doing so again, but the artist
who finds and paints the beauty of Kansas City or
Chicago is a Lindbergh among his kind—or would
have been a few years ago. Men like Robert Henri,
George Bellows and John Sloan have done much
to make us realize the possibilities of the unvar-
nished American scene. Yet even here a program
based upon literary preconceptions may be a wrong
one. The true artist knows that the only world
that he is concerned with is the world of form atid
color, and early and late makes his choice of the

"New Dimensions"
By Paul T. Frankl
Pay son &amp; Clarke, Ltd., Publishers
Review by Floride Sandburg, '30A
Nearly everyone, in this country at least, is con-
scious of our so-called Modern Art. It is being
thrust upon us in every kind of decoration. Many
of us are curious to know its significance and just
what our artists are endeavoring to accomplish with
it.
"New Dimensions," a book on modern art, prin-
cipally interior decoration, by Paul T. Frankl of
New York City, gives an interesting account of
the why and the wherefore of this movement. Mr.
Frankl has accomplished a great deal in this field
and is worthy of recognition. He presents the com-
mon argument that since the art of each age has
been the expression of that age, then why should
we, in our advanced mechanical age, be content
with the art of ages past, which is not expression
of our own. He claims that ours is a complex age
but that human nature cannot keep pace with mod-
ern invention. And while complexity is a charac-
teristic of our mechanical lives, it is the opposite
of this that we seek for in aesthetic enjoyment.
The opposite of complexity is simplicity.
Simple lines are modern. They are restful to the
eye and dignified. They tend to cover up the com-
plexity of the machine age. If they do not com-
pletely do this, they at least divert our attention
and allow us to feel ourselves master of the ma-
chine.
Mr. Frankl next gives in detail an interesting
discourse upon good procedure in interior decora-
tion. Many fine points are brought out which I
am sure would be most beneficial to anyone doing
this kind of work.
In all interior decoration Mr. Frankl advocates
"restraint for the backgrounds, courage and daring
for the movable fixtures." He deals quite thor-
oughly with modern furniture design, lighting, and
fabrics. A chapter is given to an interesting dis-
cussion of the relationships between the modern
artist and the modern business man. Artists are no
longer Bohemian dreamers who live apart from the
world. They are a part of the life of today and a
very vital part.
Another chapter deals with American City Archi-
tecture. To quote Mr. Frankl: "Lack of space has

ELECTRICITY long has been, still is, and
lung will be the most interesting branch of
engineering. Development of this universal
power is easily and clearly marked from the time
of the earlier experimenters, through the steps in
the development of the source of power, the inven-
tion and development of
the electric light, the ad-
vent of the telegraph and
telephone, and the final
means of communication,
Radio. To trace all the
developments of the sub-
ject would fill many, many
columns; but such a course
is obviously unnecessary,
for the reader has but to
look about him, at his all
electric radio, his tele-
phone, his study lamp, and
his handy cigar lighter, to
realize the vast difference
in conditions as pictured a
short hundred years ago.
Electricity has always
been a large and important
part of the physics curric-
ulum of the University of
Michigan, and it is here
that the embryo electrical engineer receives his first
glimpse of the mysteries of current, resistance, and
E.M.F. After the completion of West Engineering
Building, the facilities for advanced study of elec-
tricity were so much better that the popularity of
the electrical engineering course grew rapidly, until
today the number of those to graduate with the
Adolphus Mansfield Dudley
degree of Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engi-
neering has far exceeded all but one or two of the
other engineering groups. Michigan has turned out
numbers of good electrical engineers, a number of
outstanding men, and several who are unquestioned
as authorities upon the subject in which they re-
ceived early training at
Ann Arbor. One in par-
ticular, who has made elec-
tricity and its problems a
life work successfully, is
A. Mansfield Dudley, En-
gineering Supervisor of
Development for the West-
inghouse Electric and
Manufacturing Company.
Mr. Dudley was born in
Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1877.
He completed his primary
schooling here, and then
trailed north to find out if
Joe Parker's was all that
the song said it was. It
was, so Mr. Dudley en-
tered the University in
1898 to graduate four years
later with a degree of
Bachelor of Science in
Electrical Engineering, and
an enviable record of class grades behind him. Tau
Beta Pi was not known on the campus at that time,
but the Fraternity honored Mr. Dudley by making
him a member of Gamma chapter in 1917.
Directly after graduation he entered the employ
of the General Electric Company, to work on the

test floor of the Schenectady plant. His work here
was so well received that within a period of seven-
teen months Mr. Dudley was transferred to the
Erection Department of General Electric, stationed
at Chattanooga, and New Orleans.
In 1904, he severed connections with the General
Electric Company, and entered the services of the
VVestinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Com-
pany as an apprentice in the company's detail en-
gineering department. Shortly after, his work was
specialized in motor controller work for a year, and
then to alternating motor design.
So well did Mr. Dudley apply the principles and
practice of his college days, that it was not long
before he started to rise rapidly in the profession,
for, as early as 1906, he was made Commercial and
General Engineer in the Industrial and Power Sales
Department. A year later, further advancement
was made, and Mr. Dudley was placed in charge
of the alternating current motor section in the En-
gineering Department, and in this position Mr.
Dudley saw service for eleven years. Fate again
smiled upon him in 1918, when he was transferred
to another section where the responsibility of di-
recting the activities of the design and construction
of starting, lighting and general ignition equipment
was placed upon him.
His highly successful handling of this task soon
earned for him promotion in the title of Manager
of the Automotive Engineering Department.
Within a short four years, Mr. Dudley was pro-
moted to the office of assistant to Engineering
Supervisor of Development, and his work in this
capacity gained for him the position of Supervisor,
upon the retirement of Mr. Hellmund, in 1926.
Dr. Dudley has found time to do enough research
and experiments of his own, to take out a number
of patents on details of the construction of induc-
tion motors, all of which are now in use. He per-
sonally supervised and built the electric motors
installed upon the U.S.S. Tennessee, the first battle
cruiser to be so equipped. Besides his other notable
accomplishments, Mr. Dudley is well known for his
publications Connecting Induction Motors, pub-
lished in 1920, and his Induction Motor Practice,
published in 1928. Both are the products of the
McGraw-Hill Book Company, Publishers, and both
are universally accepted as the last word of author-
ity in text books.
This alumnus is well known, and has enjoyed a
wide experience and popularity as a speaker before
national and local branches of engineering societies.
These range from the Commencement address de-
livered at Rose Polytechnic Institute, to addresses
given all over the United States. Other literary
accomplishments include his numerous articles
upon technical subjects, published in the leading
technical magazines, among which may be found
articles upon electrical subjects published in the
Michigan Technic, Induction Motor Characteristics,
printed in 1908, and "The Work of Designing
Engineers," printed in 1907. Perhaps his outstand-
ing writing is that article in the Encyclopedia Bri-
tannica, fourteenth edition, entitled "Electric Motors."
Mr. Dudley is a fellow of the American Institute
of Electrical Engineers, and is a past chairman of
the Pittsburgh Section of that organization. He is
quite devoted to the outdoors, and is a member of
the Sylvan Canoe Club, of Verona, Pennsylvania,
using this means of recreation when he is not play-
ing baseball for the local team, or working in his
garden, or playing tennis.
The University has reason to be proud of her
Civils. her Marines, her Mechanicals, her Aeros,
and the other groups who go out from their Alma
Mater to carry on the glory of the name of Michi-
gan. She has reason to be most proud of that body
of men who are doing great work in the electrical
field, and who are perhaps more famous in the tech-
nical world than men from competing Universities.
Michigan will continue to point the way and help
her students and alumni, that she may continue to
shine as the Alma Mater of such an engineer as

DYNAMITE CLEARS THE
WAY FOR MODERN
ENGINEERING WONDERS
the Waterville Development
• • • more hydro-electric power
for the South
How dynamite was used in
the construction of this
great project
THE Carolina Power and
Light Company needed
more electric power to serve the
territory in which it operates.
The result was the Waterville
Development... a vast hydro-
electric project located in the
Great Smoky Mountains.
The actual working of this
project involved the erection of
a constant arch dam, 183 feet
high; three tunnels varying in
length from 5,000 to 16,000
feet; three penstock tunnels
600 feet in length; a vertical
shaft known as a gap shaft,
and a surge tank shaft.
From the Waterville Develop-
ment, transmission lines carry
the current to many points in
Carolina and Tennessee. The
tremendous power of the Great
Smokies turns the wheels of in-
dustry and lights the homes of
thousands of people of the South.
Such a development would
not have been possible without
the use of dynamite. Du Pont
explosives were used for all blast-
ing operations.
The engineer of tomorrow
needs to know all there is to
know about dynamite . . . the
tool that helps to build skyscrap-
ers, bridges, dams, subways,
tunnels, roads and railroads.
How can you know more . . .
now . . . while you're still in
college? Write the du Pont
Company for a copy of the
"Blasters' Handbook." This
booklet contains a wealth of in-
formation about explosives . . .

pressed buildings upward. Lack of time makes us
hurry past. The architect depends on large masses,
three dimensional forms, to gain the admiration of
the general public, not meaningless carved detail
which few have time to appreciate."
In former ages decorations were made by hand.
It was foolish to imitate by hand the work of an-
other. The hand was not content to copy. The
machine is quite content to do so, and as a result
millions now have, as imitations bearing no inti-
mate relation to their human understanding, things
that were once the very physiognomy of the hearts
and minds of former peoples. Elimination of super-
ficial decoration characterizes twentieth century art.
"New forms are being created and old ones de-
stroyed. The whole process is still in a formative
stage and for the moment only the main lines of our
new architectural world are evident.
"The best designers will be influenced, of course,
by past styles, but their interpretations will be in-
dividual and new. Creative art is alive. Art to be
alive must avoid copying. It must be an expres-
sion of an artist's personality and that personality
must be consistent with its age."
In conclusion Mr. Frankl says: "What is mod-
ern? To be modern is to be consistent, it is to
bring out an artistic harmony in our lives and
necessary environments. A harmony between our
civilization and our individual art impulses."

suggested the pursuit of the profession. However,
after a short trial in the office, he became convinced

High Temperature Control
(Continued from page 8)
perature it was obvious that other vapors should be
sought which might be used for the higher tempera-
tures. Such a vapor had to give a temperature of
about 750° F. at 100 or 200 lbs./sq. in. pressure, and
in addition had to be fluid, stable, and cheap. These
requirements were very hard to meet for a long
time and it is only very recently that such a vapor
has been found.
One of the first fluids to occur to one's mind
would no doubt be mercury. This is liquid at ord-
inary temperatures, is very fluid, boils at about
671° F. at atmosgheric pressure, and is very stable
in the absence of air. However, experience with it
in power cycles has shown that the vapor is very
poisonous and difficult to hold in an apparatus, and
is limited in supply and expensive. There appears
to be little use in considering it as a possibility
except under very particular conditions.
Organic fluids of high molecular weight appear
to offer the most advantages at the present time.
There are innumerable substances of this class, of
course, but the choice is narrowed down to about
three that have most of the properties necessary.
Diphenyl, diphenyl oxide and naphthalene seem to
meet most of the requirements fairly well. The
boiling points of all three are such that a tempera-
ture of about 700° F. may be obtained with a pres-
sure of 100 lbs. per sq. in. Apparently diphenyl is
the most stable of the three up to 800:' F. and tests
made at this temperature for several months
showed practically no decomposition. Diphenyl
oxide has the doubtful advantage of a low melting
point, but is probably not as stable as diphenyl.
Naphthalene tends to sublime rather badly in addi-
tion to being rather unstable.
At the present it appears that diphenyl has all
the requirements and very few, if any, disadvan-
tages. It is fluid, high-boiling, stable, has a fairly
high latent heat, and is relatively cheap and abun-
dant. The only possible disadvantage is the fact
that it melts at 159' F. and must be kept above
this temperature at all times in order to prevent
solidification. This is not very difficult to do, how-
ever, and the possible inconvenience is offset by the
fact that a centrifugal pump may be used to pump
it at high pressures. This is accomplished by using
a water cooled stuffing gland on the pump, which
freezes the diphenyl in the packing, and prevents
leaks.
A rather complete compilation of all properties
of diphenyl has been made by the Federal Phos-
phorus Company of Aniston, Alabama, who manu-
facture this product in commercial quantities by
the decomposition of hot benzene vapors. There

Charles F. McKim
(Continued from page 28)
For three years he studied in the Ecole des Beaux
serving the great historic monuments of the past
Arts at Paris, constantly traveling about and ob-
ages. Here he received the influence of Renaissance
architecture with which he later associated himself
so definitely. Returning to America in 1870, he
entered the employ of Henry H. Richardson, at
that time the leading American architect and advo-
cate of the Romanesque style. A man as strongly
imaginative and artistic as Richardson was the
ideal guide for the young McKim. He, himself, was
a diplome of the ficole and was quick to discern the
inherent genius of his pupil and used every effort
to provide opportunity and encouragement. It is
interesting to note that McKim worked on the win-
ning design for the Boston Trinity Church, Rich-
ardson's greatest bid to fame.
McKim opened a little office of his own shortly
after and for a time worked alone. Later, he asso-
ciated himself with William R. Mead, a young archi-
tect of great ability and future promise. In 1879, a
new partner was added to the firm in the person of
Stanford White and thus was born that well-known
combination — that great triumvirate — McKim,
Mead, and White. These three men worked in very
close harmony, at all times keeping in mind the high
standard of their calling.
Following the Civil War, the economic depression
of this country was similar to that of Europe at the
time of the Renaissance. McKim was the first to
recognize this fact and immediately bent his efforts
toward a remedy. On all sides was architectural
chaos. He visioned the reawakening of a great
people, the rebuilding of cities, rich and beautiful,
a civilization of law and order. Adopting the style
of Rome, Florence and Tuscany, he fashioned it to
the needs of America. He was roundly criticized
for this choice, being called archaeologist and copy-
ist, having transplanted from their native environ-
ment many, century-old, European buildings. To-
day, that criticism would be infinitely more bitter,
for architects have assumed a closed-minded anti-
pathy for the ancient styles. But few have really
investigated the work of McKim to thoroughly ap-
preciate the true, creative element in his work.
The Boston Public Library is one of the many
buildings embodying all the qualities of McKim.
Each detail has been minutely studied, each unit
carefully analyzed both in its relation to the mass

Cupolas controlled from the laboratory
White hot rivers of metal, pouring from big cupolas in
Crane foundries, are even more thoroughly analyzed,
more carefully watched, than the drinking water pouring
from a faucet in a well-ordered city.
Because correct chemical ingredients in valve metals are
as essential to absolute safety and right functioning of a pip-
ing installation as pure water to human health, Crane Co.
maintains laboratory control of cupolas.
This means that experts in the metallurgical and physical
testing of metals are responsible for the quality of every
valve and fitting turned out. It means that tensile strength,
yield point, elongation, and reduction of area of test bars
taken every hour of the day's run are known to labora-
tory and cupola chemists. It means that constantly, as the
metals pour out, the proportion of silicon, manganese,
carbon, phosphorus, calcium, pure iron, are known and
uniformly maintained. It means immediate correction of
any variation and rejection of faulty materials.
From specifications of raw materials to final installation,
Crane Co. knows its products and what they will do.
How Crane Co. developed the background for this
knowledge makes an absorbing story. It is titled Pioneer-
ing in Science. You are cordially invited to send for your
copy. Aside from its interest, you will find it a splendid
reference book on the reactions of metals to high temper-
atures and pressures.

BULK MATERIAL
Penny-saving is the order of the day in modern
industry. Manufacturers are cutting their costs
—cutting them from the very beginning—and
the savings come on down to the consumer.
Much of the saving is in the handling of bulk
material. Right at the mine, the cost of iron
and steel is reduced by mechanical handling of
the iron ore. Loading and unloading of cars and
even boats is now done by machinery instead of
A Rex Pivoted Bucket Carrier for handling coal
A Rex V-Bitcket Conveyor
A Rex Belt Conveyor for handling rock
A Rex Scrappr Conveyor
by slow and costly human labor. A fraction of a
cent a ton saved in the cost of handling the coal
burned in the factory may mean thousands of
dollars by the end of the year—and a radical
difference in the price which the consumer pays
for the finished product or for light and heat.
Rex Bulk Handling Equipment is doing its
share in reducing costs. In every part of the
country, in mine, mill and factory, Rex Equip-
ment is at work, handling cement, stone, sand,
phosphate rock, coal, ore, and other materials
more quickly, more cheaply.

is no limit to the availability of diphenyl. and the
price is rather reasonable.
Of course, before deciding that diphenyl was a
good vapor to use in high temperature control it
was necessary to find out what heat transfer co-
efficients could be obtained in practice, in order to
know whether the method would pay. Experiments
were carried out in the Chemical Engineering lab-
oratories of this University under the direction of
Prof. W. L. Badger, and sponsored by the Swenson
Evaporator Company of Harvey, 111. The experi-
mental apparatus and the results obtained are too
complicated to permit discussion at this time, but
the results may be summarized by stating that
the coefficient varied from 200 to 500 depending on
the temperature of the vapor and the temperature
difference between vapor and wall. This coefficient
is noticeably lower than that obtainable with
steam, due largely to the difference in the thermal
conductivity of the twq liquids. However, the
value is still high enough to warrant the use of the
vapor in practice, since in very few cases does the
other film coefficient become much greater.
Some of the possible applications of the use of
diphenyl as a heating medium may be of interest at
this time. Some few applications are already in
commercial practice and others are still in the ex-
perimental stage.
In the field of evaporation there is a distinct
opening for such a method of heating. In the evap-
oration of such high-boiling solutions as caustic
soda and potash, present-day practice is to evapor-
ate with steam to about sixty or seventy percent.
The solution is then put into large cast iron con-
tainers called caustic pots which are heated by
direct fire. The solution is evaporated for about a
week until the desired concentration is reached,
which is usually almost one hundred percent. These
pots are very expensive and have a rather short life,
and in addition the fuel economy is low. The heat

transfer coefficient is extremely low since there is
no positive circulation of the hot gases, and values
as low as one or two are estimated. It has been
impossible to use nickel or monel in these pots
because of the large surface required, and a large
amount of impurity is formed by corrosion of the
cast iron.
Experiments were made on a semi-plant basis
using diphenyl as the heating medium and caustic
soda evaporated to almost 99% using a diphenyl
pressure of about 150 lbs./sq. in. The heat transfer
coefficient from the metal to the boiling liquor was
found to be so great that practically the entire tem-
perature difference was over the diphenyl vapor
film. This meant that the overall coefficient from
the vapor to the liquor was about the same as that
of the vapor to the wall, i.e. 200 to 500, as compared
with the value of about 2 obtained in the caustic
pots. This higlr coefficient permits the use of
nickel as a heating surface; very little corrosion
takes place, and the product is made much purer.
The time consumption required for evaporation is
very much less by this new method, and the fuel
economy can be made very much better, since there
is no reason why a diphenyl boiler cannot be design-
ed to be as efficient as the ordinary water boiler.
A great deal of trouble has been experienced in
distilling lubricating oils without decomposition,
and at the same time obtaining large yields. A very
slight overheating of some of the oil constituents
results in their decomposition and though these
decomposition products are not a very large frac-
tion of the oil they are very detrimental to its use
as a lubricant, since they tend to become sticky and
adhere to the part to be lubricated. No satisfactory
method has been found to completely remove these
materials after they are once formed, and it is ne-
cessary to prevent their formation as much as pos-
sible.
A large plant has been built at the Indian Re-
fining Company's plant at Lawrenceville, 111., using
diphenyl to actually evaporate the oil, which is at
the same time kept at a very low pressure (3mm.
absolute) in order to lower the boiling point of the
oil as much as possible. By this method overheat-
ing is prevented, and a larger yield of oil obtained
which is at the same time more viscous and stable.
In the polymerization of varnish oils the present
practice is to heat the oil in an ordinary container
over an open fire, mixing the materials periodically.
This results in overheating and decomposition with
the formation of fatty acids which tend to slow up
the reaction and to color the product. The use of
diphenyl for this case would undoubtedly result in
the production of a purer, more uniform product in
a very much shorter time, and with probably less
expense. An exhaustive study of this problem is
under way at the present time.
There are a great many other places where the
use of diphenyl vapor would aid, either in the pro-
duction of a purer product, or in increasing the
present rate of production. Many catalytic reactions
require close temperature control, with absence of
any overheating, and in many cases this is possible
at present only with electric heat. The distillation
and evaporation of materials that are very sensitive
to heat may be carried out in ordinary apparatus,
using this new but very promising method of high
temperature control.

that of the man whose animating motive is veneration
for authority is dramatically contrasted in their treat-
ment of the fallen woman. At the end of this book
Jean Valjean has learned to respect the rights of others,
and to expiate his own sins. He has begun his long
climb upward.
The second book, Cosette, which deals explicitly with
the ministration of Jean Valjean to the neglected child
whom chance has placed in his path, presents two non-
social ideas: the glorification of the individual em-
bodied in Napoleon—an idea doomed by Destiny to
defeat; and asceticism, the utter abnegation of self
expressed in monasticism, which, in its attempt to
achieve self sacrifice and in its contemplation of the
Infinite, has its contribution to make to the evolution
of Jean Valjean's social conscience. Monasticism is
unsocial, however, because it lacks contact with the
great aching problems of the world. It is outdated;
it is medieval, and no longer adequate to the needs of
modern life. In this book Jean Valjean has added to
his awakened sense of justice, the experience of pure
love which comes to him through his ministry to the
needy child. He rises one step higher, for he learns
to expiate the faults of others without bitterness or
complaint.
In the third book, Marius, one sees in titanic con-
flict the forces involved in the conquest of the new
social ideal, the struggle which is to bring a new
social order. Vagrancy, noxious poverty, conservatism
and prevolutionary prejudices on the one hand and
every sort of impracticable idealism, political and philo-
sophical, on the other. It is a book of magnificent
antitheses: Marius and his old prevolutionary grand-
father, representing the old ideals and the new; the
heroic, radiant spirits of the A.B.C., idealists, Friends
of Social Progress shining in dazzling contrast to the
Patron Minette, that black fraternity of the lowest
depths of social degradation, the utterly non-social
criminal class. No more frightful picture of the depths
of depravity and social night to which poverty may
degrade the human kind has ever been painted than

Hugo has given us in this book. It is his statement
of the third of the great problems,—the degradation of
man by poverty. Jean Valjean, with his new social
ideal of service, descends to minister to this class of
unfortunates. He meets brutal attack at their hands,
but through this experience he learns his third great
lesson, to minister without appreciation, to suffer in-
gratitude without bitterness.
The fourth book, St. Denis, shows the social ideal
in conflict with the established order, the attempt to
adjust the new social forces to the old non-social con-
ditions. In the masses it takes the form of stormy
revolution; in the individual it leads to an evolution, a
transformation of spirit, fiponine touched by the new
light becomes capable first of helpful service and finally
of heroic, sacrificial death. Jean Valjean, after a
struggle comparable only to the convulsions of society
around him, conquers his selfish passion for Cosette:
he renounces the thing he loves most and follows his
duty.
In the last book it is shown that the new social order
can never be realized by revolution. The Friends of
Progress sacrifice themselves for their vision of a mis-
taken ideal; the death of Enjalras represents the glori-
ous but inevitable defeat of the ideal at the hands of
the established order. But Jean Valjean saves the man
he hates, is again victorious over all lower instincts
that try to drag him down. Groping through the dark-

ness and reeking tilth of the sewers of Paris, carrying
his cross, doing his duty against his desires, he finds
the light. The shining beauty of his compassionate
spirit proves itself superior to even the logic and
Jovert's inexorable sense of authority. He rises from
one victory after another over his selfish desires till
he learns to efface himself utterly from the lives of
those people who owed him most of gratitude. At
the end, as Hugo says, "The convict had become
the Christ."
In this triumphant rise of Jean Yaljean one has
Hugo's idea of the solution of the problems of society,
the promise of the new order which can be realized in
the individual and through him be worked out into
society at large.

two holes drilled diametrically opposite each other.
Here the oil divides, half flowing at intervals out
each hole as each hole in the shaft passes the hole
in the outer sheath. The full significance of this
picture can only be realized after it is known that
the exposure of this film lasted for five seconds, and
that during this time 125 drops of oil occupied suc-
cessively the position indicated by each drop of oil
shown. The commutator or contact mechanism
which controlled the frequency of the stroboscopic
flashes was attached to the rotating shaft, and hence
was in perfect synchronism with the rate of expul-
sion of the oil drops. Accordingly, each successive
drop was at exactly the same relative position at the
instant of flash. It is interesting to note the sur-
prisingly close superposition of one drop on that of
the one preceding, as indicated by the comparatively
clear outline of the drops. Only at the extreme left
is it seen that air currents have an appreciable effect
on the drops, carrying them out of their paths
slightly and causing a blurred outline, but this is
not nearly so great as might be expected.
Here is a practical demonstration of the existance
of unsuspected eccentricities. It will be noticed that
the oil drops assume their position in pairs as they
pass from the orifice. At first the reason for this
might not be clear but an analysis of the path of the
respective tlrops shows that the upper drops were
expelled at a greater horizontal velocity than the
lower drops, as the two follow the curve of differ-
ent parabolas in their motion. The difference in the
horizontal velocity, or velocity of expulsion, was
unexplained until a check of the method of building
the device suggested causes. As stated above, the
holes were drilled into the shaft by starting in on
one side, passing through the hollow oil core and
emerging on the opposite side of the shaft. It is
easv to see that the drill might easily leave a burr
on the inner surface as it came through, and then
on the opposite side of the inner surface cut away
the metal smoothly around the hole or even tend to
round the corners slightly thereby offering less
frictional resistance to the oil in the second case
than in the first, and increasing the velocity of
approach. This accounts for the lower velocity of
expulsion of the oil drops following the path of the
lower parabola, thus allowing them a longer time
to drop for a given horizontal distance of travel.
This may seem relatively unimportant but it serves
to illustrate the possibilities offered by the strobo-
scope in determining even slight eccentricities of
operation.
In Figure 2 is shown the results obtained in the
observation of moving springs. Surprising results
are obtained by many types of pictures of this sort. It is
seen that these two pictures illustrate this very fact.
The photograph of spring (b) w-as a time exposure
taken by the red glow of the stroboscope while the
spring was undergoing a motion of about 1500
cycles per minute. The time of this exposure was
of such length as to allow the spring to complete
about 7,500 or 10,000 cycles. And yet, the average
observer would think it had been taken while at
rest.
The spring in Figure (a) may appear at first no
different than the other, but if observed very closely
it is seen that the spacings, say betwee nthe four
middle turns, are not equidistant. And here it is
that the stroboscope comes in and solves a real prob-
lem. Ordinarily the designer assumes the deflec-
tions between adjacent turns within the area men-
tioned as equal and calculates the stresses thereby.
This picture was taken while the spring was oper-
ating at about 1500 cycles per minute and shows
standing waves with the accompanying non-uniform
spacings. It becomes more necessary each day, for
economical designing, to work materials harder,
thereby occupying less space, etc.; and yet produc-
ing parts that will stand the gaff. When it happens
that parts fail, the designer wants to know why.
The stroboscope enlightens him as to obtaining con-
ditions, and the problem is solved.
Laurent and Austin Sequin of France have in-
vented a comparatively powerful stroboscope
which they call the "Stroborama," which by 1927
had been adopted by six or seven automotive manu-
facturers in France, besides the artillery and avia-
tion department of the French Government. Since
it employed a method which made it possible to
produce flashes by interrupting the smaller current
Mowing for the neon tube excitation only, instead
of the heavier current supplied to the entire bank
of neon tubes during actual flash periods, it was
possible to increase the intensity of light emitted
almost indefinitely. This supply of brilliant light

makes it possible even to overcome other lighting
effects, both artificial and daylight, hence a clear
definition can be effected without dimming the
lights in the room. This has the advantage of
spreading a blanket of light over a machine of
almost any size facilitating inspection of the whole
machine.
There is considerable disagreement between au-
thorities as to the lowest range of frequency at
which the eye can retain vision long enough to
maintain satisfactory definition. Some maintain
that 300 flashes per minute is the lowest allowable,
but this may depend in part on the individual.
However, at low frequencies it is advantageous to
wear red glasses thereby filtering out much of the
undesirable daylight and letting through largely,
only the red light from the neon tube. The low
frequency is especially tiring to the eyes but red
glasses decrease the ill effect. Still another method
is to play a trick on the muscles of the eyes by
darkening the room except for the stroboscope,
thus eliminating largely such rapid focussing as is
necessary at low frequencies. The eye, without
stimulation during the dark period, thus tends to
retain its focussed position without the excessive
tiring effect.
Figure 3 shows the diagram of the circuit used
by the "Stroborama." The rotary contact marked
I may be controlled either by a motor as shown

study, thereby producing perfect synchronism even
under erratic speed conditions or during periods of
acceleration. This rotary contact produces a dis-
charge of a low capacity condenser connected across
the terminals of the direct current generator G,
through the winding of a high-frequency transform-
er which raises the tension to that necessary for the
passage of the current in the rarefied gas of the neon
tube T. This discharge, by reason of the low ca-
pacity of the condenser very incompletely illumin-
ates the tubes and only serves to '"prime" them for
the passage of current from the heavier power sup-
ply. This source of supply is derived from a large
battery of condensers C which is constantly main-
tained in a state of charge. For this, alternating cur-
rent is raised to the voltage required for illuminat-
ing the neon tube, by a transformer L and changed
to direct current by means of a rectifier tube R.
To discharge through the neon tube T, the current
must jump- the air gap A, adjusted so that the
resistance of the gap added to the resistance of the
neon tube does not permit the condenser to dis-
charge without first priming the tube. When the
priming current passes through the neon tube, it
reduces the resistance of the system, and the con-
denser discharges across the gap and through the
tube, producing an intense light flash of short dura-
tion. The time of illumination is so short that even
parts of mechanism moving at a linear speed or
peripherial speed of 350 ft. per second appear with
sharp and distinct contours, and without distortion
of form or size.
There are also other connections for operation
which are not required to produce such a large sup-
ply of light. One handy and effective arrangement
for obtaining a potential high enough to light the
tube, employs a modification of the ignition system
used on motor cars. This set of apparatus, which is
comparatively inexpensive, consists of one % h.p.
variable speed motor (preferably D.C. if a D.C. sup-
ply is at hand) with control apparatus; one l/\ h.p.
alternating current constant speed motor; one igni-
tion distributor; one ignition coil; one magnetic
tachometer; one D.C. voltmeter for reading the
tachometer voltage which is proportional to the
speed; one 6-volt storage battery; the neon tube
which may be mounted in a portable lantern or in
an automobile headlight; a bedplate on which to
mount the motors, the magnetic tachometer, and
the distributor all coupled together on a common
shaft; a convenient length of rubber sheathed well
insulated extension cord; and necessary connections
and switches. The entire apparatus can be mounted
on a small rubber tired carriage and rolled to any
point desired. The wiring should be such that there
is no possibility of switching both motors on at the
same time. The constant speed motor is of value
in tests of 60 cycle equipment, while the variable
speed motor makes possible a wide range of flash
frequencies. By means of the magnetic tachometer
and the voltmeter it is possible at all times to know
the frequency of the flashes. If desired, the volt-
meter may be calibrated directly in flash frequency.
A word of caution is given to those who may
wish to employ the stroboscope for the determina-
tion of speeds. First: although this instrument
affords a very accurate means of comparing the un-
known speed with the frequency of flashes of the

stroboscope, the measurement is no more accurate
than the accuracy of the flashing device itself. In
case the flashes are produced for instance, by the
sixty cycle supply from a central station, it is com-
paratively certain that the flash frequency will he
constant and 120 flashes per second. A special
transformer has been developed for this purpose,
having- a high rate of core saturation, thus producing
sharp voltage peaks in the secondary, and supplied
with a condenser across the secondary terminals,
causing sudden discharge when the voltage has
been built up sufficiently to break down the tube
resistance.
In case the speed determination is made with a
synchronizing device of variable speed, the accur-
acy of calibration of the meter and magnetic tacho-
meter is the limiting factor. This is usually as
accurate as the ordinary job requires, however.
Second: The operator must guard against jump-
ing at conclusions as to the speed of the observed
machine, and be sure that he doesn't have a flash
frequency equal to one of the harmonics of the
synchronous frequency instead of the true R.P.M.
of the machine. The effect of arrested motion is
produced to a certain extent by any flash frequency
which when multiplied or divided by a simple whole
number will give a result numerically equal to the

America's roads—a network of highways that knits the
country from the Atlantic to the Pacific and from Canada
to the Gulf of Mexico—you are indirectly utilizing another
of explosives' many contributions to our civilization.
For dynamite makes the modern highway possible. Stone,
cement, asphalt, and other road-building materials —all
are first wrested from the earth by explosives. Explosives
also blast trails over mountains, drain encroaching waters,
aid in the construction of bridge abutments, and in other
ways afford easier access to cities and towns.
Not only in road building, but in many industries—on land
and sea and underground—explosives are helping us
enjoy a richer, fuller civilization.
In these achievements, Hercules explosives have played,

served. Good judgment, in the light of the known
approximate speed, must be exercised as the de-
ciding factor in this case but the following facts
show that with a reasonable amount of care the
results obtained can be easily analyzed. For flash
frequencies below the actual frequency of the
machine arrested motion will appear at frequencies
which are simple fractions of the true frequency:
rising as follows, 1/5, 34. 1/3, and ]/2 of the true
frequency. These can be easily distinguished from
the true or synchronous frequency flash, because
the brilliancy of illumination of the object is only
1/5, J4, 1/3, and l/2 as great, respectively, as that
which obtains for synchronous frequency. For fre-
quencies which are 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. times the syn-
chronous frequency the brilliance of illumination
does not increase. Above this point however, the
observed object may be seen at two or more points
around the periphery of the wheel. For twice the
frequency the points appear diametrically opposite.
For flashes three and four, etc. times, synchronous
frequency the points appear at 1/3 intervals, and
Y\ intervals, etc., around the periphery. On ac-
count of this phenomenon it is advisable, in case a
wheel being observed has a number of spokes alike,
to make a single distinctive mark on one of them
and then adjust the flash frequency until this mark
shows at only one point, at which time synchronism
exists. In case of doubt it is always advisable to
check the speed roughly by some other means.
A few of the applications are: those by aeroplane
manufacturers for studying motors, propellers, vi-
bration, etc., and the study of speeds, lubrication,
critical speeds, and general use in mills and fac-
tories for observing such things as grain distribu-
tion or parts production. Electrical metering manu-
facturers are now actually notching the edges of
the discs on rotating instruments making it possible
to speed up testing and calibration, and also increase
accuracy by means of the stroboscope. The ob-
servation of ball bearings in action also provides an
interesting study.

high driving rates. The water screen is a separate and
distinct steam producer. There is no connection what-
ever between the hoiler proper and the water screen
until the steam has been generated. It is then deliv-
ered into the drums with the rest of the steam, whence
it goes to the superheater.
The steam generated in the hoiler cannot be com-
pletely dry as long as water is present. For this rea-
son it must he led to the superheater, which evaluates
the moisture remaining in the steam and adds heat to
the dry steam raising its temperature to 700JF.
The superheated steam is led to the turbines which
are located in a room adjacent to the boiler room. The
turbines are 21 stage units bled at the 9th, 13th, 16th
and 19th stages. The steam extracted at these points
is used in a series of feed water heaters and in an
evaporator for distilling the water used to make up the
losses in the system. This system of feedwater heat-
ing combined with condensing operation of the aux-
iliaries has proved more economical than the old
method of using the exhaust of the auxiliaries for heat-
ing the feedwater. There are at present two 50,000
Kilowatt units installed, and there is room for another
in the same building, beside the present installations.
This is indeed a very large turbine when one considers
that about 67,000 horsepower are being delivered by
one shaft. A direct connected alternator generates
electricity at 12,200 volts when running at 1,200 R.P.M.
The generator is excited by a direct connected 300
Kilowatt 250 volt exciter. The voltage of the gen-
erators is stepped up by auto-transformers to a bus
voltage of 34,000. The generator produces heat equal
to the mechanical and electrical losses. In a generator
of this size the losses might conceivably amount to
about 1.500 Kilowatts. This large quantity of heat
cannot be dissipated to the atmosphere. A generator
air cooler is used, consisting of a bank of tubes through
which river water is circulated and over which the hot
air from the armature is circulated.
The condensers have 60,000 sq. ft. of cooling sur-
face or a ratio of 1.2 sq. ft. per Kilowatt. Practice
has shown that in general one square foot per Kilowatt
produces a sufficiently high vacuum. By raising this
value a very high vacuum can be maintained in spite
of the dirty circulating water, and consequently a low-
steam consumption is insured. The condensers are of
the single pass type, and use two 60,000 gallon per
minute circulating pumps to drive river water through
the tubes. The steam when condensed runs to the hot
well at the bottom of the condenser, which, in conjunc-
tion with three 54,000 gallon tanks, serves as a reser-
voir for the feed water. The water from the tanks is
used only in case the level in the hot well becomes too
low. Automatic valves control the flow of the water
from the tanks to the hot well.
The power for driving the electrical auxiliaries is
produced by entirely separate units, called the "house
service turbines." These are 4,000 Kilowatt direct cur-
rent machines of the compound type, and are operated
condensing. There is a high and low pressure cylinder,
each a separate turbine, the power from the two being
combined by a set of herringbone gears. A single
shaft from the gear box drives a 250 volt, 360 R.P.M.
generator. The whole unit including the two pass con-
denser is separated from the main unit. The turbine
takes steam from the main line at 375 lbs. per sq. in.
pressure and is bled at the 4th stage. The bled steam
is used for heating the building.
Both steam and motor driven auxiliaries are used, to
provide for breakdowns. All electrical auxiliaries are
driven by 240 volt direct current motors. This prac-
tice was pioneered by the Detroit Edison Company and
is rapidly being adopted by other companies.
Not content with this remarkable achievement—this
ultra-modern power manufactory—the Edison Com-
pany has still another trick in the bag. An order has
been placed with the British Thomson-Houston Com-
pany for a 10,000 Kilowatt, two-cylinder, single shaft
turbo-generator, to take steam at 365 lbs. per sq. in.
pressure and from 1,000 to 1,100°F. As mentioned
above, designers have very cautiously crept up to 750 F.
as a maximum temperature for steam due to the char-
acteristics of the metals of construction. Now this big
step forward into the dark and unexplored but highly-
enticing realm of exceptionally high temperatures is
being taken. High temperatures mean high efficiency.
The problem of piping design is being given much
careful study—both by metallurgists and engineers.
Numerous plans for obtaining this high temperature
have been suggested, including a separately oil fired
superheater, and a separate boiler. A superheater of
the separately fired type has been set up in the Trenton
Channel plant for experimentation as a preliminary
step. 875°F. is a dull red heat visible in the dark,
which means that if one could view the steam passing
to the turbine it would be a decided glowing red.
Thus the Detroit Edison Company, which was the
first company to adopt large boilers, and one of the
first two to use the steam turbine for large scale power
production, is the pioneer in the very high temperature
field. The results will, to say the least, be far-reach-
ing.

of a refined and delicate character that only they
could create.
Charles F. McKim, in his later life, was, to those
most intimately acquainted with him, a man full of
reposeful charm, reserved, dignified, and handsome.
All with whom he met revered and loved him, his
personality invading and dominating everything.
His many marks of quality are, unquestionably, the
product of a life of rigid, unwearying discipline,
strenuous work, and constant altruism. In 1901 he
was elected president of the American Institute of
Architects in recognition of his remarkable achieve-
ments. It was in this capacity that he bent concen-
trated effort toward educating the officials at Wash-
ington in the importance of a closer alliance between
the profession and the government. He retired
from the chair in 1903 but continued actively in the
work he had inaugurated. His associates Mead and
White, he never neglected, offering constant criti-
cism and often taking an active part in the planning
work.
A vivid picture of the man is drawn by John L.
Cadwalader, his life-long friend and admirer. "In
the sunshine of his presence, acquaintance warmly
blossomed into friendship. In the charm and shadow
of his smile a statement became a demonstration,

TESTING
Many of the products of Allia-Chalmers are of such a
nature that they require extensive testing during the process
of development and after the machines are constructed. Often
special materials are needed or new methods of construction are
necessary in order to build a machine that will produce the best
results when in commercial operation. This testing and develop-
ment work is carried on under the supervision of competent
engineers on the various test floors and in the laboratories.
Miniature hydraulic turbine models and centrifugal pumps
are tested for efficiency and other characteristics in one of the
most extensive hydraulic test pits in this country. The electrical
test floor is busy at all times determining the characteristics of
a wide variety of electrical machinery. And so it is with alt
of the AH is •Chalmers products that it is physically possible to
test ranging from giant steam turbines of more than a 100,000
kw. capacity down to farm and industrial tractors.

Junior Class
The junior engineers have so ably demonstrated
their athletic prowess this year that, with baseball,
tennis, and horseshoe tournaments yet to be played,
they have been awarded the Interclass Athletic
Championship of the University of Michigan by the
Intramural Department.
Since 1927, when they stepped off with the bas-
ketball championship, the boys have shown definite
promise of athletic superiority, and this year has
been the final culmination of their success. Much
interest has been evidenced by members of the
class and it is this, with good management on the
part of Louis Zanoff, good sportsmanship, and ex-
cellent playing, that has given the class its enviable
position this year. This is the first class of the
Engineering College that has won the Inter-Class
athletic competition.

Construction
An important departure in apparatus engineering
is the General Electric vertical compound turbine-
generator. In this machine, the high-pressure ele-
ment, heretofore separate, is built on top of the
low-pressure generator.
This compact construction does away with the
necessity for building a separate foundation for
the high-pressure unit, permits the use of one set
of air coolers, requires less piping, and conserves
floor space.
Test men—veterans, as well as more recent grad-
uates of engineering colleges—take charge of the
machine after assembly, test for oil leaks, bring it
up to speed and check balance in the initial run,
and set the emergency and operating governors.
Electrical tests follow after the generators are
coupled on. This work is part of the training
program for general, industrial, sales, or advanced
engineering work with the General Electric Com-
pany.
