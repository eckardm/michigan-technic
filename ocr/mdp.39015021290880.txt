At Celanese, we don't think patience is much of a virtue when it
comes to creativity or careers. We became a 2 billion dollar com-
pany by responding quickly and creatively to changing markets
and technologies. By giving our people the opportunity-and
responsibility-to respond to change, to develop, to take
initiatives.
Thafs why you won't find any lengthy training programs at
Celanese. Our management philosophy is to give our engineers
and chemists significant projects and responsibilities as soon as
possible. Give them as much to handle as their skills and dedica-
tion are up to in an unusually open working environment which
fosters creative decision-making at all levels.

THIS MONTH'S TECHNIC
Where did the summer go? Wasn't it just yesterday
that we were scurrying around trying to meet the April
deadline? I guess there is no rest for the wicked. Here it
is, October already and all those articles I was going to
write over the summer are still floating around in the
nebulous of my brain. Oh well, maybe later.
The cover story this month is the first of two articles
revealing some new ideas about settlements in outer space.
Business Manager Bill Cowie, who spends his spare time
as a senior in Aerospace, writes about the potential for
energy production from structures in space. Next month
the aspects of living in outer space will be discussed.
Next comes the first prize Cooley Essay Contest winner,
an interesting story called "Nature of the Game," written
by David Henrickson. It is traditional for the Technic to
print the winner of the previous year. The article will be
run in two parts, with the second half coming up in
November.
The office Ham, Cindy Rogers, relates some of her
experiences as a slick operator in her article "CO DE
WD8AMW." The title should make more sense after you
read the article.
Summer may be gone but in some minds it is certainly
not forgotten. I'm sure many of you have had some
interesting experiences with summer jobs. Bill Cowie re-
hashes some of the finer points of searching for a summer
job in his article "It was a Long Summer."
Speaking of jobs, GregWerth did a little research into the
jobs accepted by last spring's graduating engineers. His
efforts resulted in the article "The Year of the Big
Rebound." Greg is a junior in Electrical Engineering.
The old Slide Rule Ball is being brought back this year
with a new name: The Calculator Ball. Laura Lisiecki
delves into the history of the Ball in her article "The New
Slip Stick Trot." Laura is a sophomore in Mat-Met.
The graphics this month are the work of Staff Artist
J.P. McCarthy. Lee Benson closes out the issue with the
ever-popular "50 and 25 Years Ago."

Have your ever sat down and thought hard about why
you're in school? I have and I've decided that one reason is
a goal that I've set for myself. Before I die I'd like to have
an impact on society. I have my own ideas and I'd like
to nurse them along and eventually see them borne out.
Another reason, one more visible and close at hand, is to
use my education to get a challenging and enjoyable job.
I have some strong feelings concerning the educational
process and how some recent happenings may eventually
affect us all. The effect that the educational process has
upon a student and upon personal goals set by the student
is an important subject today.
We all realize that we live in an ever increasing
technological world. More and more people are demand-
ing perfection from the engineer. We are called upon to
solve the most difficult problems in all aspects of society.
This puts a heavy burden upon the engineering world,
especially upon engineers who deal with people and people-
related products. In turn the educational system must also
bear some of the burden by making sure that graduating
students retain a level of competency proportional to
the rise of industrial technological advancements. Not
only the educational system in general, but the students in
particular, should demand the high degree of education
they will need when they step out into industry. After
all, what good are you to a company if your education is
lacking? That company could just as easily find someone
else with all the requirements and hire him in place of you.
It makes sense then that students should demand this
level of quality.
I, as a student, feel a little let down by the educational
system. Not by this particular University mind you, but
by the national trends that have recently influenced
school systems all across the country. I'm speaking generally
about discrimination and particularly about the quota
system. I feel that a deterioration of scholastic standards
may have occured because of the quota system. This could
have a direct impact, not only upon educational goals
and values, but also upon industry's standards and goals.
Just as industry influences education, so also does education
influence industry. In other words a deterioration of
industrial standards may already have occured. Looking
at our society today it is evident that any kind of in-
dustrial setbacks are soon going to affect us all very much.
Now more than ever society calls upon its engineers to
solve some of the worst problems man has ever faced on
this planet. Certainly this is not the time for a relaxation
of important standards.
What I'm calling for is a system that allows only
qualified students to graduate as engineers. This will allow
for a higher standard in education and thus a higher
standard in industry. We are going to need highly qualified
people to solve our problems in the future. It can only
benefit us (and our children) to embrace such a system.
I believe industry has already realized this. They are
choosing only those they deem fit to tackle the serious
problems at hand. I'm relying on industry more than on the
public to evolve a change in the educational process. The
change, however, will be slow without the public's help.
The public itself must realize the importance of engineers.
The original ideas behind the quota system may have
been good but the system has stepped well outside of the
limits set up for it. Until state legislatures realize this and
tie in the importance of qualified engineers to society's
technological advancement, educational institutions and
their students will continue to suffer under lower standards.

How good are you
on the turns?
A strong stroke isn't enough to win in freestyle swimming.
Experts say: "Watch the turns."
"A champion won't touch with his hand," they tell us. "He begins his
overhead tumble with a downward stab of his right arm, twists as his feet
hit, then explodes forward with a powerful pushoff."
Their conclusion: "Experience and smart coaching develop a championship turn."
We believe it. That's why we've put together the most experienced and
best-coached team of bearing and steel engineers in the world. And we're
constantly expanding and modernizing for the future.
This coupled with promotion from within will mean increasing opportunities

Space Habitats
Just as "environmental pollution" was the topic of
discussion of the late 60's, the "energy crisis" has become
the topic of today. But "energy crisis" is not a precise
description of the problem; rather, "fossil fuel energy
crisis" would be more accurate. It is generally believed
that this "energy crisis" is a new problem, as it is not
a problem that has been faced before by those of us alive
today. But a look at the history books shows that this is
not true at all. In fact, the human race has been con-
fronted with "repeated energy crises".
The Crises
What was probably the first of these crises occured
in the 1770's in Britain when that country was in the
process of rapid industrialization and needed increasing
amounts of energy. But Britain was running out of
adequate sites for locating the water wheels that were
by Bill Cowie
providing power for her factories. This development would
soon lead to a curtailment of growth in their economy,
and predictions for the future, if made, would have shown
that a limit to growth was rapidly being approached.
Most engineers of that era attacked the problem from the
most obvious angle — the water wheel itself. Much time
and effort was spent, and in due time, the efficiency of the
water wheel was doubled.
But by the end of that century, an entirely new
technology was in the process of making the water
wheel obsolete. It was first patented by James Watt,
and it was called the steam engine. In fact. Watt was
already building steam engines while others were busy
working on the water wheel. As cheaper coal became
available the steam engine continued to displace the water
wheel, and by the 1930's most of the water wheels had
disappeared.

Then in the 1860's came another crisis. This time the
concern was that Britain was running out of coal, which
was necessary for the boilers of the many steam engines.
A prominent economist of the time talked of an impending
energy crisis, and again, limits to economic growth were
projected. But as before, a new technology had been
developed, and while most of the emphasis was on the
improvement of the steam engine, the various types of
internal combustion engines fed by the increasing supplies
of oil, were beginning to demonstrate their superiority.
A definite pattern emerges from the above cases. First
comes the realization that the predominant technology
of the day will soon be insufficient to meet ever growing
energy requirements. This is accompanied by the predictions
of the "experts" of a dire future. The immediate response
is an increase in the already powerful economic and techno-
logical backing of the existing energy technology. Much
time and money is spent trying to improve the familiar
rather than looking for something new. Meanwhile, a new
technology has already been born and is struggling alone,
often unnoticed, with little financial backing and only a
small group of individuals who believe in its potential. It is
this new technology which eventually solves the crisis
by replacing the older technology with something better.
This brings us up to the present crisis, and so far the
pattern is fitting perfectly. It is now becoming apparent
that the present day fossil-fueled technology will soon be
insufficient to meet our upcoming energy requirements.
There have been rumblings of an uncertain future and
projections of limits to economic growth. We are now in
the midst of a flurry of improvements in the existing
technology. Congress has mandated improvements for
automobiles which, by 1985, will require them to be almost
twice as energy-efficient as they were in 1974. At the U.S.
Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA)
over a billion dollars per year is being spent on existing
October 1977


a new technology born less than a decade ago, and as yet
barely noticed, is struggling along on its own, with little
financial backing and little attention.
A New Idea
In 1969, Dr. Gerard O'Neill, a physicist at Princeton
University, asked a group of physics students the following
question: "Is a planetary surface the right place for an
expanding technological civilization?" Both he and his
students were surprised when their research led to a
negative conclusion. Eventually, they determined that the
best location would be in free space itself, in an enclosed,
self sufficient settlement. O'Neill was intrigued by the
conclusions of the group, and he continued to work on
the problem in his spare time.
The habitats themselves would probably be large cylinders
or spheres, with dimensions of the order of miles. (A
typical design, based on present day structural technology,
would be a cylinder 4 miles in diameter and 20 miles long).
These cylinders would rotate about their own axis so that
the people living inside them would experience an earth-
normal "gravity". (Actually it would be a centripital
acceleration). The habitats would be lined on the inside
with "soil" — actually lunar regolith - to protect the
inhabitants from dangerous solar radiation. They could be
landscaped in any desirable way, with hills, rivers, forests
and lakes. The habitats would be filled with oxygen and
perhaps some nitrogen, with large windows in certain areas
of the outer skin accompanied by mirrors to reflect sunlight
into them. By controlling these mirrors, both the amount
of daylight and the climate could be controlled as desired.
Indeed, the settlements could be made as pleasurable to
live in as the best areas on earth.
The habitats would be located in space at a point known
as L5, the fifth of the five Libration points of the earth-
EARTH

sun-Jupiter, etc. L3 is on the earth-moon line on the opposite side of the earth. In the 3-body system, eg. sun-earth-moon, the
locus of all points of minimum gravitational potential describes a complicated 3-dimensional surface of approximately the size
and cross-sectional shape shown above. This provides a tremendous area in which many space habitatsand industrial plants can
be located.

rotating about the other, has associated with it 5 points of
gravitational stability known as the Lagrangian Libration
points. (See figure 1). LI, L2, and L3, while being statically
stable, are dynamically unstable. In other words, an
object placed precisely at one of these points will stay
there only so long as it is not disturbed. The classical
analogy of this is a ball balanced at the top of a hill.
L4 and L5, on the other hand, are both statically and
dynamically stable. An object placed at either of these
points will tend to return there if displaced. The analogy
here would be a ball placed at the bottom of a depression.
L4 and L5 travel in the orbit of the moon, respectively,
60° in front of, and 60° behind the moon. Thus the
earth, the moon, and L5 form an equilateral triangle in
space.
Things are not quite that simple though, as the Sun,
however distant, still exerts a gravitational force which
can not be ignored. When the Sun is brought into the
picture, L5 is transformed from a point into a large,
complicated, 3-dimensional surface which encloses the
former single point. But there is nothing wrong with this,
since any place on this surface is a local point of minimum
gravitational potential, and it remains both statically and
dynamically stable. Now, instead of being able to place
only one object precisely at a particular point, many
thousands of objects can be placed anywhere on this
surface, and they will always stay on it. This is where many
space habitats could be established.
Satellite Solar Power
Some years before O'Neill published his iconoclastic
proposals, a novel approach for collecting solar energy had
been suggested. It became known as Satellite Solar Power,
and its most prominent spokesman was Dr. Peter Glaser. It
was proposed that huge solar collectors be set up in geo-
synchronous orbit, that is, an orbit with a period equal
to one day, so that it would always remain above a fixed
point on the earth. (Communications satellites, for instance,
are routinely lifted into geosynchronous orbit for the same
reason). By placing the stations in outer space instead of
on the surface of the earth, they would be able to collect
more than 99% of the available sunlight, since only an
occasional eclipse of the Sun would stop sunlight from
reaching them. Even using the best locations on earth,
however, the same collectors would receive no more than
20% of the possible sunlight. This is because any station on
the earth spends half its time in darkness. Even during the
day, the sunlight is attenuated by the atmosphere and the
clouds. Thus outer space is a much better location for
receiving solar energy.
According to Glaser's plan, the solar energy collected
by these Solar Satellite Power Stations (SSPS) would be
converted to microwave energy and transmitted in a narrow
beam to a receiving antenna on earth, where it would be
converted to electricity. But there was one major drawback
to this plan, namely, that the huge cost of lifting the
enormous mass of these large stations from the surface of
the earth into orbit is prohibitive.
Then along came Dr. O'Neill, whose idea breathed new
life into the SSPS concept. According to this new plan,
most of the materials necessary to build settlements and
power stations at L5 would not come from the earth, but
rather from the moon. This is one of the key elements in
O'Neill's plan as he, too, realized the prohibitive cost of
lifting materials from the earth. But the moon also has a
gravitational field, although it is somewhat smaller, and
current day rocket technology still would be a rather
expensive means of lifting the necessary materials off the
moon. O'Neill's solution lies in a device he calls a lunar-mass
driver, a "transport device that can launch payloads from the
Moon without itself ever leaving the surface."2
Basically, it would consist of a series of buckets traveling
on a long closed-loop track. The buckets would be accelera-
ted down a 7 mile long straightaway by the action of a
series of magnetic impulses. Using a technique called
"dynamic magnetic levitation",3 the buckets would ac-
tually travel over the track instead of on it, thereby
eliminating any sliding friction. A loaded bucket would
reach a lunar escape velocity of more than 5000 miles
per hour in about 8 seconds, after which it will travel in
free space for several miles while its exact speed and
direction is checked by laser light and adjusted by small
magnetic forces. At the end of this free travel, the bucket
will release its payload and will be decelerated and returned
to pick up another scoop. Meanwhile, the 20 pound
payloads of compacted lunar soil, spaced a half second
apart, will travel off in a near horizontal direction,
escape from the moon, and travel unguided to L5. There,
at an industrial site, they will be caught and processed into
their component materials.
Results from the Apollo project indicate that a typical
sample of the lunar soil would contain the following
breakdown of elements:
Oxygen 45%
Silicon 20%
Aluminum 12%
Titanium 5%
Iron 4%
Magnesium 3%
The silicon and metals could be used for construction of
the SSPS and the habitats, while the oxygen could be used
for the atmosphere of the habitats and for combining
with hydrogen brought up from the earth to produce water.
Once the component metals have been produced at
the L5 processing plant, the construction of the first SSPS
could begin. At the present time, it appears that the most
economical power plant would be a closed-cycle Brayton
turbogenerator, as solar cells may still be too expensive
to be cost effective. In this system, solar mirrors would
concentrate sunlight onto Ixiiler tubes. Helium gas would be
the working fluid, driving the turbine and then passing
through a radiator to be recirculated. The electricity thus
wou'd ^e converted to microwaves of a carefully
October 1977


shaped transmitter about a half mile in diameter. The
generator-converter-transmitter assembly would be con-
structed at L5, and when finished, would be transported
down to geosynchronous orbit via an efficient "space tug".
Once there, it would begin supplying valuable energy to the
earth.
On the receiving end, a rectenna with a diameter of about
4 miles would collect the microwave energy. It would
probably be located some distance from populated areas in
order to minimize the risk of exposure to human beings.
The microwave beam would be of only modest intensity;
nevertheless, there would necessarily be a system to stop
transmission of the beam should the trasnmitter drift off
target. The wavelength of the microwave beam would be
carefully chosen so that the atmosphere and clouds would
be approximately 90% transparent to it. The conversion
of microwave energy to direct current could be made 80 to
90% efficient, so that relatively little waste heat is generated.
(Nuclear and fossil-fueled generator stations here on earth
are 30 to 40% efficient, releasing 1V4 to 2 times as much
energy in the form of waste heat as the usable energy
they produce). Studies still must be done to determine the
effect of the microwave radiation on the atmosphere,
migrating birds, communications radios of aircraft, and
anything else that might pass through the beam.
Cost and Economics
The amount of money needed for the initial investment
for this project would be no small sum, yet the possible rate
of return could make such an investment a rather attractive
one. Let's look at the projections that have been made.
It would cost about $100 billion to build the first
space manufacturing facility at L5, since most of the mater-
ials for this facility would have to come from the earth.
To put large numbers like this into perspective, consider
the following: $100 million is approximately the amount
that the U.S. spends every year for defense, and is
considerably less than the amount spent on welfare. The
Apollo project cost a total of roughly $40 billion (in
constant 1975 dollars). Project Independence, launched by
President Nixon several years ago, was supposed to provide
the U.S. with energy self-sufficiency by 1985 at a cost of
$600 billion. And finally, it has been projected that
private utilities in this country will have to invest close to
$1000 billion dollars over the next 25 years to keep their
generating capacity expanding fast enough to keep pace with
growing energy requirements. (This projection, of course,
does not anticipate a project such as the SSPS).
Consider then, the following scenario, presented by Dr.
O'Neill in his lecture on the U. of M. campus in March of
1976. The figure of $100 billion for the first facility
at L5 would be spread out over several years. After that,
$80 billion would be required to supply the next 15
facilities with materials that cannot be obtained from the
moon — primarily carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen. Using
what O'Neill calls a "bootstrap" process, the first inhabitants
would divide their efforts evenly, spending half on building
more habitats, and half on building power plants. This
would lead to a build up of energy producing capacity at a
geometric rate. The electricity produced would be sold at
competitive rates at first, but as more and more power
plants come on line, the price would be steadily lowered in
order to penetrate a larger and larger segment of the market.
This would be possible because the only costs for these
generating plants would be the cost of amortization and
maintenance. After all, the "fuel", sunlight, is free!
Continuing with the scenario, the plan would be to
make a large initial investment spread out over many years.
The interest rate on invested capital is assumed to be 10%,
which is translated into a discount rate of about 17%.
After about 25 years, the total revenue from the sale of
solar power will exceed the entire cost of the original
investment plus all accrued interest. Once the power
plants are amortized, the cost of solar power can continue
to drop, since the only cost then will be that of maintenance.
Eventually, energy costs may be able to be lowered to the
point where, "instead of having to pump (crude) oil out of
the ground, it will become economically competitive to
synthesize artificial fuel to be used in place of gasoline".^
This, of course, carries with it some rather significant
political connotations!
Indeed, the major barrier to such a project may not be
economic or technological, but rather, political. According
to O'Neill, it will be necessary "to convince the appropriate
combinations of government and private industry" in order
for this plan to become a reality.
Admittedly, there is much research to be done, and
many questions to be answered. But the main question is,
will we repeat our past mistakes by looking for a solution
in the familiar and conventional while failing to investigate
something which holds much potential, but which requires
an open mind? And can the engineers and scientists, who
may have devoted so much of their time and energy to
the present technology, and whose very livelihood may be
threatened by this new technology be persuaded that this
might be better? Only time will tell.
Next month a look from the humanistic side: what it would
be like to live and work in a space settlement.

CQ, QRM, DE, CL, QRX, QSY, YL. How would I
ever learn all of these abbreviations for commonly used
ham radio phrases? Ever since junior high school I had
wanted to become a ham radio operator, and now I was
in the process of studying for the novice amateur radio
exam. The exam was in two separate parts — theory and
code. I had already mastered some basic electronics, radio
theory, and Morse code. The minimum requirement for
Morse code was five words per minute (for the novice
exam) which sounded easy enough. After all, I could type
thirty five words per minute, but I soon found that
copying code was not exactly like typing. It was much
more difficult to obtain speed in copying code. But, in fact
it was quite enjoyable; almost like knowing a foreign
language. I was lucky to have been able to learn the
code by listening to it rather than by trying to memorize
the symbols. This made it possible to learn quickly and
correctly, and it turned out to be not as difficult as I
first thought.
The first part of the test involved a Morse code speed
test administered by a ham operator with a General class
license or higher. On the day of the test, Richard, whose
call letters were WB8NKF, gave me the exam. I passed
with flying colors. The second part of the exam was a
written test from the Federal Communications Commis-
by Cindy Rogers
sion (FCC). In order to take the second part of the exam
it was necessary for me to have passed the first part.
I settled down to wait for the US Government to send
me the written part of the exam. As luck would have it,
the exam arrived just about the same time finals did for
the winter term. I took the test, it was mailed back to
Washington, and then I prepared for another long wait for
the results to return. That summer I received my license
from the FCC. I was now a novice ham radio operator.
My first contact was to a man in Louisiana. I was so
nervous I had to ask him to repeat things at least twice.
When I finally understood what he was trying to tell me,
I really had to laugh. He told me he was thirty and single
and wanted me to send him a recent picture. I signed off
and he sent me "88's" (which means love and kisses).
My roomates couldn't understand what I was laughing
about because they didn't know code.
Of the numerous conversations I have had, I have met
amateurs of all ages, ranging from factory workers, to
students, even to the vice-president of a well known
company. But amateur radio has more to it than just
talking to other operators. Many hams receive awards
from an organization called the American Radio Relay
League (ARRL). Award certificates are given to hams
who communicate with all fifty states, work one hundred

a simulated national "emergency" situation called Field
Day. Field Day entails a twenty-four hour period of national
alert where hams from all over the United States use
their equipment to contact as many other operators as
possible. The hams set up their radios in an open field as
makeshift station and use whatever means possible to
generate the necessary power for transmission. Solar energy,
gasoline generators, batteries, and even bicycles have been
used as means of supplying power. Copper wire strung
over trees is often used in place of much more sophisti-
cated antennas. It has been found that communication
is possible in the event that electric power and telephones
are out of service. Besides being a unique learning exper-
ience, Field Day is a lot of fun. It is usually the big event
of the year for many amateur radio clubs.
Besides being able to communicate by voice and code
many hams are able to use satellites orbiting in space
as communications links. Also used to communicate
are teletypes and even television pictures have been sent.
The frequency bands allocated to radio amateurs can also
provide an interest to hams. The time of day, the time of
year, and even the number of sunspots will influence how
close or far away a certain band will carry the radio signals.
There have been some unusual times when most of the
different countries, and who achieve various code pro-
ficiencies.
Amateur radio is not always just fun and games;
amateurs often handle emergency communications during
natural disasters. During these disasters amateur operators
have provided the only link to the outside world. Some
examples of this include the earthquakes of Central
America and the floods of Johnstown, Pennsylvania this
past summer. However, emergency communications are just
a small part of what amateur radio is all about. Many
hams deliver and send non-emergency messages all over the
world. In many cases, amateur radio operators have pro-
vided an overseas link between service men and women
and their families back home. Still others just like to chew
the fat with old friends.
stations on a particular band were from outside the
continental United States. Talking to these foreign amateurs
is always exciting and interesting.
Learning is the most fascinating part of the hobby.
Experimenting with equipment, antennas, and ways of
communicating can provide hours of fun . . . Conversations
with foreign operators can shed light on their culture and
way of life. Overall amateur radio has to be one of the most
diverse and interesting hobbies that exists today. Want to
meet some very interesting people? Want to make friends
with people all over the world? BECOME A HAM!

This is a "once upon a time" story.
I know, I know; I'm not supposed to say things like that.
But it's true. It's important that you understand what
I'm trying to do here. I also want you to know exactly
what you're letting yourself in for.
You see, this is a fable, sort of.
The "sort of" is because, while this story takes on the
basic form of a fable, it is not concerned with any morale
as such but rather with an idea instead. One which is
intriguing in a devilish sort of way.
It concerns the eternal triangle of the Christian religion:
heaven, hell, and man in the middle. It also concerns the
Christian teaching which urges each believer to emulate
the Godlike perfection of the Creator to the best of his or
her natural ability. With these as a foundation the idea is
this: What would happen if a man were to succeed in such
an ambition? What would be the reaction of those that rule
in heaven and hell to this presumptuous interloper?
An impossible achievement though of course. But
perhaps the entrance requirements aren't quite that de-
manding, perhaps the heaven-hell-afterlife situation isn't
exactly according to either Hoyle or church dogma. Then,
we have the makings of this story.
Briefly, the setting is the Middle East, in the eleventh
century anno Domini, at the end of the cruel and bloody
first Crusades to the Holy Land. Our sole human character
is a man of noble birth, a duke, hero and applicant to the
position in question. Not that he's perfect mind you, this
Everyman, far from it; he has the weaknesses all men possess.
A man of strong faith, he has nonetheless doubted and
blasphemied; a believer in the Tightness of the scriptures,
he has still coveted that which he should not and slaughtered
rather more than his share of fellow men in the name of his
faith. In short, done many things during his life for which
he was ashamed.
Yet, this is a man of much worth even so; much of his
nature hinting at true greatness if only the times had
allowed. In an era of fierce prejudice he was a man who
possessed an unwaivering sense of justice as well as an
amazingly open mind. In a period of history which was
1977 Cooley Essay Contest First Prize Winner
David K. Henrickson
rampant with cruelty and horror, he was a person who was
genuinely kind and merciful, from strength and not through
weakness. As compared to a normal man from any age, the
power of his will, the sheer strength of his determination,
was an awesome thing to witness. He was one of those
extremely rare individuals whose unbreakable spirit made
the man more than just the flesh which hosted him. This
is what made him special; perhaps, in someway, this is what
was responsible for all that was to happen . . .
Anyway. This is a "once upon a time" story. A fact I
acknowledge most humbly in order to justify the method of
the tale and the taint of conventionality you will find it
possesses. In short, what I wish to tell you, my audience, is
this: the time and historical setting of the story are real
enough; the characters dangerously close to being stereo-
types; the general idea thread-bare; the plot-lines almost
obliterated with use; the intent, though flippant of tone up
to this point, completely earnest and serious; the objective
clearly defined and already in jeopardy. All of these
opening comments have been in preparation for this
immensely compounded sentence, that there might be no
doubt between us.
Enough of this introducing. An end to it.
Once upon a time . . .
The horse moved along slowly, steadily, its iron-shod
hoofs clattering against the frequent stones which cobbled
the ancient and desert-dry river bed. Beside it the man
moved with the same enduring, unalterable tread; one hand
on the horse's bridle, his bent head bared to the relentless
sun which beat down from a cloudless sky. Beads of sweat
stood out upon his brow and in among the short locks of
his bleached and burnished hair; the breath labored in his
lungs, giving him no relief despite the effort it cost him;
with each infinitesimal step he took the heavy leather he
wore tried to bind his movements and drag him to the
earth.
Yet, despite all these sufferings and more, this man
would continue walking; long after the faithful companion
at his side died in its tracks trying to keep the measured
16
Michigan Technic


whatever this man set his will upon, if it was possible and
deserving in the eyes of God Almighty, then that he would
accomplish or die attempting. His inner strength made this
man a thing of oak or granite, broken he could be but never
bent. In movement there was life, and it was life and the
service of God to which he now clung as a plant clings to
the soil and the light from which the torrent would separate
it.
Three days past they had left the fresh greeness of the
floodplains and gentle valleys, to strike out along the arid,
wasted coast towards a distant hearth and homeland to
which only fortune would eventually guide them. Now, so
coated and grimed with sand that they were no longer
readily distinguishable from the earth on which they walked,
the man knew the destination that fate had finally led him
to; and accepted it as the wisdom of God.
His faded eyes caught on the slice of distant sea which
glimmered at the horizon. Surely, he thought, his body
would support him no further than that. But it did not
really matter, he had been commanded to fight for each
second of life with the gift of life itself, so many years ago
it seemed; he could do no less than that now. He would
walk until he could walk no more, and then he would die.
He knew that if he mounted the horse he might live an
hour, a day perhaps, longer; but the thought did not tempt
him. Already the horse carried his helmet, weapons, mail, and
their few supplies; the more it carried the quicker it would
die. Though it would accept his killing weight with no more
than a dull feeling of Tightness, he would have no part of
it, not even to extend his own life. This he would not do.
He had had enough of death and killing, he could kill
no more, he had lost the mandate to do so. Where exactly
he could not say, but somewhere in his three day trek it had
been burnt away from him as his skin had been burnt away.
Perhaps the wind had chiseled it from about him, the same
as it had eaten the humanity from his existence, leaving
only the saint behind. Hard, barren essential, as if
sainthood were the bones of the body; fit only to sense,
worship, and serve the Creator. After a lifetime of doubt, loss,
and torment, it was enough.
The sea was the first thing that the Duke became aware
of. Its surface lay calm and gray in the indeterminate light;
composed beneath an insistent, steady breeze which flowed
in towards shore bearing its burden of salt to the man's
senses. As if the wind came from the edge of the world,
where the dome of heaven rested upon the perimeter of
the earth, it pushed the sea up onto the shore in long and
momentous waves. Waves which moved up the flat beach
to almost touch the hoofs of the duke's horse as it stood
and shivered, blowing the pungent air through its nostrils.
Absently he reached down and patted the beast beneath
him, vaguely puzzled that he should be mounted. Turning
to observe the beach behind him, the solitary tracks of his
mount as they came along the shore, thrown deep in the
soft sand, were plain to his eyes. He must believe then,
he told himself, though in truth he could remember nothing
of that ride. Nothing at all since ... his brow gathered
in concentration. What had happened? It would not come,
something he should remember, but it would not come.
The horse nickered softly and shifted uneasily beneath
him, recalling his attention to the here and now. Recollected,
it was almost as if in a dream that he swung back around.
And froze. A creature stood by the horse, so close that it
nearly touched the man's boot in its grip. He mouthed a
curse and grabbed for the hilt of his sword, his heart
hammering wildly within him; and yet did not draw and
strike. For the creature did not move or show in any way
that it was aware of his intentions. It simply stood, one
white claw of a hand grasping the horse's bridle, and
gazed up at him with a terrible contemplation on its
caricature of a face. This tableau held for a minute more
and then the creature released its grip upon the horse and
stepped quietly away until the man no longer looked
directly down on it. Almost painfully the duke began to
breathe again.
It was only then, after he had gathered himself, that
he truly, horribly realized how strange, how wrong, this
17
October 1977


and feature which, though tragic and repulsive, was a natural
occurance; this, thing, was unearthly. And though how the
man knew this with such certainty he could not say, it was
inherently evil and hostile to man.
The caricature of the face was exactly that, a caricature
which made no secret of its nature. White, as dried bleached
bones are white; hard, brittle, rigid and yet somehow as
capable of change and movement as the duke's own. It was
not a skull but rather a mask, like that a traveling player
might fit around his face. The nose was finely sculpted, the
cheeks as smooth as any woman's, the presence of the ears
only suggested by the curling edges of the mask as they
trailed into the thinness of air. The mouth was wide and
made for laughing, the lips thin and as bloodless as the rest.
The eyes of the thing, or rather their absence, were the
worst. Beyond the lashless lids, dwelling within the black
void where white and pupil should have sat, lay damnation.
The whole impression of the face was cruel, weak, selfish,
hateful, foolish, arrogant, gloating, deceitful, jealous, vain,
insatiable; an impossible diversity of natures. Every negative
emotion or characteristic that the man could think of he
could sense there. Indeed, so infallible was it, that the
other sensed it to be a reflection of what one expected
to see. By what witchery this was accomplished the duke
had no notion, but he felt great powers at work here and
crossed himself against them. At this gesture the mask-face
smiled without any trace of goodness and the man knew
that he was right. The caricature of a face was no distortion
of humanity, but rather a mockery upon it.
The creature's hands, so crippled and wasted as to
appear clawlike, possessed the same ability as the face to
portray an inexhaustible supply of evils. Though they
seemed so ruined as to be helpless and without strength,
hanging limp at the thing's side, the man believed that
nothing alive could survive their touch. And yet, even when
it had stood at his side, nearly touching the horse as well
as himself, the animal had not bolted nor shown any real
fear at its sudden presence. The horse had reacted to the
duke himself often in that way, its master. With an awful
sense of premonition the man hurried past this thought
and tried to grasp the final, most-impossible of all the
creature's attributes.
For, beside the mask of the face and the hands just
described, the thing had no body; nothing. Nothing in fact.
Between the face and the two appendages, as if a section of
reality had been cut out in the shape of a full, muffling
robe hung upon a thin and wasted body, there was Nothing.
Deeper than darkness truly, it was total, complete, absolute
black. No light touched it, reflected from it, relieved it,
or passed through it. The man felt that nothing existable
could mitigate it in any way; by the very nature of its
being.
To describe it simply as a window into darkness though
would be wrong, it was a volume and not an area of non-
existence in the form of a man. It disturbed the duke to
look at it, for it drew and then tugged at his eyes until
they began to strain, his vision to dance. But he forced
himself to consider it closely and to some extent was able
to get an idea as to the subtlety of the imposture.
Perhaps it was a body and robe in some unfathomable
way, the duke amended, because if it was not then the
detail of the forgery was immense. By what he could tell
from the change of its abrupt outline with the small move-
ments that it made, the simulation was perfect, even to the
fold and drape of the fabric. It was even complete with a
hood, thrown up and about the face to frame it in darkness.
During this silent examination the apparition remained
motionless, as if aware of the effect he created and allowing
a full measure of time for the duke to accept. And, of
course, the knowledge of what the other was did come to
the man as he sat there. And though his heart seemed to
catch and his face paled, it was not true that he knew terror.
In a way he was even relieved: the reaction of the horse, his
own strange foreboding, the bizarre suspension of memory
which left him without knowledge of how he had happened
to reach this place were all explained; the terrible familiarity
of his terrible companion.
Again the horse moved restlessly beneath him. The man
steadied it automatically and, summoning his breath and
courage, spoke out in a strong, true voice. "Death, I
know you. What is your business with me?"
At these words the creature laughed without rancor, as
if sharing a joke. "You think that I am Death? Not so,"
18

Once more the duke was surprised; not at the words or
the laughter but at the nature and quality of the gestures,
the speech, used by the creature. If not by its appearance,
then by its manner and bearing, the thing seemed no more
than human. Indeed, the words it had spoken and the laugh
it had laughed had seemed to come from the throat of a
normal, even common, man.
"Let me introduce myself," the apparition delivered a
modest bow. "As unpretentiously as possible, for despite all
the legends I have never been one for melodrama. Quite
simply, I am satan."
"Satan himself?" said the old duke, straightening.
"Please, Sir. If only in my presence will you do me the
consideration of dropping the honorific? It's just plain satan,
not Satan. Small s."
"Your pardon, satan." From his seat high on the brutal
warmount his Grace belatedly returned the other's bow.
"As you wish."
"You are kind. Lord; also curious no doubt. I beg you,
restrain yourself on my account no further. Ask of me
what questions you will."
It was difficult to recouncil the thing's speech, mild
and inoffensive, subtle as the tounge of a scholar, with its
hideous and supernal guise. Somewhat uncertain but not
misguided, the man did not know whether he faced the
Prince of Darkness or not. He did know that this other was
not to be trusted in any way.
"We have met before."
"That is a statement, not a question. I see you are no
novice. Sir, to use the sickle; which must only be swung
with the utmost caution. I too know the value of a straight
blade. Yes, we have met."
"Three times."
"Exactly three. Though I have watched you from a
distance often."
Three times. Twice in the chaos of battle and once as
he led a patrol through the desert stretches, he had glimpsed
such a fantasma as faced him now. Glimpsed and then
forgotten, hidden, or disbelieved as impossible and imagined.
"Each time you were watching me. Each time I felt
very near death."
"As you were of course, which was why I was there."
The other's voice trailed into silence, his gaze significant.
There was a pause. "And now I am dead," the man said
slowly pondering this fantastic thought out loud. The last
trek through the desert, the sea on the horizon; he
remembered now.
"Precisely. Hardly what you imagined, eh?"
"I don't believe I ever imagined it any single way," the
man answered quietly, bound up in the thought. "This
seems as likely as any other." It was as simple as that, he
now talked about being dead the way he had once accepted
the plain fact that he was alive. He no more doubted the
latter state now than he had ever doubted the former. There
would be no weeping, no begging, no incredulity; he knew
he was dead, his whole body knew it. It was something
beyond question.
"You are wise indeed. Lord. The manner of your death
revealed the extent of your greatness, your coolness now
only confirms the impression. You will truly be a worthy
adversary."
The man's reply was cut off as his mount, stirring once
again, abruptly reared, nearly throwing him. It was a
moment's work before the duke was able to master him. As
the horse stood shivering, still uneasy, the man looked
towards the one who called himself satan for an explanation.
"You had better dismount," responded the other. "He
will be forced to throw you if he must."
"Why?What is wrong?"
"Nothing. It is simply that a greater master summons him,
to a destination which is not your destination."
"Where?"
The creature pointed, to where the shoreline disappeared
beyond a distant point.
"There is a place," he said. "Along that coast, where
mountain upon mountain of bones are piled. The resting
place for all the servants of man." He gestured. "Dismount
now if you would."
The man did as he was bid reluctantly, as if parting
from an old friend forever. He stood a minute and stroked
its neck, seeking to smooth the tremors from its body, then
moved away toward the other.
"How far from here?" From normal eye level the
October 1977

"Forever and a day." At the man's puzzled expression,
the apparition elaborated further. "You can never reach it,
it is a journey which requires more than a pair of legs to
complete. There, the inhabitants are free at last from you.
It's only fair, is it not?"
The man ignored this last. "I do not understand how
such a thing can be."
The demon shrugged its Nothing shoulders in polite
indifference.
"And if I were to pace my horse step for step the entire
way?" the duke asked, unwilling to give up the subject.
Amused, the other gave way graciously, "Go ahead, if
you can catch up to him."
The man whirled; to find that the horse had vanished as
efficiently as the other had appeared. Only the hoofprints
in the sand, ending inexplicably, proved that it had ever been
there. He turned away quickly, feeling a deep, startling sense
of loss.
The other showed no signs of being aware of it. The
face shaping a smile, one twisted hand showing the way, it
said simply, "Come."
The man, seeing no alternative, did so and together they
continued his journey along the shore. They walked in
silence for a brief while until, entering a region of rocks and
water-carved boulders, the creature ventured an observation.
"You have not yet asked the most important question
of me."
"Is it truly necessary?" the duke asked, seeking to
extend his outer calm beneath the surface. "You are about
to show me its answer, are you not?"
The creature gave a single bark of appreciative laughter.
"By all that's Unholy, you're a shrewd one."
The duke was not about to be drawn out so. "You get
many such, I imagine. I doubt you find them much more
difficult than their duller companions."
"Little more," confessed the so-called satan, giving up
the ploy; evidently deciding that honesty was better, at
least for the time being. "Any type of bread still being
no more than bread, if my meaning is clear."
"Terrifyingly so, I assure you."
"Your basic problem lies in that it is not you who I
want something from, but rather Him. That something,
unfortunately for you, being yourself of course. And, again
unfortunately for you, when I really want something badly
enough I don't have much trouble in getting it from the
old pariah."
It might have been talking about weaseling scraps of
food from the master of the kitchen for all the emotion, or
evil, it displayed, the man thought as they rounded a reach
of rock and looked upon a small cove. Here, of course, was
their destination at last, was all he could think now that the
time had come. On the fine, smoothed gravel above the
reach of the tide; an exquisite table of massive oak; two
greatchairs facing across from one another; and on the
table between them, a game of chess arranged and waiting.
"Here we are," said the apparition, turning to him with
the polite concern of a host. "You play, I believe?"
The duke nodded, despite his resolve chilled and taunt.
"A skill I've found useful to possess," he managed.
Againthatshrugof Nothing."It could have been anything.
A contest of some sort is expected with men of your
caliber." Those sockets containing only emptiness met the
duke's hard, uncompromising gaze; considering. "You
believe it as well, I can see it. Always the same." It shook
its head with an air of exasperation.
"There need be no confrontation, I assure you. What
more proof do you need than what you have seen? You are
here, in this place, with me uncontested by any sign of His
will. Believe, you are mine and mine alone."
"Do you truly think that my Lord and Master, and
yours as well, would forsake a loyal and abject subject in
his time of greatest need?"
"Do you profess to know the workings of Heaven and
Hell, man?"
"Being a man, can I doubt the word of God?"
The demon considered him. "Then you know all truth?"
"What I have been told of the truth, then that truth I
know."
"You know about God, then."
"Yes."
"I see. And do you also 'know' where the wind comes
from?"
The duke looked at him strangely. "Hardly."
"But surely they explained a matter as simple as that,
these priests of yours? Nothing at all in comparison to the
complexity of even myself, for instance."
The man could not understand the other's insistence.
"Surely you know as well as I that it is an area where even
our greatest mages are not well versed."
"True. Yet once you, yourself, believed that the wind
came from the mouth of a snoring giant who slumbers far
to the west, did you not?"
It was the duke's turn to shrug. "Merely a story for
chil—" he stopped abruptly. "Clever," he acknowledged after
a moment. "You are clever, my lord." The man would
not forget.
The demon accepted the compliment as his due. "The
game awaits. What is your pleasure?"
The man turned his back on the other and went to one
knee. Crossing himself, he prayed long for guidance.
After a polite interval of silence, the satan asked with
only a trace of sardonicism in its voice, "What consequences
can you report?"
"I am strengthened," replied the other from his position.
"Have you received guidance?"
"Not knowingly."
"Then what is your decision?"
The man stood abruptly and turned. "To accept your
challenge, in the name of the Father, the Son and the
Holy Ghost. Right must triumph."
The apparition merely smiled, and gestured toward the
waiting table. To be continued next month

by Bill Cowie
I remember last April very well. I couldn't wait to get
done with finals, especially with all that warm weather we
were having. But, as luck would have it, the very day of my
last exam the weather turned cold and rainy, and it stayed
that way for weeks. I should have known right then that
it was going to be a long summer.
After several weeks of filling out applications at the un-
employment office, I had received no results and was get-
ting rather discouraged. Then one Saturday morning I was
brutally awakened from my blissful slumber by a ringing
telephone. Looking at the clock, I noticed it was only 8:30
am, and I wondered who would be calling at such an ungod-
ly hour on a Saturday morning.
Still half asleep, I stumbled down the hall and picked up
the phone.
"Hello?"
"Is this William Cowie?"
"Uh . .. yes it is," I replied, still a bit foggy.
"I'm calling from the Chrysler Corporation," the voice
said. "You are already a half hour late. Are you planning on
coming in this morning?"
"Uh . .. half... what?" I stammered.
"Didn't you receive our telegram?"
"Telegram ..."
"Mr. Cowie," the voice said, growing somewhat per-
turbed, "you filled out an application to work at this
plant, didn't you?"
"Uh, yes ma'am."
"Are you still interested in working here?"
"Yes ma'am."
"How soon can you be here for an interview?"
"How about an hour?" I replied.
"That will be fine. Come in the Bismarck gate and go to
the employment office, window A.
"Right," I said and hung up.
"Let's see," I thought. "That was Gate A, go to Bis-
marck office ..."
A half hour later I found myself driving into Detroit.
After wandering around for 15 minutes, looking for Bis-
marck Street and Gate A, I finally stumbled onto one of
the plant gates. With directions from one of the guards, I
eventually found the employment office. As I walked
through the door, I was greeted with a rather unpleasant
surprise. There must have been 200 people there, just sit-
ting on wooden benches with bored looks on their faces.
I didn't know how many people were being hired, but with
200 people in line ahead of me, my chances of getting a
job were not looking good. Nevertheless I zig-zagged my
way through the mass of bodies and took a seat on one of
the benches.
I soon found out that this company screens prospec-
tive employees the same way they build cars, using an as-
sembly line process. It goes something like this:
Fill out some forms, proceed to the next station, get in
line, and wait. After some time, get called to another win-
dow and have a brief talk with an interviewer. Go to the
medical room, get in line, and wait. The first nurse checks
your blood pressure. Go to the next station, get in line, and
wait. The next nurse checks your eyes. Go to the next sta-
tion, get in line, and wait. The next nurse checks your
ears. Go to the next station, get in line, and wait.
After several hours of this, most of which was spent
waiting in line, I had seen three interviewers, six nurses,
two doctors, a secretary, and the Playboy Playmate of the
Year (the latter due to the fact that I had dozed off at one
of the stations.) I ended up right where I started out, sitting
on a hard bench in front of window A. By this time I was
beginning to think I was having one of those crazy dreams.
After all, the last thing I remembered was getting into bed
on a Friday night....
Just about the time the wooden bench was becoming un-
bearable, the man at window A called my name again.
When I reached the window, the information came rapid-
fire.
"You start Monday morning at 7:00 am; be here at 6:30
so we can assign you to your work station. Your depart-
ment is 6190, your security badge number is 4142. Your
base pay is $5.42 per hour, cost of "living allowance is
$1.28, union dues are $14.37 per month, and you'll get a
25-cent raise after one month."
My head was spinning with numbers.
"Sign here, here, here, and here," he said, pushing a
22
Michigan Technic


six page contract in front of me, half of which was in fine
print. Once that was taken care of, I was free to go. But, by
force of habit, I once again took a seat and resumed wait-
ing. After all, I was getting in some good practice for get-
ting football tickets in September.
Driving home, the numbers started running through my
head. S5.42 ... $1.28 ... $0.25 . . . darn, I wish I had my
calculator. Well, anyway, it sounded like good money,
somehwere around $7/hour. Then the bad news suddenly
sunk in. "6:30!! Did he say 6:30 in the morning?" The
worst was yet to come. Half hour to get to work, plus 45
minutes to get ready. That means I have to get up at 5:00.
If I want eight hours of sleep that means in bed by ...
darn, that calculator is never around when you need it.
Let's see, that makes it ... 9:00! That's 9:00 in the after-
noon! How can I possibly get to sleep at 9:00 in the after-
noon? It doesn't even get dark outside until 10:00!
When I arrived at home I was still debating whether I
really wanted the job. 5:00 in the morning? But a little
voice kept reminding me: $7 an hour, $7 an hour, $7 an
hour . . .
"Did you get the job?" my mom asked as I walked into
the house.
"Seven dol—uh, I mean, yeah, Ma, I start Monday," I re-
plied.
"That's wonderful! By the way," she remarked, pick-
ing up an envelope, "while you were gone, this telegram
came for you."

The Calculator Ball scheduled for November 12 and
sponsored by the Engineering Council is an attempt to re-
vive a twenty-seven year tradition in the College of Engin-
eering. First initiated in 1929, the "Slide Rule Dance,"
whose name has obviously been modified to suit the cal-
culators of the seventies, was continually one of the most
well-known, well-attended, inexpensive social events of the
year. In the old days, the dance was strictly formal, with
the engineers in tuxes and their dates in strapless taffeta.
The Grand March was led by the heads of the various de-

partments. After the war (World War II, that is), the formal-
ity of the dance was abandoned because of the cost. How-
ever, the women of the University still received "late per-
mission" to attend, as the dance usually lasted until 1 a.m.
Many of the top bands of the era were hired to play at
the Slide Rule Dance, such as the Casa Loma Orchestra from
New York in 1932, Vincent Lopez in 1939, Woody Her-
man in 1940, and Don Kenney and his orchestra in 1955.
Usually held at the Union or the League, the location of the
dance once degenerated to the now defunct Waterman
Gymnasium. The dance was patronized not only by stu-

The characteristic motifs of the Slide Rule Dance (af-
fectionately dubbed the Slip Stick Trot in its early years)
always included a gigantic slide rule, along with tremendous
T-squares, blue prints and revolving gears. And of course,
a large Technic seal, symbolic of its original co-sponsor.
The slide rule was usually the first article destroyed when
the dance was sabotaged by the lawyers, who regarded the
event as a frivolous attempt by the men (sorry girls, that's
the way it was) of the College to display their "culture".
There is even a record of a certain Professor Menefee who
was injured while assisting in the defense of the slide rule
in 1953. The problem seems to have been the fact that
the engineers always scheduled the Slide Rule Dance on
the same night as the lawyer's annual "Crease Dance", and
the lawyers felt (or perhaps knew) they were being up-
staged. In any case, the concurrent events always proved
to provide a good atmosphere for smoke bombs, excess
water, misplaced eggs and general pre-revolutionary rowdi-
ness. It is hoped that this November's Calculator Ball will
become as traditional in the College of Engineering as the
Slide Rule Dance of former years.

Big Rebound
by Greg Werth
On many campuses 1977 is being called "The Year of
the Big Rebound." What is the "Big Rebound"? No, it's
not Michigan basketball star Phil Hubbard grabbing a re-
bound in a big game. Instead, the "Big Rebound" generally
refers to the 41 percent increase, over last year, of job
offers to new graduates of four-year colleges. The College
Placement Council (CPC) reported on August 11, 1977 that
this year is the best year of the 1970's for job-hunting
graduates, with engineers on the top of the salary scale.
Overall the biggest breadwinners, for those with bachelor's
degrees, are those in petroleum engineering averaging
$1,512 a month. The salary survey of the CPC is based on
job offers, not acceptances, made to college students in
particular programs, during the normal job recruiting
period, September to June.
The "Big Rebound" is not solely characterized by the
results reported by the CPC. The optimism of the most
recent annual Endicott survey and a $41 billion increase in
research and development spending both reemphasize the
CPC report. As might be expected, the "Big Rebound" is
being fueled by substantial increases in both engineering
enrollments, and federal funding for colleges. Even President
Carter's budget proposals for the fiscal year beginning in
October leave engineers little to jeer about as far as the
job market is concerned.
Endicott Survey
Frank Endicott's annual survey of expected demand for
new graduates predicted a 29 percent increase in demand
for engineers with B.S. degrees and a 10 percent increase
in demand for master's candidates in engineering over last
year. The report, conducted in November 1976, was
based on a survey of 215 "prominent" but not necessarily
giant employers. However, because companies are usually
optimistic about the future, the Endicott survey in past
years has tended to overestimate actual demand. Still, the
survey reports that 72 percent of the 182 firms responding
indicated an increase in their needs for bachelor's level
graduates this year, and 58 percent of 110 responses said they
planned to hire more new master's level graduates, too. In
the survey the 121 companies which planned to hire new
engineering graduates in 1977 indicated a need for 3,745
engineers at the bachelor's level and 597 at the master's
level. This represents about a tenth of all engineering
graduates available to enter the job market in 1977. The
report also indicated an expectation of modest growth in
the demand for MBA's with technical undergraduate
degrees.
Expected salaries are also on the rise, with companies
saying they expect to pay bachelor engineering graduates an
average of $1,242 per month, as compared to $1,165 paid
last year. Expected salaries for master's level engineers are
$1,430 (up from $1,353), $1,476 for MBA's with technical
undergraduate degrees (up from $1,388), and $1,315 for
other technical fields, up from $1,239 in 1976. At both the
bachelor's and master's level for new graduates, these
salaries remain substantially above the average for non-
technical fields by almost $200 per month.
October 1977

According to the National Science Foundation (NSF),
research and development (R&amp;D) spending by government
and industry is expected to total nearly $41 billion this
year. In current dollars, this would be an increase of 9
percent over 1976, but assuming a 5.5 percent inflation
rate for 1977, the increase is more of the order of 3 percent.
More R&amp;D spending means more jobs. Employment of
engineers and scientists engaged in R&amp;D grew 2 percent in
1976and is expected to grow again in 1977. The growth has
and will occur in federal employment, colleges, and univer-
sities, with the number of such personnel remaining constant
in industry. Total full-time R&amp;D personnel now stands at
around 542,000.
Enrollment and Federal Funding
Enrollment in engineering curriculums continues to
increase in contrast to the sharp drop in the early seven-
ties. According to the fall 1976 figures compiled by the
Engineering Manpower Commission of Engineers Joint
Council, freshmen enrollments are at their highest point
ever. Also, the proportion of women and minority-group
students continues to climb significantly.
More than $4.5 billion were allocated by federal
agencies to universities and colleges in 1975, according to
the NSF, with the percentage increase for engineering
outpacing all others. The 1975 totals were up 1 percent
in current dollars and followed a 17 percent jump in 1974.
These increases in engineering enrollment and federal
funding are both indirect constituents of the "Big Rebound".
Carter Budget
The Federal budget is an important item to consider as
an influence on the "Big Rebound" because there is, of
course, a direct correlation between the allocation of
money to certain areas and the corresponding availability of
jobs. At present it looks as if President Carter's budget will
not have a very big influence on the job market for engineers.
The highlights of the proposal include the following items:
Defense spending down 1/3 billion dollars
Energy and environmental funds up 4% (or $800 million)
Commerce and transportation up 4%
Community development funding may rise 27% to $10 billion
NASA budget unchanged
Also, the President proposed to drop 19 water projects
located mainly in the western states which would reduce
the figure further by $289 million in the coming fiscal year.
Some of these will most likely be restored in Congress, but
two of the biggest, the Central Arizona Project and The
Garrison Diversion in the Dakotas, are in trouble on
financial and environmental grounds. The removal of
these water projects may have a slight effect on the
engineering market in their respective regions, but it is
unlikely to effect the overall national job market.
There was worry about the possible detrimental after-
effects of President Carter's dumping of the B-1 bomber.
Initially the halt in B-1 bomber production-seemed to be
producing some dislocation among engineering personnel
but no drastic cutback in general. Several firms working on
avionics have expressed confidence that Cruise missile
work and the B-52 upgrading will more than make up
for the loss of the B-1. At present, the aerospace industry
is strong both in weapons work and in the civilian sectors,
thus contributing somewhat to the "Big Rebound."
"Big Rebound" at U of M
The "Big Rebound" at the engineering school here is
evident, as the demand for graduates has continued to
increase. This is substantiated by an increase of 14 percent
in the number of interview visits and 25 percent in the
number of requests received by mail. Additional evidence
includes a 40 percent increase in the number of salary
offers reported and a 7 percent increase in the average
dollar amount offers. These increases were highest for
Ph.D's. but increases were substantial for all degree levels.
Further evidence includes significant increases in inter-
viewing and salaries for summer employment, in the
number of plant visitations for regular employment, and
a large increase in the proportion of employees using
pre-selection services offered by the Engineering Placement
Office.
The aerospace, electronic, automotive, and mechanical
equipment industries all increased their campus recruiting,
while the chemical and petroleum industries decreased
somewhat. A substantial increase of visits by small com-
panies reflected a decrease in visits by large organizations.
For the future, indications are that recruiting activity
will continue to be strong, at least compared to the past
year. Employers will generally expect similar requirements,
particularly in design and operating functions, with some-
what less definite needs for research and development,
especially with the federal agencies. The recruiting of
women and minorities will undoubtedly still entail special
efforts.
The following charts, both applying to the engineering
school at U of M, show the starting salaries offered or
accepted, and the major employers.

J[j Years Ago
by Lee Benson
50 Years Ago
An article in the Technic of 50 years past described
a new wind tunnel that had just gone into operation in the
School of Engineering. No it wasn't on North Campus, but
(of all places) in the basement of the south wing of East
Engineering. It was hailed as being one of the "largest and
more powerful equipment for aerodynamic research in this
country." It replaced an older wind tunnel in West
Engineering that, because of velocities of only 40 mph, was
inadequate for research work." The new wind tunnel was
capable of 250 mph velocities and contained a "three-
component wire balance dynamometer, allowing measure-
ments of lift, drag, and lateral forces.
For all you seniors out there, job hunting is nothing
new as evidenced by an article entitled "Seniors, Jobs and
Other Things" which was written for the benefit of the
graduating seniors. Among some of the insights and ideas
given to future engineers were "good health, character,
judgement, efficiency, understanding of men, knowledge
and technique." Also stressed was setting one's sights on
future goals and working steadily (and slowly) towards
them. Sound familiar?
The editorial page featured a few paragraphs on the
metric system. Now don't laugh while thinking that the
metric system wasn't around in 1927. On no, it was there
all right and the editor had much to say about it. Besides
being convenient and standardized it far outweighed the
"clumsy antiquated system" still being used today. It was
discouraging for the editor to think that a "profession
which has advanced as far as engineering has advanced is
still retarding its own progress while in other countries
the more popular system was long ago adopted." Sounds
like something you might hear today.
Under the new inventions and ideas section were a
couple of clever gadgets. One was a portable air compressor
purported to "speed up road grading, street repairs, rock or
clay trenching, to a rate of accomplishment undreamt of
only a few years ago." Labor costs were supposedly cut in
half and job time was greatly reduced. Also new on the
scene was the Spooner Sound-Selective Switch that auto-
matically controlled night time airport lighting. The device
used engine noises from incoming airplanes to trigger a
switch that turned on the runway lights. A time limit was
employed to make sure that sporadic outside noises did
not accidentally activate the system. Nothing was said
about problems with local automotive noises, but I can
just envision some kid hacksawing off the family sedan's
muffler just to see the lights come on late some Saturday
night.
25 Years Ago
Included in the October 1952 issue of the Technic was
an article on the Engineering aspects of dinosaurs. We've
all seen paintings and replicas of these massive creatures but
how many of us stop and wonder how strong their bones
had to be in order to carry their great weight? Well, a Met-
allurgical Engineer thought about it and after visiting the
Hall of Evolution at the University Museum, he wrote down
some interesting facts that are usually overlooked in the
study of these animals. (Here are some of them.)
The Trachodon, a duck billed dinosaur, was typically
forty feet long and weighed around 15 tons. It stood on its
hind legs, yet was a good swimmer. For the average Trach-
odon this meant that each hind leg supported 15,000
pounds. However, the total bone area of the two main leg-
bones, the tibia and fibula, was only 24 inches square; thus
each bone had to withstand 625 pounds per square inch.
To illustrate just how impressive these figures were the
author compared the bones to contemporary materials in
use during 1952. "The compressive strength of wood ranges
from 1490 pounds per square inch for northern white
cedar to a maximum of 6450 pounds per square inch for air
dryed Douglas fir. Red oak is about 3500 and hickory about
4500. Concrete has a compressive strength of only 3120
pounds per square inch."
These figures become more impressive when one realizes
that the Trachodon was only a medium sized dinosaur.
Larger dinosaurs, although larger in proportion, had strong-
er bones. For example the 50 to 60 ton monsters of the
Jurassic Period had hind leg bone strength approaching
6000pounds per square inch. Certainly bones, whether din-
osaur or human, have to be considered an engineering
wonder.

Enjoy college
Education not only makes life more interesting but eventu-
ally brings more influence in society than can be expected
by those who have never bothered to read, study, listen, and
reflect on the pleasure and pain of it all. That includes influ-
ence as articulate citizens, customers, and investors.
Nevertheless, the truth in this may not be apparent right
out of college when a desire for steady income leads some
B.A.'s to come to us with a major in, say, political science or
Romance languages, seeking a start toward an executive
career. We listen and then ask, "Are you a born salesperson
and how can you prove it?"
In a way, that question reflects our own limitations. For a
person well educated in something other than technical
fields, it is usually only in sales that we can match qualifi-
cations to openings.
For you, who may have lost out on some of the pure
pleasure and sheer fun of college because of the kind of
technical courses you've had to grind away at, the choice can
be wider. Sales is just one possibility. You can also consider
research, development, design, manufacturing, and various
combinations of those. Decision-makers throughout our or-
ganization, in work often far removed from the subject mat-
ter of a technical curriculum, first attracted interest by their
success in coping with technical problems. Then, having
demonstrated an ability to lead, they exercised their option
to move on to broader responsibilities. That sort of choice,
for the outset of a career and later, is earned in courses
where quantitative thinking rather than personal opinion is
demanded.
This includes choice from among other technologically

Hold your breath for 60 seconds.
Try this little experiment and
chances are you'll find the last few sec-
onds unbearable.
That desperate, terrifying sensa-
tion is caused by a lack of oxygen and
an excess of carbon dioxide.
People with emphysema or other
lung diseases know the feeling well.
They live with it 24 hours a day.
Oxygen therapy can help many of
them. But it can also sentence them
to a bleak existence — living in fear,
bound to heavy, bulky oxygen tanks.
Union Carbide has developed a
portable oxygen system.
We call it the Oxygen Walker.
It's small enough to be carried on
a shoulder strap and weighs only 11
pounds full. Yet, incredibly, this
handy pack can supply over 1000 li-
ters of oxygen gas —enough for 8
hours or more, depending on individ-
ual flow rates.
Taking the Oxygen Walker with
them, patients are free to leave their
homes. Free to go walking, shopping,
fishing... many have even returned
to work.
The Oxygen Walker is only one
of the things we're doing with oxy-
gen. We supply more of it than any-
one else in the country. For steelmak-
ing, hospitals, wastewater treatment
and the chemical industry.
But, in a way, the Walker is the
most important use of our oxygen.
Because to the people who use it, it
is the breath of life.

Our search for energy begins with people.
America needs energy.
Its economy depends on it.
But to find it, Gulf needs minds.
Good minds.
The search for energy is not a simple
problem, and there will be no simple
solutions.
It demands people with a wide
variety of talents and skills. People with
imagination, determination, ingenuity,
and perseverance.
No other industry today offers such
an amazing diversity of complex, sophis-
ticated problems—problems that must
be solved today and problems that may
take 20 years to solve.
The energy business has changed.
It's no longer simply a matter of locating
and producing crude oil.
We need to search for it in strange,
difficult locations.
We need to develop energy resources
without destroying or polluting our
environment.
We need to go beyond known sources
of energy and explore alternatives such
as oil shale, geothermal power, tar sands,
coal, and solar power.
But first we need people.
Chemical and petroleum engineers,
geologists, geophysicists, geological
engineers, chemists, and mining engineers.
Gulf Oil Corporation has allocated
some $1,000,000,000 to be spent this year
on energy development programs in the
United States alone.
If you think you can contribute to
the search, see your college recruiter or
write Virgil Hanson, Human Resources

THIS MONTH'S TECHNIC
The leaves are gone, we've weathered midterms, and it
looks like we just might make it through the end of the
semester. (Thank goodness for Thanksgiving vacation!)
For those of you who want to get away from it all and
think it would be fun to live in outer space, this month
Bill Cowie brings you some insights on the finer points of
habitating in space. Last month Bill discussed the energy
aspects; how stations in space could be set up to collect and
transmit solar energy for use on Earth. In this half of the
article, "The Solar Solution and Space Habitats" he dis-
cusses how the stations would be set up for human living.
They would be completely self-supporting with separate
stations for living, manufacturing, and food production.
To tear down or not to tear down, that was the question
last year concerning Waterman Gymnasium. Faced with
large renovation expenses, the decision was finally made to
tear it down. Since the demolition occured in June, most
students did not get to see it come down. This month the
Technic features a Waterman pictorial with some shots of
it coming down along with a few older pictures. The
accompanying article giving a brief history of Waterman
and Barbour Gymnasiums was written by Editor Karen
Zahn.

The Alaskan pipeline has been regarded as the United
States' solution to dependency on foreign oil. However,
there have been problems in the design and building of the
pipeline. Kevin Bemis writes about the problems the pipe-
line has faced in his article "The Biography of a Pipeline".
Kevin is a sophomore in Electrical Engineering.
Have those i's and j's been getting you down lately?
You're not the only one. Maybe you possess latent hostilities
towards complex numbers starting from your understanding
of basic math from the first grade. Steve Stathos presents
solutions to these problems in his article "Complex Numbers
are Our Friends."
And finally, Karen Zahn discusses aspects of the engineer's
relationship to society based on articles appearing 25 and 50
years ago. Graphics credit goes again this month to John

The dream of a pipeline to transport the vast reserves
of oil in the Alaskan North has existed since the oil fields
were proven to exist. Since that time the dream has gone
through the planning stage, the construction stage, and the
problem stage. Now that the pipeline is complete new
problems have arisen and new controversies have begun. We
have the Alaskan oil. The problem is what do we do with it.
Before Alaska was a state there were hints of vast oil
fields in Alaska's frozen north. During the 1800's, Eskimos
told American and Russian whalers stories of black lakes
that burned. At the time nothing was done to investigate
these stories. The oil remained hidden until after Alaska
became the 49th state. Arctic investigations in 1968 by
Atlantic Richfield led to the discovery of vast areas with
potential oil fields. Prudhoe Bay, a 200 square mile area in
northernmost Alaska, is believed to have reserves totaling
9.6 billion barrels. Estimates of the total recoverable oil
reserves in Alaska range from 12 billion to 76.1 billion
barrels. Besides oil, Alaska is rich in natural gas, coal, and
minerals, including uranium. The quantities of oil found
were enormous, but there was no way to transport it from
northern Alaska to the continental United States. The
shipping routes north of the Bering Straits were impassible
during the winter. The only reasonable alternative to
shipping was to pump the oil from northern Alaska to a
southern port.
Congressional approval had to be obtained before a pipe-
line could be built. Plans for two different pipeline routes
were presented to Congress. The first plan was to build a
pipeline from the Prudhoe fields to the shipping port in
Valdez, a southern Alaskan port. This pipeline would be
800 miles long, stretching Alaska's entire length. A second
route, which was never adopted, called for a trans-Canadian
pipeline, pumping the oil directly from Alaska to U.S.
refineries in the Midwest. Both plans had their advantages
and disadvantages. The Trans-Alaskan route would be
cheaper. It would also be finished faster, a point in its
favor since the U.S. was feeling the pressure from foreign
oil dependency. It would not expose as much land to
environmental damage, and it would not involve an agree-
ment with Canada.
The Trans-Canadian route would take the oil to midwest
refineries, which were better equipped to handle the heavily
sulfured Alaskan oil. There was speculation that the west
coast refineries, which would receive the oil from a Trans-
Alaskan route, could not handle all of the oil Alaska could
produce. The oil companies involved in Alaskan oil repor-
ted that there would be no surplus problem. They reported
that west coast refineries could handle all of the Alaskan
oil. Thus the Trans-Alaskan route was accepted for mone-
tary and environmental reasons, but the environmentalists
were not satisfied with the proposed safety standards.
Environmental pressure led to the final design of the safest
pipeline in the nation. The pipeline was designed to protect
everything in the environment from the permafrost to
caribou migration routes.
The base of the pipeline is a 48 inch steel pipe. Eight
hundred miles of this pipe were shipped from Japanese mills
at a cost of $100 million. The pipe came in 40 foot sections
which were welded together to form 80 foot sections before
being transported into the field. Each of the welds was
x-rayed to check for defects before it was sent out to the
field operations.The pipe is covered by a fiberglass sheathing
and polyurethane panels. This insulation is necessary to
prevent the permafrost, permanently frozen earth, from the
thawing effects of the hot oil. The oil leaves the wells at
approximately 150 F., but cools down to 35 F. during
the trip to Valdez. The permafrost is protected to protect
the pipe. If the ground were to thaw, the moisture in the
soil would turn the ground to mud. This would cause the
vertical supports to fail under the weight of the pipe. If the
ground were to thaw around buried pipe and then refreeze,
the expanding ice could damage the pipe. The insulated
pipe is either suspended on vertical supports, placed at
November 1977


VI-
to 1800 foot intervals, or at some river crossings is
suspended from a suspension bridge. Piping that has to
travel under a river is weighted down by a concrete jacket
to prevent the bouyant oil-filled pipe from rising in the water.
The entire length of the pipe is designed to prevent
breakage due to thermal expansion and earthquakes. Thermal
expansion is allowed for by running the pipe in a zig-zag
pattern which gives the pipe room to expand. Earthquake
protection is designed into the vertical supports. The
connection between the pipe and the support is a shoe
mounting which allows for some position shifts. To insure
that any break in the pipe could be contained, 151 isolation
valves are placed along the length of the pipe. Many are
placed near rivers to minimize the effects of an oil spill.
The possible occurrences of leaks are constantly checked by
ultrasonic devices, pressure gages, and visual inspections.
Before the completion of the pipeline, the Alyeska
Pipeline Service Co., the builders of the pipeline, ran into a
great deal of trouble. There were accusations that the
pipeline did not meet its required safety standards. Alyeska
was accused of breaking safety regulations in order to finish
the pipeline as quickly as possible. These accusations seemed
sound to many people; after all the interest rate on the
money loaned to build the pipeline was $1% million per
day. Any delay in completion time was extremely costly.
Alyeska was also being politically pressured to deliver the
oil during a time when there was national concern about
the country's oil dependence. Alyeska was accused of faking
or missing pipe weld x-rays. Two investigation teams, one
ordered by President Ford, were sent to investigate the
accusations. The results of the investigations revealed that
the accusations were true. An audit of 30,800 field welds
disclosed that 3,995 welds were questionable. There were
154 duplicated or falsified x-rays and 298 x-rays were
missing. Of the questionable welds 1,000 were buried in
critical locations.
The restoration that followed the investigation helped
to raise the cost of the pipeline from its originally estimated
cost of $1.5 billion to nearly $7.7 billion. Every questionable
weld had to be rechecked and x-rayed again. The 1,000
buried welds had to be dug up, checked and then reburied.
After the double checking was completed only a few welds
were found to be truly questionable. The vast majority of
the welds, although there was no x-ray proof, were well
within safety standards.
Soon after the restoration was completed the entire
pipeline was completed, but before oil could flow some
final preparations were necessary. First the pipe underwent
a thorough cork cleaning. Cork cleaning consisted of
blowing small cork balls down the tube with a high pressur-
6

or other debris that were left in the pipe. Next a preparatory
test was necessary. Highly pressurized nitrogen was pumped
into sections of the pipe. The pressure was raised many
times above the required safety standards, and out of the
entire 800 miles only one section proved faulty. After this
section was repaired the pipeline was ready for oil to flow.
Turning on a valve to an 800 mile pipe was not the same
as turning on a kitchen faucet. The oil coming from the wells
was much hotter than the pipe, which was at the same
temperature as its frozen surroundings. To prevent thermal
shock, which would result if the oil was allowed to rush into
the pipe, the oil had to be pumped through the pipe slowly
to allow the pipe to heat up. This was accomplished by
placing a device called a pig into the pipe. The pig is a barbell
shaped device that fits snugly into the pipe. When the pig
is in the pipe, oil will be pushing it from one side and
compressed nitrogen will be holding it to a slow pace from
the other side. The pig will move through the pipe at 1%
m.p.h. for the entire length of the pipe. The entire journey
takes approximately 30 days. To let inspectors outside the
pipe know where the pig is, it is equipped with a radio
transmitter and a deformed wheel which makes a banging
sound against the inside wall of the pipe. Except for one
major accident the oil moved uneventfully through the
pipe. One of the pump stations did suffer an explosion and
fire which held up the oil flow for about a week while
repairs were being made.
Now that the Alaskan oil is flowing there is some
question over what to do with it. Despite earlier claims,
it turns out there is more Alaskan oil than west coast
refineries can handle. Presently only a few west coast
refineries can handle the high sulfur content in Alaskan oil.
Even if this problem could be solved by 1978 there would
still be an oil surplus. Of the 1.2 million barrels per day the
pipeline can produce, only 970,000 barrels per day could
be refined at west coast refineries. Why was this over-sight
made? The oil refineries did not feel that they could make
enough money from Alaskan oil to justify the cost of a
program to expand their present operations. Another
disadvantage to refining Alaskan oil is that it is much heavier
than oil which comes from other countries. Therefore, its
percentage of lighter petroleum products such as gasoline
and jet fuel, which are high profit items, is lower.
There are four solutions to the surplus oil problem;
however, each of the solutions has its own problems.
Restricting Alaskan oil flow is one solution. The entire
state of Alaska is against this solution. The pipeline has
already brought billions of dollars into the state, and if
oil production can be increased to 1.6 million barrels per
day by 1980, Alaska should bring in about $1 billion per
year in oil royalties. Any cutback in oil production cuts
back on the oil royalties Alaska is hoping for.
Another alternative is to ship the surplus oil through the
Panama Canal to refineries in the southern United States.
This plan would be acceptable but for two problems. It
would increase the price of the refined products, and there
is doubt that there are enough small tankers (supertankers
won't fit in the Canal) to handle the surplus.
A third alternative is to build a second pipeline which
would carry the surplus to refineries in the Midwest or South.
The problem with this solution is that it would cost too
much, and it could not be completed before Alaskan oil
starts reaching west coast ports.
The final suggestion, which will almost certainly never
materialize, is to exchange Alaskan oil with Japan for the
lighter grade oil they import. The cost of shipping would be
about the same. It is the cheapest solution and the most un-
popular. In addition, before approving the pipeline Congress
included the stipulation that Alaskan oil could not be sold
to foreign nations. It would take Congressional approval
and a Presidential order to undo this restriction. With our
present oil shortage, public opinion would never allow
a repeal of this regulation.
Presently it looks as if the oil will be transported
through the Canal until a second pipeline can be built.
Whatever plan is adopted, the final price for the use
of Alaskan oil will be high.

1894 -1977
by Karen Zahn
Returning students this fall noticed something definitely
strange in the vicinity of the Diag;a large open space. Then
the realization sunk in —Waterman and Barbour Gymnasiums
were gone. The efforts of several groups of students had only
managed to delay the destruction a year. Preservation of the
aged buildings would be too costly was the reason given for
the demolition. The razing was begun in the early part of
June, and the structure was down in a few days.
Since most students see fit to spend their summers in
places other than Ann Arbor, most of us did not get to
witness the demolition. For many students, particularly
upperclasspersons, Waterman holds vivid memories. Before the
Central Campusand North CampusBuildings were completed,
the IM Building and Waterman were about the only available
sites for student athletic activity. And those of us who were
around before the advent of CRISP certainly remember the
hassle of trying to register for classes in Waterman
Gymnasium.
Throughout its 83-year history Waterman has seen more
than registrations and overworked students slogging around
its track. Parties, drills, celebrations, and graduations took
place within its walls, and it was even used as a hospital.
It began as a dream of the student body back in the
late 1860's. Interest in athletics and in a gymnasium in
particular was demonstrated when 250 students signed a
petition in the fall of 1868 indicating their desire for a
gymnasium to be built. The proposal was presented to the
Regents by President Haven that year, but no action was
taken until a year later, in the fall of 1869. It was referred
to the faculty who killed it by suggesting that the monies
be used instead for the establishment of a hygiene and
physical culture program. In 1878 an organization called the
Athletic Association of the University began to raise
money for a gymnasium. The account was turned over to
the University in 1894, at which time it contained a total
of $6,000.
The real impetus forthebuildingof Waterman Gymnasium
came in 1891 when Joshua Waterman, a Detroit real-estate
owner gave $20,000 towards the construction of a gymna-
sium with the stipulation that another $20,000 be raised to
supplement it. Faculty and students responded to the
challenge rather quickly, raising the additional $20,000 in
only a few months. The Regents gave their approval to
plans calling for a construction cost of about $60,000. Work
was begun on the building which was located on the
northeast corner of campus where the old cricket grounds
had been. Construction was slow and wasn't finished until
the summer of 1894. The total cost was $65,100.
Around the time that the money was being raised for
Waterman Gymnasium, a strong campaign for a gymnasium
for women was being undertaken by the Women's League.
Private donors raised $21,000 during the period from 1892 to
1897 to which the Regents added about $20,000 to bring the
total to the final cost of $41,300. The women's gym was built
adjacent to Waterman Gymnasium and was completed in
1896. It was named Barbour Gymnasium in honor of
Regent Levi Barbour who donated land in Detroit to the
University to aid in the cost of the construction of the
building.
The students responded with enthusiasm to their new
gymnasiums, and throughout the years they have seen use
for many activities other than athletics. They were fre-
quently used for social events. University Senate receptions
and the annual Junior Hop and numerous other dances were
held in Waterman Gymnasium. In 1905 it was the site of a
student carnival.

During World War I, Waterman was turned into a barracks
for the use of SATC (the Students Army Training Corps)
who drilled and lived there. The influenza epidemic, which
struck Ann Arbor in September of 1918, saw Waterman and
Barbour Gymnasiums turned into a hospital. More recent-
ly Waterman had been used for class registration, until
CRISP was developed.
With the completion of the Central Campus and North
Campus Recreation Buildings it became evident that the
upkeep of an old, practically useless building would be a
financial burden on the University, who was trying to
cut back its spending. A proposal was made to raze
Waterman and Barbour Gymnasiums. When the realization
of the proposal sunk in, there was a flurry of protest. Groups
were organized to "save Waterman" and the Michigan Student
Assembly (MSA) asked the Regents to consider the
gymnasiums for use as a student center to provide badly
needed space for student activity groups. However, the
Regents decided last spring that to renovate the buildings
would be more expensive than to build a new building.
The original motion to tear down the buildings was con-
firmed.
The razing took place during the first weeks in June and
was finished quickly. By the time the students returned in
September the buildings were completely gone. An addition
to the chemistry building is possible when and if funds are
provided. For now the grassy open space will remain
indefinitely.

A well-equipped gymnasium is . . . much needed. It
would not only contribute to the physical well-being of the
students, but would also confer indirectly both intellectual
and moral good. The health and consequently the intellectual
and moral vigor of not a few of our students suffers from
the lack of sufficient. . . exercise.
President Angell, 1879
On the subject of women's physical education classes in
1894-95:
For this instruction the women wore no special costume.
They dressed as freely as they dared, which for the gay
nineties meant ankle-length full skirts, tight waists, large
puffed sleeves, and high-button shoes. The windows of
Waterman Gymnasium were blinded, and no man save Mr.
Fitzpatrick (the instructor) was allowed in the building
during the mornings when the women were taking their
exercises. There were no showers but, in 1895, the Board
of Regents voted to place eighty lockers in teh building
'for the use of the women'.
. .. The purpose of the program carried on by Fitzpatrick
was to discipline the body through exercise and to
counteract the strain placed upon the women by intensive
study. To accomplish the purpose, marching, calisthenics,
and simple running and throwing games were introduced —
a typical physical training program for this period. Strenuous
activity had to be avoided since many of the women were
unaccustomed to physical exercise. There were no organized
team sports nor individual sports of any kind.

Waterman Gymnasium affords excellent opportunity
for all phases of gymnastic and indoor athletic activities.
The main floor is a rectangle 246 by 90 feet, with
truncated corners, allowing if desired a 75-yard straight
away sprinting track. There is also a dirt pit for jumping
and shot putting, covered by a trap door when not in use,
as well as equipment of the various kinds of appara tus usually
found in the best modern gymnasiums. Several smaller
rooms are devoted to administration, fencing, boxing, and
other special purposes, while the basement is given to
baths, lockers, handball, shot put, and a rifle range . . . A
gallery makes room for an elliptical running track, ten laps
to the mile.
Before beginning gymnasium work each student receives
a thorough physical examination, in order to eliminate
those who are not physically capable of doing the regular
class work. Every student examined is measured and
furnished with an anthropometric chart, which affords a
comparison of his own measurements with those of the
average student and reveals for correction any abnormality
that may be present. A second measurement is made after
the class work is finished, in order to note what changes
have taken place.

"... of course, in the most general case," continued
the professor, "the variable X in this equation can represent
a complex quantity." Our class acknowledged this statement
with a series of grunts, groans, and assorted barnyard
sounds. So verbose was our displeasure that, had I just
entered the room, I would have thought that we had just
been assigned to sample the meat loaf at West Quad. The
lecture continued despite the outburst, but afterwards I
couldn't help but wonder why the mere mention of
complex numbers was capable of exposing such latent
hostility. At first I thought our adverse reaction was due to
our relative unfamiliarity in working with complex numbers,
or more specifically, the imaginary part thereof. Outside
of class this type of mathematics is about as useful as lint.
Imaginary numbers are simply not applicable in everyday
business transactions such as purchasinggroceries or balancing
checkbooks, (right, Bert?) Therefore, it stands to reason
that we might be a bit apprehensive in using them on
those occasions when they are not only appropriate but
essential. This explanation seemed reasonable, although
deep down I knew that what was demonstrated in class was
not "a bit of apprehension." It was pure hate.
It wasn't until several weeks later that I realized the
actual reason behind our abhorrence of imaginary numbers.
We disdain working with them because we have been
subconsciously influenced, throughout our lives, to believe
that imaginary numbers are in some way inferior to other
numbers. The very names mathematicians have assigned to
the different classes of numbers has contributed significantly
to this end. Think about it. Early in our mathematical
careers, we were introduced to the "natural" numbers. Now
what could be more wholesome? No preservatives or
stabilizers, just 100% "natural numbers". They occupied
that very special place in our lives between whole milk
and the peanut butter &amp; jelly sandwich. How easily we
accepted them into our lives. Next we encountered the
"rational numbers", so named because they represented the
ratio of two numbers. Unfortunately, the word "rational"
also carried the connotation of "reasonableness". It was as
if these numbers had a little extra going for them in their
numerators. No wonder we had no misgivings about
accepting them. Somewhat later we met the "real" numbers
and we thought, "This is finally it". Even though philoso-
phers have been debating the essence of reality since the
beginning of time, with little yet resolved, one thing was
clear. When all questions concerning this matter were
ultimately resolved, we could rest assured that the "real"
numbers would be a part of that answer. How could we
fail to accept such a cornerstone of our universe.
Then, a year or two later, a petite white haired lady
went to the blackboard and wrote:
z=x+iy
We were told that "z" was a complex number consisting of
a real number "x" and an imaginary number "iy". Quickly
we sat the old woman down and brought her a glass of
water, but this didn't help. She still maintained that "iy"
was an imaginary number. We decided to play along in the
hope that this "imaginary" number would soon disappear.
We asked why "iy" was called imaginary and were told
that i=\/-1, which meant that iy=\/-y. It was called imaginary
because it had no physical significance. To illustrate this,
she directed our attention to the five apples on her desk,
(this lady hated doctors.) and asked us what "i5" apples
would look like. We replied that we did not know, which
somehow confirmed her theory that imaginary numbers
have no physical significance. It also seemed to confirm
our growing belief that imaginary numbers weren't worth
studying, but alas, they were required.
Okay, maybe it didn't happen quite that way, but
imaginary numbers were presented to us as slightly mystical
quantities, divorced from reality and devoid of meaning.
This, of course, is absurd! Imaginary numbers are every bit
as mathematically valid as real numbers. If interpreted
correctly they also can be physically significant, otherwise
they would indeed be useless. Today we know that those
5i apples we couldn't explain before represent five apples
advanced in phase by 90 . Perhaps in another five years
or so, we'll even know what that means. We must keep in
mind that all numbers are but logical constructs created
by men so that our thoughts can be generalized without
loss of consistency. Let us not fall victim to the "semantic
trap" that mathematicians have unintentionally set for us.
Complex numbers are our friends. Now that we realize
that our hatred of them is uncalled for, perhaps we can
eliminate it or at least transfer that hatred to a more
deserving entity, like convolution!

and
Space Habitats
by Bill Cowie
Last month the mechanistics of space stations and
settlements were discussed; how and where they would be
built, how solar energy would be collected in space and
transferred to earth, and so on. This month, let's look at
what it would be like to live and work in a settlement at L5,
and the purpose behind building habitats in outer space.
Imagine the options available if we were the ones to
design the new space habitats. Leaving the earth behind,
with its dirty air and fouled water, we have the opportunity
to make a fresh start. We could design any type of land-
scape, with hills and trees and small rivers and lakes of
clean water. The climate, too, could be of our choosing.
We may decide we want a tropical Hawaiian climate for our
habitat, with mild weather the year around. Others, of
course, might prefer a cooler climate, wkh the variety of
the changing seasons. But the point is the choice would
be ours, and the possibilities would be limited only by
our imaginations. Indeed, the habitats could be customized
to our likings, and could be made at least as nice as the
most beautiful places on earth. And they could continue
to be nice indefinitely, since a major source of contamina-
tion, heavy industry, will be outside the enclosed world, at
a nearby station of its own. Let's see how life in such a
world would compare to that on earth.
The major change of living in space habitats would be
the separation of the three basic functions: living, .industry,
and agriculture. Each of these functions would be carried
out in a separate enclosed area of its own. This way, each
area could be optimized to best suit the function being
carried on within. Let's look at each of these 3 functions
separately to see how this could be accomplished.
Living
The living areas themselves, as discussed above, could
have whatever climate the inhabitants prefer. They would
be the residential areas, set aside for eating, sleeping.
Part II
recreation, and entertainment. The habitats themselves
would be large structures of roughly cylindrical shape. The
inside walls could be lined with a 5 foot layer of industrial
slag from the nearby industrial stations. This would then
be topped off with a foot or so of lunar soil to which
fertilizer had been added. This combination would provide
a foundation for the lakes, trees and grass, and would also
serve as a shield to protect the inhabitants from dangerous
solar radiation. Mirrors would be used to reflect sunlight
into the habitats. This way, the time of sunrise and sunset
could be controlled by controlling these external mirrors.
Based on present day structural technology, a typical
habitat might be 3 or 4 miles in diameter and 10 or 20 miles
long. It would thus have a land area of 100 to 250 square
miles and perhaps a population of several million. A
reasonable comparison would be the size of the city of
Detroit and its surrounding suburbs. But since there would
be no industry present, the same population could be
spread out over a larger area.
These large habitats would be rotated about their own
axes, so that the people and other living things inside them
would experience an apparent gravity. In the case of our
typical habitat, a rate of one rotation every 2 minutes
would produce an earth-normal gravity on the ground,
that is, at the surface of the habitat. But as you move
upward toward the central axis - which you would do, for
instance, if you went mountain-climbing or flying in a
glider - you would experience an entirely new dimension
which is unavailable on earth. As you move toward the
axis of a rotating body, the centripital acceleration dimin-
shes, and it vanishes when you reach the axis. Since it is
this centripital acceleration which is the source of the
"gravity" you feel, you now become weightless! As you
descend your weight steadily increases, and it returns to
earth-normal when you reach the valley floor. So you now
have your choice of any gravity you like!
16

a basketball court could be built at the elevation where
gravity is 1/3 normal, and the hoops could be raised to
15 feet. Then any ordinary person could glide through the
air and put on a performance that would put Julius Erving
to shame. Meanwhile, at 1/10 gravity, a ballet company
could perform with grace and beauty unmatchable any-
where on earth. Entirely new sports could be invented,
perhaps even games played in three dimensions. Indeed, the
list could go on and on, once again limited only by the
range of human imagination.
Industry
The industrial sites would be space stations located a few
miles from the habitats. Commuting to and from work would
be quite a unique experience at first. A small passenger
vehicle, perhaps the size of a bus, would be attached to
the outside of the wall of the habitat. Since the habitat
is constantly rotating, the vehicle has a constant tangential
speed of about 500 miles per hour in the case of our typical
habitat. Passengers would get in the vehicle, and at precisely
the right instant, the vehicle would be released and would
travel tangentially away from the habitat in the direction
of the industrial station. After only a few minutes of
unpowered, weightless travel through free space, the
vehicle and passengers would arrive at the industrial station.
At first, the industrial stations would be primarily used
for processing metals and other materials from the soil
brought from the moon and for building the large Solar
Satellite Power Stations which would collect solar energy
and transmit it to earth. Both of these operations can be

needed for processing metals can be obtained simply and
inexpensively by erecting a large parabolic mirror aimed at
the Sun. The huge structures being assembled for the power
stations could be assembled in a station that is rotating
very slowly. Although they are quite massive, the structures
will have very little weight, and can thus be moved and
assembled without massive bearing and supporting struc-
tures.
Since industries in space would necessarily be very
heavily capitalized, it would probably be necessary to have
3 shifts of workers so that the equipment could be run
constantly. Since the individual habitats control the time of
their own sunrise and sunset, it would be possible to have
workers from 3 different settlements all work at the same
plant at different times. These 3 settlements would purposely
set their respective times of day such that they would be
8 hours out of phase with each other. This way the workers
from each habitat would go to work when it is daytime for
them, and no one would have to work the night shift.
Agriculture
Most of the food for the inhabitants of a space settlement
would be grown outside the habitat itself. There still could
be backyard gardens grown inside the habitat by those
residents who enjoy gardening. But the major crops, con-
sumed by both the people and livestock, would be grown in
(relatively) small enclosed modules. One current proposal
THE L5 SOCIETY
The L5 Society is a non-profit organization
whose purpose is to inform the general public
about the concept of the humanization of space,
and to generate interest in the idea. I visited
the national headquarters of the L5 Society
in Tucson, Arizona, and found the people there
very willing to answer my questions and supply
me with plenty of information. They distribute
a monthly newsletter with news and information
on recent developments in this concept. Their
membership is open, and they encourage anyone
interested to join their organization. More
information can be obtained by writing to:

There is also a local chapter of the L5 Society
here in Ann Arbor. They meet at 7:00 on
Tuesday evenings in room 4203 of the Michigan
Union. Their membership is also open to anyone
interested. More information can be obtained by
contacting Rand Sinberg.

Society, particularly Chuck Bernard, for help

calls for cylindrical-shaped modules connected together in
a large ring near the endcap of the habitat. (See figure 1).
Each will have a land area of about one square mile, and an
environment optimized to best suit the crops growing
inside. Our typical habitat of several million people could
be fed by 100 of these agricultural cylinders.
Large mirrors would again be used to reflect sunlight
into the agricultural areas. "The day-length will be controlled
in an inexpensive way, by drawing an aluminum-foil shade
... across the front of the mirrors to close off the sunlight.''^
The climate of each cylinder could also be independently
controlled. It would then be possible to designate some of
the cylinders for only annual crops, such as wheat, corn,
potatoes, vegetables, etc. These cylinders would be kept at a
constant spring-summer climate, and as soon as one crop is
harvested, a new crop could be planted in its place. This
way, the land could be used year around with 3, or
possibly 4, growing seasons every year. The remaining
cylinders would be used to grow perennial crops, such as
fruits and berries. The controlled climate of these cylinders
could be chronologically staggered, with winter in some,
spring in others, and so on. This way, many seasonal crops
normally available only during a short period of the year on
earth would be available throughout the year, including the
winter!
The Purpose
When looking at this plan of settling and industrializing
space, it is inevitable that the question is raised: "Why?"
An immediate answer would be: "To solve the energy
crisis". But most of the people I talked with, including
members of the L5 Society, (see inset) would consider this
to be a superficial answer. Instead, they talk about expanding
human options, and relieving impending problems, such as
overpopulation and pollution, on an overburdened earth.
The man who originally conceived this idea, Princeton
physicist Dr. Gerard O'Neill, explains his purpose in his
book The High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space. He sets
forth four long-term goals relative to space habitation.2
1. Ending hunger and poverty for all human beings.
2. Finding high-quality living space for a world popula-
tion which will double within forty years, and
triple within another thirty, even if optimistic esti-
mates of low-growth rate are realized.
3. Achieving population control without war, famine,
dictatorship, or coercion.
4. Increasing individual freedom and the range of options
available to every human being.
To reach these goals, O'Neill believes we will need the
following:^
1. Unlimited low-cost energy, available to everyone
rather than just those nations favored with large
reserves of fossil or nuclear fuels.
2. Unlimited new lands, to provide living space of
higher quality than that now possessed by most of
the human race.
3. An unlimited materials source, available without
stealing, killing, or polluting.

Figure 1 • Artist's conception of the exterior of a space community. Each of the large cylinders is about 4 miles in diameter and 20
miles long. One would be the residential habitat, the other would be an industrial station. (Note the long, thin mirrors that
reflect sunlight into the cylinders.) The smaller cylinders, ringing the ends, are the agricultural areas. Each one has a land area of
about one square mile, and a particular climate based on the crops being gro wn inside. This illustrates ho w the 3 human functions
of living, agriculture, and industry can be carried on separately and individually within a few miles of each other.

space is a viable possibility for meeting these needs and
reaching these goals.
But O'Neill also admits that this will not offer the
solution to all human problems. "I offer no Utopia," he
cautions. "Man . . . has always within him the capacity for
evil as well as good."4 Rather, his plan describes "an
environment which combines with its efficiencies and its
practicality, opportunities for increasing the options, the
pleasures, and the freedoms of individual human beings."5
The Other Side
Of course, not everyone agrees that this plan can accom-
plish what O'Neill feels is possible. But I think it is signifi-
cant that in researching this subject, I was unable to find
anyone who had seriously studied O'Neill's ideas and come
up with any major criticisms or flaws. Most of the criticism
I found was merely superficial, made by people who did not
really understand the proposals. But this is understandable -
after all, at first glance this does look more like science-
fiction than a viable proposal backed up by serious study.
Nevertheless, there were several questions raised.
One such question involves one of the most vital aspects
of O'Neill's plan - that of cost. This issue is very critical
because of the large initial investment that will be needed
(about $200 billion), and the relatively long time it would
take before the whole development can pay for itself
(around 25years). There were several issues raised along this
line:
1. How should this project be capitalized? By govern-
ment(s) or private industry, or a combination of
the two?
2. How will it be determined which government(s) and/or
corporations will provide this investment? And will the
ones who supply the money be allowed to determine
who will receive the energy from space?
3. What if there are unforseen costs, or cost overruns?
How will more money be obtained?
Beyond the issue of economics, there are other questions.
For instance, how would a country which is highly depen-
dent on solar satellite power protect its satellites from
attack by another country in a time of war? After all,
these stations are very vulnerable out in space, orbiting
the earth, especially since it was recently brought to light
that both the United States and the Soviet Union are now
developing the means for destroying each other's intelligence
and spy satellites. Other critics point to O'Neill's concept
of closed ecosystems, both in the living and agricultural
areas. They are doubtful that the delicate balance necessary
to sustain such a system can be reproduced artificially.
And finally, there is a very fundamental criticism.
Considering how much we as human beings do not know
about ourselves and our world, is it not possible that all our
projections and studies will indicate that we should go ahead
with this project, while unforseeable to us, there lurks a
serious, and possibly catastrophic danger? This possibility
does exist, although one can only guess in what form such a
danger might appear. But as an example, it was pointed out
that we used flourocarbon compounds for several decades
before realizing the possible long-term hazards that they
may cause.
So it would be impossible to say with any real assurance
that this plan is or is not possible at this point in time.
There are still many problems to be solved and many
questions to be answered. But it is my hope that much
more research will be carried out in the near future. I
believe that this plan holds a great deal of potential, and
we can only deprive ourselves of many options by ignoring
it. It is true that many uncertainties do exist. Yet
throughout history, mankind has not let the fear of the
unknown dampen his adventuresome spirit. And perhaps
someday, mankind may look back on the end of this
century - as we now look back on the age of Columbus and
Vespucci - and see the same unquenchable spirit of adven-
ture and discovery which leads to a better and more pros-
perous new world.

by David K. Henrickson
As promised, here is the second installment of the 1977
Cooley Essay Contest First Prize Winner, a short story
entitled Nature of the Game. In the first half, the duke,
a man of strong spiritual faith, has died while crossing the
desert with his horse. He finds himself confronted by the
devil who suggests playing a game of chess with him in
order to determine his place in the world of the dead. Be it
heaven, or hell... .
The game began.
To the duke's surprise he found himself from the very
first in uncontested possession of the offensive. Inexplicably
his center pawns were allowed to take and hold -the dominant
positions in the middle of the field; while his primary
pieces were developed and positioned for a long, deliberate
attack without obstruction or harassment. The creature
opposite him seemed willing to bide its time, deploying its
forces with quick, careless gestures which nonetheless
revealed it to be a master of the game.
Despite the certainty of its moves the demon might
almost have been unaware of the game set out before it
and the significance its outcome held. Rather the creature
seemed to find the man incredibly compelling, devouring
each and every aspect of his behavior with those empty,
ungiving sockets. The mortal, for very mortal he still felt,
tried to ignore that gaze as he kept his own attention fast
to the board, examining and then re-examining each move
to be made.
The other revealed no evidence of impatience at this
tedious procedure, or indicated that it was aware of the
passing of time at all. It merely sat and stared, stirring
1977 Cooley Essay Contest First Prizewinner
only to counter each new move by the duke without
pause when it was made, as if it anticipated every move in
advance. Then it would grow still again until the next time.
The man suspected that the apparition behaved so merely
to savor his own reaction, and that it was laughing at him
from somewhere deep within the darkness of its eyes.
As for the man's own mental state, it was as if he were
in a dream. Not in the sense that he was detached from his
emotions, just the opposite, he had never been so coldly
terrified in his life .... In his life, he smiled to himself at
the phrase, perhaps that was part of the answer. While
his emotions appeared to have remained the same, his
outlook on the world which decided those emotions had
definitely changed. Though he still felt capable of feeling
such things as doubt, uncertainty, skepticism, despite the
bizarreness of his situation he could see no reason to feel
so. Just as he could not doubt that he was dead, so he was
not incredulous at finding himself matched in an unspoken
and undefined battle against Satan, himself, for the possession
of his soul. Either he had lost his sense of judgement upon
dying, or had acquired something which surpassed it. As if
he had been given the keen nose of an animal without
knowing it, he was certain of things when there was no
normal reason to be so.
That it was a battle, and a serious one, that he was
engaged in he was sure of; despite the fantastic appearance
it took on. He sensed that winning this game of chess might
be the most important victory he would ever achieve.
Therefore he would win it, he must.
The duke, in the act of advancing a bishop, paused with
November 1977
21


question concerning the true purpose of the game.
"What do you hope to accomplish with all this?"
referring to the game with a motion of his hand. "I can
almost believe that I am still out wandering in the desert with
my wits taken from me."
The demon shrugged as if indifferent, but when it
saw that the man was intent upon an answer and showed no
signs of resuming the game, it seemed to reconsider and
shrugged again.
"Very well, I will explain. Though you will not truly
understand," giving the man a chillingly knowing grin. "Until
it's too late." It paused, gathering its thoughts.
"Consider our concept of the world as a painting which
we create in our minds. It contains all that we believe about
the world: what we have seen and felt, what we have
experienced or learned, what we have reasoned or concluded
on our own. All the things which have reached in from the
outside world and left their impression with us, these form
our picture of the world; how we actually see it. In short,
our idea or conception of the world represents to each of us
separately that world which exists around all of us."
The duke gathered his weathered eyebrows in thought.
While no priest or scholar he considered himself a man of
some learning, yet he had never heard the like of this idea
before. It was disturbing in its implications and so uncom-
fortable, but it could not be denied that it was an idea
which contained merit.
"If this is true," the duke said slowly, still struggling
with this revolutionary concept. "Then we must each
paint a different picture."
"Excellent!"
"But if we each see a different world," the words
slowed and then stopped as the man sensed but could not
see the pitfall ahead. "Then what does it actually look
like? Where is the truth?"
"Somewhere always in between," the demon interjected
smoothly, seeking to steer the man past this dangerous
ground. "But that is not my point," it said. "You wished
to know the meaning of the game."
"Yes." The man straightened with a start, cursing
himself for letting this enemy distract him so effortlessly.
As if anew he looked into that face and saw the evil appear
there as fat would rise to the surface of a boiling pot. He
shuddered and looked away. This . .. thing was unholy, its
powers of deception monstrous. How quickly, deeply, it
had lulled him. Despite his resolve, he had sat there and
listened like a student to his teacher.
The demon seamed to be unaware of this inner turmoil
within the man. "Very well. It is still a matter of this
representation. You use it constantly and are unaware of it.
As a warrior you are familiar with maps, this is a perfect
example of representation. The map describes the route you
take, but it is not the actual ground over which you travel.
After all, it is only a piece of parchment. The word you
speak is not the thought in your mind, it only represents
it. Your painting of the world which is in your mind is not
the world itself, only your conception of it.
This is the nature of the game, it represents the battle
between you and I. If I defeat you at this play of chess,
then you are mine. If by some means you should win, then I
have no power over you. Concentrate on the game, its
result is everything."
The man hesitated, there was something not right about
what the demon had just said. But an instant later the doubt
was swept away, even the deadly cold which seemed to have
settled permanently into his bones was forgotten. "I am to
spend eternity in Heaven or Hell, even over the will of God?"
The creature only smiled its thin, cruel smile at this
impudence. "This is my domain and whatever I will to be,
is. Even, on occasion, against the will of your god; which
this," it added significantly. "Is not."
This last hit the duke like a blow. It was true, he thought,
he would not be here if it were not the Will of God. The
knowledge chastened him like fire and yet at the same time
he was exulted. He was being tested! Unheedful of the
demon he crossed himself and prayed forgiveness for his
weakness and doubt. He would not fail.
"So the game is everything?" The rekindled knowledge
that his Lord was watching over him gave the man the
strength and courage to match the other's assurance.
"Doubt it if you wish."
The man shook his head in denial. "I am bothered by
one thing though. Earlier you said that there was no need for
22

"There has been no change, both statements are correct.
Though the outcome of the game is inarguable, it is a match
you cannot possibly win. Therefore there is no reason to
actually play out the game. You have already lost."
"I cannot win?"
"Never," was the implacable reply.
"Strange," the man mused, at long last replacing the
bishop onto the playing board. He had finally managed to
crack the creature's defensive perimeter, the bishop's
advance was the first move in an offensive which would
drive like a wedge towards the other's king and victory.
For a minute he looked directly into those deep, orbless
pits. "At the moment I seem to be doing just that."
Immediately responding to the man's move with a
careless one of its own, the creature only smiled. And
waited.
The game continued on, and the hours passed.
Both players were truly excellent and made no mistakes,
perfectly matched it seemed. Yet as the game progressed the
advantage plainly rested with the duke's white host more
and more. The reason for this was not that the white
possessed and held the first move, though in a game of
such quality it might have been important had the strategies
been different; nor that the duke was slightly the better
player, if anything the opposite was true. Rather it was
simply that the black refused to attack, remaining stubbornly
on the defense; for some reason known only to the
creature, waiting for the white's well-considered offensive.
It took longer than the man would have imagined under
other circumstances, for the subtle weave and play of the
creature's defense was truly superb. He could only be
thankful that his opponent seemed content to bide his
time, as an attack of equal skill would have left the man
hard-pressed. And yet this very restraint made him uneasy,
as if he were missing some crucial point which would give
the other victory in the end. This was the only reason which
explained the creature's strategy, for no matter how master-
ful the defense, inevitably its flaw could be found and
exploited. Surely his adversary realized this, it had too.
Then what was its plan? The man searched and searched the
board even as he continued the attack, and found nothing.
The creature's face took on a mocking tone. Winning, the
man's unease grew.
"Mortal," mused the demon, staring thoughtfully at the
white queen on the board. "What if your faith were
suddenly to ... snap?"
For a minute the man did not seem to hear. "A
senseless question," was all that he responded finally. He
too studied the field, and his queen's position on it, intently.
Like the tip of a slender spear it was sunk deep into the
enemy's forces, a mere knight's move away from the black
heart of his opponent. While the white did not hold clear
domination over the field; it did press inward on the
numerically superior black; driving in shaft-like to furnish
power and support for the beseiging queen. And none of the
black one's forces were in position to harm that vital tip
as it paused to give the other a moment's grace. His earlier
unease had been unfounded. Soon, near impossibly, it
would be over. He would have won.
"Give me what answer you can. What if your faith were
to fail you now?"
"What if the world suddenly ceased to exist?" The man,
though he listened to the words, did not seriously consider
them. The demon was trying to distract him, but it would
do no good. He was too close now to make any mistake.
"It has, for you."
The man looked up from the board, straightened. "Admit
it, you cannot hope to beat me now. All your words have
come to nothing."
"Your move," the creature only said, as if suddenly
bored by the game.
"Can you not confess failure?"
"My words have not yet been tested. The game is not
yet over."
The man could not understand the other's blind confi-
dence. "But look at your position!" With a violent gesture
he indicated the hopeless position of the black king.
"Fool of a man," the demon's voice seethed with scorn.
"Did I not tell you that this game of chess was only a
representation? It merely reflects the real contest which
has been decided from the first. The final result of this
game must and will agree with that decision. One in which
you had no say."
"But why must I lose?" the man asked, his gaze narrow.
November 1977


He cannot afford to let you win. It would make you too
strong for comfort. Eventually you might prove as great
a threat as I. And together, what is there we might not do?
Such a possibility is something He cannot chance."
"I, a threat to the Lord Almighty, God in Heaven you
are twisted about! He is my Savior, my strength, my soul.
Can you be deaf, He is my God!" Silence so loud it echoed,
the man's composure returned, deadly calm. "Even if,
by some holy intervention of His will, I were made as
powerful as you, can you possibly imagine that I would turn
against Him? It is as likely that a hound would turn against
his master and defend the wolf! Be assured that this hound
would soon have the taste of your blood."
The apparition leaned across the table like a vast,
gathering cloud in its intentness. "Think! You are no
longer a man, if you were allowed to win, you would become
much more. Under such circumstances you could hardly
expect to retain the innocence of a tottering child, a state
of grace you have so recently left. Reality is not as you
have painted it, soon you would discover that you have
been blind, foolish, stupid, mis-lead, lied to, and generally
deceived; on the whole, infinitely naive during your mortal
life. Your old devotion and loyalty would quickly be
stripped away by this experience. The pious belief and
faith in the infinite goodness of God would seem no
different than the tales of your childhood. For the first —"
"Enough!" The man drowned out the other with a roar,
leaping to his feet. "I will hear no more! It is nothing but
lies, deceit, and blasphemy!"
The other stopped, its form relaxing back into its
greatchair, the empty sockets taking on an air of waiting
expectancy in that smug mask-face. The man fought for
calm again, seeking to quiet his thundering heart, his
throbbing head. He reseated himself, finally, clasping his
hands carefully together before him. Studying them, he
grew calmer yet.
"You cannot shake my faith, you know that as well as
I. Then why are you trying to do so? Even if you succeeded
it would do no good, only a miracle could save you now."
His profound puzzlement was genuine as he sought to reason
out the strategy behind the other's actions.
"An appropriate choice of words." The creature had lost
none of its unfathomable assurance. "If you are so confident,
then make your final move against me. End it now."
The man eyed the apparition warily. Something was wrong,
what it was he could not say, but something was terribly
wrong. The feeling grew stronger and stronger around him
like a gathering storm, yet he was helpless to know its
meaning, to change it in any way.
"Well, what are you waiting for?" the creature prodded
as it saw the man hesitate. "Advance the queen and have
done with it. Just one more move."
The dizziness came upon him like a tide then. At no
point did he recognize its gradual approach, until suddenly
its waters were all around him, rising over him inexorably.
His head was vague, disoriented; his perception dream-like.
From a great distance he pushed himself to the edge of his
chair. A hand which he knew to be his, a trembling hand,
reached out across the vast expanse of the table. Reached —
and reached — and reached for the queen. Taking forever he
reached for the queen .. . and missed.
He jerked back as if burned. God, what was happening?
Beads of sweat slid from his brow and threatened to
blind him, with an impatient gesture he swept them away
with a sleeve. His breath came loudly to his ears; desperately
the man tried to order himself, to think.
Something was hindering him, trying to prevent him
from winning. He looked across at the demon as it stared
unreadably at him. Damn the creature, it wasn't the source!
How he knew he could not say, he simply did. This was not
the obscene thing's doing!
The man gathered himself once more and, as if reaching
for the summit of a mountain, reached again for the
queen; with a hand that shook so badly that it threatened
to upset the game. This time though it did not seem so
bad. He reached, and missed again. Now he did not pull
back. Seizing his right arm in the other hand to steady it
as best he could, he summoned everything he possessed
and, in agony as the pain poured in, tried again.
The coolness of the delicately carved stone piece
beneath his finger tips was a shock. He gasped but continued
to struggle as immediately the queen began to slip from
his pinching, punishing grasp; slick with sweat. With a
strangled cry of terror that turned into one of victory, he
grabbed desperately . . . and held it secure. He had it!
Incredibly, he had it. In his emotion he buried his head into
the crook of his arm and sagged . . . And felt the piece
crack in his mighty grip.
With an insane shriek he plunged across the table,
scattering the game, sending his chair toppling backwards.
He tried to clamp the piece together . . . and felt it disinte-
grate entirely, irretrievably, into powder. Irrationally, for
just a moment before he caught himself, he tried to jam
the grains of sand back together as they piled upon the
table from his hand. He stopped, and slowly raised his face
to the demon's, only inches away now, as it sat and
watched him with pitiless amusement.
"You," the man mumbled. "You did this.... Cheated -
couldn't win ..."
The creature slowly shook its head inarguably, in
terrible denial. Then, as it lounged there at ease, it began
to giggle, and then to laugh. And the man watched, as he
half-lay across the table, in anticipated horror as one of
the talon-like fingers stirred, and pointed ... up.
"NO!" A scream of madness ripped from the throat, the
massive table heaved away as the man screamed again and
continued screaming. He grabbed the greatchair behind
him and with hysterical strength lifted it high, bringing it
down upon the table again and again and again as he
plunged into an insanity of destruction. He completely
lost control then, lost even the memory of what followed.
All he knew was, so great was the pain of his own destruc-
tion, that he too must destroy, or lose what remained of his
24
Michigan Technic


there was nothing around him left to destroy. Slowly the
fury abated.
Finally he found himself on his knees at the edge of the
water, exhausted. His hands were bloody and ruined from
their work, his voice raw and thin from his continuous,
maddened screaming he could not remember hearing.
Behind him was the destruction he had wrought, before
him on the beach stood Satan in truth; cloaked in Nothing-
ness, his face the color and texture of sun-bleached bone.
The man did not care, it did not matter; there was nothing
that did. He simply wished he could go to sleep and not
dream, ever.
"Ironic," the demon mused as it stood and looked down
at the man's abject form. "Your success was your undoing,
you know. He took a little too much pride in making you.
Your strength, your potential, was too great; it had to end
like this." It paused as if to let the man savor the
exquisite irony as well. "Do you understand?" it inquired,
bending down when the other made no response. "By His
very nature as the pinnacle of existence, He can stand no
rivals, tolerate no one of His creations the chance to surpass
Him. He fears the work of His own hands, that is why there
is a Heaven."
"Why was I not just sent there, then?" The creature
could barely hear his voice.
"To become stupid, fatted kine like all the rest, you
mean? Because I contested His possession of you, and by
the rules of the game I must then be allowed by chance
to win you."
"Why should you want me?"
"In truth I didn't." The man raised his head to consider
the other at these words. "I could only hope that He
would weaken, in His pride of you, and let you defeat me.
This would have given you power and ultimately made you
His lieutenant. Then there would have been three in the
game," it smiled a deadly smile. "A number with many
possibilities."
The demon shook his head. "But He is so afraid, you see.
So alone and so afraid, of the dead even more than of the
living. Death is a strange thing, it makes the spirit more,
not less, than it was in life. For His own survival He must
damn the likes of you, who are too strong. Only the most
worthy of men are totally forfeit of the mercy of God."
It paused, and when it continued the regret in its voice
seemed real. "It is a pity you never chose to bend the
power of your will to me rather than to Him. / would never
have brought you to this."
"What have you actually accomplished with this charade
then?" the duke asked from the land of his despair.
The creature shrugged. "I have you, and I have enjoyed
myself. What more should I desire that I am likely to
receive? What's wrong, don't you like charades?"
The man did not stir from where he knelt. "You make
November 1977


winter; the words which rasped from his throat hard and
bitter. "Life is no more than a game to keep you entertained,
to relieve the boredom. The glory and agony of being alive
are totally incomprehensible to you. Of all that exists and
thinks, only you and He possess no souls." At last his gaze
challenged the other.
"And what of that?"
"Then it is you who are the fools, not we." The man
found a terrible kind of satisfaction at the thought.
"Indeed. Then you will have something to keep you
amused during what lies ahead."
"We are bound for Hell, then."
The creature shook its head. "We are already there."
The man looked about him, nothing was changed. "So
we were even lied to about Hell. I see no flames, no
burning pits."
"Oh, we were truthful enough about Hell. It's just that
each man has his own. This belongs to you, and to those
like you."
"And what is so special about this place?"
"Nothing, precisely nothing. You see, even now it is
barely conceivable that eventually you might still prove a
danger to Him 'up there'. And while the possibility does
not bother me in the least. He and I have an implicit
agreement in such matters as these and I will keep to its
letter. Here you are and here you stay; nothing is more an
antithesis to the human spirit than lack of challenge, here
there will be no challenge."
"You said others."
"Do you imagine that you are unique? There have been
others before you, there will be others after. It is a gambit
I try often, though it has yet to work. It irrates Him, you
see, a small matter of conscience."
The man ignored all this. "Where are they?"
"Somewhere out there," the demon indicated everywhere
with a sweep of Nothingness. "Look for them all you wish,
you cannot find them."
"We shall see."
The creature shook its head again. "You shall."
Abruptly it was no longer beside the man, but a dozen
paces away along the curve of the beach. The steady breeze
caught at the stuff of its blackness as it solemnly raised an
arm, pointing at him.
"For you there will be no end. Ever. Your damnation
is life eternal; your fate will be changeless, remorseless,
relentless existence. You will simply exist, and exist, and
exist, and exist. The seconds will be an eternity in your
thoughts, an endless process of waiting for nothing, and
from which nothing can save you. Useless existence, you
will come to hate yourself in time. You will loathe each
dreary thought that you will ever come to think, be
sickened with every pointless emotion that you cannot
help but feel. You will come to realize forever what a puling
hollow sack of ego you really are. And still you will exist."
"Drown and you will not die; crush your skull between
two stones and you will not cease to think; insane I will not
let you become. Night there will never be, the sun will never
set, the light will never change. The wind from across the sea
will remain so constant that soon you will feel no wind;
this sand and shore will be all you ever know again. Never
will you feel thirst or hunger, never will you tire. In time
you will beg for your vision of Hell; for anything, even
torture and agony, to relieve this ultimate in horror."
Suddenly the figure composed of Nothing was further
away yet, though still within the man's range of hearing.
It turned, calling out to mock him one last time.
"I do not want you to despair completely though, little
one." Its laughter was obscene as it planted one final horror
within him, hope. "Eventually my opponent will grow
tired of this game and uncreate me, or grow careless in
which case / shall supplant Him. Either way this farce will
end and you will know the blessing and salvation of true
death at last. Eventually. In an eternity or two. So hold
fast, withstand. Even eternity is not forever, you know."
It laughed a final laugh, and was gone.
Empty. The world felt empty.
Kneeling, the man felt the throb of his injured hands,
the sting of tears in his eyes, the wind brush impersonally
against his cheek. Besides these sensations, and the gentle
sound of waves, the bareness of his vision, there was
nothing. Silence of information, a void, deaf, dumb.
Emptiness and its correlary, alone.
Time.
The man did not want to, but he forced himself to
stand. There could be no acknowledgement of a final
defeat, suchanadmissionwouldaccomplish just such a defeat.
He would survive, he would flourish, he would grow, he
would triumph. It would not be easy, hardly, but it could
be done. And he would do it. In silent farewell he thanked
the satan for its inspiration. He had no doubt that it had
known exactly what it was doing. Bound to the letter of
a bargain it could be, but not to its spirit; that was a
contradiction. The man vowed to himself that eventually
he would repay the other back in kind, both of them in
fact, many times over.
Now, to look for the proper pieces of wooding among
the wreckage of chairs and table; a fire was in order. It
would not be too difficult to start one, and it would
comfort and strengthen him for the long, cold wait ahead.
Besides, the occasion demanded a celebration. And he
had much to think about.
Where the land sloped gently down to the sea, that was
where the man had fallen for the last time. He lay spread-
eagled upon the ground as if in supplication, one cheek
pressed to the ungiving earth, his eyes closed in either pain
or prayer. Which it was, if it was only one of these and not
both, perhaps even the man had not known when he had
shut away his sight forever. Dust and sand, blessed by the
wind, had sealed them since; gilded the lids and lashes with
the glitter of gold. Upon that surface tears, two, had run.
Like old river beds, where water had once fled and then
gone, their trails down the cheek remained.

Years Ago

How much is an engineer involved with life in the
community, and to what degree is the engineer responsible
for social well-being? These questions were raised and
discussed 50 and 25 years ago even as they are discussed
today. Although the living situation was a bit different at
the two times, many of the situations discussed paralleled
each other. The conclusions reached in each case were
quite similar, that engineers should be more concerned with
social matters, but exactly how this should be done is
different in each case.
50 Years Ago
In an article appearing in the November 1927 Technic
entitled, 'The Engineer and his Relation to Community Life,"
Professor William C. Hoad discusses how engineers relate
to the world around them and its social aspects in particular.
During this era the population move was from the country
to the city, and engineers took an active role in the
planning, construction, and operation of large cities. "Life
in the city today has become vastly more complicated
than life in the small town," he points out. He states that
the role of the engineer is vital in such areas as "water
supply, transportation, sewerage, and lighting" as well as
in other activities including fire protection, traffic control,
and power production and distribution.
Due to the increase in technology, great manufacturing
advances were being made along with "comforts, conven-
iences, and labor-saving devices." All of these added up to
more leisure time for people than they had ever experienced
before. How was the general population reacting to this?
Professor Hoad points out that engineers "create" leisure,
but they give no thought as to how it should be used. He
feels the engineer should provide humanistic, as well as
technical solutions. Preparation for this task begins with
the necessary college background, he states. "It seems
perfectly obvious that the time has come for the engineer
once more to broaden his foundation, by resting his work
by Karen Zahn
upon the social sciences as well as upon the mathematical
and physical." In this way, the profession as a whole is made
to feel responsible for social conditions that come about as
a result of their advancements.
25 Years Ago
In contrast to Professor Hoad's ideas that the engineering
profession as a whole should accept responsibility for
social problems caused by technological advancement,
Eugene Coleman feels the solution should be attacked on
a more individual basis. In his article, "The Social Responsi-
bilities of the Engineer," appearing in the November 1952
issue of the Technic, he also feels that advances in technology
are causing social problems. He is somewhat more specific
as to just what these problems are, however. "Technology
has built a world in which society finds adjustment a much
slower process." He claims this country was not built on
mass-production but on the leadership of individuals and
that technology has destroyed much of the leadership in
men. He cites in particular the advent of television and
radio as contributing to this problem. And after the loss of
leadership comes deterioration of other values. "Is it
possible to lose the power to think for ourselves, and lead
ourselves, and, eventually, govern ourselves? The qualities
of leadership are giving way to the docile acceptance of mere
existence."
Coleman calls for engineers to accept social responsibility
more on an individual basis. "As engineers, we will have
been trained in a college atmosphere and have received a
broader education both scholastically and in living. We
should be willing and able to accept a larger share of
social responsibility. It seems quite natural that such pro-
fessional men as lawyers, doctors, and teachers should
accept social responsibility and the base for engineers
should be no different." He goes on to say, "But only by
active awareness of community life and participation in
community affairs can these responsibilities be met-"

engineers who were
born to lead.
Are you the kind of engineer who has what it takes to move into management someday?
If you are, you already know it.
Now what you need to know is which companies can offer you the best oppor-
tunities. We think you'll find General Electric is one.
We're a high technology company. And that means we have to have manag-
ers who understand technology—women and men —to run the place.
Today, over 60% of the top managers at General Electric hold technical
degrees. In fact, over 657c of the college graduates we hired last year held
technical degrees.
Of course, just leadership ability and a technical degree won't get
you into management. First, you're going to need solid engineering
experience and abroad understanding of business.
And we have a lot of ways to help you get it.
One is our Manufacturing Management Program. A two-year
program of rotating assignments that gives you broad experience
with different products and manufacturing processes.
Another is our Engineering Program. For engineers with an
interest in product and systems design and development.
There's also a Field Engineering Program, a Technical Market-
ing Program, plus a number of programs sponsored by product
operations.
And all with just one aim. To give you all the responsi-
bility and all the perspective you need to move into man-
agement. As fast as you can manage it.
Of course, starting on a program isn't the only way
to make it into management at GE. If you have a
specific product interest, we have many direct-
placement opportunities that can get your career
started fast, too.
What kinds of product areas can you
work in at GE?
Maybe nuclear power. Or more
efficient turbine-generators. Or better
mass-transit systems. Or medical
equipment. Engineering plastics.
Cleaner, quieter jet engines. Communi-
cations products. You name it.
Sound interesting? Why not
send for our free careers booklet?

opportunity in terms of

— David A. Dindinger BS, Chemical Engineering
"I interviewed companies

10 big companies in all. And I
felt Du Pont offered me the
most opportunity in terms of
career development, outstand-
ing benefits and, best of all, the
chance to do some traveling.

THIS MONTH'S TECHNIC
There's nothing like a little Technic to help celebrate
the holiday season (and the end of exams). This month is
our "alternative engine and vehicle" issue. First is an
article dealing with the feasibility of diesel engines in
automobiles, followed by a discussion of several types of
alternative power sources as presented by a study done in
California. Finally, an invention from right here in Ann
Arbor, a wind-electric hybrid, is featured.
Diesel engines have been around for a long time powering
trucks, tractors, and marine equipment. Now automobile
manufacturers are beginning to look at the diesel as a
source of more efficient power for their cars. Greg Werth
explores the area of diesel engines in automobiles, its pros
and cons in his article " 'Dieselitis' for 1978".
Next Tom Rainwater discusses several different types
of alternate power sources for automobiles - including
the electric car, electric hybrids, gas turbine, and steam
engine. He uses a recent study done by the Jet Propulsion
Lab at Cal Tech as the main source for his article.
You're driving down State St. and all of a sudden this
oblong vehicle on three wheels with a large arch overhead
whizzes by. No, you're not seeing things, it's just James
Amick out for a spin in the wind-powered vehicle he
invented. Bill Cowie went out to interview Mr. Amick and to
get a closer look at the Windmobile. He explains a little bit
about the design and how it works in his article "The
Amazing Windmobile."
Engineers seem to be increasingly concerned with
economic matters these days. An issue of great concern over
the past few years has been unemployment. President
Carter has promised to get the unemployment figure down
to 4% in the next few years. Cindy Rogers discusses some
of the problems facing moves to combat unemployment
in her essay "Full Employment: Is It Possible to Achieve
and Still Maintain Price Stability?"
A bit of science fiction is featured this month as
erstwhile photographer Randy Warsaw writes about a sub-
ject he is very interested in - nuclear warfare. The title
of the story is "Flower for Riyadh."
Another unexplored frontier which is right here on
Earth is the oceans. The oceans are rich with mineral and
wildlife resources and deciding who is entitled to these
resources has caused many problems between various
countries of the world. Ric Lee, in his article "Who Owns
the Sea? The Law of the Sea Issue" presents some of these
problems and the solutions being sought for them.
The closing note is the ever-popular 'The Michigan Technic
50 and 25 Years Ago" brought to you this month by Karen
Zahn.

Dear Editors,
I recently had a chance to review Bill Cowie's article
on "The Solar Solution and Space Habitats", in the
October issue of the Michigan Technic and was glad to note
that someone in the aerospace engineering program at the
University of Michigan is aware of the challenging scope and
infinite potential of the L-5 concept. It is unfortunate that
the aerospace department has apparently chosen to place
maximum emphasis on the aeronautical aspects of aero-
space, because an increasing percentage of the aerospace
industry is gearing to astronautically oriented contracts.
N.A.S.A.'s budget and an increasing portion of the Depart-
ment of Defense's research budgeting is being directed to
developing space technology. These two agencies' budgets
largely determine the who, what, and where of employment
statistics for aerospace engineers in any given fiscal year. If the
University of Michigan is to retain its' high ranking in the
aerospace category of the American Deans' evaluation, then
it is high time to modify faculty attitudes that astronautical
engineering is the exclusive realm of M.I.T., Caltech, and
Stanford!
In reference to Mr. Cowie's article, there are a few
conceptional errors that I would suggest be corrected in the
next issue of the Michigan Technic.
1) Professors Gerald O'Neill and Peter Glaser are
not advocating a complete global dependence on
the Satellite Solar Power Station system concept
as suggested by this article. What they are sugges-
ting is that the S.S.P.S. system is a very viable
system in conjunction with existing/projected
fossil fuels, nuclear fission, and advanced energy
systems such as nuclear fusion and geothermal
tap technology (where applicable).
2) According to the 1977 Princeton/A. I.AA./N.A.S.A.
Conference on Space Manufacturing Facilities, the
Bernal Sphere Habitat (pictured on page 7) and the
cylindrical habitat (described on page 8) should
be classified as sophisticated third generation
habitats that would see initial construction within
15-20 years after developing a baseline space
manufacturing system, instead of immediate con-
struction as envisioned in the article. In fact, the
first habitat will probably be in a torus ring con-
figuration with a null gee manufacturing plant
located on a perpendicular connector several
hundred meters away and a flat donut-shaped
mirror located immediately "above" it to reflect
sunlight into the space community.
3) The description and sketch of the Lagrangian
Libration points (on pages 8 &amp; 9) are very
misleading from a space physics standpoint. The
"L-4" point has the exact same characteristics
and advantages as the "L-5" (relative to its 60
degree post lunar orbit) point as a location for
space habitats. The "L-5" designation in all space
manufacturing facilities studies usually refers to
both the "L-4" and "L-5" points.
My thanks to Mr. Cowie for an otherwise accurate and
informative article on a relatively ignored part of our
future space program, that is, if there is a strong enough
lobbying force mustered through the public to overcome the
highest of all technological barriers: politics.
If anyone is interested in the L-5 concept, I would urge
that they attend one of the weekly meetings of the Ann
Arbor chapter of the L-5 Society. These meetings are held
in room 4202 of the Michigan Union, every Tuesday
evening at 7 p.m.

What is "Dieselitis"? No it's not a spin-off of last year's
Swine Flu, but its consequences may be of equal magnitude.
"Dieselitis" is a phenomenon contagious among many of this
year's automobile manufacturers. Its symptoms are charac-
terized by the production of diesel-powered automobiles
for 1978.
"Incubation" of Dieselitis
For the past half century, diesel engines have powered
trucks, trains, and tractors all over the world, so why has
the diesel remained dormant among automakers, until now?
Today's automakers find themselves asking: "Does the
diesel engine hold any promise as a near-term power source
for a significant number of our automobiles?" This is the
same dilemma that faced automotive industrialists of the
nineteenth century. In Germany, in 1892, Rudolf Diesel
patented the first diesel engine, a compression-ignition
four-cycle engine, which he painstakingly developed in
France while working as a refrigerator engineer. Six years
later the first production version of Rudolf Diesel's patented
"Rational Heat Engine" was offered for sale, amidst the
existence of 50,000 Otto-cycle engines (today's conventional
engine). Besides having to compete with the large number
of already existing Otto-cycle engines, the diesel's chances
for survival were also limited by several of its characteristic
disadvantages: it was large and bulky, offered a measly
twenty horsepower output and required a large facility for
an engine garage. However, from the beginning of its
existence, the diesel was superior to every other source of
power in one critical aspect: It offered the highest mechani-
cal efficiency of any internal combustion engine. This is
why the diesel is again under serious consideration now.
The diesel, at its dawning, was only partially successful.
It won several awards, was purchased by big business, and
it triumphantly countered the flocks of skeptical critics
and enemies, but it never flourished into the inexpensive,
efficient, revolutionary power source Mr. Diesel had objecti-
fied. And for that matter, Mr. Diesel didn't flourish too well
either. On a dark night in 1913, Rudolf Diesel silently
stepped off the Dresden into the cold dark waters of the
English Channel, ending his painful financial and social
burdens. But all was not lost, for in 1927 Robert Bosch
perfected the fuel-injection system which enabled the
diesel to become potentially practical in the transportation
world. However, the diesel has stayed dormant in the
automobile industry until now, when economics, the energy
crisis, technology, and public opinion have placed the
diesel in the spotlight of the automakers and the public.
Increasing scarcity of resources, tougher emissions standards,
raving international inflation, and government fuel economy
standards, all foreshadow a crisis which can only be avoided
by drastic action; possibly by the implementation of the
diesel.
"Physiology" of the Diesel
A basic understanding of the differences between the
contemporary gasoline engine and the diesel engine is
necessary to fathom how the diesel could seriously challenge
the gas engine. To begin with, the internal components of
both engines are practically identical. Both use a crankshaft,
pistons, and a chamber assembled from a cylinder block
and one or more head assemblies, enclosing moving connec-
ting rods and valves. The four-stroke cycle is shared by
both, along with the internal burning of a mixture of
fuel and air to deliver power to the crankshaft.
With all the similarities, how does the diesel differ? The
diesel obtains its uniqueness by the method in which it
ignites its fuel/air mixture. In contrast to the contemporary
coil/spark-plug ignition, the diesel depends on spontaneous
combustion of its charge. No fuel is present during intake
and compression strokes. Air drawn into the cylinder is
compressed to a very high temperature and pressure so the
ignition is spontaneous the moment fuel is injected into the
cylinder. The rise in temperature and pressure drives the
piston downward delivering power to the crankshaft, as in
a conventional engine. Because the diesel possesses this
unique type of ignition, it also requires several other func-
tional differences. To insure spontaneous ignition the
compression ratio is much higher, typically over twenty
to one, in contrast to eight to one for gasoline engines. The
necessary easy combustion following fuel injection, requires
diesel fuel to have a very low octane rating. Also, piston
force is strictly determined by the amount of fuel injected,
as opposed to throttling the air intake. Lastly, a special
plug must preheat the cylinder for up to 90 seconds for
cold starts.
The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: Advantages, Disadvantages,
and Pollution
Tables 1 and 2 summarize the advantages and disad-
vantages of the diesel compared to the conventional gasoline
engine. These two tables contain most of the important
differences except for exhaust emissions which are listed
in table 3.
To Diesel or Not to Diesel
The diesel's chances for survival depend on the answers,
over the next ten years or so, to basically four questions:
(1) Can we afford to continue to inflict the air with the
6
Michigan Technic


fuel become more readily available? (3) Are we prepared
to pay the extra money for a diesel and what will there be
to choose from? And (4) Can Detroit continue to build the
contemporary gasoline automobile and still meet the
statutory 27.5 mpg fleet-weighted average by 1985.
Presently the diesel's existence hinges on question (1).
Oxides of nitrogen, especially nitrogen dioxide are spread
feloniously by the diesel. As it stands now, the NOx federal
standard is 2.0 grams per vehicle mile, except for California
which specifies 1.5 gpm. The diesel has no trouble meeting
these standards, but next year's limit will drop to 0.4 gpm.
There is no way the diesel can operate at less than 1.5
gpm and unless there is some legislative change the diesel
is a goner. The United Auto Workers are lobbying hard to
give the diesel a chance. The UAW proposal infers that, "Any
technology that is 25 percent more fuel-efficient than a
comparable weight vehicle (which the diesel is) would be
considered for a waiver from the statutory NOx standards."
Now for question (2). Will making diesel fuel readily
available be very difficult? R.K. Stone, a senior staff
engineer for Chevron Research says, "Even if there were a
twenty percent market penetration of diesel powered cars
(about two million a year) we wouldn't see much problem
in accommodating that demand." There are transportation
and storage considerations for diesel fuel which could prove
to be difficult because the tolerance of diesel fuel to
contamination is considerably lower than for gasoline.
Contaminated fuel is a major cause of trouble for diesel
engine operation, and can ruin precision equipment such as
fuel pumps and injectors; the conventional gasoline engine
can better tolerate some fuel contamination. Also, pumps
and tanks must be installed at thousands of retailers, which
would prove costly, but as Stone says, "Certainly we
would want to accommodate the business."
On to question (3). Is the public willing to shell out
the extra bucks for a diesel and what kind of a market is
there to choose from? Apparently automobile manufacturers
feel the diesel's superb fuel economy and durability will
make the initial investment worthwhile in the long run. Last
year Volkswagon, Datsun, and Citroen all introduced diesel
cars to compete in a market now dominated by West
Germany's Mercedes-Benz and France's Peugeot. This year
the American car manufacturers get into the picture.
General Motors Corporation will be offering diesel engines
with their Oldsmobile 88 and 98. Also, International
Harvester has equipped its Scout with a diesel. Most
important of all, the largest selling light vehicle in the U.S.,
the Chevrolet pickup truck, will be offering a diesel for
1978.
Lastly, question (4), a very straightforward problem.
Can the contemporary gasoline automobile we presently
know and love, meet the fleet-weighted average of 27.5
mpg by 1985, as mandated by Congress? If not, the
diesel seems a feasible solution.

COMMENT
Efficiency
Higher. How much higher depends on
compression ratio.
On an absolute basis, that is, for equal compression
ratios, the Diesel cycle is actually less efficient than the
Otto cycle used in gasoline engines. But compression
ratios are never equal.
Energy content of
Diesel fuel
Approximately 10% higher than
gasoline on a volume basis.
Delivers more work per gallon of fuel.
Lack of throttle
More mechanically efficient.
It doesn't have to pump against a vacuum to draw in
its air supply. With larger power settings, this advantage
diminishes and at full throttle, disappears.
plate
Fuel savings
Approximately 25% (with equal
acceleration performance).
Overall, acceleration is poorer.
Diesel life span
Considerably higher.
Higher because engine parts are more robust because of
higher pressures.
Maintenance (excluding
oil changes)
Lower than non-electronic ignition
cars and even with electronic
ignition cars.
Diesels have no spark plugs, ignition points, coils,
distributors or carburetors to worry about.
Fuel production
Half the energy required to make

This may lead to an approximate 1% savings in crude
oil for every 10% increase in Diesel vehicle population.

Internal Combustion Gasoline Engine
by Tom Rainwater
Despite growing criticism of the automobile as a polluter
of the environment, as a glutton of precious energy
resources and as the source of somewhere near 60,000
fatalities each year, it seems as though the automobile will
continue to be the primary source of transportation for
some time into the future. The Jet Propulsion Lab of
Cal Tech recently spent over 18 months and $500,000
studying the technologies available for improving the
automobile and its powerplant. The study looked at the
automobile and its powerplant within the framework of key
issues such as: the role of the automobile and other transit
systems in providing personal mobility, energy and fuels
availability, material resources, air quality, highway safety,
and the changeover capacity of the automotive industry.^
The JPL announced that public transit systems, due to their
limited applicability and the required amount of time and
effort to build, will not cause more than a 10-15% shift
from the personal automobile in the next 10-20 years. It
added that the Otto-cycle engine could, with additional
development, be catalytically controlled without sacrificing
fuel economy to meet the strictest environmental standards
on emissions.2The study centered on the question: "Should
we have a new engine?" from the standpoint of society's
needs and problems. The aim of this article is to examine
what appear to be the alternatives to the present automo-
bile and its powerplant. I will use the JPL study and its
conclusions as the major source for my article.
The JPL studied the present day Internal Combustion,
Otto cycle engine (1C or Otto) along with seven alternatives.
The seven alternatives were: the stratified-change Otto,
the diesel, the Brayton, the Rankine, the Stirling, the
electric, and various hybrids. This article will deal only with
the Brayton, the Rankine, the Stirling, the electric, the
hybrids and to some extent, the conventional. Otto cycle-
engine. The JPL suggested that the stratif ied-charge and the
diesel do not offer enough advantages over the conventional
Otto to warrant their widespread introduction as alternatives.
In fact, the study felt they may cause a delay in the
introduction of a better, long-range solution to the pro-
blems facing the conventional Otto today.
An Overview
The Brayton engine is of the type often referred to as a
gas turbine. It is a continuous-combustion engine in which
the hot gases produced by the burning fuel-air mixture are
expanded through a turbine to provide power. For automo-
tive application, the most suitable are designs that feature
modest intake air compression and which recycle much of
the heat from the gases exiting from the turbine.
The Rankine considered in this test is, for all intents and
purposes, a steam engine. It is described as a "continuous-
combustion engine in which the heat from combustion is
transferred to a separate closed system containing a con-
densible working fluid. The fluid is vaporized and super-
heated in a boiler, expanded to produce power, and then
condensed back to a liquid for re-use."3
The Stirling is a continuous-combustion engine in which
heat from the burning fuel-air mixture is transferred to a
separate closed system containing a non-condensible working
fluid (a small quantity of higKpressure gas, usually hydrogen).
In producing power, the working fluid is alternately cooled
during compression and heated during expansion. The
design of this engine also provides for recycling most of the
heat energy left in the working fluid after expansion. The
Stirling engines used in the JPL study were piston-type.
The hybrids studied "combine a combustion engine of
lower horsepower in the range of near-maximum efficiency,
while providing power for routine driving chores and de-
livering a small surplus of power to the energy storage
system; the latter then imparts energy to the drive system
when bursts of power are called for. Most emphasis to
date has been placed upon heat-engine/flywheel hybrids
and heat-engine/electric hybrids."^
All of the engines were evaluated in three stages of
development. The three stages were termed. Present, Mature,
and Advanced. The Present configuration is the way the
engine exists today; it may be in the form of a laboratory
prototype or at the stage of production. The Mature con-
figuration is a near-term improved version of the engine
available with today's technology. It represents primarily
metallic construction with the need for design "cleanup"
December 1977


ment before it could be introduced into production. The
Advanced configuration is a long-range projection. It doesn't
require any basic materials to be developed, but "does
necessitate some fundamental research, much of it in
ceramic materials and processing developments."^ Most
of the engines are not yet suitable for production in their
Present condition except, of course, the conventional Otto
and the diesel. I would like to stress that none of the alter-
native engines exist in the Mature configuration and those
in the Advanced configuration probably will not be
producible until sometime after 1990.6
The Stirling, the Brayton, and the Rankine
Of all the engines the JPL team studied, they were most
impressed with the Stirling. The Stirling-engined vehicles
were superior to all of the others because of the high
efficiencies attainable. The Stirling offered, in addition to
good mileage, quietness, and multi-fuel capacity, the all-
important ability to meet future emission standards. Ford
Motor Co. and The Energy Research and Development
Administration are reportedly also working on the Stirling.
Ford isoptimisticallyprojectinga production date somewhere
around 1985. "The latest automotive version of the Stirling
uses four cylinders. A swashplate drive translates the up-and-
down motion of the pistons into rotary motion ... In
addition to a reduction in bulk and weight, the swashplate
system brings the four cylinders close together, allowing
the use of a single heat source at the front of the engine. A
pre-heater surrounding the burner recovers waste heat and
warms incoming air."7
The Brayton powered vehicles ranked second, after the
Stirling, in the JPL study due partly to reasonably good
engineefficienciesand partly to the vehicle weight reductions
which could be made using these lightweight engines. How-
ever, the Rankine-equipped cars were barely competitive with
the conventional Otto powered cars, because of poor
efficiency when using a condensing working fluid. One
advantage of these continuous-combustion cars is the
adaptability of fuels. They can tolerate a much broader
class of liquid hydrocarbons than can the conventional Otto-
cycle engines. They also are capable of emissions well below
the statutory standards and could move the automobile to
a secondary place in the list of major polluters. Their
emissions advantage stems from the fact that the combus-
tion process they utilize is physically separated from the
work-producing process.
The Electric Automobile
The electric vehicle has been the subject of much
more study than the rest of the alternatives, and much of
it is conflicting. The conflict arises from the question
concerning a new power source for the electric vehicle.
Opponents claim that unless a new power source is
developed, other than the conventional lead-acid battery, the
electric vehicle will not be able to compete with today's
automobiles. Proponents, however, claim that there is the
possibility of using a system with the conventional lead-acid
battery. There are also conflicting articles over the status
of a new power source - the lithium battery. First I will deal
with the questions concerning the lithium battery, and
then I will examine the possibility of using the conventional
lead-acid battery.
In presenting the problems facing the electric automobile
we see that they are centered on the problems of adequate
speed and acceleration, and the range of the battery before
it has to be recharged. The electric vehicle faded out long
ago because it was too slow and genteel to keep up with
the traffic on improved highways. "Really, it had a little-
old-lady-in-high-button-shoes image. Its range was so limited
. . . and finally the task of recharging the battery, a
frequent necessity, was about as convenient as elective
surgery."8 The above problems are the same ones which
face the electric today - even more so than before. "Because
of its range and recharge limitations, the battery powered
vehicle can only be regarded as a second car or urban area
vehicle. It does not provide the necessary range for long
distance travel or so constant use at this stage of its de-
velopment. "9
The solution appears to be with the development of a new
power source; one which can help to shed this image of the
electric and, equally important, reduce the need for such
frequent recharging. The answer to this problem, as seen by
many in the engineering community, is in the lithium type
battery. The lithium cell offers the user the advantage of
better range; recharging consists of simply replacing the
lithium anode every V/z months - on an average yearly total
mileage of about 9600 miles - or about the same time frame
as the present day oil change. Routine refueling would
consist of adding carbon dioxide and removing lithium
carbonate.
Problems arise when dealing with the lithium source
battery because very little lithium is refined and the
resources haven't been thoroughly prospected, although
there are believed to be copious amounts^ 0. However, a good
deal of lithium can be recovered from the spent anode
elements and recycled, which would cut down the amount
of fresh lithium that would have to be mined. Nothing is
recoverable from the burning of petroleum products. How
close to becoming realized is the lithium battery? While
many people speculate that research is still in the beginning
stages, and it will be a few years before the lithium source
can be of potential use, a group of GM researchers said
they had demonstrated a lithium and iron sulfide battery
that offered ranges of 200 milesJ ^
Whether or not the lithium battery is developed, however,
seems to have relatively little effect on those who believe in
the present lead-acid system as a viable solution for the
proliferation of the electric vehicle. Recognizing the limita-
tions of electric vehicles, the Copper Development Asso-
ciation, Inc. (CDA) "commissioned the design and construc-
tion of a small two-passenger, prototype automobile
10
Michigan Technic


the CDA Town Car. The result was an impressive, sleek
looking automobile capable of a top speed of 61 mph, with an
acceleration from 0-30 in 11.2 seconds, surpassing design
goals. It turned out to be about the same size as an AMC
Gremlin, had a sliding compartment which came out of the
rear of the car and supported the eighteen, 6-volt, lead-acid
batteries which power the car. The unit which houses the
batteries is the main structural unit of the car, which is de-
signed with highway safety in mind. The unit runs length-
wise through the bottom of the car and is about the same
size as the "hump" in most cars today which houses the
transmission. The entire electrical system can be completely
recharged from a "dead" state in 8 hours using 220 volt ac.
However, I should emphasize the point that the range is
limited to somewhere around 75 miles. Thus the need for the
lithium battery is once again emphasized before the
electric car can become anything more than a limited-use
automobile.
The Hybrid
Turning now to the last alternative, let's examine the
hybrid vehicles. Many engineers consider the answer to the
problems facing the electric vehicle as "the development of
a hybrid car that can use its battery for short trips in town
and turn to an 1C on the turnpike, while storing energy
in a flywheel for later use. The electricity would be for
energy-costly stop-and-go driving; the gasoline for more
efficient longer trips."13 This hybrid is of the type referred
to as a heat-engine/flywheel type. Another type which was
mentioned earlier is the heat-engine/electric. The more
viable of the two appears to be the heat-engine/electric.
Past hybrid developments have tended to use the heat
engine primarily as a battery charger. The present hybrid
(electric version) reverses this philosophy and makes mini-
mum use of the electric system. This system has essentially
six modes of operation. Mode 1 is completely electrically
powered for operation at speeds below 10-15 mph. In
Mode 2, the engine is the source of power and there is no
flow of energy into or out of the electrical system. In Mode
3 (the battery charging mode) the engine powers the car
but excess energy is used to charge the battery. When
acceleration demands tax the system both the electric motor
and the engine work together; this is Mode 4. Mode 5 is
called regenerative braking where energy from deceleration
charges the battery. The sixth mode is when the vehicle
is standing still and neither engine nor electric motor is
operating.
14
Although hybrid cars can be made even better than
conventional cars in short bursts of acceleration, they
cannot compete in sustained high load operation. The
upper limit of hybrid vehicles is estimated at a 20-30%
improvement over the conventional Otto cycle engine. One
of the major drawbacks to the hybrid vehicles is the cost
involved; they require a heat engine plus an energy storage
system plus appropriate coupling. A hybrid electric would
be about 1.5 times more expensive than a conventional car,
a hybrid-flywheel would be less than the electric hybrid,
but still more than the conventional car.
Although I think the hybrid and electric sound like very
good alternatives to our present energy situation, the JPL
study didn't think they warranted sufficient consideration,
partly because of their complexity and cost, and also be-
cause of the uncertain situation of the lithium battery.
Conclusions
The first step in improving the automobile and its power
plant should be the implementation of simple vehicle
design changes - primarily weight reductions and aerodyna-
mic design changes. (Aerodynamic drag on an automobile
at 40 mph is 50% of total drag.) These can be implemented
relatively easy and should be used in production by 1981-
1985. The Brayton and Stirling stand out as the best long-
range alternatives and can reduce fuel consumption by about
1/3 of that of conventional automobiles, while at the same
time meeting the strictist presently-legislated emissions
standards. We should set a target date of 1985, or earlier if
possible, when we could incorporate these into the develop-
ment schedule. We should continue to improve the Otto
cycle engine, pushing it to its limits. "Such an updated
Otto engine constitutes not only a good stopgap automobile
configuration, but also a very acceptable "fallback" position
if intractable difficulties arise in both engine's develop-
ment.''^
The last point which I would like to make is that the
JPL study suggested whats/7ou/d be done, and not necessarily
what will be done. The automobile industry is very complex,
and no matter how much money is available to supplement
a new alternative to the present engine, no change is going
to happen overnight. Thus it appears as though no alterna-
tive engine will be available for mass production in standard
size and performance before the 1980's and even though
some alternatives may become competitive, the spark-
ignition type will be around for some time to come.

Amazing
Windmobile
by Bill Cowie
At first sight, the Windmobile is a very unique looking
vehicle, with its sleek, cigar-shaped body and 8 foot high
arch over the top. And the first explanation I heard,
describing how it is propelled, was also very interesting.
Three batteries power electric motors which accelerate the
vehicle up to a speed of 20 to 25 miles per hour. This, in
turn, creates a wind relative to the car. As the speed of the
vehicle increases, the wind blowing over it begins to help
propel the car. Soon the electric motors are not needed at
all, as the wind itself can keep the car going on its own.
Now, instead of the motors driving the wheels, the wheels
drive the motors in a regenerative mode, thus recharging
the batteries.
This explanation sounded very intriguing. In fact, it
almost sounded like some sort of perpetual motion machine.
So to find out more about this unique vehicle, I talked to
the man who invented it.
The Invention
The man's name is James Amick. He is a resident of Ann
Arbor and a former Research Engineer in Aerospace
Engineering here at U. of M. Some years ago, one of his
sons wanted to build an iceboat for the winter ahead. So
Dad set to work, and after a few months of design work, he
emerged with a rather unique fixed-wing design vehicle.
As it turned out, it was not such a great iceboat after all.
But when it was converted to a land vehicle, it fared much
better. So much better, in fact, that it was then modified

seen a frozen lake since.
The car can best be described as a hybrid electric-wind
powered vehicle. These two different methods of propulsion
complement each other quite nicely, each making up for
the deficiency of the other. The problem with current
electric cars is their limited range, especially at highway
speeds. The drawback of a fixed-wing wind vehicle is its
inability to accelerate from rest, or to travel at high speeds
under unfavorable wind conditions. But by putting the two
together, Amick overcame both of these shortcomings. The
electric motor is used to start the vehicle and is used when
wind conditions are unfavorable. And when the wind is
favorable the battery can be recharged, thus extending the
range of travel.
The explanation of how this Windmobile is propelled by
the wind is based on sound aerodynamic principles. In fact,
it is based on the same phenomena which govern the flight
of airplanes and gliders. So before I try to explain how
the windmobile works, let's make sure that these aerodyna-
mic principles are understood.
Figure 1. The lift force, L, is perpendicular to the direc-
tion of the flow of air relative to the wing. The drag force,
D, is parallel to it. The sum of these 2 forces is the resultant
force, R.
Aerodynamic Principles
According to the laws formulated by Daniel Bernoulli,
the flow of air at low speed is governed by the equation:
p + %pV2 = constant
where p is the local pressure, p is the density, and V is
the local velocity of the airstream. This gives us a concise
inverse-square relationship between the pressure and the
speed of a given airflow. Since a variable p will ruin this neat
relationship, we will assume it stays constant. (This is a
common trick used by professors and authors of textbooks
so I am sure you are all familiar with it. But, at least in this
case, the assumption happens to be a very reasonable one).
So for a given increase in the velocity of moving air, there is
a corresponding decrease in its pressure.
An airplane wing re-directs the air flowing around it and
causes the air flowing over the top of it to move faster than
the air flowing underneath it. Thus the slower moving air
underneath the wing exerts a greater pressure on the
bottom of the wing than the faster-moving air that is
flowing over the top of it. This difference in pressure,
exerted over the surface area of the wing creates a net up-
ward force, called the lift force, which keeps the plane from
falling. If one were to stop and consider a moment, it is
apparent that this lift force can indeed be rather large. After
all, the entire weight of an airplane, including passengers,
cargo, and fuel, must be offset by the aerodynamic lift
forces generated entirely by the relatively small wings.
One more brief point before we return to the Wind-
mobile. The flow of air over a wing also causes another
force — the drag force. The resultant force, R, is the vector
sum of the lift force, perpendicular to the direction of
flow of the air, and the drag force, parallel to the flow.
(See Fig. 1) As is the usual convention, the net force on the
wing in any direction is represented by a single force througY-v
its center of pressure.

air
irfoil
Figure 2. Cross section of the Windmobile, looking down
from above. Note the symmetrical shape of the cross
section of the airfoils. The lines of symmetry are parallel
to the direction of travel of the vehicle.
How It Works
With that background behind us, let's look at how the
windmobile works. The wing, or airfoil, of the windmobile
is the vertical part of the arch on either side of the vehicle.
The cross section of these airfoils is symmetric about a line
parallel with the direction of forward motion of the vehicle.
(See figure 2) Because of this symmetric shape, the wind
must be blowing at an angle with respect to the line of
symmetry, but a wind blowing from either direction will
produce the same aerodynamic forces.
Perhaps the best way to explain this would be by using
an example. Let's say that we take out the Windmobile one
fine, sunny day for a drive in a due westerly direction.
Before we start, we notice that there is a wind coming from
the southwest at 14 miles per hour. At this wind angle, the
airfoil of the car is "stalled" and it produces very little lift,
just as an airplane can stall if its angle of attack is too high.
So we must use the electric motors to get the car moving.
As soon as we start moving, the wind relative to the car
changes. The relative wind, - i.e. the wind you feel blowing
over you as you travel along, is the vector sum of the true
wind and the wind that is created by moving through the air.
Once we are moving at 15 m.p.h., the relative wind becomes
a wind of about 27 m.p.h. at an angle of about 22 . (See
figure 3). At this angle the wing becomes unstalled and
produces a lift force. The vector sum of this lift force and
the corresponding drag force produced by the airfoil
gives a resultant force, R. (See Figure 4). Looking at this
resultant force, we see that its direction is forward of a line
perpendicular to the direction of travel. So the wind
produces a large lateral (sideways) force and a small force
in the forward direction. It is this small forward force which
propels the Windmobile.
Figure 5 shows the speed that the vehicle will reach on
wind power alone, given the direction and speed of the true
wind. On our imaginary trip the true wind coming from the
southwest is at an angle of 45 and a speed of 14 m.p.h.
The electric motors are used to accelerate the car up to
15 m.p.h. (Point A). At this point the wing becomes
unstalled and the wind begins propelling the car. If we now
turn off the electric motors, the car is propelled by a 14
m.p.h. breeze at 45 . The intersection of these two lines on
the graph is point B. Reading back to the vertical axis, we see
that we would be moving about 30 m.p.h. If vie wanted to go
faster, the electric motors would again be used.
The speed of the car is controlled by a hand throttle. In
the forward position, the electric motors propel the car
forward. In the middle (neutral) position the power is off.
And in the rearward position, the car is slowed down, as the
wheels are made to drive the motors in a regenerative mode.
In this position, the motors act as generators and recharge
the batteries. If more braking is needed, the driver simply
steps on brake pedals and conventional mechanical brakes
slow the wheels.
Continuing our imaginary ride, let's say we come to an
intersection and make a right-hand turn. We would now be
headed north, and the southwest wind would be at an
angle of 135 . Referring again to figure 5, we see that we
would have to accelerate up to about 30 m.p.h. using the
electric motors. Once we did so, the 14 m.p.h. wind would
keep the car going at 50 m.p.h. (point C), without any help
from the motors. If the road we are travelling on bends to
the left, we would need to pull the throttle back to slow
the car down, since the wind would now be at about 110
and would try to push the car up over 65 m.p.h. (point D).
Of course, neither the speed nor the direction of the
wind remains constant for very long. So the job of the
driver is simply to control the throttle - varying the amount
of power delivered to, or taken from, the wheels- in order
to keep a constant speed.
One final consideration is how high winds would affect
the windmobile; for instance, whether the vehicle can be
blown around or upset if it ran into a storm. If the wind is
from the front or rear, the effect would be minimal, since
the craft is well streamlined. The vehicle is more vulnerable
Figure 3. The relative wind is the wind one would feel if
moving along with the vehicle. It is the vector sum of 2
winds:
1) the wind that would be felt if the vehicle is moving
through still air, and
2) the wind that is felt when the vehicle is standing still
(the true wind).

on one of the two airfoils. Note that the resultant force,
R, has a forward component as well as the rather large
lateral component. Although these rather large lateral
forces are exerted on the vehicle, the wheels are pointed
forward, so the Windmobile travels in that direction. The
forces are essentially the same on the other airfoil.
was put together by Mr. Amick and his son, using what
was available to them. Thus there is much room for
improvement in this prototype model. With some test and
design work, and parts designed specifically for this vehicle,
a much improved model could be built.
Mr. Amick also showed me drawings of a 2-passenger
Windmobile he has designed. It has 3 vertical airfoils, and
the second passenger sits behind the driver in tandem
formation. SunWind Ltd.. a company in California is
currently working on development of this model. It would
have double the range of the existing prototype and could
accelerate from 0 to 30 m.p.h. in 6 seconds. It would also
be less than 80 inches wide, so that it could be licensed as
a motorcycle for normal street use.
And somewhat further in the future, it may be possible
to build solar panels into the Windmobile, thus harnessing
solar energy to help recharge the batteries. The combination
of these 3 sources of power - electric, wind, and solar -
would further improve the versatility and practicality of
this unique vehicle.
to winds from the side, especially with-the large lateral
forces that are generated. In this case, the center of pressure
is located at a point near the center of gravity, which is low
on the airfoil and near the rear axle. Thus, the overturning
moment is hindered by a short moment arm, and rather
high winds would be needed to upset it.
What would happen instead, says Amick, is that the large
lateral force would cause the rear wheels to sideslip
slightly, turning the vehicle into the wind. This would reduce
the lateral force to an equilibrium level. Normal steering
control would be retained, since this force does not act
near the front of the vehicle. Thus, even under relatively
strong winds, the Windmobile is inherently stable.
Specifications and Developments
The Windmobile is 8 feet wide, 1T/2 feet long, and 8
feet high at the top of the airfoil. It is propelled by two
electric motors, one on each rear wheel. The motors are
propelled by 3 lead-acid batteries. The steering wheel is
connected to the single wheel in front. The vehicle's
structure is primarily epoxied styrofoam. It weighs about
750 pounds when empty (no passenger), and can accommo-
date one person.
If there is no wind, the prototype Windmobile can travel
about 40 miles at 40 m.p.h. on one battery charge. In a
closed-loop course, a 12 m.p.h. wind increases the range to
90 miles at 45 m.p.h. or 220 miles at 35 m.p.h. And under
certain wind conditions - for instance, a wind of 15 m.p.h.
or greater coming approximately from the side - the Wind-
mobile can travel at 55 m.p.h. as long as the wind holds out.
It is significant to point out that there has been no
wind tunnel testing as of yet, nor any other type of design
or engineering optimization. It is simply something that

and Still Maintain Price Stability?
The United States has accepted full employment as one
of the goals of national economic policy. The official
commitment to the goal of high employment was made in
the Employment Act of 1946. Congress stated in this act,
that, "it is the continuing policy and responsibility of the
Federal Government ... to promote employment, produc-
tion, and purchasing power." Later, during President
Eisenhower's administration, the Commission on National
Goals stated that "we must seek to keep unemployment
consistently below 4 per cent of the labor force." Yet,
there have been only seven years since 1949 in which the
unemployment rate has been below 4%. 1 This high level
of unemployment takes its toll on both man and society
as a whole.
Historically, we can see the impact of high unemployment
on both society and individuals. The best example is that
of the Great Depression of the 1930/s. At one point, the
unemployment rate was a staggering 24.9%. Edward Wight
Bakke, Professor of Economics and Fellow of Jonathan
Edwards College =it Yale University, conducted a study of
white Americans thrown out of work during the Depression
years, which makes it clear that the lack of money to live
on is not the only problem of unemployment. He found
that, initially, public assistance for the unemployed was
effective. However after a few months of public assistance,
this program by itself could no longer hold back the
destructive consequences of being without work. A man's
relationships with his family, neighbors, and the whole
community degenerated dramatically. These unemployed
men felt useless and unwanted by society. Once this process
began, only work could enable a man to regain his position
as a valued member of society.
Today, we find a similar problem. An article in Psychology
Today, August, 1975, by Dr. Dorothea Braginsky, research
psychologist at Fairfield University, and Dr. Benjamin
Braginsky, teacher at Wesleyan University, shows much the
same results as the previously mentioned study conducted
by Bakke. In their article they reported a study done on
46 jobless men compared to 53 employed men. From
questionnaires given to the men they concluded that
Most of these jobless men felt unwanted by society.
More than two thirds agreed with such propositions
as: "Society doesn't value you unless you can do
something for it," and "Society judges your worth
by the product of your labors."2
These men felt useless. Disruptions in lifestyles, lower
sense of personal worth, and lack of confidence are among
the many wounds caused by unemployment. This damage
is also inflicted on the unemployed man's family, neighbors
and coworkers.
Doctors Braginsky and Braginsky also quote a statement
by M. Harvey Brenner of Johns Hopkins University School
of Hygiene and Public Health, who "fears the current
amount of unemployment will bring a dramatic rise in
mental illness, alcoholism, and suicide."^ Brenner compared
employment figures in the United States from 1922 to
1968 with first admissions to state mental hospitals during
the same period;
The results show a clear inverse relationship that
holds up even for minor declines in all regions of
the country; as employment drops, mental hospital
admissions rise . . . the admission rates ... lag behind
the economic swings, but generally respond within a
year. 4
Besides the psychological harms of unemployment, we
can also see the monetary harm. Arthur M. Okun, recipient
of the Medal for Excellence from Columbia University and
staff economist for the Council of Economic Advisors from
1961 to 1962, states in his book, The Battle Against Unem-
ployment,
When the United States experiences an economic
slump . . . the costs are enormous. At the beginning
of 1971, the actual rate of output of goods and
services was running $60 billion below the potential
output of this nation.5
Later in the same book Okun states.
Statistical evidence from past periods of economic
fluctuations suggests that an extra 1 percentage point
of unemployment blocked as many as 1 million people
from crossing the line of poverty income.6
We see that a small increase in the rate of unemployment
can greatly decrease the national output and decrease the
number of people able to break out of poverty.
It is not difficult to see that unemployment is detrimen-
tal to the unemployed and to society as a whole. The
question now seems to be "What can be done about unem-
ployment in the United States?"
There is no easy answer to that question. If there were
an obvious solution, it would have been implemented by
now. However, we can explore the possibility of implemen-
ting various programs as a contribution to a solution of
unemployment.
During the Great Depression of the 1930's there was
such a high rate of unemployment that no one seemed to
think in terms of the inflationary effects on the economy
in dealing with unemployment. The main problem at the
time was to get as many people as possible out of very
16

first was by direct relief. This form of relief refers to direct
payments of money or goods to the needy without re-
quiring work in return. However, direct relief had severe
critics. Some claimed that it would destroy the will to work
and create many loafers. As we have already seen, this form
of relief is psychologically harmful. President Roosevelt
was opposed to direct relief except as a temporary expedient.
This method of aid failed to provide two of his important
objectives: to restore and maintain the self-respect of
price

recipients, and to preserve, utilize, and develop their skills
and capabilities. These objectives seem to be a part of
American culture.
However, one argument for direct aid was that it
provided the time necessary to implement work programs.
These work programs included the Civilian Conservation
Corps, the National Youth Administration, the Civil Works
Administration, and the Works Progress Administration. At
times there were some 4.35 million households employed
under Federal Works Programs. Besides putting people to
work, these programs also served another useful purpose.
Under the CW A a lone the following projects were completed:
250,000 miles of new and improved roads; repair of 40,000
schools; drainage of hundreds of thousands of acres of
malarial lands; destruction of millions of rats and ticks;
150,000 sanitary privies; 200 swimming pools; and 3,700
playgrounds. There were comparable results from the other
programs also.
It certainly seems easy enough to solve the problem of
unemployment by once again implementing the programs
that existed during the Great Depression. However, with
a small amount of economic theory it can be seen that this
is not possible without creating harmful inflation. We agree
that unemployment is harmful, but a solution to this
problem must not produce considerable harm to the
economy. There is no sense in attempting to eradicate unem-
ployment and its harms if the result will be harmful infla-
tion.
To understand why inflation must exist in a full em-
ployment economy one must understand some basic
economic concepts. The first of these concepts is demand
and supply. If demand and supply curves are plotted on the
same graph (see Figure 1), the intersection of these curves
happens at what is called the equilibrium price ($Y2&gt;. No
matter what price is originally asked for the commodity,
eventually the price will end up at the stable equilibrium
price.
But why does the price eventually have to hit equilibrium?
Say that originally corn producers ask Y-) dollars per bushel
for their corn. At YI dollars per bushel it can be seen from
Figure 1 that consumers will only demand X-| bushels of
corn. The suppliers will be left with a surplus of X2 - XT
bushels of corn. They will decrease the price of the corn
until all of it is sold. With a little thought, one can see that
the only stable price is the equilibrium price. This is $Y2
per bushel. It is at this price that the quantity demanded
equals the quantity supplied. There is no surplus or shortage.
A similar argument can be used for the case where corn
producers originally ask too low a price for their goods.
They see that they have sold all of their corn and that the
demand for corn still exists. The corn sellers can then raise
their prices until equilibrium is reached.
When more people are put to work, the demand curve
shifts to the right of where it was before the increase. When
people have more income, more money is spent. In terms of
Figure 2 the effect is to raise the equilibrium price for goods
(now Y3&gt;. This is what is called demand-pull inflation (see
Figure 2).

reached is if there was an appropriate shift in the supply
curve ($2 in Figure 2). A shift in the supply curve can only
happen with some change in technology or increased produc-
tion that would cause a product to be cheaper to produce.
This is a much more gradual change than the change in
demand caused by increased employment.
Why can't it be assumed that production will increase
enough so that the equilibrium price for goods will be the
same? First, production is limited by the natural resources
available. Second, if the economy is not at maximum
production for the limited resources available because of
unemployment, production can be increased by employ-
ment of more people. But, as will be explained by the law
of diminishing returns, adding more labor will only increase
production of goods up to a certain point. The law of
diminishing returns states that
as successive units of a variable resource (say, labor)
are added to a fixed resource (capital), beyond some
point the extra, or marginal, product attributable to
each additional unit or variable resource will decline.?
To illustrate what is meant by the law of diminishing
returns, say that originally there is a fixed amount of land,
100 acres, and no labor. If one unit of labor is added, 2,000
units of corn will be produced. By the law of diminishing
returns, if one more unit of labor is added the result may
be 3,000 units of corn total output. This is an increase of
1,000 units for an added input of one unit of labor added
compared to 2,000 units produced for the first unit of labor
added. This effect continues until a point when if more
labor is added, the result is little or no increase in output.

Unemployment Rate (%)
Figure 3
This is another reason that the supply curve can not change
dramatically by providing extra labor.
The net result of increasing employment is to raise the
equilibrium price of commodities, as can be seen in Figure 2.
The compatibility of full employment and price stability
can also be examined by the following graphical data, the
Philips curve.
The annual rate of inflation is plotted on the verticle
axis and the unemployment rate is plotted on the horizontal
axis. It can be seen from Figure 3 that there is indeed a trade-
off between full employment and inflation. As employment
increases, the rate of price level increase is also higher. The
data of unemployment rates and the rate of price level
increase was taken from the years 1955 to 1973.
So far, the type of inflation discussed has been demand-
pull inflation. Cost-push inflation also exists as employment
increases. As more people are employed, labor unions make
increasing demands for higher wages. Increasing prosperity
will tend to enhance the willingness of business to grant
wage demands. Fuel is added to the fire of inflation.
Inflation can be extremely harmful to an economy. A
good example of this is the inflationary period experienced
in Germany during the 1920 and 1930's. The rate of
inflation was so high that money became worthless. Food
riots took place because farmers would not take money for
the food they produced. People took money in shopping
bags to the store to buy one loaf of bread. The entire
economic system collapsed.
The example of Germany during the 1920 and 1930's is
a case of extremely high inflation. Employing the 8.2% of
the labor force that is currently unemployed in the United
States may not cause a complete collapse of the American
economy, as happened in Germany, but inflationary harms
will still be felt by many Americans. Those people on
fixed incomes, lenders of money, and people who have most
of their savings in the bank will experience real monetary
losses due to inflation. Even people who obtain increases
in wages to keep up with inflation still feel cheated by
inflation.
We can see that achieving full employment and price
stability at the same time, at least in a capitalist economy, is
an impossible task. Apparently, the best that can be done
is to carefully weigh the risks of unemployment and infla-
tion and to precede with a suitable economic policy from
this data.

by Randy Warsaw
Side by side we wait the night; and the darkest of the morn.
I hear the voice of thunder down in the valley below.
I'm waiting for the angels of Avalon, waiting for the Eastern glow.
I
J. Page and R. Plant
"Sure, sure they were looking for a few good men,"
Johnson thought. "Well at least they had one good schnook!
What the hell am I doing here? I joined a peace-time Marine
Corps, and who the hell would have guessed I'd be here
with an M-18 on my back, ready to kill? I don't even
believe in killing, I've never done it; what if I can't?"
Mark Johnson's mind was tortured with uncertainty as
the mercury climbed past one hundred fifteen degrees.
"Why, why, why? Why did I sign up, why did I marry,
why am I here?" were questions that now plagued his
mind. All the answers that seemed so simple last week
were now as complicated as the meaning of the Universe.
He had signed up because of the double digit inflation,
the lack of employment opportunities at home, and his
desire to see the world. He had been singled our during
basic training because of his skills as an engineer. Later,
trained in small scale tactical nuclear warfare, he rational-
ized that he was here because the Russians gave "them"
the bomb. With captured delivery systems "they" pose a
threat to the entire free world. He had married one week
ago for love.
One week alone in nowhere was enough to cause
Johnson's mind to think again. It was the first time since
college. He wasn't thinking very fast, but a week is enough
time to realize that you have been victimized by the Fates,
by the Government, and by your own mind. The heat was
incredible. It burned and blistered his fair skin. His mother
was dark, an Arab-American of Syrian descentand his father
was Canadian.
He now wished his skin was a little darker. Then the sun
wouldn't burn it so badly. The odds implied he probably
wouldn't have to treat these sunburns. The G2 unit estimated
a probability for survival of one percent. There were eight
men involved so he had a one in twelve chance of survival.
Survival now was the only thing that he wanted. His
wife of one week didn't know that Johnson was in one of
those damned if you do, damned if you don't situations. If
he succeeded, he would probably be dead. If captured,
suicide: if he didn't attempt his mission he yvould be shot.
He was according to G2 too intelligent.
Though, . . . thinking was all he could do for two more
days. Thoughts of breeder reactor banning in 1978, then
thoughts of nuclear power banning in 1979. The use of gas
by industry was banned, due to shortages. Coal was used
too extensively. The clean air coalition now demanded an
end to coal power due to the smog alerts and deaths across
the country. Oil was priced out of the market. The Russians
were trading nuclear arms for cheap oil. It was a joke, art,*
outrageous joke upon mankind. "The Saudies," thought ■
Johnson, "didn't pose any threat with their five warheads
I
LJsand mile delivery systems. Why would I want
to do this? Who is his right mind would?" In the words of
Intelligence, "Secure a foreign base, activate attack systems,
and create a flower."
The wait time was almost ovei; two hours until sunrise.
Sunrise was when Johnson and his company could see well
enough to bypass the alarms, and with small neutron devices
nate the base to a point where little resistance would
be met. Johnson was briefed to speak only Arabic. What
eally matter? In the ensuing massive takeover of
Saudi Arabia by the Marines, everyone would know who
it was. ■
First dawn, a time when light peeks out; possibly the
last time Johnson would see the dawn. The mile trek to
the base had started. From now on he was committed. It
would be all automatic. First the alarms. Then the neutron
device would be planted. Simultaneously the neutron devices
would be exploded by the eight men, at dawn, from a
half mile range. One hour of waiting, then a brief waltz
through the base mercykilling all the inhabitants. No
resistance would be found. The enemy was too busy
wretching. Then the aiming of the missile. After the arming
would come the firing. A large, very large flower would
blossom over Riyadh. Then the escape.
As Mark Johnson ran past the empty sentry post he
felt queezy. He had not killed on a small scale, but had
killed one hundred people on the desert base. At first he
rationalized that they were dying of radiation sickness and
it was merciful, but then the sinking feeling of killing the
major percentage of a city's population crept into his
mind. The gnawing hatred of himself weighted his gut down
so badly his run turned into a stagger. The idea that he was
only following orders quickly appeared in his brain, but
disappeared as fast as it came. He might have been only
one eighth responsible for the deaths, but was this not
mass murder?
The paths of the eight men spread radially out from the
base, like the legs of a laige tarantula, to their individual
pick-up spots. Johnson thought "Only five miles to go.
Then a hot bath and home to my wife, Marie." It occurred
to him that he had been selfish to have married a woman
in full knowledge of his participation in a suicide mission.
But after all, he had made it; he had beaten the odds! Only
one mile to the pick up spot.
The guilt that suddenly overcame him was overbearing.
What had he done? He killed off ten thousand Marie and
Mark Johnsons over something as ridiculous as oil. The
thought was enough to turn his stomach. After vomiting,
Mark's mind was more at ease. Suddenly, an overwhelming
feeling of gloom struck, more intense than when the bomb
went up. Mark glimpsed a bleeding sore on his right hand. He
knew. The nausea, the sores; radiation! He wouldn't
make it over the next mile to the pickup point. As he sank
to his knees to wretch, he pieced it all together. There would
be no pickup or invasion. It was the final joke. The scheme
was cooked up by Intelligence to discredit the Russians.
Those lying sons of bitches!" screamed Mark. "Marie!"
In the distance was a bright glow. Like a sun. It must
ave been the flower of a twisted mind.


Who Owns the Sea?
by Ric Lee
Freedom of the seas has been a traditional pillar of
American foreign policy. Historically sovereignty extended
three miles beyond a nations' shores (the range of an 18th
century land-based cannon); all else was high seas (some
340 million square kilometers of about 67% of the earth's
surface), open to all, with each ship governed by the law of
the land whose flag it flew.
As the pressures of population growth intensified, nations
looked more hopefully to the resources of the seas to
supplement the dwindling resources of the land. In 1966
the U.S. Congress extended American fishing rights to 12
miles, and some other countries went even further. The
doctrine of freedom of the seas was losing out to a doctrine
of guarding one's own national interests.
Today the situation is even more threatening. Prodded by
a world food shortage, enormous factory ships swoop up
masses of fish thousands of miles from their home ports,
thereby endangering species and competing with domestic
fisheries. Industrial nations have found ways to lift the
nodules of rich minerals from the deep seabed, and the
developing countries, seeking a new economic order, are
demanding a share of the wealth. Pollution is encroaching
on the marine environment, making global curbs essential.
Nations in the 1970's are wondering just how much freedom
of the seas is desirable.
The negotiations in Caracas in 1974, Geneva in 1975,
and New York in March 1976 are billed as the Third United
Nations Law of the Sea (LOS) Conference. The first LOS
Conference in 1958 resulted in international agreements on
several issues, but failed to fix the width of the territorial
sea. Fewer than half the world's nations ratified these
conventions. A second attempt in 1960 also failed.
Throughout the negotiations the battle lines have been
drawn on economic, not political, lines. A coalition of
underdeveloped nations calling itself the "Group of 77",
now numbering more than 100 countries, is attempting to
influence a new world economic order, while another
allianceof 50"land-lockedand geographically disadvantaged"
states is seeking to protect its own interests.^
In Geneva, at the First United Nations Conference on the
Law of the Sea in 1958, world-wide recognition was given
to coastal state rights over the continental shelf up to
water depth of 200 meters, or even deeper if technologically
exploitable.
Since most of the negotiating has gone on behind closed
doors, it is almost impossible for the press, or anyone not
familiar with the detailed task of the Conference, to
evaluate its work. Following the ten-week session in Caracas
in 1974 and the eight-week session held in Geneva in the
spring of 1975, several definite trends began to evolve.
Particularly in the Second Committee, charged with the
more traditional ocean law issues — navigation, fishing, and
the definition and status of the various emerging jurisdic-
tional zones — the concept of a 12-mile territorial sea
coupled with an "exclusive economic zone" to extend 188
miles beyond were among the many key provisions. As the
term implies, the coastal states were given, in their
respective zones, the control of both living and non-living
resources. Only the oceans beyond 200 miles clearly
remain "high seas", while the deep sea-bed, "the common
heritage" area and its resources, would be subject to the
management of the new international regime being fashioned
by the first Committee.2
When the General Assembly established an Ad Hoc
Sea-Bed Committee in 1967, its main objective was to
examine the question of a new world regime for the floor
of the oceans and the mining of their mineral resources.
Before that goal could be realistically addressed, there
were related and interrelated questions that needed to be
clarified, first among them being the question of national
jurisdiction. To put this in another way, before the code
could be written for the international area of the sea-bed,
it first had to be agreed upon where the area began.
The issue which made the most progress at the New
York session was the one that has always been the most
difficult for the 150-odd countries to negotiate; control of
the deep seabed area beyond the limit of national jurisdic-
tions. In 1970 the General Assembly had declared the sea
bed, its subsoil, and the resources which lie beyond the
various economic zones to be the common heritage of
mankind. No state or person could claim or acquire any
rights to these resources, except in accordance with the
provisions of the Convention which were to be drafted by
the Conference.3
It is over the common heritage area that the Conference,
since its inception, has been the most seriously split. On the
one hand, the advanced industrialized countries, led by the
United States, which have the technical capability to
20
Michigan Technic


undertakedeep-sea nodule mining have insisted on guaranteed
and secure access as essential to the large capital investments
that will be required for actual production. On the other
hand, the Group of 77, have favored a monopolistic
authority with effective controls over marketing and pro-
duction so as not to jeopardize the economics of developing
countries who are often landbased producers of minerals
contained in the deep-sea nodules. 4
Just prior to and continuing through much of the
spring 1976 session in New York, a small negotiating
group (including the United States, developing land-based
mineral producing countries, and moderate landlocked
countries) suggested treaty provisions which struck a com-
promise between the two extremes. The central feature
of the package was acceptance of a duel access system,
giving the industrialized countries assured access to one-half
of the manganese nodule fields, while leaving the balance
of the sites to be developed by the Enterprise arm of the
new International Seabed Authority.
The provisions also contemplated an interim production
limit tied to the annual growth of the nickel market to
protect land-based producers. However, the efforts of the
negotiating group were in vain because at the New York
session, the Group of 77 simply refused to accept the new
text. They sought instead to introduce proposals that would,
in effect, scrap the dual access system in favor of the all-
powerful monopolistic International Seabed Authority
controlling access to seabed minerals.
The International Seabed Authority would be created
based on the principle of sovereign equality of all members.
The Authority will comprise an Assembly (in which each
state will have one vote), a Council, a Governing Board, a
Tribunal, and a Secretariat. The Authority would hopefully
generate substantial revenue to be equally shared among its
members. Such an arrangement would exclude the United
States and other developed countries and their nationals
due to the fact that the Group of 77 comprises the majority
of the countries seeking the Authority.
Toward the end of the second session in the summer of
1976 in New York, Secretary of State Kissinger attempted
to break the deadlock by offering to see to the financing
of the Enterprise arm of the Authority which would enable
it to begin operation of the Authority's share of the mine
sites simultaneously with those of the developed world.
While of interest to the developing nations, the proposals
came too late in the session to act as a catalyst for a
compromise.
Sessions in 1977 began with a ray of hope. Most of the
provisions were agreed upon. However, there were last-minute
changes that went against the United States. These last-
minute changes rendered the first Committee text, in the
words of Ambassador Elliot L Richardson, "fundamentally
unacceptable" to the United States. The disagreement
centered on scientific research.
Norman A. Wulf, special counsel for international
matters with the general counsel's office at the National
Science Foundation, explained 'the United States' position.
He pointed out that the roots of this dispute are anchored
in the 1958 convention, which requires consent of the
coastal state for any research on the continental shelf. "If
these same provisions are extended to the economic zone
so far as all research is concerned, it would bring 37%
of the oceans under the unlimited discretion of the coastal
states," he said. "The U.S. is trying to avoid this."
The opposing positions looked like this: the "Group of
77" favored total consent of the coastal state on all research
within the 200-mile economic zone. The USA and its
supporters were seeking freedom to conduct research within
obligations defined by international law. Wulf outlined
seven proposals that the U.S. delegation felt would protect
December 1977

continued research. They are:
• advance notification to the coastal state of a research
project
the right of participation by the coastal state
the sharing of data and samples
assistance, if necessary, in understanding the data
submission of a final report and conclusions
certification that the project is being conducted by a
bone fide research institution
• compliance with environmental regulations according
to the LOS treaty
Throughout this debate, the landlocked and geographically
disadvantaged countries have argued for the right to be
informed of research in neighboring coastal waters and to
receive information and participate if they desire.6
At present, mining the ocean's mineral riches is the
main disputed point in the Conference. Three trillion
dollars worth of nickel, copper, cobalt, and manganese are
tied up into potato-shaped nodules scattered throughout
the ocean floor. An estimated 1.6 million metric tons of
manganese nodules are presently on the Pacific Ocean
pelagic sediments.? The nodules have been estimated to
form at a rate of about six million metric tons per year
in the Pacific Ocean. Even if only 10% of the nodule depo-
sits prove economic to mine, sufficient supplies of many
metals in these sea-floor deposits should last for thousands
of years at our present rates of consumption. As in the case
with many mineral deposits of the sea, the manganese
nodules would be a renewable resource.8 The nodules lie
in waters that are truly international and are beyond the
limits of national jurisdiction.
Recently, the third-world nations have retreated from
their original contention that this "common heritage of
mankind" ought to be mined exclusively by the International
Seabed Authority. Now the hard bargaining is centered on
the parallel system. Under the parallel system, which the
United States favors, a company wishing to mine the
seabed would propose two sites to the Authority, which
would assign one to the applicant and put the other site in
a "bank". The Authority could then decide to mine the
reserve site itself or assign it elsewhere. In 20 to 25 years
a review conference would be held to assess the seabed
system and recommend changes as needed. The main
problem with the system is that neither side trusts the
other. The developing nations are concerned that even if the
needed sums of money (up to $800 million for each mining
operation) are available, they will still be denied the
necessary technical assistance.9
How much power the International Seabed Authority
will have over each group is another matter of dispute.
In addition, while the Conference argues, the U.S. Congress
may act unilaterally.10 jhe consortia have been lobbying
for legislation that would authorize them to begin mining
in mid-ocean before the Conference reaches agreement.
Three deep-sea bills are now before Congress and are being
considered in various committees. 11 Congress has been
carefully monitoring the Law of the Sea negotiations.
Whether or not legislation is enacted will depend largely
on the outlook for agreement on an acceptable treaty text.
The Carter Administration opposes legislation as it stands.12
Are there reasonable solutions to the problems? The
Christian Science Monitor gives these suggestions: First, the
Conference participants must recognize that the consortia
cannot keep their funds available indefinitely and should
avoid excessive bickering. Second, Congress must continue
to resist the temptation to go ahead unilaterally, despite
pressure from industry. The White House can help by
continuing to discourage hotheads on Capital Hill. Third,
for their mutual benefit, both industrial and developing
countries must soon agree on a strong but completely
impartial seabed authority to ride hard on maritime miners
as well as adjudicate other matters.13
The fate of the New York conference was postponed due
to the black out. At present, the Law of the Sea treaty,
affecting the $18 billion-a-year fishing industry, the rights
of maritime powers to free transit of the oceans, exploration
for offshore oil and mineral deposits, and regulations
concerning navigation, pollution and scientific research is
unsettled.

50 Years Ago
What do you associate with America? Hot dogs? Football?
Skyscrapers? For Mr. R.W. Sexton, a prominent Detroit
architect, skyscrapers represented the style of architectural
design that was "distinctly American." In his article,
"Unifying Architecture in America," which appeared in the
January 1928 issue of the Technic, Sexton brings out that
due to the diversity of the United States, particularly in its
climates, this country really had no distinctive type of
architecture such as other countries and locations had. He
cited differences such as the Spanish style in the Southwest,
the Grecian influence in the Middle Atlantic states, and in
New England the characteristics of "early American inhabi-
tants."But the new style which was making its appearance
at that time, particularly in New York, was the skyscraper,
and for the first time in the history of the country there
was "a style of architectural design that we can definitely
point out as being distinctly American, in a truly national
sense."
But any good thing can be overdone and the new
skyscrapers were no exception. At first ornamentation was
placed second in design to their sheer size, and the result
was "the architecture in our cities became a conglomeration
of elongated boxes and ill-proportioned towers, marvelous
feats of engineering skill, but lacking in their design, the
very basic principles on which architecture is founded. With
buildings striving to outdo one another in height, the
streets became canyon-like in appearance, the sun finding
its way there for an hour or two during the middle of the
day, playing havoc with business, the very thing which the
tall buildings were indended to aid most."
The problem was remedied by imposing zoning laws.
In New York City, for example, a structure was allowed to
rise a certain maximum height straight up from the street
line, which was determined by the width of the street
upon which it faced. If the building continued beyond that
point it must from there slant backwards and be kept
"within a line drawn from the center of the street through
the top of the wall on the street or building line." A
provision further stipulated that twenty-five per cent of the
area of the plot of the building may be carried to an un-
by Karen Zahn
limited height, giving rise to the towers frequently seen on
skyscrapers.
25 Years Ago
Publication of the December 1952 issue marked the
Technic's 70th anniversary (which means that with this
issue we celebrate our 95th anniversary.) The magazine that
month featured a look-back of features the Technic had
presented and also looked at the way the Technic itself
had been run. One of the articles was entitled "The Organiza-
tion of the Technic" and was written by Marjory Maurer
who at that time was the Assistant Associate Editor. The
article described the internal organization and the steps of
putting together the magazine at that time. A schedule of
events for putting together one month's magazine is set
forth in considerable detail.
This is a good time at which to bring out the way the
Technic is put together today. The magazine receives no
money from the College or the University; expenses are
paid for by local and national advertisements. Any student
or faculty member may submit an article. The deadline
for submitting an article is the first week of the preceding
month of publication, eg., December's deadline is the
first week of November. The articles are read, and if the
decision is made to publish them, they are edited and sent
to the typesetters. The typesetters type the articles into
the ordered columns that appear in the magazine.
The finished copy is returned to us after approximately
one week. Then the fun begins. Several days and nights are
spent arranging the copy, drawings, and photographs into a
magazine format. Once the articles are laid out and taped in
place the completed pages are ready to be taken to the
printers. At the printers the pages are photographed, and
the negatives are used to make metal plates. The metal
plates are used on an off-set printing press to print 2500
copies of the magazine. This process takes about three
weeks. The Technic is then distributed free of charge at
several locations in East and West Engineering. An awful lot
of somethinq goes into each issue. Ask Mutad, he knows!

In the beginning there was Aristotle,
And objects at rest tended to remain at rest.
And objects in motion to come to rest.
And soon everything was at rest.
And God saw that it was boring.
Then God created Newton,
And objects at rest tended to remain at rest.
And objects in motion tended to remain in motion,
And energy was conserved and momentum was conserved
and matter was conserved.
And God saw that it was conservative.
Then God created Einstein,
And everything was relative,
And fast things became short.
And straight things became curved,
And the universe was filled with inertial frames.
And God saw that it was relatively general,
but some of it was especially relative.
Then God created Buhr,
And there was the principle,
And the principle was quantum.
And all things were quantified.
But some things were still relative,
And God saw that it was confusing.
Then God was going to create Furgeson,
And Furgeson would have unified.
And she would have fielded a theory,
And all would have been one,
But it was the seventh day,
And God rested.
And objects at rest tend to remain at rest.
The Thermo Song
Free energy and entropy were swirling through his brain
With partial differentials and Greek letters in their train.
For Delta, Sigma, Gamma, Beta, Epsilon and Pi
Were driving him distracted as they danced before his eye.
Heat content and fugacity were whirling in his mind.
Like molecules and atoms that you never have to wind.
With logarithmic functions doing cakewalks in his dreams.
And partial molar quantities devouring chocolate creams.
They asked him on the final if a mole of any gas
In a vessel with a membrane through which hydrogen could pass
Were compressed to half its volume what the entropy would be.
If two thirds delta sigma equalled one half delta P.
He said he guessed the entropy would have to equal four,
Unless the second law would bring it up a couple more.
But then it might be seven if the thermostat were good,
Or it might be almost zero if once rightly understood.
The professor read his paper with a corrugated brow.
For he knew he'd have to grade it, but he didn't quite know how.
Till a sudden inspiration on his cerebellum smote,
And he seized his trusty ball point pen, and this is what he wrote.
Just as you've guessed the entropy, I'll have to guess your grade.
But the second law won't raise it to the mark you might have made.
For it might have been one hundred if your guesses had been good.
But I guess it will be zero until rightly understood.

Enjoy college
Education not only makes life more interesting but eventu-
ally brings more influence in society than can be expected
by those who have never bothered to read, study, listen, and
reflect on the pleasure and pain of it all. That includes influ-
ence as articulate citizens, customers, and investors.
Nevertheless, the truth in this may not be apparent right
out of college when a desire for steady income leads some
B.A.'s to come to us with a major in, say, political science or
Romance languages, seeking a start toward an executive
career. We listen and then ask, "Are you a born salesperson
and how can you prove it?"
In a way, that question reflects our own limitations. For a
person well educated in something other than technical
fields, it is usually only in sales that we can match qualifi-
cations to openings.
For you, who may have lost out on some of the pure
pleasure and sheer fun of college because of the kind of
technical courses you've had to grind away at, the choice can
be wider. Sales is just one possibility. You can also consider
research, development, design, manufacturing, and various
combinations of those. Decision-makers throughout our or-
ganization, in work often far removed from the subject mat-
ter of a technical curriculum, first attracted interest by their
success in coping with technical problems. Then, having
demonstrated an ability to lead, they exercised their option
to move on to broader responsibilities. That sort of choice,
for the outset of a career and later, is earned in courses
where quantitative thinking rather than personal opinion is
demanded.
This includes choice from among other technologically
oriented organizations just as good as we are for an inter-
esting life. If it's us you want to challenge, so signify to

The subject of safety is very much in the news these days with more and more
products coming under attack as being dangerous to the public. With DDT, PBB,
polyvinyl chloride, red dye #2, and cyclamates is your life much more endangered
now than it would have been 50 or 100 years ago? What constitutes a health
hazard? What exactly is the definition of safety — or does one even exist?
Former editor Ray Barry returns to contribute an article that discusses these
questions and attempts to define safety. It is titled "Caution — Life May Be
Hazardous To Your Health."
Continuing with the theme of safety, Bruce Young reports on the findings
of research being conducted in the Industrial Engineering Department on the
topic of carpal tunnel syndrome. Carpal tunnel syndrome is an affliction affecting
the hands and wrists and is believed to be caused by certain types of job-related
activities. A description of the disease and what can be done to combat it is
discussed in his article, "Carpal Tunnel Syndrome."
The Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) was created
to regulate safety and health standards in this country's industries. Steve
Hannah describes the job OSHA is doing and raises some questions as to
whether they're doing more harm than good, particularly in economic aspects.
This is Steve's first article for the Technic. entitled "OSHA: Costly Crusaders."
He is a sophomore in electrical engineering.
The topic of travel in time and space has been speculated ever since H.G.
Wells wrote his captivating novel. The Time Machine . Aerospace senior Darwin
Ho puts forth the scientific evidence for (the discovery of black holes and
distorted time-space curvatures) and the present restrictions (such as the inability)
of man to travel faster or approaching the speed of light) on travel through time
in his article, "Hyperspace Travel."
A new type of non-destructive testing is being tested here at the University
in the Mechanical Engineering Department. Often it is desired to test an object
without destroying it for further use, hence the name non-destructive testing.
Nolan VanGaalen looks into this new method of testing and explains it in his
article, "Ultrasonic Synthetic Aperture Focusing as a Method of Non-destructive
Testing."
The issue ends, as usual, with "The Michigan Technic 25 and 50 Years Ago"
by Karen Zahn. Art work this month was again done by J.P. McCarthy and
photographs were by Robert Wang.

Life May Be
by Ray Barry
The message we seem to be getting from the media is
that our health, if not our very lives, are endangered by the
very same technology that supports our existence. The
barrage of warnings is ceaseless: DDT, PCB, poly vinyl-
chloride, nitrous oxides in the air, unsafe automobiles,
radiation, food poisoning, sweeteners, contraceptives, fall-
out, fluorocarbons, noise pollution, x-rays, cosmetics,
ad infinitum. One might begin to wonder how we ever
manage to survive past the age of 25. Controversies begin
and crises of this type often arise because of the uncertain-
ties and complexities of the concept of safety.
Hazardous
To Your Health
As scientists and engineers one of our daily concerns is
with the concepts of risk and safety. It makes no difference
what aspect of engineering you eventually become involved
with, be it product engineering, manufacturing, quality
assurance, sales and marketing, maintenance, or product
supervision. In the end, something for which you have been
responsible will have the potential for causing harm, big
or small. It is essential that we, the bastions of technology,
have a thorough understanding of risk, safety, what they
involve and how they are determined.
We've Come A Long Way, Babe
At one time or another we've all heard the doomsayers
who preach that our technology has brought us to the brink
of destruction. The solution they offer is full retreat. Before
jumping to any such rash conclusions, let's step back and
take an historical perspective. To make the comparison
fair, we'll stick to modern times and not go back to an era
when life was completely miserable.
Imagine, for a moment, what life would be like if we
lived with the technology of the early 1900's. (Ignoring
the fact we wouldn't be able to feed all of us.) Every home
has two houses (ah! the luxury!). The second is a small,
fly infested, one-room arrangement that never stays upright
on Halloween; a seat of disease, if you'll pardon the
expression. All water is hand-pumped, rarely checked for
quality, and the well is fed from the basement of the little
house out back. Talk about disease!
Prefer life in the big city? Replace all the cars with
horses dropping their doings as they trample over broken
cobblestone streets. After a hard day of abuse (12 hours)
in the sweatshop you can relax to the peaceful clash and
clammer of the overhead trains. Of course, the air pollution
from cars would be gone; instead the air is fouled with coal
dust and soot, the same as peoples' lungs. Coal is the major
fuel for cooking, heating, and industry.
Not feeling well? Because of the poor sanitary conditions
it's likely that you've caught the latest wave of diptheria or
one of the leading fatal diseases: pneumonia, influenza, or
tuberculosis. Don't worry though, there are plenty of
"potent" medicines to ease any ill you might have. There
is only one problem; many do more harm than good. The
leading antiseptic is the very corrosive carbolic acid. No
matter, with all those "natural" foods, uncontaminated
with modern pesticides and herbicides, you'll quickly re-
cover. Fruits and vegetables are coated with the insecticide
lead arsenate, a toxin. Canned foods are preserved with
sulfites, boric acid, and formaldehyde. The leading red dye
is lead chromate, a substance most chemists prefer not to
handle, much less injest.
So you're moving to the'farm where it's safer? Don't
forget the dangers of axes, kicking mules, biting insects, hot
laundry kettles, tetanus-inducing implements, and spoiled
food.
The point is made: Technology is here to stay because
we are far better for it. One might say that we now have

hardly be noticed next to yesteryear's. We have conquered
many of the classic threats to our existence and know much
more about others. Compared to malaria, typhoid, polio,
and tuberculosis, worries about sweeteners are trivial. Infant
mortality is down to 2%, the biosphere is slowly, if pain-
fully, clearing up, and food poisoning is rare.
Human activity always involves risk. If ours are more
subtle, they are also more monstrous and frightening. The
potential consequences exceed anything known before.
Innovation occurs so fast we struggle to keep on top of it.
Technology often reaches the market and becomes ingrained
in the economy before it is fully scrutinized and its conse-
quences fully understood. The automobile has become such
a key part of our society and economy that we are faced with
it as such. One of the important tasks is to learn how to
prevent this from happening.
If at times there seems to be no end to the list of
products which endanger us, it is important to remember
that serious government research is little more than a decade
old. The environmentalist's crusades of the '60's have
caused the government to take a closer look at many
common products. With millions of products to survey
they logically started with the most suspect; therefore, it's
not surprising that a large number of dangerous products
are being found.
How Much Will You Bet?
A workable definition of a safe thing is one with risks
which are judged to be acceptable. Everything involves
some degree of risk; the key is often in deciding what is
acceptable. This is often a political task, a decision made
through political channels. Before something can be judged
acceptable, the risks must be known and measured along
with the benefits so that there are some rational means of
determining its acceptability.
There is a mistaken conception that scientists measure
safety. Scientists measure risk, not safety. Keeping the two
processes separate is essential. Much confusion and mistrust
can be brought about by a scientist who steps over the line
and makes a value judgment about whether something is
acceptable or safe. Saying that scientists determined a thing
to be safe is misleading, if not semantically incorrect. By
whose standards is it safe? As we shall see, there are many
different bases on which to judge safety. Under one set
of circumstances a thing can be judged safe, and under
another, unsafe. Safety is highly relative, changing from
time to time and place to place. DDT is a good example. In
the United States DDT is rarely used because there are other
nearly as effective pesticides and the threat of pesticides is
low. In temperal climates and underdeveloped countries
where every scrap of food must be preserved and the threat
of insect-spread disease is great, DDT is widely used. It's the
only effective, economical solution; the threat of cancer is
minimal compared to starvation and plague.
Engineers, as opposed to scientists, often enter into the
realm of determining safety. They are called upon to make
value judgments. Is the threat of electrical shock from a
certain appliance as minimal as economically feasible? Will
the bridge carry traffic under the worst conditions? Is it
worth spending more money to design a safer car? Has
everything practical been attempted to prevent radiation
leakage from a nuclear plant, and is it enough? A particular
responsibility for public safety lies in the hands of engineers
because the public has placed their trust in them.
Searching for Clues
The business of measuring risk is not always a clear-cut
or precise endeavor. There are many sources of evidence to
be drawn upon. In choosing which route of analysis to
followone must consider the reliability, accuracy, availability,
and pertinence of the various sources of data. Some of the
common sources are listed below.
Traditional or folk knowledge. Many dangerous practices
have been discovered by experience and passed on from
generation to generation. The dangers of lead in glazings on
pottery were well known by the Romans.
Analogy to known cases. A well known fact is that
thresholds exist where sound pressure levels become
damaging to the ear. Do other hazards have threshold
levels?
Experiments on humans. These yield the most reliable
results but involve questions of ethics. More later.
Reviews of inadvertant exposure. Many times accidents
occur exposing people to hazardous situations. Although
the occurrences are regrettable, it would be foolish not to
take advantage of the situation to learn about conditions
that would be unethical under other circumstances.
Epidemiological surveys. This is merely a statistical
analysis. An epidemiological study in Pasteur's time related
dog bites to rabies.
Experiments on non-humans. The animal kingdom is
the common source of data on the effects of Pharmaceuti-
cals and new medical technology.
Product performance tests. There are many laws and
voluntary regulations regarding the performance of a prod-
uct, requiring it to be licensed or certified before it can be
put into production. Product testing is a very direct and
highly controlled source of information.
Nailing It Down
A classic investigation can be broken down into four
categories, which follow one another in a straightforward,
logical manner.
One. What are the conditions of exposure? If I may
borrow an old cliche; who, what, when, where, and how?
Not to mention how long and with what intensity? This is
the first step, defining the conditions of exposure. It
sounds simple, but it's not. Take air pollution, for
example. It's conditions change from moment to moment.
There are many special cases to consider; the young, the
old, the asthmatic, and the pregnant. Then, of course,
where does one find a control group? The laboratory condi-
tions are less than ideal.

possibility. No two auto accidents are alike, so how is a
passive or active restraint to be evaluated? Is it necessary
to test it in rare types of accidents?
All cynicism aside, John Q. Public must be expected to
misuse anything he gets his hands on. Conditions of
exposure also include common misuse and any user error
that can reasonably be expected. Anticipating all possible
faulty modes is a difficult task. After all, John Q. is very
creative, especially in this area.
Oftentimes the worst case of exposure is more impor-
tant than the mean. The average person may drink very
few artificially sweetened soft drinks. However, safety
standards must be set for dieters and diabetics who may
consume much larger quantities than the average.
Some exposure conditions are terribly subtle and diffi-
cult to trace. The development of new technology has
allowed the detection of small, but significant amounts of
DDT in Alaskans where it is not even used. Detecting
small amounts of a substance in an organism is a tricky
business, especially when one part per million or less can
be significant. The case of DDT is even more elusive since
it degrades into ODD and DDE. Many chemicals are meta-
bolized after entering an organism and hide themselves.
Some have an accumulating effect; once they enter an
organism they don't leave. Certain chemicals have a
favorite type of tissue they like to infest; like the liver
or kidneys or fatty tissue. Concentrating in one type of
tissue, they form concentrations in that particular part of
the organism which are much higher than the concentrations
consumed.
Two. Given that so-and-so has been subjected to what-
chamacallit in such-and-such a manner, what are the
adverse effects? Granted, this question too often gets
asked in the past tense. We see the problem in hindsight -
after it has become aggravated. The early experimenters
with anesthetics had no idea the drugs they tested on
themselves were addictive. Addiction was unknown. The
first radiation experiments exposed the experimenters to
lethal substances they had no reason to believe were not
harmless.
The toughest part about identifying adverse effects can
be knowing what to look for. How will a specific threat
express itself? Is a certain chemical an outright poison or
does it have a chronic effect like causing cancer years later?
The following are examples of common types of injury:
mechanical (cuts and bruises, etc.), chemical and thermal
burns, electric shock, chemical poisoning, irritation or
sensitation of the eyes or skin, etc., carcinogenesis,
mutagenesis, alteration development or teratogenesis, and
behavioral impairment.
Irritations and sensitations can be broken down into two
categories. The first is allergens, that is, substances which
effect different people in different ways and intensities. The
second is irritants, or substances that effect most people in
the same way. Pollen is an allergen, onions are an irritant.
The last four types of injury mentioned above - carcino-
genesis, mutagenesis, teratogenesis, and behavioral impair-
ment, are the most difficult to detect. It is interesting to
note that a carcinogen is defined as a substance that can
cause increased incidence of tumors in lab animals. This is a
controversial one.
Three. Now we ask, what is the relationship between
exposure and effect? Ideally, the answer to this question
would be in hard, fast quantitative terms; exposure of x
number of people to y amount of substance A causes z
percentage of people to become ill. Even more ideally, one
would like to say that x amount of substance A has no
adverse effect and y amount does. Such precision is limited
because people are not uniform. Consequently, statistical
averages are used; x number of people exposed to y amount
of substance A will result in a probability that z number
of people will become ill. That probability is often little
more than a guess.
Four. Considering everything, what is the overall risk?
Important effects must be separated from insignificant.
Which risks are worth worrying about and which are not?
Estimating risk is the scientist's job, and it consists of
supplying enough evidence to decision makers (supposedly
free from bias), so they can make reasonable choices.
It is also the scientist's job to recommend reliable
measuring systems so that standards are meaningful and
can be reliably enforced. Setting a standard for the turbidity
of water ejected from factories would be useless in con-
trolling thousands of colorless but dangerous chemicals.
Flexibility is essential in setting standards; one all-en-
compassing standard may be meaningless in many special
cases. Standards should also be periodically reassessed for
three reasons. First, as our knowledge grows new dangers are
found. Second, as mentioned earlier, the concept of what is
safe changes over time. Third, as technology advances,
better measuring techniques are devised making the stan-
dards obsolete.

Details, Details
Various sources of evidence were mentioned above. To
better understand the problems and intricacies involved in
determining risk and judging safety, we will examine some of
these a little closer.
Frankenstein's Delight
Experiments on humans are essential; they have been
the cornerstone of medical progress and will continue to
remain so. The drug industry, and medicine itself, would
still be in the dark ages if it weren't for chemists who used
themselves as guinea pigs (often in ignorance of the dangers).
In the end, the only test subject that can prove a substance's
or technique's usefulness and risk is man himself. Even so,
many tests cannot be done on man because of practicality
or propriety; certain tests would be outrageously costly
or unethical.
Many substances, like laetril, must be tested not only
on man, but on a particular illness. In such cases suitable
control groups are unavailable. Then, too, is it ethical to
substitute a test substance for a known treatment?
Further ethical questions arise then possible mutagenesis
and teratogenesis are involved. Limiting the dangers to our
own generation is one thing, but when future generations
are threatened, the issue takes on ominous proportions.
In an effort to keep things under control, groups like the
AMA have instituted a code of ethics. The following is a
summary of the AMA code.
1. Experimenters must fully disclose the nature of the
test to the subjects.
2. The voluntary and informed consent of the subject
must be given.
3. Perceived benefits must justify the experiment.
4. All investigations must be conducted under the
direct supervision of certified professionals.
5. Every reasonable precaution must be taken.
6. Both subject and experimenters are free to stop the
experiment at any time.
The problem with such codes is defining what consists
of "voluntary" and "informed". A common practice has
been to use prison inmates, but questions arise whether the
prisoners feel coerced into participation, whether or not
they actually are.
Reasonableness would suggest a graduated approach to
the problem of human experimentation. Starting with

design small scale experiments with humans. Then if the
results are still promising, large scale tests on humans are in
order.
Epidemiologically Speaking
Epidemiological surveys have become a useful tool in
relating cause with effect, especially since the advent of
computers to sort and correlate large amounts of data. The
leading causes on injury are determined by feeding data from
hospital emergency room admissions into a computer which
calculates the frequency of various types of injuries. In-
formation gained from such surveys allows a sensible
setting of priorities and is useful in detecting new or
worsening safety hazards.
Epidemiological surveys can be the early warning sign
pointing toward the need for further investigation, as they
were in relating smoking to lung cancer. Basically it is a
"guilt by association" method that compares data which
are similar except for one aspect. Therein lies a pitfall;
there is always the possibility of unforseen differences.
The biggest failure of epidemiology is one of proof; it
can prove nothing, only implicate and suggest links.
Epidemiology depends on statistics. Statistics do not
always point to the truth. We all know how easy it is to
associate two things. Suppose, for example, the study of
lung cancer was done a little differently and the results
showed that a larger percentage of people who carried
butane lighters got lung cancer than those who didn't.
Therefore butane lighters cause lung cancer. WRONG. The
example may seem absurd but it shows how easily a cause
and an activity remotely related to the cause can be
confused. Then, two unrelated activities can also be easily
related. A good example is the minister who blamed rock
and roll for juvenile delinquency because all juvenile
delinquents listened to rock and roll.
Man's Best Friend
Experiments on non-humans are a key part of modern
research activities. The so-called "meg-mouse" experiments
are responsible for setting the radiation standards for
humans. Using animals not only allows for large scale
experiments, but it provides the only method for tests that
would be unethical if performed on humans.
For the purpose of research, special breeds of animals
have been developed by intensive in-breeding. This keeps the
animals as genetically uniform as possible. Differences
become easier to detect. Some scientists dispute this
technique because in-breeding may breed in or out certain
sensitivities or tendencies which appear randomly in normal
populations.
Passing Grades
Product performance testing is something with which
engineers can relate. It is simply impossible to put a profitable
product on the market without preliminary test models and
extensive testing. Poor reputation for reliability and ex-
pensive warranty repairs can quickly put a company out ot
business. Stress testing is common - the product is exposed
to exaggerated and worst case conditions and checked for
performance. Product failure, as in autos, can be fatal.
Statistical analysis can be used to predict mean times be-
tween failure, but the only reliable information comes from
actual testing and field experience. Life testing is another
common form of testing - running the product until it
fails and then investigating the mode and cause of failure.
If failure is premature, the cause of failure must be corrected.
Deciding which properties of the device to test is the
first step in product performance testing. Initial product
tests invariably result in some fine tuning. As engineers
know all too well, improving one performance specification
often deteriorates another, resulting in the infamous engin-
eering compromise.
Further complication arises when the properties are
difficult to measure. Flammability is one such property.
Different sets of standards have been set for measuring
flammability. The same product subjected to the different
tests yield widely different results. Flammability is a
particularly elusive quality because much of it depends on
the environment, the ambient temperature, the type of
fire used, etc. One test for flammability of mattresses might
measure the diameter of an area which becomes charred
when a lit cigarette is let lie on the mattress. Another might
subject the mattress to a blow torch and measure how long
it takes the mattress to burst into flames. The best type
of test would subject the mattress to the most realistic
conditions possible. Standardization is also desirable so that
meaningful comparisons can be made.
Playing Private Eye
Examining safety issues is often a matter of detective
work. One aspect that demonstrates this is accident-chain
analysis. This is best explained by the following example.
A nuclear bomb is exploded strewing radioactive iodine-131
through the atmosphere. In the form of tiny dust particles
it gets attached to rain drops and falls to earth where it
contaminates grazing pastures. Cows eat the contaminated
grass and the iodine-131, which can substitute itself for
calcium, concentrates in the cow's milk. The milk is
consumed by children and concentrates in their thyroid
glands, exposing them to the risk of thyroid cancer. This is a
scenario that actually happened, but the technique is often
applied to hypothetical accidents, as in PIRGIM's con-
troversial report, "Fallout on the Freeway."
Do Satisfactory Answers Exist?
Because determining risk involves much inference, extrap-
olation, and techniques like accident-chain analysis, the
results are highly subject to interpretation. There are many
"ifs," "maybes," and questions of relevancy that arise,
for example:
• Every possibility, item, or case cannot be tested;
sampling techniques are imperative. The question that must
be answered is, "How many experiments are enough?"

levels. In testing for the incidence of tumors there is always
the possibility that a certain percentage of tumors, which
actually exist, will not be found. Because of limitations in
confidence levels, large numbers of tests are necessary to
be sure the incidence of tumors is low. Finding no tumors
in three million test subjects with tests having 99.9%
confidence levels sets the upper limit of risk at two
tumors per million. These are certainly desirable limits,
but three million tests obviously cannot be performed.
Therefore, sicentists must deal with much less certainty.
• With tests on animals an adverse reaction is not proof
of an adverse reaction in man. Even closely related species
will react differently. The choice of species to use becomes
critical. One would like the choice to be as close to man in all
relevant physiological aspects as possible.
• In experiments with animals where the response isweak
and the effects long term, unrealistically large doses are
often given. This is the only way, in some cases, to see the
effect, but if doses are unrealistic, perhaps the response is,
too. This is one of the controversial issues in the infamous
sweetener tests.
• Is there a realiable way to extrapolate doses given to
animals into doses given for humans? One of the most
common normalizations used is comparative weight ratios -
that is, weight of substance per weight of subject. A newer
method uses weight per area.
Further Complications
Studying the effects of a single substance acting alone is
not always enough. Air pollution, for example, is a mixture
of pollutants. The effects of each pollutant can be studied
individually, but the combined effect would still be un-
known. The combined effect can be synergistic, the
individual effects reinforcing one another to a greater
degree than the simple additive effects. On the other hand,
the effects can be antagonistic or neutralizing. Then again,
they may simply be additive.
The most subtle, difficult to detect risks are low level,
chronic effects such as cancer, which may show up years
after exposure. Acute, immediate hazards show up more
easily in the laboratory, but proving that no chronic
effects exist is more difficult. To simulate low level exposure
over long periods of time, large doses are administered as
already mentioned. Consuming cyclamates at the rate they
were fed to test animals would be humanly impossible;
unfortunately it is the only method available. Chronic
effects are known to exist with some substances; therefore
no substance can be considered free from hazard until it is
shown there are no chronic effects. Primary tests showing no
imminent hazard can only be tentative until long range
effects are known.
Expressing Risk
Convenient ways of expressing risk are necessary so that
safety judgments can be made with a minimum of misinter-
pretation and an optimization between benefits and hazards.
The two basic things that are necessary to express are pro-
bability of harm and severity of harm. One might quote
figures expressing the risk of driving a car in terms of pro-
bability of a fatal accident. The probability would be easily
understood and the severity obvious.
Some risks vary in relation to exposure both in severity
and probability. These relationships might be seen most
easily in graphical form, as a set of graphs showing proba-
bility of varying degrees of severity for specific exposure
levels.
In an effort to put a quantitative number on risk, the
Consumer Product Safety Commission developed a "risk
index." One version is the "frequency-severity index."
Frequency of injury is determined by hospital emergency
room admissions and severity is rated on a scale which
runs from skin irritation at the bottom to death at the top.
Giving each hazard a normalized number allows for easy
comparison, but is it a fair comparison? Simply attaching
a number is completely misleading. The total picture of
each case must be considered individually. There are too
many variables to boil down into a single number, especially
when based on a misleading figure like emergency room
admissions.
Expressing risk in chronic hazards is more difficult. The
"extra death" method has been a widely used figure. The
number of extra deaths due to lung cancer caused by
smoking cigarettes would be one example, but these are
only estimates and depend on the number of people who
smoke. Years of life lost is another familiar expression, for
example, each cigarette subtracts so many minutes of life.
This is a very innaccurate expression, misleading, and no
more than a fabricated number. What's more, it has more
emotional connotations than the "extra death" method
when trying to convince smokers of hazards.
Elusive Acceptability
Acceptability has the characteristic that it cannot be
defined, stated succinctly or be shown to have rational
foundings. What is it that makes a thing acceptable?
Acceptance is a number of things. It may be a passive
continuance of historical momentum, like cigarette smoking.
It may be the result of ignorance or the lack of alternatives.
Acceptability may be a majority mandate or a single
official's decision. The decision to accept something may
not be fair, just, consistent, efficient, or rational. Corrupt
or innocent, the decision can be made deliberately or by
simple lack of decision.
Basically one can think of two levels of decision making.
One is on the professional level; engineers decide how
risk-free to make a product, bridge, dam, etc. Doctors
prescribe medications and treatments. These decisions
represent the values of the people who make the decision.
The second level is on the public or political level, public
officials setting standards and regulations. Oftentimes
decisions must be made immediately, not leaving enough
time to wait for the results of lengthy investigations that

Guidelines
We would probably all recommend reasonableness be
employed in judging whether a particular risk is acceptable.
The concept of reasonableness is too vague and value laden
to be of much help. Is the risk of bodily harm reasonable if
a product user is well aware of the risks, and accepts them
to obtain the benefits, such as in the use of chain saws? We
might agree that preventable risk is not reasonable; pre-
ventable always asks, "At what cost?" Is the cost of
preventing the risk reasonable? Something better than
"reasonableness" is needed for basing judgments. Consider
some of the following bases for judging acceptability.
Common usage. Long usage with unquestioned accepta-
bility can be a guideline. The long usage of glass dinnerware
has shown the risk of breakage and injury to be commonly
accepted. Along these same lines, prevailing professional
practice can be used as a guideline. If something is widely
used in practice, one assumes any adverse effects would
have been found; therefore the risk is acceptable. Implicit
in this assumption is that the practice is widely used by
professionals who know what they are doing and understand
the risks.
Best available practice. This is another useful basis
meaning that the highest practical protection is employed.
The degree of necessity or benefit plays a part in this. The
best available practice may not be good enough if the
benefits do not warrant it.
A widely used and controversial basis is the Oelaney
principle: a thing is not acceptable if it induces cancer in
man or animal. In the opinion of some, it is the best approach
to deal with chemical threats to man; however, it ignores
the possibility of benefit.
Another common basis for determining acceptability is
"no detectable adverse effect," which is nothing more than
an admission of uncertainty.
In toxicology, acceptable exposures are set at "insignifi-
cant" levels. The problem of determining insignificant is not
solved, and is often done arbitrarily. This principle does not
apply to a carcinogen where "insignificant" is harder to
define.
Thresholds are one way of setting acceptable limits.
However, setting thresholds for a widely variant popula-
tion can be a difficult task.
Comparing exposure levels to background levels is
commonly used in determining acceptable radiation limits
but is not limited to that. This is a good criteria in that it
sets exposure levels that won't increase risk over normal
levels. The false assumption is that nature is completely
benevolent.
Occupational exposures, oftenmoreintenseand prolonged
than other types of exposure, can be used to set acceptable
limits if they are found to produce no ill effects. Usually a
suitable safety factor is applied, for example 1/10.
The final guideline we will consider in comparison with
accustomed hazards. The risks of flying are often compared
to the risks of driving on a per mile basis.
Although not a guideline, public referenda is one way
for determining acceptability when the issues get too hot for
politicians to handle.
Considerable Considerations
Judging safety is a normative political activity. It
involves studying the risks and benefits determined by
scientists. It is a value judgment, and as such, bound to be
controversial. The following is a partial list of considerations
to be made by those judging safety.
• Are the risks taken voluntarily, or are they involun-
tarily imposed?
Are the effects immediate or delayed?
Are there alternatives? At what price?
With what certainty are the risks known?
Is the exposure essential or is it a luxury?
Are the risks encountered occupationally, is the
endangered subject being paid to take the risks or is it
encountered non-occupationally? The rationalization is
difficult to explain, but on-the-job risks are often higher
then one would willingly impose on himself.
• Is the hazard a common one or a dread hazard?
Dread hazards often twist issues drawing attention away
from other important issues.
• Who is affected? Average people or sensitive people?
In these terms, what does equal protection under the law
mean?
• Will use be as intended, or is misuse likely? To what
extent should the public pay to protect against potential
misuse?
• Are the consequences reversible or irreversible?
Unfinal Decisions
Now comes the fin ... er, unfinal decision. How safe is
it? In the terms we have been discussing, is the degree of
risk judged to be acceptable? This is the key question to be
answered but not the only one. It must be balanced against
the answers to two other questions.
1. Is the degree of benefit judged desirable?
2. Is the distribution of risks, benefit, and cost judged
fairly?
Given all certainties and uncertainties this is not an easy
task. The task is made easy by quantifying as many variables
as possible, but some things defy quantification. How does
one quantify such things as natural beauty and peace of
mind?

Costly
Crusaders
by Steve Hannah
On April 28, 1971 Congress passed the Occupational
Safety and Health Act which created an organization
whose purpose was to document and cut down the number
of industrial accidents. OSHA (Occupational Safety and
Health Administration) was to be the watchdog and
enforcer of safety laws. OSHA is authorized to set safety
and health standards for nearly all non-government em-
ployers. This included (at the time of its formation) 5
million employers and 60 million out of 80 million workers;
only employers covered by other federal safety programs
or family operated enterprises were exempt.
OSHA, therefore, is a very powerful and influential
organization. It has the power to investigate a company
on a worker complaint basis or on its own incentive. If OSHA
finds something which it feels is a safety hazard it can
impose a fine of up to $1000 a day for the violation or
it can seek court orders to close the facility down. In the
event of any accidental death or disaster injuring 5 or more
workers OSHA is automatically entitled to investigate the
scene and to impose fines or shut the facility down (with
a court order). Any such accidents are to be reported
within 48 hours.
Many Americans tend to think that occupational hazards
are a thing of the past, like sweatshops and child labor. This
is a very dangerous misconception. Workplaces now are
about twice as dangerous as our nation's streets and high-
ways. OSHA officials felt this misconception was due to a
lack of industrial accident statistics. Until OSHA was
formed a relatively small percentage of industrial accidents
were being reported. Early OSHA officials estimated that
once accidents were reported and investigated the number
would double.
Much of OSHA's early dealings were with 4 target
occupations which were abnormally unsafe and had a
high rate of accidents. They were: longshoremen (the
workers were in constant danger of falling crates and
16
unstable loads), meat packers (packers often cut themselves
on the band saws and cutting tools), loggers (workers are
easily crushed by logs and are often in situations where
one slip means death or serious injury), and metal stamping
plants (presses and stampers generate a continuous 115dB,
the threshold of pain being 120dB). These industries were
required to protect their workers from such adverse condi-
tions. The employers felt that protective devices such as
steel toe boots, hard hats, goggles and ear protectors would
provide adequate personal protection along with guards and
safety devices on the machines. OSHA, however, felt that
protective wear was not the answer and began to inquire
about engineering the safety into the machines and into
the workplaces. This line of thought threw OSHA and
businesses into deeper conflict. Businesses had already
started criticism towards the way OSHA went about its
business. Businessmen felt that OSHA was investigating
poorly and that they were getting bogged down by trying
to enforce many small and relatively insignificant things
while letting the major issues slide.
Take, for instance, OSHA's latest main objective:
noise reduction in factories and in products. OSHA at first
had set noise levels at 90dB. Workers were given ear protectors
which met those standards, but OSHA felt that the machines
should operate quietly enough to allow workers to take off
the ear muffs. However, the engineering involved to change
the machines would cost billions of dollars. To make matters
more touchy, OSHA is trying to decrease the noise level
to 85dB. The economic impact of such a level would be
disastrous for industries such as the steel industry, which
is already being undersold by foreign competitors. To get
noise levels down to 90dB will cost the steel industry $476
million, to get noise levels down to 85dB (by re-engineering)
will cost $2.4 BILLION. That's $1.2 million for each
worker in the affected area! Steel officials say they can
provide better protection with $42 per worker ($10 for
hearing protector $12 for noise monitoring, $20 for hearing
checks). If OSHA demanded that this noise level become


Big industries aren't the only ones affected either.
If OSHA comes down hard there will be:
1) A loss of jobs
2) Many small businesses would be forced to close.
3) Some products would cease to be produced.
4) U.S. economy would plummet further into the hole.
OSHA does not realize that not all the technology
exists to economically and successfully quiet down very
noisy environments. Instead, it should try to develop
suitable personal protective devices; this would be much
easier on industry and on the economy.
Several businessmen and corporations have decided
to test the constitutionality and feasibility of OSHA's
power. Recently one Idaho businessman felt that OSHA's
self given right of unnotified, unwarranted search of a
company was a violation of the fourth amendment of the
Constitution, which requires a search warrant. In this case
the businessman won. The case set a precedent for further
OSHA investigations. It might not be too long before OSHA
is required to present a search warrant before it investigates
a company. Other major lawsuits filed against OSHA have
resulted in court rulings which require OSHA to start
considering the economic issues, something which they most
wrongfully neglect.
OSHA has a worthy job to do; this point is not disputed'
by most people. The protection of workers is very
important, but overprotection can prove to be very
detrimental to the economy. Safety cannot be achieved
by just a "safe" machine. The workers must exercise
caution when working because no matter how much
protection exists, there is always a way to get hurt. After
a number of years OSHA realized this; thus the switch
from safety to health regulations. Since it is apparent that
certain health standards may be too costly, OSHA is faced
with the decision between protective wear and costly
redesigning. It may seem nice to have very quiet workplaces
and products, but we simply can't afford to have industries
re-furnishing their production facilities. Until we are able
to develop cheaper methods of noise control, protective
wear and precautions are going to have to do. As far as
quieter products go, consumers have no choice but to buy
whal is available to them. They will also have no choice but
to pay the higher prices that will come along with them.

Aperture Focusing
as a Method of
Non- destructive
Evaluation
by Nolan VanGaalen
In the past few years, increasing emphasis has been
placed on the safety of the processes necessary to meet
society's continued demands for new products and new
sources of energy. In the area of new energy sources espe-
cially, processes involving extreme pressures and tempera-
tures are required to meet this demand. It is only after
great and justified assurances of the safety of a process and
the equipment can it be made that any of these new
processes will be accepted for use.
The best way to be assured of the safety of process
equipment is to test it after it has been built, and this calls
for some form of non-destructive evaluation. Also, as
sections get thicker, NDE is often the most convenient
way of testing the material. Thus, there are strong motives
for research to develop better NDE methods.
Several methods are available and widely used in certain
areas:
1) Radiographic examination by either X-ray or gamma
radiation is commonly used for inspection of pipelines and
welds. However, for the thicknesses of pressure vessels used
in the nuclear power industry, for example, radiographic
methods do not have the penetrating capability.
2) Magnetic particle examination can be used to detect
flaws on or near the surface of magnetic materials but
inclusions or other flaws deep in the interior of the material
cannot be investigated.
3) Liquid penetrant gives similar information and it, too,
is of no use in examination of subsurface flaws.
4) Ultrasonic techniques use high frequency vibrations
(between 1- and 10-million Hz.) transmitted in pulses to
the material by a transducer. The reflection will show
signals representing the front and back surfaces as well as
any flaws between them. Conventional ultrasonic testing has
its disadvantages: strong signals from the surfaces of the
specimen can mask the signal of a discontinuity near one
of the surfaces, and, occasionally misleading results occur
due to the use of the size of the reflected signal to determine
the size of the flaw.
A new and more useful method of ultrasonic testing has
been studied and used here at the University of Michigan
over the past few years. At present, research is being
continued by Mechanical Engineering Professor Julian R.
Frederick, the project's director, and Brian Anderson, the
principal investigator, as well as students Chris Vanden
Broek and Mike Elzinga. The method is known as the
"Synthetic Aperture Focusing Technique for Ultrasonic
Testing", or, SAFT UT.
As in conventional testing, the transducer sends out an
ultrasonic pulse to the specimen and receives its reflection.
Instead of determining the size of a flaw by the amplitude
of the reflection, the SAFT UT system fixes its size by
producing high resolution images of the flaw's boundaries.
As long as the energy of the reflection is detectable, its
actual energy is unimportant. High resolution ensures that
two discontinuities which are very close will not be mistaken-
ly identified as one larger discontinuity. Smaller diameter
transducers do not generally give such high resolutions but
with the synthetic aperture system a large diameter (high
resolution) transducer is synthesized by a computer algorithm
which processes the data. After the part has been scanned
and the data digitized and recorded in the computer's
memory, the synthetic aperture algorithm is employed to
combine them, after they have been phase-shifted, to
produce an image from the summed signal. The SAFT UT
system is able to image and inspect non-horizontal dis-
continuities in a single scan by using a wide beam width
transducer to obtain optimum resolution.
As mentioned earlier, conventional ultrasonic testing
generally fails to clearly distinguish discontinuities close to
the surface since the signal reflected by the flaw is usually

SAFT UT system improves this situation in two ways: First,
it uses a highly damped transducer which causes the surface
signal to decay faster, and secondly, the system contains
programming which subtracts out any or all of the surface
response if it is interfering with a clear signal from the
discontinuity.
Since all the information gathered in the scan is digitized
and stored in the memory or on disc, any part of it may be
retrieved and processed to image any given area of the
specimen at any given depth. Monitoring a growing crack
is made more convenient since previously stored data can
be compared with newly gathered data and the images
printed or displayed on a screen.
Having discussed these characteristics and capabilities of
the SAFT UT system, we now look to the actual equipment
which has been assembled for the system. The object of
the entire exercise is to examine potentially dangerous
flaws in a piece of material. This specimen, whether it be
from a vessel which has been in service or a sample of
material intended for pressure vessel construction, is
mounted on a stand and submerged in water. Water serves
as a very good medium for the ultrasonic transmissions to
and from the specimen.
The transducer is suspended a few inches above the
specimen on an assembly which is controlled by the
computer to move in x and / directions. The computer used
here is a 32-bit minicomputer with 256k bytes of core
memory. The boundaries of the specimen and the scan grid
distances are entered by the operator and the scanning
begins. At each position, the transducer, under the control
of the computer, is pulsed and the reflected signal is
digitized by an analog to digital converter and, if desired
by the operator, it is also sampled to give a picture of the
structure of the material at a given depth. This digital
representation of the reflected signal is stored on magnetic
disc, and thus, at the end of a scan, the computer has a
complete digitized set of information which is then used to
image any discontinuities which are present.
The synthetic aperture algorithm now takes over to
process the data into useable form. Suppose that the
specimen has a flaw at a certain position in its interior and
that the specimen has been scanned in the manner just
described. At different positions of the transducer, the
echoes from the flaw take different times to return. This
difference is called a phase shift and it can be predicted by
knowing the scanning grid used and the geometry of the
specimen's surface. The synthetic aperture algorithm shifts
these individual echoes forward by amounts equal to their
phase shifts so that all the signals are in phase with the echo
which returned the earliest. These signals are then summed
to synthesize the signal which would result from a large
diameter high resolution transducer. When the system's
ability to focus at any desired depth simply by sampling the
reflected signal at that depth is combined with the synthetic
aperture algorithm, we have a synthetic aperture focusing
technique to produce a processed data file from which high
resolution, focused images can be generated.
The researchers have been able to produce impressive
contour plots and orthographic projections of specimens
having known discontinuities such as drilled holes, machined
notches, and slag inclusions in test welds. Their work is now
moving to the use of this experimental system on specimens
having unknown and irregular flaws.
New proposed work includes the use of the SAFT UT
system in a "spotlight" mode. A narrow beamwidth
transducer would be used to continuously illuminate a small
area in the specimen as the transducer is scanned across it.
After conventional SAFT UT has located a discontinuity,
this technique would be used for increased viewing angle
and less power loss at larger depths.
Another area of investigation is that of discriminating
between slag inclusions and cracks so that decisions could
accurately be made on whether repair of the part is really
needed. Cracks should be repaired but many slag inclusions
are not serious enough to warrant expensive repair work.
It should be noted here that the equipment as used in the
experimental setting at the University of Michigan would
not be adequate for investigation of in-service process
equipment. The intent here is to develop and refine the
software and the testing techniques. Each in-service applica-
tion of this system would require different means of
mounting and moving the transducer for a good scan of the
vessel under investigation.
In conclusion, the SAFT UT system represents a
significant improvement in modern methods of non-
destructive investigation. If continued funding by the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission allows further research to
proceed, the SAFT UT system can be refined and perfected
as an efficient economic tool to insure the integrity of
process equipment and thus also protect the public
interest.

In Newton's era, nobody dreamed of the possibility of a
journey to elsewhere in time since space and time were
regarded as absolute invariants. As Newton had said, "Ab-
solute, true, and mathematical time flows uniformly,
without regard to anything external." This concept was
first challenged in 1895 by H.G. Wells' electrifying novel
The Time Machine which described time travel. As is often
the case, ideas in science fiction turn out to be science
facts. Twenty years later, in 1916, Dr. Albert Einstein
refuted the concept of space and time as absolute invariants
by introducing the famous General Theory of Relativity.
The theory states that time is variant under different
velocities and explains the idea of space-time curvature
under a gravitational field; for example, the Sun curves the
space-time around it so that the Earth is moving on a
circular orbit, and the time on the Earth runs slower than
time without the interference of a gravitational field.
In 1949, Dr. Kurt Godel published his article about time
travel entitled, "A Remark About the Relationship Between
Relativity Theory and Idealistic Philosophy." It was based
on relativistic time dilation under extremely high velocities.
According to his calculations, it would be theoretically
possible to travel into any region of the past or the future
in our own universe if the spacecraft could achieve 70.7%
of the speed of light. Thus, man's boldest idea of time
travel had at last received some support from scientific
hypothesis.
However, Dr. Godel's theory has been seriously challenged
by a recently published book The Voices of Time written
by two mathematicians, J.T. Fraser and Allen Lane. They
pointed out that in order to travel to the past or the
future, a starship should achieve infinite speed rather than
70.7% of the speed of light. Since the achievement of
infinite speed requires an infinite amount of energy (which is
impossible to generate), they conclude that time travel is
impossible.
Which of these assumptions is right? At present, no one
can tell. Even if Dr. Godel's theory is correct, it might
still be argued that to achieve 70.7% of the speed of light
is beyond the limit of our present technology. Nevertheless,
science always provides more than one solution to a
problem. Besides Dr. Godel's proposal, there is another
approach to time travel by using the connection of space and
time under a gravitational field as indicated by the General
Theory of Relativity.
Based on this idea, the German astronomer Karl
Schwarzchild discovered that under infinite gravitational
force, the radius of space-time curvature would become so
small that time would be 'frozen' and space would be curved
to the degree that it would connect any space-time in our
own universe, as well as in any other universes. He also
predicted that such an infinite gravitational force could
be created by a compressed star. This came only a few
months after the publication of the General Theory of
Relativity. Most scientists did not take his fantastic idea too
seriously until the discovery of the black hole orbiting
around the star Cygnus X-1 in 1973. As predicted by
Schwarzchild, a black hole is the corpse of a collapsed
star which is at least three times as massive as our sun.
When this type of star has burned up all its fuel, gravity
becomes the dominant force and compresses the star to a
radius of 2cm! The size of this massive object is so incredibly
small that the gravitational force will become extremely
strong near its surface. Nothing, not even light, can escape
from it. And at the very center of the black hole, there is
a region called a space-time singularity, where the radius
of the space-time curvature approaches zero due to the
intense gravitational force. Many of today's leading cosmolo-
gists, such as Dr. William J. Kaufmann of the Astrophysics-
Relativity Group at Caltech, are predicting inconceivable
phenomena by applying Schwarzchild's solution of space-
time to this region. It is believed that inside the space-time
singulatiry, the intense gravitational force stops the flow
of time and curves the space so that it connects our own
frame of space-time to infinitely many others. The place
where different spaces and times are connected is called a

wormhole. The imaginary 'space' which connects two
wormholes in the same universe or different universes is
called superspace. Some of the cosmologists have suggested
that there is no past or future nor any dimension inside
the superspace. It is full of ceaseless activity, yet overall it is
static and timeless. Due to the characteristic of the super-
space and the black hole connection of space-time, if an
astronaut enters a wormhole, he will appear instantaneously
in another wormhole, in any place or any time, in his own
universe or any other universe. (That is, with respect to the
space-time of his original position).
These ideas seem very fascinating for time travel and
space flights of the future. However, this kind of journey
is far beyone our present capability since there are two
fundamental problems which cannot be solved by today's
technology. First, when the astronaut is very close to the
black hole, he will be killed by the immense gravitational
pull, as no human being can withstand more than ten times
the Earth's gravitational acceleration. Secondly, even if he
could overcome the gravitational pull, our presenttechnology
cannot provide him a method of navigation inside a
wormhole. In other words, once the astronaut arrives in
another time or in another universe, he will not know
which path he should choose in order to come back to his
own space-time.
All in all, while the idea of a hyperspace travel may seem
far-fetched, predictions based on the already proven theory
of General Relativity indicate that this kind of journey is at
least theoretically possible. If Dr. Godel's theory is correct,
or if we could solve the technological problem of with-
standing a strong gravitational pull and could derive a
navigational method once inside a wormhole, then there is
no reason why the controversial ideas of time travel or a trip
to elsewhere in zero time could not be made possible.

CARPAL
TUNNEL
SYNDROME
by Bruce Young
Currently, there is a fair amount of time being spent
looking into carpal tunnel syndrome as an occupational
injury. To date, research points toward the conclusion that
causes of this disease of the wrist are associated with both
worker and job attributes. What is carpal tunnel syndrome
you ask? Carpal tunnel syndrome is a neuropathy of the
median nerve inside the carpal tunnel that results in motor,
sensory, and autonomic dysfunction in parts of the hand
innervated by the median nerve. The median nerve is a
major nerve that passes through the center of the wrist and
is believed to be the main thing affected by carpal tunnel
syndrome. The disease can cause a great deal of pain and
can seriously effect the motor and sensory functions of the
hand.These symptoms can be progressive and can completely
disable the hand.
The research going on now has been prompted by past
studies that have left questions unanswered and conclusions
not fully supported and explored. There has also been a
considerable interest in such research from industries who
have workers troubled with carpal tunnel syndrome. The
past research in this area puts down a foundation on which
the current endeavors are based. An understanding of some
of the established facts will help the reader to understand
the scope of the current research.
It is generally believed that carpal tunnel syndrome
is caused by pressure on the nerves inside the carpal tunnel
of the wrist. This idea has received support from several
studies over the last fifty years. This pressure can be
generated in many ways, ranging from physical movements to
physiological anomalies. Temporary pressure can be caused
by deviating the wrist, by fractures, and by forceful hand
exertions. Constant pressure (chronic pressure) can result
from improperly healed fractures, muscle anomalies, fluid
imbalances, tumors, and inflammation of the flexor syno-
vium.
There have been numerous studies that support the idea
that carpal tunnel syndrome is associated with the activities
of the hand and is an occupational disease. One researcher
linked carpal tunnel syndrome to the use of certain hand
tools. He designed a new tool based on biomechanical con-
siderations. It was found that workers using the redesigned
tool experienced fewer problems. Other researchers have
noted a connection between the disease and certain types
of jobs and also noticed that the syndrome was more
prevalent in the dominant hand.
There has been a considerable amount of analysis of
hand-wrist biomechanics here at the University of Michigan
led by Dr. Don Chaffin and Dr. Thomas Armstrong. Basically
24

tendons during different hand and wrist motions. The
tendons create forces and pressures in the wrist which
could be related to the carpal tunnel syndrome. One of the
results of study in this area has been that greater intrawrist
forces are produced during exertion with an open hand than
with a closed hand. Generally it has been shown, both
theoretically and empirically that intrawrist forces in and on
some tendons (not necessarily all) are proportional to the
size of the hand, the force of the hand exertion, the position
of the hand, and the angle of the wrist. Most of the results in
this area have come from making analogies between the
tendons, nerves, and curves in the wrist and belts and
pulleys. In this way force analysis could be carried out.
There has also been extensive study by a gentleman
named Sunderland of the effects of pressure on circulation
in the wrist. It seems that certain hand and wrist movements
can seriously effect the circulation in some people's wrists.
It has been suggested that reduced circulation can make
nerves nutritionally deprived and this can result in feelings
of pain. It is also possible that lack of oxygen and nutrition
can lead to a chain of events that results in inflammation
of several of the tissues in the carpal tunnel, which will
create constant pressure on the nerve in it.
Another possible factor in carpal tunnel syndrome is
the possible continuous pressure on the median nerve created
by fibrosis or thickening of the flexor synovium. The
flexor synovium is compressed during all wrist deviations
and thus may be important to understanding carpal tunnel
syndrome. The synovia! membrane is responsible for
secreting a fluid that serves as a lubricant in the wrist.
Inflammation in this area can be caused by repeated
pressure or rheumatoid arthritis.
Most of the existing research gives some evidence that
carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by, precipitated by, or
aggravated by certain hand exertions. It is of interest
to determine what the factors are that effect an individual's
susceptibility to carpal tunnel syndrome. If these factors
were determined, it might be possible to avoid putting
people into jobs that would result in carpal tunnel syndrome.
Most of the factors that cause one person to develop
carpal tunnel syndrome while another doesn't are not
really understood completely. Nevertheless, a few common
items have been identified. These relate to a person's hand
size, age, gender, and general health. A small wrist is
always indicative of higher intrawrist forces and therefore
has a greater likelihood of carpal tunnel syndrome. It has
also been noted that the disease is far more prevalent in
people in their fifties, although it can be found at a variety
of ages. It is commonly accepted that women are more
susceptible to the syndrome; the disease is usually two to
four times more common in women. It is believed that
this is due to more than just smaller average wrist
sizes, but it is not understood what other factors might be
coming into play here. Connections have also been made
between carpal tunnel syndrome and other bodily ailments,
but research here has been rather limited.
It is apparent that occupational wrist injuries are a
large problem for persons performing repetitive tasks of
hand. There is evidence that links certain hand positions
and high hand forces with carpal tunnel syndrome, but it is
hard to say with certainty whether the positions and
forces are the causes or results of the syndrome. The current
researchers, led by Dr. Don Chaffin and Dr. Thomas
Armstrong, believe that it is possible for this uncertainty to
be resolved by a proposed intervention study and bi-
omechanical-histological study. They also hope to develop
a test battery that will diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome in
its early stages so that a modification of the work situation
willbeable to reduce personal suffering, permanentdisability,
and costs due to lost productivity, workmen's compensation,
and medical expenses.
Now in process is an investigation which hopes to
yield a better understanding of the causes and workings of
carpal tunnel syndrome. One phase of the current work
involves an anatomical investigation of biomechanical
carpal tunnel syndrome factors. As a part of this area of
study, researchers are developing a facsimile of a wrist that
models forces in the wrist connected with various hand
positions and exertions. Basically, this is a three dimensional
model made up of pulleys and belts. Mathematical and
empirical techniques have been used to determine lengths
and curvatures in creating this model.
In conjunction with the Medical School, median nerves
in cadavers have been extensively examined. Work here
supports the hypothesis that tissue changes are more severe
within the carpal tunnel and suggests that there is a relation-
ship between tissue load and retrogressive tissue change.
Another phase of the current work involves a two part
field study. In one part researchers are comparing the
frequencies of certain hand positions and forces in people
that have been diagnosed as having carpal tunnel syndrome
with the same frequencies for people who do not have the
disease. In the second part of the study researchers are
comparing frequencies of certain hand positions and forces
in jobs associated with carpal tunnel syndrome with the same
frequencies in similar jobs that are not associated with
carpal tunnel syndrome. A surface electromyogram is used
to indicate the force exerted by the hands while a motion
picture camera recorded the hand positions and the current
electromyogram. External and internal anthopometric in-
formation was also collected from all subjects.
In the first part of this study it was found that people
with a history of carpal tunnel syndrome produce higher
intrawrist forces than the people without a history of the
disease. It was also noticed that the group with the
syndrome used the pinch exertion (open fist) and deviated
wrist positions more than the group without the syndrome.
The results from the second part of the study have not been
completely analyzed yet and can not be commented on now.
In general, these studies are pointing toward the fact that
high intrawrist forces are produced in an open fist pinch
exertion and are directly related to the force required when
grasping objects and reflect wrist deviations. Additional data

final analysis, recommendations for reducing carpal tunnel
syndrome will be made to the three plants cooperating in
this study.
This research is hoped to be continued to determine
if the findings to date can be used effectively to modify
work methods so as to alleviate carpal tunnel syndrome.
The first step in achieving this goal is to develop a diagnos-
tic test battery that can be used on the job. This test
battery will make it possible to quantify and monitor the
functional state of a worker's hands. This is necessary in
order to determine the effect of different work methods on
the state of the worker. The tests that make up this battery
will be evaluated in three areas: 1) how closely it is related
to the worker's ability to work, 2) how accurately it indi-
cates the existence and severity of the syndrome, and 3)
how easily it can be administered in a plant situation.
Average test scores will have to be determined for
populations with and without carpal tunnel syndrome.
Using these averages, people can be evaluated in hopes of
accurately diagnosing the syndrome. A high degree of
uncertainty exists with each test and that is why a battery
of tests is being proposed. Once the tests are evaluated in
terms of averages, feasibility, and relevance, the sensitivity
of each test will be determined. In connection with this
study, the effects of paced and unpaced work will be assessed.
It is generally accepted that workers usually work faster
when they are not paced. It is hypothesized that the
workers who are unpaced will work faster and will be more
impaired than workers who perform at the slower, paced
rates. It is thought that this may determine whether or not
it is worth slowing the work rate to reduce the injury to
the worker.
A second goal of future study is to evaluate the
effectiveness of conservative intervention. This effective-
ness will be tested by first selecting pairs of similar
individuals (personal attributes and job) one of which has
carpal tunnel syndrome and one who does not. The test
battery will be used to determine the state of each person
initially and then recommendations of the researchers will
be implemented for the'afflicted individual. The subjects
will be tested again on regular intervals, and it is hoped
that the condition of the subjects with the syndrome will
approach that of those without it. Possible recommendations
are as follows: 1) train the subjects to use certain hand
positions and to avoid others, 2) move the subject to a job
requiring lower hand forces, 3) place a splint on the subject
to prevent wrist deviation, and 4) pace the workers at a
slower rate.
The researchers also hope to continue in the area of
biomechical investigation of carpal tunnel syndrome. This
type of investiqation helps in understanding and confirming
or refuting results found in the field. It is hoped to further
study the relationship of hand positions and forces with
the intrawrist forces and pressures. Another item to be
looked at is the relationship between forces on given
tissues and the histopathical changes in the tissue.
Generally, the research that is hoped to precede from
now will try to demonstrate the feasibility of intervening
in the development if injury occurs at the work place. It is
possible that if a set of guidelines can be developed to
control carpal tunnel syndrome occurring on the job, then
maybe it is possible to develop guidelines to control other
occupational ailments effecting the back, shoulder, and other
body parts.

50 and 25
Years Ago
50 Years Ago
Most people think of it merely as CRISP. But 50 years
ago, long before the appearance of the glass structure on
North Campus, the old A&amp;D Building was the recently
completed Architecture Building. Waldo M. Abbot, an
Assistant Professor of Rhetoric in the Literary College,
described in verbose detail the intricacies of the new
building, in an article appearing in the March 1928 issue
of the Technic entitled, "Architecture Building Fulfills
Dreams."
To give an idea of the type of building this was at that
time, he began by stating that "no other University
building built with state funds, has the artistic symmetry
combined with utilitarian arrangement that is to be found
in this first large building to be designed upon the campus."
What Mr. Abbot is saying is that the building is artistically
beautiful yet, at the same time, practical. He emphasizes
that the building fits well between the Martha Cook
Building on one side and the University High School (now
the Education Building) on the other; "it forms an easy
transition from the Gothic beauty of the girl's dormitory
to the factory-like efficiency of the school's steel windows."
Parts of the building inside are still quite beautiful. The
University seal inlaid in the floor on the main lobby was a
gift of Albert Champion of the Flint Faience Tile Company.
The stone staircase, also in the main lobby, was a gift of
the Indiana Limestone Company.
Though it is difficult to tell from the article, the large
room where the CRISP terminals are located was once a
large drafting room with "one hundred old pine benches
accomodating inadequately the'one hundred and thirty
freshmen." (Evidence of overcrowding even back then!)
The corridors of all three floors were lined with exhibition
cases so that "the student may constantly be inspired by
the best in art and design as he walks through the halls."
Evidently the original building plans called for additions
to the building so that when completed it would form a
hollow square with a courtyard in the middle. Mr. Abbot
points out that "at present there is no appropriation for the
completion of the building." Apparently the appropriation
never came since the building is still in the same state as it
was when the article was written.
An interesting note is when he talks about a small studio
in the tower of the building that was used for the life class.
"Here twenty-seven advanced students gather to draw
by Karen Zahn
campus athletes. The position of the model is much de-
manded by athletic students who are working their way
through the University because it is one of the best paid
jobs about the campus, paying 75 cents an hour."
25 Years Ago
The job race is on. This is the time of year April
graduates are heavily into interviewing, arranging plant
visits, and trying to make the decision as to what is more
important—the bucks or the more interesting job. Companies
are doing recruiting of their own for the most desirable
graduates. The whole scenario has not changed much in 25
years, as evidenced by the amount of advertising appearing
in the February 1953 issue of the Technic. In that issue
the 56-page magazine contained 37 pages of advertisements.
A wide variety of industries was represented, ranging
from the automakers to small components manufacturers
to the ever-present petroleum industries. The aircraft
industry, in particular, seemed to be recruiting heavily,
with ads from five different companies: Boeing, Hughes,
Pratt and Whitney, Chance Vought, and Goodyear Aircraft.
Most of these ads mentioned that the war had expanded
their industries and several noted that guided missiles
were big as future projects.
Various strategies were used to attract graduates to the
different companies. Recent graduates were cited to
illustrate the rapid advancement that was possible with a
particular company. One company said of the graduate:
"... he is assured every opportunity to fit into the job
he likes best — and, once there, he knows he will be en-
couraged to advance as rapidly as his ability and energy
will carry him."
Other commodities offered included a variety of jobs to
choose from, attractive locations, good working conditions,
and excellent benefits. Opportunities seem unlimited with
one company who described "a career opportunity best
described by the fact that many of the high ranking
executives in the organization at this time began their
climb to success in positions similar to those offered
graduates today."
Several companies stressed on-the-job training and be-
ginning with work on the bottom, in the laboratories." A
preliminary orientation which may include basic experience
in production plants for sales personnel, and sales office
work for technical trainees."

"Recognizably distinct quality/' our president tells

That phrase states our strategy flat out.
We know it succeeds, if only we can get help.
Good engineers are the kind of help we need.
They devise, design, make, and market things
that work well and are obviously worth the
money the world's people give for them.
Examples from the recent past, the now,
and the near future:
• Made-in-the-U.S.A. Kodak pocket
cameras good enough to have 1.4 million of
them shooting pictures in Japan, where only
35-mm "status" cameras are said to sell.
• Several million Kodak instant cameras
now making color prints that don't smudge
and don't require peeling anything off to
throw away.
• Lens/color film combinations so fast that
no more light is needed for photography than
for reading a menu.
• Xerographic film that has its light
sensitivity turned on and off electrically,
develops in seconds, and can do it over and over
again for adding image.
• Copier-duplicators and sensitized products
that make the distribution of information on
paper much simpler than it used to be.
• Simple, quick, low-cost ways of retrieving
microfilm images bearing detail too voluminous
to keep on paper.
• An extension of certain special
technologies of ours far beyond the image
business to the even more vital business of
blood chemistry.
• New knowledge about dyes and fibers,
which molecules cling to which and what
they do to light.
• New environmentally acceptable solvents
which help customers formulate coatings that
meet stringent air-pollution standards.
In explaining our game plan on such matters,
we stress one theme that connects everything
together: recognizably distinct quality. The
world does recognize Kodak quality, and we
need very good engineers to provide it at a
price the world can afford to pay.

Quite a bit of research goes on around the University, particularly in the
College of Engineering, which is relatively unknown to most students. In this
issue the Technic presents several articles describing research that is being done
in the departments of Nuclear, Electrical and Computer, and Bioengineering.
Philip Schulte kicks it off with his article entitled "Laser + Plasma = Fusion:
North Campus Contributes to the Quest." He describes several of the experiments
being conducted at the Laser Plasma Interaction Laboratory on North Campus,
and, in particular, experiments dealing with the production of fusion power using
plasmas and lasers. This technique involves first creating a plasma by running a
large current through a contained volume of gas, producing large numbers of
positive and negative charges. These charges form the plasma column which the
laser is focused to produce the fusion power.
Research is being conducted in the Electrical Engineering Department at this
time on pressure sensors, devices which transform pressure readings into electri-
cal signals for use in controlling or monitoring functions. There are many
applications in which pressure is a useful parameter, including barometric
pressure in aircraft, exhaust manifold pressure in automobiles, and intracranial
and arterial pressure in the human body. Greg Robertson, in his article "ECE
Research Project: Developing a Solid-State Pressure Sensor" describes how
pressure sensors work and how they are made.
The last of the research articles is entitled "The Effect of Shear on Fibrin
Formation" and was written by Scott Macomber. Fibrin is the main ingredient
in blood clots and is formed by a polymerization reaction of the monomer
fibrinogen. Fibrin research centers around the possibility that shear rates in the
circulatory system increase the rate of fibrin formation. This can ultimately
be related to several health disorders, particularly arteriolesclerosis, or hardening
of the arteries.
So now you're finally graduating and those job offers keep rolling in. However,
many times before the offers come, rituals known as plant trips must be under-
taken. Sometimes these plant trips can be quite an experience as staff member
Cindy Rogers found out when she tried arranging plant trips. Cindy relates some
of the high points of her plant trips in her article "Fear of Flying? or What Your
Mother Never Told You About Plant Tours."
The issue ends with the regular feature "The Michigan Technic 50 and 25
Years Ago," written by Karen Zahn who takes a look at some of the regular
features of past Technics.

North Campus
Contributes to the Quest
To many of the students and faculty of the University
the phrase 'Laser Fusion' has almost magical connotations-.
Its mention conjures up mental images of the block-long
monsters of Sandia and Livermore Laboratories that are
being found with increasing frequency on the covers of both
popular magazines and technical journals. These people
are probably also aware that there is a growing opinion in
the scientific and engineering communities that these
megalithic lasers are the ideal means to usurp the energy-
producing processes of the sun.
Fusion Power.
What is unfortunately not as well known is that the
University has its own smaller, slightly different, less
glamorous, but perhaps ultimately more critical version of
the well-known laser experiments. It is in operation on the
North Campus.
The experimental hardware occupies a large room on the
second floor of G.G. Brown Laboratory. The blacked-out
windows on the doors of the room bear the now familial
red-starburst warning of laser operations. A small, neatly
lettered plaque in the window bears the legend LPIL. This
acronym stands for Laser Plasma Interaction Laboratory.
This title is imposing enough in words, but it is even more
impressive in terms of potentialities.
The LPIL was created in 1969 by Professor David R.
Bach under the auspices of the Department of Nuclear
Engineering. Professor Bach performed an extraordinary
feat in managing to establish the Laboratory at a time when
Laser-Fusion research was still viewed very skeptically. He
sought and obtained a number of grants from various
Scientific Foundations to cover the initial equipment and
operating expenses. The administrative details are now
being taken care of by Doctor John Ackenhusen, while
Professor Bach is on sabbatical leave at a large Laser-Fusion
laboratory in Osaka, Japan.
Much of the initial funding for the Laboratory came
from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research. At
present slightly more than half of the financial support
comes from the National Science Foundation.

Walking into the Laboratory, the first impression comes
from the very cool, very dry air demanded by precision
equipment. Imagination rather than any sense of smell or
taste provides the faint sharpness of ozone from the last
series of experiments. The size of the room strikes next.
It is large, with a maze of thin metal rods and small steel
beams that hang from the ceiling and hold a remarkable
mass of cables and equipment comfortably close overhead.
Close by the door is a small wooden platform which
supports a cage of heavy copper mesh. The mesh is used to
electronically isolate the cubicle from the rest of the
laboratory by grounding out any extraneous electromagnetic
signals from the experiments. Inside the cage six multi-
channel oscilloscopes display the fleeting electronic spasms
of a score of monitoring devices. A battery of high-speed
motion picture cameras dutifully record every millimeter
of the oscilloscope's traces. This method of gathering and
storing data is imperative when one is concerned with
experiments which last, literally, no longer than the blink
of a human eye. The black boxes of the timing and triggering
devices fill up most of the rest of the metal wrapped cubicle.
Dominating the rest of the laboratory is the laser/plasma
equipment. Lines of lenses, prisms, cables, hoses, and
electronic gear radiate out from a massive central assembly
of wiring and steel supports. At the very center is a small
(17cm long x 3cm dia.) quartz tube which contains the
target gas. At the end of each line is either a laser or one
of a variety of exotic detector/recorder devices.
The present target gas is helium. In the first few
nano-seconds of the experiment a 100,000 amp current
rams up through the gas, ripping away the orbital electrons,
ionizing the atoms instantly. The free positive and negative
charges now constitute a perfect gaseous conductor. A
plasma. The particles respond to an intricate pattern of
electric and magnetic forces and begin to spiral around the
magnetic flux lines. They spiral in tighter and tighter orbits
as the current increases. The plasma column 'pinches down',
contracting into a fine thread of incandescence. It keeps
contracting until the magnetic pressure of the fields and the
Michigan Technic


equilibrium.
This dynamic quality is one of the factors which makes
these experiments both fascinating and infuriating. The
plasma column is not rigid. It is an electrified fluid which
obeys all of the laws of hydrodynamics. It oscillates with
each minute change in current flow. It writhes as if in
torment, making a difficult target for incoming laser beams.
At this point one of the Laboratory's two Carbon-
Dioxide lasers is fired. A bank of gray-metal, suitcase-sized
capacitors similar to the ones which provide the initial
ionizing current power the laser. The narrow beam of
coherent light is channeled through a complex set of
optics almost twenty feet long which focus it onto the
target.
The laser releases a total of 20 joules of energy in a pulse
which lasts 38 nanoseconds. The power of the beam is thus
over 500 megawatts. The optical system focuses this down
until the beam intensity at the target is over 400 billion
watts per square centimeter.
When the beam strikes the plasma a number of things
happen, all simultaneously. A shock wave traverses the
length and breadth of the column in a few billionths of a
second, setting up a complex interference pattern of
pressure waves. The shock wave shifts the gas around, which
shifts the flux lines, which shift the mass of plasma even
more. Total anarchy in the micro-world. The few partially
ionized atoms remaining in the target area suddenly find
themselves struck by the subatomic equivalent of a tidal
wave. A single photon of the CO2 laser's 10.6 micron
radiation does not have enough energy to ionize a helium
atom, but fifty such photons will blast that final electron
free quite handily. The literal deluge of incoming photons
force the atom to gorge itself on energy; far, far too quickly
for it to be re-radiated away. The orbitals swell as the
electron is kicked up to higher and higher energy levels
until it is finally torn free of the coulombic grasp of the
nucleus.
All through these processes detectors record and Men
learn.
The actual experimental run can end in a variety of
ways. A wildly oscillating plasma column can re-expand
and batter itself out of existence against the walls of the
containing cylinder. It might also stabilize, absorbing or
discharging the sudden influx of energy. Then it will
eventually collapse as the last of the ionizing current drains
out of the capacitor bank. Less than a tenth of a micro-
second separates the initial ionization from the final
collapse of the plasma column.
The only differences between this experiment and an
actual laser-induced fusion reaction are the absence of
nuclear reactions, and the fact that the initial current and
not the laser is used to produce the target plasma. But the
physical action of the laser/plasma impact is only a small
part of the whole experiment. Most of the equipment is
devoted to either initiating or supporting the reaction, or
recording the results.
The optical system which the laser's beam is focused
through is a good example of the interesting and unusual
equipment involved. Its lens can not be made of regular
glass, as that material is a very efficient absorber of the
infra-red level radiation which the laser generates. Instead
they are fashioned from large crystals of sodium chloride.
These lenses are transparent to the laser's wavelength. They
are also very fragile, and for obvious reasons must be
protected from high humidity. Watching a single medium-
sized lens which easily costs $500 dissolve can be a heart-
breaking experience.
It is also necessary to keep the surface of the optics very
clean. Before each shot the surface of every lens is gently
but thoroughly dusted. If this were not done, the laser
beam would diffract around the dust motes, focusing the
energy into localized hot spots within the optics. This could
cause them to pit or crack.
One of the more exotic of the detector/recorder devices,
and one of the major reasons for the Laboratory's existence,
is a ruby laser. The ruby laser is not as spectacular a
participant in the experiments as the CO2 laser, but its
function is just as important.
In the sequence of events of the experiment, the beam
of the laser illuminates the plasma column for a period of
16 nanoseconds, beginning just as the main laser pulse
impacts. The transmitted ruby laser is then used to create
a hologram of the action. Examination of this hologram
makes the actual dynamics of the reaction much clearer and
gives a better idea of the total phenomena than the traces
of the oscilloscopes.
A hologram from a past experiment is hung on the wall
of the Laboratory Office. It shows a plasma column with a
pinpoint hole punched prominently through its center. To
a researcher in this field the picture is at once stimulating
and frustrating. It is definite visual evidence of one type of
interaction; but the area in the immediate region of the
impact, the region of greatest interest, is blurred. Because
of this a large portion of the work being presently carried
out in the Laboratory is devoted to increasing the resolution
and magnification of the holograms. When this is accom-
plished the next goal will be holographic movies of the
March 1978


entire sequence of the experiment. Right now equipment
limits the holographic operations to one per shot.
The successful attainment of these goals would give
fusion researchers an extremely valuable diagnostic tool.
When the work involves precisely focusing a dozen or more
megawatt lasers onto a BB-sized fuel pellet over a range of
several meters, then actual pictures of the results of your
'fine-tuning' attempts would be very helpful. They could
decrease the time between trials, decrease the cost, increase
the efficiency, and perhaps lead to successful innovations in
the fusion field.
Along with the holograms the researchers on North
Campus are also performing experiments to determine the
exact optical properties of the plasma column itself. If
you graph the intensity of the transmitted light against the
intensity of the incident light, you would get a decidedly
non-linear curve. At some critical incident intensity deter-
mined by such factors as plasma density and temperature,
the transmission of the laser light through the column
increases drastically. This means that if you could properly
manipulate all of the variables in the experiment, the
plasma column could be used as an actual lens, or even a
'light switch'. If work in this area is successful, then plasmas
could be used as high-speed focusing and switching systems.
The inherent nanosecond response times of the electroni-
cally controlled plasmas are far faster than any mechanical
device and could be constructed and maintained.
The LPIL is not itself involved in the application of
these ideas, but the data which it is gathering will certainly
be of great use to some laboratory which might someday
have its interest aroused by the possibilities of optical
plasmas.
Experimentation in the Laboratory follows roughly a
three day cycle. The first day involves working directly
with the laser-plasma unit. Power requirements and equip-
ment limit the day's activities to 12 to 14 shots. The next
day is devoted to viewing and interpreting the collected
data. The third day is spent planning the next series of
experiments. Past results determine the direction of research
more than any preset and rigid schedule.
A 43-item checklist is taped on the casing of the CO2
laser. It governs the background procedures of the trials.
The checklist contains such entries as, 'film loaded',
'cameras on', and 'lenses dusted'. This list might seem a
bit trivial, but bear in mind that the laboratory technicians
must keep track of several tons of sophisticated equipment.
When work at the Laboratory was first begun, data from
more than one experiment was lost because of a forgotten
6

Despite many lists and schedules, work in the Laboratory
is never dull. Every once in a while one of the lasers is
accidentally triggered or the optical system will focus a
portion of the beam onto an unintended target, usually
the poor, unsuspecting air. This results in some impressive
noises and some even more spectacular sparks.
Other Lasers
Besides the Carbon Dioxide and ruby lasers, the Lab-
oratory contains a small scientific arsenal of other lasers.
A second C02 laser is under the jurisdiction of graduate
student Dave Voss. He is using it to develop equipment
capable of generating ultra-short duration pulses. In this
case ultra-short means one nano-second or less. Shorter
durations mean more power delivered and a greater chance
to achieve fusion conditions.
Behind the main C02 laser in the Laboratory is a small
Helium-Neon laser. It is used to properly align the optics
before each experiment. The CC&gt;2 laser itself is not used for
this because it is designed solely to produce high intensity
bursts of light. It is far easier to adjust the path of a fairfy
low-power continuous-wave beam rather than that of a
single high-intensity pulse in the fury of midflight.
A Nitrogen laser is carefully mothballed in one of the
Laboratory's storerooms. This was built several years ago
from some plans published on "Amateur Scientist" page of
Scientific American. The original intention was to provide
a low-cost, frequency variable laser. Unfortunately only
the Nitrogen laser, which was to function as the initiator,
was finished. The equipment is still waiting for some
interested graduate student to construct the remaining
organic dye chamber, mirrors, and resonators.
The most recent addition, a Neodymium-Glass laser, is
in the process of being uncrated and tested.
Other Experiments
Another variety of plasma experiment conducted in the
Laboratory is called the 'exploding wire'. In effect it is a
household fuse raised to the n-th degree. In a regular fuse
too great a current will cause the small metal bridge to melt
and cut off the current. If an even larger current is applied
the wire could explode. If you ram a current on the order
of 100,000 amps through the wire, it will vaporize. This
high-energy metal vapor will obey the laws of plasma
dynamics and pinch itself down in exactly the same fashion
as the ionized helium does in the laser experiments. The
filament materials now being utilized are lithium, aluminum,
and tungsten.
Graduate student Don Kania is using this type of plasma
generator to develop a diagnostic technique complementary
to the holographic analysis. The technique involves the
plasma producing an x-ray self-portrait.
When the electrons in a plasma shift energy levels they
generate electromagnetic radiation, in this case soft x-rays.
If you could focus these x-rays down onto some film, the
resulting picture could yield some valuable information on
the distribution of mass and energy within the plasma.
The main problem is the fact that the plasma column
is a large diffuse source, rather than the point source of a
medical x-ray. It is also very difficult when you consider
that the wavelengths involved will sail right on through an
ordinary camera without so much as a smile.
Don Kania's answer to this is deceptively simple; a
pinhole camera. It functions just like an old-fashioned
pin-hole camera, but with heavy shielding and an incredibly
narrow aperture to handle the much shorter wavelengths.
The technique is promising, but a great number of man-hours
remain to be invested in its perfection.
Metal filaments are presently being used because of their
availability and their interestingly complex x-ray spectra,
but the technique is equally applicable to the deuterium and
tritium fuels boiling in the heart of a fusion reaction.
Concern for the Future
Unfortunately, one of the biggest concerns that Professor
Bach and Doctor Ackenhusen have is non-technical. The
long awaited move of the entire Engineering College to North
Campus could create problems for the Laboratory. There
is some talk of the move forcing the Laboratory out of its
present quarters to some still unknown location.
The prospect of moving a sprawling complex of delicate
and sophisticated equipment whose positions and align-
ments are measured in small fractions of a millimeter and
even smaller fractions of a second of arc is nothing less than
a nightmare. Exposing the Laboratory's set of expensive
and fragile sodium chloride optics to a large amount of
handling in the typical Michigan environment of high
humidity and very variable temperatures is a special source
of anxiety.
Conclusion
A variety of vital types of research is being carried out at
the Laser Plasma Interaction Laboratory on the North
Campus. The thing to remember is that all of the experi-
ments are very basic research into the techniques of
observing and manipulating plasmas and lasers. Implications
of their success involve communications, defense, space
travel, but most of all, fusion power. Figuratively speaking,
while the large and well known fusion research centers
around the world are attempting to solve the advanced
calculus of fusion power, LPIL and other similar university
laboratories are making sure that they understand the
necessary basic arithmetic.

Developing a Solid-State
Pressure Sensor
The arrival of the integrated circuit (1C) on the elec-
tronic scene has led to the invention and construction of
many devices that were never before practical and/or
possible with the much bulkier transistor. Advanced manu-
facturing techniques now yield IC's of low cost, small size,
and high dependability. Besides the now everyday use of
IC's in calculators, wrist watches, and T.V. games to name
a very few, one extremely powerful application is for use in
microprocessors.
The microprocessor is in essence a mini-computer that has
been custom built to perform a particular task. They are quite
applicable in situations where system control or monitoring
is desired. For example, in the case of system control the
microprocessor would receive certain information about
the system as input, process this information and then
generate an output that, in general, would produce some
action. This output would depend upon what was given as
input and what the microprocessor "decided" to do, in
accordance with its programming. In an example of system
monitoring, the microprocessor might be responsible for
merely receiving certain input, then repeating this input
in various forms for an output. Also it could possibly
initiate some action exterior to the system being monitored
if certain input conditions were detected.
The method of input/output (I/O) is one of the major
differences between a run of the mill computer program and
a typical microprocessor set-up. With an average computer
program, data is usually accumulated over a period of time,
then fed in at once (via IBM cards, teletype, etc.) and
processed. A microprocessor is used often in a "real time"1
situation with the microprocessor designed for one specific
task only. "Real time" requires continuous and "live"

where data is being fed to a computer continuously, as
the data occurs, i.e. the data is "live".

input. Therefore, a device is needed to convert the input
parameter to an electric signal which the microprocessor
can "understand".
If the input is electrical in nature, some circuitry will
usually do the trick to put it in a form acceptable to the
microprocessor. However, if the input is of any other form,
a transduced is needed to convert the input parameter to
an electric signal, and vice versa for output, i.e. convert the
output electric signal to the desired form.
As it turns out, a very useful parameter in several
applications is pressure. Pressure is of interest, for example,
on an aircraft (altimeter, barometric pressure), in an automo-
bile (in approximately 20 different places, but particularly
exhaust manifold pressure) and in health care (intracranial,
arterial, inner heart pressure). Each of these examples are
cases where "real time" input of pressure into a micro-
processor is desired. In the case of the aircraft altimeter
and health care, it is for monitoring purposes and in automo-
tive applications it is both monitoring (e.g., tire pressure)
and control of certain systems (e.g., carburetion, ignition).
Thus there is a need for a pressure-to-electrical transducer
or simply a solid state pressure sensor.
Solid state pressure sensors have been used in medicine
for a number of years. However, their applications have been
limited to only certain types of measurements, their relia-
bility has been low, and their cost has been high ($400 to
$500 range). In the Electrical and Computer Engineering
(ECE) Department here, active research has been under-
way for about the last three years for developing more
versatile, more reliable, and cheaper pressure sensors. The
research has been headed by Professor K.D. Wise with
much work presently being contributed by graduate stu-

form (e.g. mechanical, heat, light) and converts it to
another form.

toward the development of pressure sensors for biomedical
instrumentation. However, a sensor for automotive applica-
tions has become of increasing interest recently due to the
reduced cost of microprocessors and the need for more
energy efficient automobiles.
The biomedical and automotive pressure sensors each
have their own set of design requirements. In the cost area,
the biomedical sensors can be of modest cost ($50 each)
since the production volume would be small and since
people are willing to pay a little more for health care than
for automotive applications where volume is much higher
and cost must be kept low ($5 each). The working condi-
tions of these two types of sensors also differ. A biomedical
pressure sensor has to work over a narrow temperature
range (30° - 40°C) and must be able to measure low
pressures (0 - 200 mm Hg) with a high degree of accuracy
In addition, its dimensions must be very small (on the
order of 1 mm). On the other hand, an automotive sensor
has to operate over a wide temperature range (-40 - 200 C)
and be able to handle moderate pressures (0 - 1000 mm Hg).
However, it does not need to be as sensitive or as small
as the biomedical sensor.
The pressure sensors built by the ECE department are
of the piezoresistive^ variety. The piezoresistive effect is
observable in silicon at low levels of stress. It is a result
of a change in the charge carrier mobility (/i) with stress
in the silicon. Silicon is a desirable material for a pressure
sensor due to the highly refined techniques in processing
brought about by the development of IC's. Since stress in
silicon (with proper orientation) is a linear function of
pressure, and resistance is a linear function of carrier
mobility (temperature constant), in effect we have a
resistor that varies linearly with pressure — linear at least for
pressures in a certain range.
As it turns out, in order to produce observable effects
with the relatively small pressures which are of concern,

(Applied Mechanics) and G. V. Edmonson (Bioengineering).
In addition, graduate student J.M. Borky earned his
doctorate last year through his work on this project.
4. Piezoresistive refers to a material that has a resistance
that changes according to the pressure applied to the
material.
some kind of pressure magnification scheme is needed.
In the sensors fabricated by Professor Wise and his
assistants a very thin diaphragm of n-silicon is used as a
stress magnifying device onto which four p-silicon piezo-
resistors are diffused. The piezoresistors sense the pressure-
induced stresses in the diaphragm. A diaphragm thickness
of about 5 microns is required for obtaining reasonable
sensitivities for diameters of about 0.5mm. A supporting
rim of thick silicon is necessary for the mounting and
handling of this structure. Fig. 1 (a) shows a photograph of
a pressure sensor and Fig. 1 (b) shows the cross section.
As mentioned above a combination of four piezoresis-
tors is used on the diaphragm to form the pressure sensor.
Two of the resistors (R-|,R4) are oriented tangentially
on the diaphragm surface near the edge, since the edge is
a high stress region, and the other two (R2,Rs) are situated
near the edge with a radial orientation. They are all
connected electrically to form a bridge circuit (see Fig. 2).
A voltage (Vjn) is placed across the bridge. With no
pressure on the diaphragm Ri = R2 and R3=R4 and thus
the output voltage, Vout=0. Now if pressure is applied
to the diaphragm, stresses are realized in the resistors.
However, the tangential stresses and the radial stresses
are not the same, causing RI and R4 to change by an
Fig. 1. (b)

R3. This leads to an imbalance in the bridge circuit and Vout
changes to a value other than 0 volts. The change in Vout
is a linear function of the change in pressure on the
diaphragm. This means that the output voltage can be
calibrated so that it gives pressure directly as an output
parameter. This accomplishes changing pressure into an
electric signal that can then be fed into a microprocessor.
A factor that must be considered in the operation of a
pressure sensor is the change of resistance due to a tempera-
ture change. This comes about because mobility (/*)
increases with temperature. This can be compensated for
with a rather simple scheme. At any given temperature the
total bridge resistance is constant regardless of pressure.
This is true since R-) and R3 change by the same amount,
but in a different direction, as R2 and R4. Therefore, if the
bridge is driven by a current source instead of a voltage
source a temperature-dependent signal that is pressure
independent can be obtained from the driving point (see
Fig. 2). This signal can be used to compensate for tempera-
ture drift of the sensor. An added benefit of this circuit is
that the system's temperature can be measured using this
signal.
The actual fabrication of the pressure sensor is a process
that is similar to procedures used in making IC's. The
starting material is a sheet of n-type silicon 50-75 microns
thick which is covered with a layer of silicon dioxide on
which many chips (sensors) will be made at the same
time. The oxide is removed in the appropriate places and
the p-resistors are diffused into the n-silicon. An oxide
regrows over the resistors as they are diffused. Next holes
are opened in the oxide for contacts where wires will later
be connected to the sensor. Gold or nickel is evaporated
selectively into these openings. The diaphragm formation
step is next and is done in conjunction with the chip
separation etch. A mask (Si02) is put over the whole sheet
and is then removed from where the chips are to be
separated and the diaphragms formed. An anisotropic etch
is used which means that the etch angles in from its
starting position at a constant angle (see Fig. 3). Using this
characteristic the diaphragm thickness can be controlled. By
making the separation notch on top of the silicone sheet 1.4
times the desired diaphragm thickness, the chip will separate
from the sheet the instant that the diaphragm reaches the
correct thickness. The chip is now ready for mounting.
The mounting is an integral part of pressure sensor
development and is one of the big problems as tar as cost
is concerned. In biomedical applications size and toxicity
must be considered. In automotive applications, protection
of the sensor is a major concern. It must be able to withstand
high manifold temperatures and excessive vibration.
The future for pressure sensors is bright, however. Major
advancements have been made. Integrated circuits have been
put on the diaphragm itself that can control the temperature
drift. Another use of this on-chip 1C is for an FM signal
format thus allowing two wire operation of the sensor and
several sensors on the same two wire pair.
It may not be long until the day when you can have
your blood pressure and a host of other information
measured by simply putting a band containing a series of
pressure sensors around your wrist. Or imagine your car's
engine completely controlled by a small microprocessor
"brain" hidden under the dash communicating via pressure
sensors with the various parts of your car!

icance of this reaction to the medical field, much research
has been devoted to blood coagulation and related areas.
The majority of this research has dealt with studying the
reaction rate of the first essential step in the reaction
mechanism. The different and interesting aspects of this
proposed research are that it is intended to study the
rate of fibrin formation in various (stationary and flowing)
systems and to examine the kinetics of the polymerization
step itself.
The purpose of this proposed research is to relate the
rate of fibrin formation with the shearing forces present,
and to gain insight into the actual mechanisms taking
place during thrombin formation. Thrombin is the catalyst
for the polymerization step; therefore the rate of formation
of thrombin is proportional to the rate of fibrin polymeriza-
tion. The results can hopefully be applied to make a
working model of thrombus formation in flow situations
such as the living system. In addition it is hoped that this
research can substantiate a possible mechanism for arter-
iolesclerosis. In particular it is felt that not enough consid-
eration has been given to the fact that shearing forces may
actually enter into the kinetics and equilibrium of the fibrin
polymerization reaction. The hypothesis being tested is
that the hydrodynamic effects of shear rates similar to those
found in real circulatory systems actually increases the rate
of fibrin formation.
The fibrinogen molecule (monomer) has been shown to
be a rod-like, 3-noded structure. Polymerization takes place
as these monomers form fibers by arranging themselves in
a staggered, end-to-end fashion. Recent research with poly-
mers similar to fibrin has shown that these polymer fibers
will grow very rapidly under flowing conditions due to the
aligning of the fibers via the velocity gradients (shear rates)
at the tips of the fibers.
Research has been done measuring the effect of shear
rates on fibrin polymerization but the results have been in-
conclusive. One problem has been the relatively low shear
rates which have been used as compared to those found in
the body. This current research intends to study the effect
of shear at these high rates so as to give more significance
to the results and hopes to clarify some of the previous
data, thereby strengthening the hypothesis.
Another reason for the inconclusiveness and incon-
sistency of previous data is the fact that the rate of poly-
merization is very difficult to measure either directly or
indirectly. Much of the success of this research lies in the
elimination of this difficulty. The method to be used in-
volves an apparatus for measuring the quasi-elastic scattering
of laser light. Data is correlated in the form of a graph of
the intensity of scattered light versus the frequency of
scattered light. Translational diffusity can be directly cal-
culated from this graph and is a strong function of mole-
cular size. The data is therefore directly related to the degree
of polymerization.
A related area which is to be simultaneously studied is
the effect of blood coagulation with respect to artificial or-
gans. When an artificial material of any kind is placed in
contact with blood, the blood will form a clot on the sur-
face of the material. In creating artificial organs or exper-
imental devices which must come in contact with the cir-
culatory system, emphasis must be given to increase "bio-
compatibility" so as to reduce these clotting effects. This
research plans to use existing methods for determining bio-
compatibility in conjunction with the results from the
laser scattering apparatus in order that new insight may be
gained concerning the biocompatibility of various materials.
A final area to which this research intends to address
itself deals with the problem of arteriolesclerosis. Hardening
of the arteries, as it is better well known, is characterized by
the formation of deposits on inner surfaces throughout the
cardiovascular system. These deposits effectively reduce the
diameters of veins and arteries thereby increasing resistance
to flow and increasing the pressure necessary to maintain
proper circulation. The extremely narrow venules and arter-
ioles can become completely blocked quite easily. The con-
tinuation of this phenomenon results in a host of cardiac
and circulatory problems, most of which are quite serious.
Current evidence indicates that the formation of the deposits
occurs most often in areas of the circulatory system in
which high shear rates develop at the blood vessel walls.
It has also been determined that fibrin or fibrin-like struc-
tures comprise a large portion of these deposits. Thus the
information gathered in this research is directly applicable
to the serious problem of arteriolesclerosis. It is hoped
that with the knowledge gained about the action of fibrin
in shear fields some insight can be gained as to the reasons
for this phenomenon and possible solutions to the problems
it poses.
The subject matter of this research, the clotting of blood,
is another one of the countless number of amazing aspects
of the human body that most people take for granted. Due
to the nature of this phenomenon, it is something we can all
relate to, and the importance of this research is something
which cannot be stressed enough. Because preliminary re-
sults support his hypothesis, Dave is naturally enthusaistic
about his research. While proving his hypothesis would be
quite an accomplishment, Dave remains unbiased as to the
eventual outcome of his research, for his true quest is one
of knowledge. This attitude came through during an
explanation of his research to an interested listener when he
said: "The ultimate goal of my research is to obtain an
accurate picture of the blood coagulation mechanism.
... Once it has been established that the data being collected
by this apparatus (light scattering) is an accurate represen-
tation of the molecular state of the polymerization being
studied, the possibilities of further experimentation are
virtually left to the imagination of the experimenter!"

or What Your Mother
Never Told You
About Plant Tours
During my junior year I watched my friends who were
seniors fly to various parts of the country to interview with
different companies for jobs. I used to envy them because
I love to travel. This year I finally got my turn. The re-
sulting trips were not at all what I expected.
I had scheduled my classes so that I would have
every Thursday off. That way I could leave for a plant tour
on a Wednesday night and return to Ann Arbor the next
evening without missing any classes. My first tour was
planned for early December. The company had sent me
an itinerary and a letter which instructed me to pick up my
pre-paid airline tickets at the airport one hour before the
flight departure time. The flight was scheduled to leave
Detroit Metropolitan Airport at 5:00 pm. I had an exam
from two to three so I decided to take the 3:30 pm airport
limousine. Since Metro Airport is only a thirty minute
drive from Ann Arbor I was sure I would be there in
plenty of time. Immediately after my exam I headed for
the Michigan Union to buy a limousine ticket.
Ticket in hand, I headed downstairs to the outside door
near the University Cellar. Being the first time I had ever
used this service I decided to ask someone who looked like
they were leaving if I was at the correct door. Before I had a
chance to question someone, an older man in his sixties
saw my suitcase and asked me if I were going to the air-
port. I found out I was indeed at the right place and all
I had to do was wait. Meanwhile, the man struck up a con-
versation with me. I found out that he was going to the air-
port to catch a connecting bus to his home in suburban
Detroit. He then asked me what I was studying and what
company I was going to see.
When he found out that I was studying electrical engin-
eering he asked me if I was culturally void like most engin-
eers. I replied that I hoped not (only because I was dumb-
by Cindy Rogers
founded by the question) and he inquired as to why I did
not think I was devoid of culture. I told him that I en-
joyed classical music and had played the viola since the
fifth grade. We then conversed about several classical com-
posers, famous present-day musicians and the best orchestras
and conductors in the country. He seemed to be an ex-
tremely intelligent and well educated man.
Then, out of the clear blue sky, he asked me what I
thought of giving medical electric shocks to people. I told
him that if my heart were to stop I would gladly be given
electrical shock to start it beating. It turned out that was
not the type of electrical shock he meant. By this time I
knew what he meant, "and I did not like the way the con-
versation was going. He then asked specifically what I
thought about giving electric shocks to mental patients.
I told him that I really did not believe in hurting people if
there was no reason to, so I guessed that I did not believe
in them. He asked if I had ever talked to anyone who had
received electric shock treatments. When I told him that I
had not he replied that maybe I had and had not realized
it. Yes, I thought, maybe I had, but certainly not until I
had conversed with him. Now that I knew he was or had
been a mental patient I was a bit frightened. The closest
I had ever come to psychology was physiological psychology
my freshman year.
The limousine finally arrived and the man, another
girl, and I boarded. The driver said he would be a little
late leaving the Union and then went inside. When he said
this I assumed he meant only fifteen or twenty minutes
late. At about 3:45 a young man and his father boarded.
They seemed normal enough, so I conversed with them and
hoped my not-so-normal friend would leave me alone. Af-
ter five minutes the older man decided that I liked the
young man and insisted we sit together. I warned the young
man that the older man was a bit strange and asked him
to stay close to me for the afternoon and I'd explain every-
14
Michigan Technic


thing at the airport. It was about this time that the young
man's father became irritated because the limousine had not
left for the airport yet, so he went inside the Union to see
if the driver could be paged. In the meantime, two limou-
sines had come to the Union — one never stopped and the
other had a driver who disappeared into the building as
fast as our driver had. By 4:00 pm the front desk at the
Union had made several futile attempts to page the airport
limo drivers. It turned out that the young man and his
father had reservations on the 6:00 pm flight to La
Guardia. That set my mind at ease; even if I missed my
flight, I could probably make their flight.
We finally left the Union at 4:30 on the "3:30" limou-
sine. I dashed for the American Airlines ticket counter at
4:55 when we arrived to find that my flight was on time.
(I've never had a plane before or since be on time.) Re-
solved to the fact that I missed my plane, I got in line to
see if I could catch the next flight into La Guardia. While
standing there in line I heard several people ahead of me
talking about how they wanted to take the 6:00 pm flight
into La Guardia. What luck! I asked someone why every-
one seemed to want to get into MY airport and was told
that all flights into Newark had been cancelled and every-
one was transferring into Kennedy and La Guardia, the
New York City airports. I tried two different airlines,
but was unable to find a flight until 6:00 am the next morn-
ing. Even if I had been able to get into New York City that
night, I could not have reached my destination of upstate
New York. I felt very stupid trying to explain that I would
not be at the interview the next morning when I called the
representative of the company.
The next plant tour I took was two weeks later, during
study days. Before I left, I thought nothing could match
the last attempt; I assumed this trip would run smoothly
and be totally uneventful. I was wrong again! Being ex-
tremely irritated at the airport limo service, I asked a
friend to take me to the airport. I told him that my plane
was scheduled to leave at 5:40 pm. The morning of the
trip I looked at the ticket again - 4:50! At 3:00 pm I
tried to call him, but realized that he had said he had to
register for classes at that time. I wasn't sure if I'd get in
touch with him in time so I caught the 3:30 limo. I didn't
think we'd make it that time either when a state policeman
motioned to the driver to pull over for speeding. Fortun-
ately, the policeman let us go on.
I had the ticket in my hand, so once we arrived I quickly
ran for the boarding gate. (After that first experience I
made it a point to pack only a small suitcase that I could
carry on the airplane.) With only ten minutes to spare I
arrived at the gate. There the posted departure time was
listed for 6:10 pm, and I assumed that I had either missed
my plane or was at the wrong gate. I asked if I was at the
right gate and was told I was. The plane had been delayed
because the 3:00 pm flight from Metro had flown to Newark
(my destination), circled Newark for an hour attempting to
land and was sent back to Metro due to some problem in
Newark. The passengers on that flight also boarded our
plane.
The flight went very smoothly, and luckily the limousine
driver was still waiting for me at Newark Airport. The limo
March 1978

told me that he was moonlighting at the job because he
had alimony and child support payments besides a very
expensive girlfriend. When we were close to the motel where
I was staying he told me about the great bar in the motel
and added that the company I was interviewing with
would pick up all of my bills. I knew he was waiting for me
to ask him in for a drink, but I told him I never touch the
stuff. (A little lie now and then . . . ) The rest of the tour
went well, considering I had to stay an extra day for inter-
views in a different location.
My third and fourth plant tours were in California. After
spending some time in Los Angeles with the Rose Bowl
tour, I flew up to San Jose for my interviews in that area.
A twenty five year old young man named Bob sat next to
me on the airplane to San Jose. He was very friendly and
very eager to talk to me. Half an hour after take-off the
plane ran into some turbulence. At that point, friendly Bob
put his arm on my leg and his head on my shoulder because
he said he was "frightened." He told me it was a shame I
would not be in Los Angeles because he could show me all
of the hot spots. He really liked technically oriented women,
too!
The fifth tour had its high spots, also. This time I played
it safe on the flight time; my reservations were for 6:00 pm
Wednesday into La Guardia. Since I had to miss my after-
noon classes anyway I hopped on the 12:30 pm limo and
took the 2:00 pm flight instead. I arrived in up-state New
York five hours early and got a good night's sleep. My
interviews on Thursday went very well. However, Thurs-
day night it began to snow and by Friday New York City
was in the middle of the worst snowstorm it had seen since
1967. Luckily I had plane reservations for Saturday instead
of Friday because all of the airports were closed on Friday.
I left up-state New York on Saturday morning for La
Guardia Airport. Although I arrived an hour and a half be-
fore the flight was to leave, I knew I'd never make it to
the American Airlines check-in counter in that amount of
time. It looked like the entire city of New York was waiting
at that ticket counter. I decided to avoid the congestion
and checked my bag with one of the bell hops outside
and headed straight for the boarding area for my boarding
pass. There were still thirty or forty people ahead of me
in the line for passes. Then they called for people with con-
firmed reservations on the flight, and only three men and I
went to the desk. I was fourth. When I handed them my
ticket they said they were sorry but there were no more
boarding passes. My bag was on American Airlines flight
619, but I wouldn't be. When I looked like I would break
down in tears, somehow they managed to find me a pass.
(This works every time.) While I was waiting to board,
a yound man asked me if I was flying to Metro Airport
in Detroit. It turned out he was a chemical engineer at
Toledo University and had been interviewing in New
Jersey. He asked if he could sit next to me on the plane.
I told him that our boarding passes were not next to
each other, and he probably would not be able to. When
we boarded the plane he sat next to me anyway. The
lady who had the seat next to me came and told him
nicely that he was in the wrong seat. He told her that we had
just gotten married and would she mind switching passes
with him. She felt sorry for us being on our honeymoon
and not being able to sit together so she switched passes.
Oh well, that sure was not anything new to me by that
time, with the people I had met on the other tours.
After everyone was seated, there was one man who had
boarded without a pass. Since he had no seat, the steward-
ess asked him why they let him on. He told her that he
had been a flight attendant for American Airlines at one
time, and he was getting married in Southfield, Michigan
in four hours. The poor man ended up helping the
stewardesses serve dinner since they were two flight
attendants short. The flight, my last, went well, considering
the weather. I managed to make it back to Ann Arbor in
one piece. Although my plant tours are over for now, I'm
looking forward to business trips in my future work!

chnic
50 and 25
Years Ago
by Karen Zahn
Regular features were common in past Technics and
featured everything from new products to alumni news to
entertainment such as puzzles and jokes. This month we
look at a couple of regular features which graced the pages of
Technics in 1928 and 1953.
50 Years Ago
Engineering societies and their activities are an integral
part of many engineer's college careers, whether the
organizations are honorary, departmental, or social. A
regular feature in 1928 was "The College Chronicle" which
presented current activities by the various societies and
also happenings of general interest in the College of
Engineering.
One of the largest events of the year announced in the
March issue was the annual Engineering Open House, a two-
day affair held that year on March 23 and 24. (And you
thought this year's Open House was a new event!) The
Open House featured displays by the aeronautical, automo-
tive, chemical, civil, electrical, marine, mechanical and
military engineering departments. A prominent display
was a Wright Whirlwind motor.
Many societies active today were also active 50 years ago,
including AIEE, ASME, Tau Beta Pi, and AlChE, who
listed as their speaker that month Dr. H.H. Dow.
The Engineering Council was in the midst of being
restructured from the old Engineering Society, although
its "exact scope of application and executive powers (had)
not (been) determined yet." The Engineering Council
did bring activities such as All-Engineering Smokers, All-
Engineering Convocations, and the Engineering Open House
under a central control.
Several clubs active then are no longer in existence today.
The Engineering Debating Society was in the process of
organization and, at that time, was open to the class of
'30 and succeeding classes. Promotions for the society
offered this description: "This society is not a stiff, formal
gathering of powerful elocutionists, but rather an active,
direct thinking, semi-formal gathering of fellows who like
to air their views of r. oblems of common interest.
Incidentally, they are securing practice in thought and its
expression while standing before an audience."
The Transportation Club covered interests dealing with
every aspect of transportation and provided a link between
railway, aeronautical, highway, and marine engineers. The
society held regular meetings with speakers and conducted
field trips. In addition, there was a separate Aero Club which
was open to anyone who was interested in aeronautics.
The club had special balloon and glider sections.
25 Years Ago
Another popular feature from 25 years ago was "Technic
Teasers," a page of puzzles and mathematical tricks. (As
if you weren't already challenged enough by problem
sets!) A sampling from the March 1953 issue include:
Once upon a time a large business firm planned to
open a new branch in a certain city, and so they adver-
tised positions for three new clerks. Out of a number of
applicants the personnel manager selected three promising
young men and addressed them in the following way: "Your
salaries are to be paid every half-year. If your work is
satisfactory, and we keep you, your salaries will be
raised. Which would you prefer, a raise of $150 per year
or a raise of $50 every half year?" The first two of the
three applicants eagerly accepted the first alternative, but
the third young man (a Michigan graduate), after a mom-
ent's reflection, took the second. He was promptly put in
charge of the other two. Why?
Here are four quickies - these aren't difficult if you
remember the lesson of the first problem and don't jump
to conclusions.
The clock on Burton Tower strikes six in five seconds.
How long does it take to strike twelve? (The answer is nor
ten seconds.)
A bottle and its cork cost together $1.10. The bottle
cost a dollar more than the cork. How much does the
bottle cost? (The answer is nor $1.00.)

same time that a local leaves Ann Arbor for Detroit. The ex-
press travels at the rate of 50 miles per hour, the local at
the rate of 30 miles per hour. Which is further from Detroit
when they meet? (The answer is not the express.)
A physicist drove his car 1 mile to the top of a moun-
tain at the rate of 15 miles per hour. How fast must he
drive 1 mile down the other side in order to average 30
miles per hour for the whole trip of 2 miles? (The answer
is not 45 miles per hour.)
While thumbing through an Ancient Greek Manuscript
the other day I stumbled upon a problem put to one
Polycrates by Pythagoras (of Pythagorian Theorem fame)
and it went thusly:
Polycrates speaks: Blessed Pythagoras, Helicenian scion
of the Muses, answer my question: How many in thy house
are engaged in the contest for wisdom performing excellent-
ly?
Pythagoras answers: I will tell thee then, Polycrates. Half
of them are occupied with belles lettres; a quarter of them
apply themselves to studying immortal nature; a seventh
are all intent on silence and the eternal discourse of their
hearts. (Author's note: These last were probably chess
players.) There are also three women, among whom the
superior is Theano. That is the number of interpreters
of the Muses I gather round me.
How many were there?
H.A. Merrill in Mathematical Excursions has collected
several rather unique methods for remembering the value
of Pi. To remember four places you merely mumble to
yourself, "Yes, I have a number." This expression has
the number of letters in the successive words — 3, 1,4, 1,
6 — to give the digits for pi.
To remember twelve places we are told to say to our-
selves the following:
"See, I have a rhyme assisting
My feeble brain, its tasks ofttimes resisting."
And to remember to thirty places we repeat the
French verse:
"Que j'aime a faire apprendre un nombre utile aux sages!
Immortel Archimede, sublime ingenieur,
Qui de ton jugements peut sender la valeur?
Pour noi ton probleme cut de pareils avantages."
Such verses must be considered the ultimate in func-
tional art.

HERE'S ONE ENGINEERING OPPORTUNITY
YOU WON'T GET IN PRIVATE INDUSTRY.
If you're thinking about a
technical position after graduation,
think about this.
How many companies can offer
you a nuclear submarine to operate?
The answer is none. Equipment
like this is available only in
one place—the Navy.
The Navy operates over half the
nuclear reactors in America.
So our training is the broadest and
most comprehensive. We start by
giving you a year of advanced
technical education. In graduate
school, this would cost you
thousands, but in the Navy, we
pay you.
Once you're a commissioned
Nuclear Propulsion Officer, you'll
earn a top salary. Over $24,000
a year after four years. And
you'll be responsible for some
of the most advanced equipment
developed by man.
The Navy also has other
opportunities in surface ships
and aviation assignments. If you
are majoring in engineering, math
or the physical sciences, contact
your placement office to find out
when a Navy representative will be
on campus. Or send your resume to:

IT'S NOT JUST A JOB, IT'S AN ADVENTURE.


Take
a lesson
from a tennis pro.
A tennis champion's powerful backhand looks as smooth and
unhurried as a ballerina's graceful bow. What's the secret? Being
in the right position in plenty of time.
"Remember this about the backhand," the pros advise. "Get both feet
around pointing toward the sideline. And always make sure the right foot's
forward, so your body doesn't cramp your swing."
Getting into proper position early is good advice for college seniors, too.
Here's the first step:
When companies interview on your campus, make sure they interview you. When The Timken
Company representative stops by, don't let him go without seeing you.
He'll fill you in on our work (maybe your work) with the aerospace, automotive, construction,
chemical industries. Our openings in production, engineering, sales, marketing, finance,
metallurgy. Our continuing expansion and modernization program. And our strict policy of
promotion from within.
So you won't get caught flat-footed when it's
your turn to make your move.

like Du Pont, an engineer can
change careers without
changing companies*
— LJnda Land BS, Mechanical Engineering
"My job gives me the chance
to change assignments every cou-
ple of years. This has two advan-
tages: 1 get variety, yet I am in one
place long enough to make a
contribution.
"Du Pont has many opportu-
nities for engineers to learn,
develop and establish their own
kinds of careers—whether in
research or practical applications,
in specialized or broad fields, in
supervision or technical work."
Linda was recruited by
Du Pont from the Mississippi State
campus in 1973. She interviewed
about 30 companies.
Linda's story is typical of
many Chemical, Mechanical and
Electrical Engineers who've
chosen careers at Du Pont.
We place no limits on the
progress our engineers can make.
And we place no limits on the con-
tributions they can make to them-
selves, the Company or to society.
If this sounds like your kind of
company, do what Linda Land
did: talk to the Du Pont represen-
tative who visits your campus. Or

The Inside Story
"Allow me to introduce myself," as the Count used to say. I'm the new
staff writer for the Technic, and my name is Nagihcim Cinhcet. (If you're a
regular reader you may remember my brother, Mutad.) Now that Mutad's
graduated (class of '78) and gone to work for Bingham Plastics, I'll be taking
over his job of writing this column. Since I'm only a freshman, it wouldn't be
appropriate to say "Welcome back." However, I will say I hope you enjoy
this issue and the rest of them throughout the year.
Far above us at this very moment many satellites are orbiting the earth.
Their functions vary from transmitting television signals to reporting weather
to defense communication, and their numbers are growing every year. Recently
there have been instances of satellites malfunctioning, and, in some cases,
evidence that they were outright destroyed. The culprit is often another
satellite, specially designed and programmed for that reason. Veteran writer
Greg Werth, pow a senior in EE, looks into these "killer" satellites in his
article "Killer Satellites: A Menace in Space."
Are engineers the dull, unimaginative people that they are stereotyped to
be? They don't have to be. A new way of "creative" thinking has been espoused
by several prominent authors. The Technic continues in this vein by presen-
ting resident creative thinker Bill Cowie and his article, "Creativity in
Engineering" in which he describes creative thinking and how it can be
applied to solving engineering and everyday problems. He even includes a
short quiz for you to take which will give you an indication of how creative
you are, along with suggestions for improvement. Bill is Managing Editor
this year and a senior in Aerospace.
If you're a graduating senior, you'll be glad to hear that the upcoming hiring
season for engineers will be one of the biggest in history with starting salaries
continuing to climb. If you'll be graduating within the next few years, you'll
be glad to hear that hiring of engineers is expected to continue to increase.
In some industries, such as aerospace, there is an acute shortage of skilled
personnel, and the competition between companies for hiring is keen. Editor
Karen Zahn discusses the hiring situation and presents the statistics for
interviewing and hiring (from the Placement Office) in her article "Employ-
ment On the Rise for Engineers."
The next time someone challenges you to "Dungeons and Dragons" or
"Richtofen's War" take them seriously. They are probably enthusiasts of the
current craze of wargaming. Unlike small games, such as Monopoly or
checkers, which involve a small board and a few playing pieces, wargames
generally cover larger areas like whole tabletops or even floors and can utilize
hundreds of playing pieces and 50 page books of rules. Business Manager Paul
Cook is a wargame enthusiast and gives an introduction to the subject in the
first of a three-part series entitled "WARGAMES: Tabletop Explorations."
Included is a history of wargaming.

By Karen Zahn
Here it is, folks, the article you've all been waiting
for; the job outlook for 1979 and average starting salaries
for graduates in 1978. The upcoming hiring year promises
to be one of the best in more than a decade, with students
graduating at the end of 1978 having 11% more job openings
to choose from than 1977 graduates, and the openings are
increasing to 26% more openings for 1979 graduates.
The sudden surge of openings is due largely to an increase
in defense spending, noticeable mainly in the aircraft
industry, combined with a decline in engineering graduates
after the slump years of the early 1970s. And as the demand
for engineers increases, graduating engineers are commanding
higher and higher starting salaries. It was reported that one
employer was paying 8% to 10% more for BSE graduates in
1978 than for MSE graduates in 1977.
Will the demand continue to increase or will it start to
swing down, as it did in the early 1970s? Some observers
say that in a few years there will be an oversupply of
engineers. Citing the high starting salaries that are luring
more and more students into engineering, enrollment
figures are predicted to reach 84,000 in 1979, as compared
to a low of 50,000 in 1971-72. If the number of technical
openings does not increase proportionately, then another
downswing is expected to occur.
But many observers, including some employers, believe
that the shortage will continue, even with increased
enrollments. Technology is rapidly expanding, with the
search for new forms of energy, the increase in the use of
complicated microprocessors in many industries, and new
techniques needed in the design of many products. All
this adds up to more jobs and the need for specialty-
trained personnel.
Defense spending is on the rise, after being low for
several years. Its impact is being felt on the market,
particularly in the aircraft industry, and the hiring compe-
tition between companies is becoming furious. The situation
is especially competitive in southern California, where the
aerospace industry is centered. A survey of Aviation Week
and Space Technology indicated a need for 3600 engineers
by 1979 in eight major aerospace firms. Another estimate
places the number of total openings in southern California
as near 30,000.
As a result, companies there have resorted to unusual
advertising practices and offering more than just salary to
attract qualified applicants. Last Memorial Day weekend
Hughes Aircraft hired an airplane to tow a banner over
Los Angeles area beaches advertising for engineers. The
response was disappointingly small. Pomona Division of
General Dynamics had been hosting open houses for inter-
viewing on weekends, and is also utilizing radio commercials
in several major cities. Some companies are being forced to
recruit nationally for the first time. The higher cost of
living in California is believed to one deterrent, and at
least one company is offering low-cost home loans to pros-
pective employees.
National Enrollment and Degrees Granted
Total engineering enrollments were increased again in
1977 for the fourth consecutive year since reaching a 20
year low in 1973. Of 289 U.S. colleges, offering bachelors
and higher degrees in engineering, surveyed by the Engin-
eering Manpower Commission of the Engineers Joint
Council, Freshmen enrollments reached 88,780 in 1977.
This is the largest enrollment ever recorded, and is almost
an 8% increase from 1976. Sophomores, Juniors, and
Seniors also increased significantly. Graduate engineering
enrollments increased by almost 8%. From 1973, an
increase of 55% in total enrollment was noted.
The four most popular curricula are electrical and
mechanical engineering, followed by civil and chemical.
Since 1973 chemical and civil have shown slight gains in
degrees awarded with electrical and mechanical showing
decreases of 20% and 10% respectively. The aerospace in-
dustry is facing a major decrease in supply, with degrees
awarded in that field dropping by 30% from 1973 to 1977.
The total number of degrees awarded has decreased 7.4%
for all curricula combined from 1973 to 1977. The drop in
degrees in the larger curricula have been balanced by an
increase in more specialized areas. Since 1973 petroleum
and environmental engineering degrees have increased by
20%.
The Outlook At Michigan
Here on the home front, the market also looks very
good, with increases over last year in almost every category.
From June 4, 1977 to June 4, 1978, there was a 14% in-
crease in the total number of degrees granted. Bachelors

5NGINEEQING
By Bill Cowie
The ability to be creative can be a valuable asset for an engineer,
allowing him to solve difficult problems by generating fresh
ideas when conventional thinking fails. But most engineers do
not realize that creativity is simply a different type of thought
process, and that this process can be learned. Thus most
engineers fail to develop their full creative potential.
Try this puzzle. Arrange six kitchen matches to make
four equilateral triangles. The length of each side of each
triangle must be equal to the length of one match. You
may not break the matches.
Most people begin to solve this puzzle by constructing
one triangle with three of the matches, and search for some
way to construct three more triangles with the three re-
maining matches. Soon, they run into a dead end; there
seems to be no solution.
The solution comes when one steps back to reevaluate
the problem. Most people try to solve the problem while
leaving the matches flat on the table. But leaving the
matches flat on the table is not required by the instructions
to the puzzle. Most people simply impose this requirement
on themselves, and thus prevent themselves from finding a
solution. The only way to solve this problem is to use three
dimensions. Using three of the matches, construct a
triangle flat on the table. Then use the remaining three
to construct a pyramid with the triangle as its base. The
result is four equilateral triangles using only six matches.
The solution to this puzzle illustrates one of the basic
processes of creative thought. Only by ridding oneself of
the restriction of two dimensions can the puzzle be solved.
When conventional thinking fails, creative thinking leads to
the solution.
This puzzle also demonstrates the fact that creativity
often allows an individual to solve seemingly impossible
problems by generating fresh ideas when conventional
thinking becomes blocked. Thus a person who possesses a
creative ability would undoubtedly be better at solving
problems than a person who does not, since the creative
individual will be able to solve problems that stymie the less
creative individual.
As engineers, it will be our job to find new and better
ways to solve many problems. Since we have seen that
16

logical that a more creative individual will make a better
engineer. But most of us do not inherently possess a great
deal of creativity. Does this mean that we are doomed to be
nothing more than average engineers, hindered by our in-
ability to think creatively? Not at all. Many researchers in
this field believe that creative thinking is simply a mental
process, and that this process can be learned by any intelli-
gent person. In fact, many researchers believe that most
people possess a great deal of creative potential which they
simply fail to develop.
So if a creative engineer is a good engineer, and if this
creative ability can be learned, an important question for
many engineers is: how can a person learn to increase his
ability to think creatively? To learn how, one must first
understand what creativity is.
What is Creativity?
Creativity is not easy to define. One can think of several
synonyms — ingenuity, imagination, originality — but these
are not quite accurate. Basically, creativity is the ability
to formulate a unique idea, or to combine old ideas in a
unique way. This definition is a starting point, but to
really understand the concept of creativity, we need some
insight into the mind of the creative individual.
There is, and always has been, a general misconception
about the highly creative individual. In olden times, it was
widely believed that creativity and mental illness were
somehow related. The old saying, "There is a fine line
between genius and insanity", captures this widespread
belief. Only in this century, under the scrutiny of scientific
research, has this myth been disproven. Emperical studies
of brilliant individuals have revealed "an unusual amount of
persistence and drive among these people, but little incidence
of psychosis."[1] And today, it is still widely believed that
creativity is a peculiar gift of a few rare individuals.
But researchers have found that this idea has also failed
the test of evidence. Although it appears that creative
ability is partly determined by genetics, research indicates
that it is strongly influenced by environment. So with these
myths behind us, let's move on to the facts.
A highly creative person tends to perceive the things
about himself in a different way thqn does the-average
person. Where the average person sees nothing more than a
rainy, stormy day, the creative person perceives the anger in
the clouds, and the ongoing struggle between the wind and
the trees. This difference in perception can be seen quite
vividly in the works of impressionistic artists.
The thought processes of the highly creative individual
also differ from those of the average person. (One researcher
found physiological evidence to support this. He observed
that patterns of brain waves differ between highly creative
and less creative individuals when assigned a creative task.)
Instead of the very rational and highly disciplined train
of thought that one would expect of an Edison or an
Einstein, the creative mind tends to be irrational. Further-
more, "the creative individual not only respects the irrational
in himself, but courts it as the most promising source of
novelty in his own thought."[1] This way of thinking has
been termed "divergent" thinking as opposed to the more
conventional "convergent" thinking. Let's look at the
difference between the two.
Convergent vs. Divergent Thinking
From elementary school through high school and now in
college, we have been trained to think convergently. We
are taught that there is a single, unique, "correct" answer
to most problems, and if we analyze a problem properly,
our thought processes should lead us to converge on that
single answer. The occasional individual who does not think
along this pattern, but uses the "irrational" thought process
is often laughed at by his peers, or chided by a teacher for
"being silly". Since his ideas and answers are generally
considered strange, or even wrong, he soon learns to
refrain from this method of thought, and will usually join
the others in using the more conventional method of
convergent thought, thus stifling his creative ability.
Yet the creative person — the one who retains the
talent of divergent thought — does not always set out after a
single, unique solution to a problem. Instead, this type of
person generally uses an entirely differentthoughtsequence.
After evaluating the problem, he will tend to step back
from it, try to look at it in a different perspective, and try
to rid himself of any restrictive assumptions that may limit
himself. He is then inclined to let his mind flow freely, to
let his imagination wander, and to think of many possible
ideas or solutions. It does not bother him that many of
these ideas may be ridiculous and obviously unacceptable;
in fact, he does not even stop to evaluate the merits of any
idea. Often, the simplest and most direct solution will
suddenly pop up from the others and become very obvious.
Even if this does not happen, the divergent thinker has
generated a broad set of ideas, each of which can be analyzed
in a convergent method to determine which is best.
This method is often used by a group of people, in a
technique which is commonly called brainstorming. In
fact, the brainstorming technique was developed by applying
what was known about the creative process in an individual
to a process that could be used by a group.
The creative person also depends quite heavily on his
subconscious, even though he is generally not aware of it.
Often, the answer to a particularly tough problem will
suddenly emerge in a dream, or an idea will suddenly strike
the person while he is relaxing. At some time in his life, this
person has developed a means of effectively using his
subconscious mind, and effectively coordinating it with
his conscious mind.
So the creative process generally goes as follows. After
analyzing the problem, the divergent thinker will step back
from it, and will generally look at it in a unique way. He will
then generate many different ideas without stopping to
analyze each one as it is formed. This process is often aided

average individual.
by the subconscious part of the mind, and may continue
for days, weeks, or even years. From this pool of ideas that
he has generated, he then analyzes each to determine the
best solution.
It is important to note that the truly ingenious person
does not rely strictly on divergent thinking, the way less
creative people tend to rely strictly on convergent thinking.
The creative individual uses the divergent thought process
to complement the convergent process, and realizes the
essential nature of the latter.
Increasing Creative Ability
Now that we understand much of what is currently
known about the creative thought process, we can return to
the original question: how can a person increase his ability
to think creatively? Those of you who have read this far
probably possess two of the three necessary elements: a
desire to be more creative, and a basic understanding of the
creative thought process. The third element is practice. You
have already spent the better part of your life developing
your skills at convergent thinking and are probably pretty
good at it. To become more creative, you must make a
conscious effort to develop the skills of divergent thinking.
Unfortunately, there is no text book to read, nor professor
to ask questions of. But there are various puzzles and
problems that can help one determine his own creative
ability, and can help point out the reasons why he may not
be using his full creative ability. (See inset; How Creative
are You?} These puzzles can also help you exercise your
creative faculties, but they tend to be -of limited use;
once you have figured a problem out, it can not be used
again unless you forget the solution.
One of the best exercises to develop your creative ability

3. Draw four straight lines through thp nine dots without
lifting your pen from the paper or retracing any line. If that
is too easy, try to do it with only three straight lines. Again,
no retracing or lifting your pen.
There are several methods of testing one's creative
ability, although in some cases, researchers are not certain
whether the tests truly measure one's creative ability, or
whether they partially measure some other quantity, such
as intelligence or knowledge.
One method uses various riddles and puzzles. Generally,
they are constructed so that one must step back from the
problem and look at it differently if the answer is not
immediately obvious. Also, one must be careful to avoid
self-imposed restrictions that block the mind from reaching
the solution. See how you do on the following puzzles.
The answers are on page 39.
1. Name a device used to" help people look through brick
walls.
2. After a beautiful drive on the 12th hole, Joe discovered
his ball had rolled into a small paper bag which someone
had carelessly left on the fairway. If he removed the ball
from the bag, he would have to take a penalty stroke. If he
tries to hit the ball while it is in the bag, he will probably
lose control of the shot. What should he do?
4. A farmer has an L-shaped piece of land that looks like
this.

brick, a blanket, etc.) and write down as many uses as you
can imagine for that object other than the use it is intended
for. For instance, consider the possible uses for a brick.
When researchers gave this problern to a large number of
people, they found that the less creative people would think
of such mundane things as "use it as a bookend" or "use it
as a doorstop". But one very creative response given by a
young girl was "use it as a bug-hider". When confused
researchers asked her to explain, she replied, "Leave it
on the ground for a few days, and when you go back and
pick it up, you will find bugs hiding underneath it." Now
that is creative!
Although there is still much to learn, many researchers
feel that we now have a basic understanding of the creative
thought process. Unlike the more restrictive thought process,
the creative individual tends to begin with a free-flowing,
imaginative process which often appears to be irrational or
even absurd. After generating many possible ideas, the
creative thinker often uses a more convergent process to
evaluate each idea and determine which is best. This
second step is not always necessary, however, since the best
solution will oftentimes strike the person suddenly, creating
what some call the "aha!" or "Eureka!" response.
And finally, it is no longer assumed that creativity is the
rare gift of certain individuals, or that it is related to
mental illness. Researchers now believe that creativity is a
mental process that can be learned by almost anyone with
average intelligence and the desire to be more creative.

another jar of the same size. At exactly 10:00 a.m., the jar
that originally held two flatworms is exactly filled. At what
time will the jar that originally held only one flatworm be
filled?
Another method of testing creativity involves the use of
word association puzzles. However, this type of test
probably measures one's vocabulary as well as his creative
ability.
The following set of problems requires you to think of a
fifth word that is related to the four that are given. You may
form an entirely new word, a compound or hyphenated

The final method is one which many researchers feel is
the closest to measuring pure creativity. A person is simply
asked to list as many different uses for a particular object
as he can think of, such as the brick problem discussed
in the article. For instance, sit down with a pencil and paper
for 10 minutes and write down all the unusual uses you
can think of for junked automobiles. Then check page 39

A Menace in Space
By Greg Werth
Satellites in outer space are now
being threatened by the latest
advance in weaponry.
Since the launching of the first Sputnik in 1957 by the
U.S.S.R. both the United States and the Soviet Union have
exploited space for military purposes, using satellites for
communications, navigations, reconnaissance, and for early
warning of attack. Most authorities view such satellites as
an enhancement rather than a threat of military stability.
For example, in 1972 surveillance satellites enabled both
countries to monitor an agreement placing ceilings on land -
and sea - based ballistic missiles. The same satellites will be
essential in verifying future, more comprehensive records.
But, recently a new breed of satellite has cropped up; the
"hunter-killer" satellite, designed to approach another
satellite in its orbit, identify it, and disable it. Why would
anyone want to disable satellites? For the simple reason
that they are our "eyes" in the sky. In today's super
sophisticated world of modern warfare, highly sensitive
early warning satellites have become our first line of defense.
These satellites could become targets for countries wishing
to disrupt our defenses, and it might be difficult to deter-
mine whether one of our early warning satellites had been
attacked or simply malfunctioned. For example, when a
potential target moves out of range of its home tracking
station, a killer satellite could destroy it, so that as far as
the tracking station was concerned, its satellite would have
merely malfunctioned.
U.S. Dependence on Satellites
Robert Kirk, president of Vought Corporation in Dallas,
which is presently building a potential U.S. antisatellite
weapon, told a Washington audience in early February
that, "In the military arena, our forces are becoming
critically reliant on space for surveillance, reconnaissance,
early warning, navigation, meteorology, mapping, communi-
cations and command and control." Satellites now handle
two thirds of U.S. military messages abroad. For the
superpower nations that rely on them, satellites play a
vital role in the use of long range detection, communication,
navigation, and missile guidance systems that would be
useless without them.
In early 1976, after four years of hibernation, the
Soviets resumed testing of killer satellites. The new tests
have triggered a concern in government circles as to whether
its own apparently highly vulnerable satellites should be
further protected. The U.S. also made it clear that it will
consider the annihilation of its satellites to be a most serious
hostile act. Many specialists believe that a large scale'
antisatellite attack would probably occur as a prelude to
World War III. However, a killer program could be used to
harass U.S. satellites.
Types of Killer Weapons
Conventional weapons, and their use on satellites, are
not practical in the vacuum and weightlessness of space;
sacrificial satellites which deliberately detonate themselves
are. For example, if a satellite tried to fire a projectile, say
a 20-mm cannon, it would have the same effect as turning
on a propulsion rocket on the craft. The satellite would be
blasted out of its orbit by the recoil of the cannon, render-
ing it useless.
At present, research and development efforts are concen-
trating on three methods of destruction for use in anti-
satellite strategies. These are (1) sacrificial satellites, (2)
satellites using laser beams, and (3) satellites using particle
beam accelerators.
Most satellites carry self-destruct apparatus that can be
triggered by radio command from Earth. Until recently,
this feature had been used only to dispose of unwanted

gone dead, or otherwise outlived their usefulness. Thus, if
satellites can be exploded remotely from Earth, the ability
to use them as a controllable weapon is obvious. Just
sneak the killer satellite up to the target and when it is close
enough have it self destruct, hurling shrapnel at the target
and disabling it.
The second type of destructive device, the laser, has
several advantages. Unlike conventional weapons, the laser
has no recoil. It is extremely fast - literally traveling at the
speed of light. In fact, a laser would be more effective in
space than on Earth. On a cloudy or foggy day on Earth
the high magnitude of concentration of the laser is
diminished. But this is not a problem in airless space. A
killer satellite armed with a high intensity laser gun could
disable an enemy satellite or an ICBM (Intercontinental
Ballistic Missile) as it traveled through the atmosphere on
its deadly run. One serious drawback to the laser is that
a light beam of weapon magnitude requires a tremendous
amount of energy. In spite of this obstacle, both the U.S.
and the U.S.S.R. are involved in extensive research and
development in using lasers as weapons.
The third type of destructive apparatus being researched
is the particle beam weapon which accelerates charged
atomic particles, such as protons and electrons, and uses
large electromagners to aim the stream of particles. United
States military intelligence indicates that the Soviets have
had a mammoth research commitment to this weapon for
the past twenty years. Some speculators estimate that the
Soviets may have such a weapon fully experimental by the
1980's. In May of 1977, the prominent industry magazine
Aviation Week and Space Technology ominously reported
that such a breakthrough "may soon provide a direct-
energy beam weapon capable of neutralizing the entire
United States ballistic missile force.
"Research in the U.S. in this area has been limited
because our scientists are skeptical of the feasibility of
particle accelerators as weapons. These devices would
possess many of the same drawbacks as laser weapons.
They require huge amounts of energy to operate, and the
force of the weapon would be diminished by the Earth's
atmosphere, which would scatter and weaken the beam
concentration. Even in space, where scattering is not a
problem, the accuracy of the weapon would be altered
by the Earth's magnetic field. However, if all the bugs were
solved, the particle accelerator would be a deadly antimissile
weapon.
Soviet Antisatellite Program
In the early 1960's Soviet interest in destroying satellites
was spurred when Nikita Khrushchev and other Soviet
leaders began to express concern over the initial deployment
of American spy satellites. In spite of these complaints
Moscow did not then have the capability to hinder American
space surveillance. But by the mid-1960's the Soviet Union
did possess its own spy satellites. In 1967 both nations
agreed to an Outer Space Treaty to ban the orbiting of
mass destruction weapons, and it appeared momentarily
that a potential arms race in space had been avoided. But
in that same year the Russians realized the potential of
killer satellites and began five years of experiments designed
to develop, as Edward Hynoff in an article in Popular
Mechanics put it, "a special breed of hunter-killer satellite
whose sole purpose is to blast unwanted foreign satellites
into oblivion."
Most of the experiments conducted by the Soviets were
co-orbit intercept approaches which consisted of putting a
target satellite in orbit and a few days later launching an
interceptor. The interceptor achieves a highly elliptical
orbit with a quick bypass of the target, or matches the
orbit of the target. In more recent years test interceptors
have been placed in orbit below their targets and then
"popped up" to intercept them. Up to now the only method
of destruction utilized has been with conventional ex-
plosives. At present none of these techniques is thought
to -pose a large scale threat to American spacecraft
because (1) the hunter-killer satellites possess poor maneu-
verability, (2) intercept attempts have taken place only a
few hundred miles high and (3) the orbital parameters of
the experiments coincide with the parameters of Chinese
satellites much closer than they do with U.S. space
vehicles. This puts almost all U.S. communications and
early warning satellites out of reach, since no testing has
been conducted in the high orbits of each synchronous
satellites.
When the mainland Chinese started launching experi-
mental spy satellites of their own in February 1976 the
Soviets began a second series of experiments which, as of
March 1978 were still in progress. The individual tests of
this second series according to an article in the March 25,
1978 issue of The Nation, were as follows:
Date Comments
February 16, 1976 Came within 96 miles of tar-
get on fifth orbit.
April 13, 1976 Re-entered atmosphere and
burned up after first orbit.
July 21, 1976 Failed to achieve intercept
altitude.
December 27, 1976 Interceptor passed within a
mile of target.
May 23, 1977 Failed to achieve intercept
altitude.
June 16, 1977 Did not come close enough to
damage target with conven-
tional explosives.
October 26, 1977 Came within lethal range of
target.
December 21, 1977 Intercepted target.
There seems to be considerable debate acout the relative
success or failure of the 'recent Soviet tests. In the same
article in The Nation, author Robert C. Aldridge states,
"The success is not impressive, and even had they all been
22
Michigan Technic


successful, the number of tests comes nowhere close to
what is required to develop a system." However, there is
little doubt among Pentagon officials that during the next
decade the Soviet Union will be able to improve its combat
potential in space, perhaps producing laser equipped space-
craft with altitude capabilities up to 20,000 miles or more.
American Antisatellite Program
The Russians are not alone in the development of a
killer satellite program. The United States has been con-
ducting numerous tests in this area for the past two decades,
(see insert).
The U.S. has also been taking defensive precautions.
Special equipment has been added to new models of the
SAMOS (Satellite and Missile Observatory System) and
MIDAS (Missile Defense Alarm System) satellites, part of
the "Big Bird" surveillance/reconnaissance network. If they
come under attack by killer-hunter satellites the special
alarm system on board alerts Earth. They also have
sharper television systems working in tandem with high
powered lights to transmit a good image of what the
attackers look like to Earth observers. In addition to all this,
extra fuel and rocket power enable the satellite to avoid the
killer's path. The "Big Bird" network is also protected by a
small fleet of decoy satellites which give off an alarm when
they detect an intruder. They are also capable of rushing
up to a hunter-killer and suicidally eliminating it by
exploding.
In March 1977, as another backup precaution, the U.S.
launched the first two of a new series of "dark" satellites.
Equipped with special exteriors, they are invisible to con-
ventional radar. They will be stationed in deep space in a
"turned-off" mode waiting to be called into service to
replace destroyed satellites.
As another defensive measure, some engineers propose
covering U.S. satellites with cork to absorb heat generated
from lasers. Other specialists speculate that by covering
satellites with mirrors, it may be possible to deflect even
the most intense lasers.
The Pentagon is considering a couple of sneaky tactics
to implement in its own seek and destroy strategy. One such
tactic is the use of "mine layer" satellites to sprinkle
clusters of explosives in the orbital path of unwanted
satellites. Another tactic considers the use of the Space
Shuttle with its large cargo bay to kidnap enemy satellites.
American Soviet Conflict
To date there has been only one incident between the
United States and the Soviet Union with regard to anti-
satellite operations. It received widespread media coverage
and concerned the alleged attempt by the Soviets to blind
U.S. satellites with a ground based laser. On October 18,
1975 the infrared sensors on a U.S. early warning satellite

on two Air Force communications satellites were reported
to have been temporarily blinded. The Air Force satellites
also began to tumble. Two more Air Force satellites were
subjected to the same treatment on November 17 and 18.
It was reported that the energy source that caused the
problems had to be at least ten times the magnitude of an
ICBM launch. The cause of the incidents was attributed to a
Russian laser. A couple months later the Pentagon disputed
such claims by telling Congress that the disturbance was
caused by several large fires along Soviet natural gas pipe-
lines. The Pentagon also claimed that the fires were local in
nature and did not hinder the satellite's ability to provide
early warning.
Administration Policy
To cope with the possibility of the Soviets developing
a sophisticated antisatellite system, the Administration is
pursuing what officials call a "two-track" policy; a kind
of Catch-22 predicament. The policy calls for the develop-
ment of an American antisatellite while simultaneously
attempting to negotiate a complete ban on the weapon.
The Pentagon is reluctant to conceed to any agreement that
would obstruct the development of U.S. antisatellites until
the United States has its own. Many observers speculate
that until the U.S. has developed its own antisatellite, in
about five years or so, the Soviet Union will have very little
incentive to damper their program.
According to some officials, the alternative is to impress
upon Moscow the advantages of coming to an early agree-
ment. One specialist commented, "They may be ahead of
us now, but they have got to recognize that if we put our
minds to it, we could clean up the sky in fourteen hours."

I pray before lunch and I curse after it. Tell me,
Christian, what does that mean? It's better not to answer —
I am weary of your hypocrisy, aye, and your weakness
and your folly. I sighed: a true bill of indictment. Class
began in five minutes, but the height of my ambition —
not that I should overwork myself — was to sit on Alexis'
landing with my elbow on my knee and my head on my
hand.
Of course I'm the only one who knows the name of
Alexis' landing. But then, I could argue that I have some
right to give it a name simply because I'm almost the only
one who uses it: there are two other staircases which are
closer to doors, and so I sit on this one to think in
private. That was the origin of the name, from the words of
the Tsarevich Alexis Nikolaievich: "I like to think and
wonder." Did anyone before me ever associate the landings
of staircases with names? To me, every place where one
stopped out of weariness or confusion or simply the need
to rearrange books had a name. The one on the steps up to
the eight a.m. calculus class, where a semester ago I had
staggered half-awake, was Akhmatova's landing: her verses
had sung so insistently in my mind that, in a burst of
disgust because I could not recall a line, I memorized all of
the prologue and first section of Requiem. The landing on
the steps going down from my physics class was Caius'
landing: the obvious meaning was that I had been reading
Roman history and Caius Gracchus was my hero, but it
also meant that, fighting down forebodings as I came from
a confusing physics lecture, I usually had to go all the
way down the hall and reach the stairs before I could
shove my fears to one side and think of Caius.
Physics ... You could argue that that was the beginning.
Has anyone ever written the history of their own life as
indefatigably as I wrote mine? To come out with a state-
ment like that when you're only a college sophomore!
But it was a beginning, however pretentious that sounds.
I took it a year early, in my freshman year, and my first
tests were horrors - or at least what looked like horrors to
an all-A high school student. The one way to make up for
them was not merely to do well, but to do better than all
of them. I worked on physics as I had worked on nothing
before and, at first to my amazement and later to my calm
expectation (what arrogance!), it worked. I left the
professor's office for the last time with my final under my
arm, first in the class and quoting Hotspur, "By heaven,
methinks it were an easy leap/To pluck bright honor
from the pale-faced moon ..."
It was then that Gwen Evreux, my counselor, assured
me that I should go into engineering: two more semesters,
heavy but certainly manageable, at the community college,
and then I could transfer to where I wanted, say the
University of Michigan; there should be no trouble ... Who
was to to doubt this, and why would I want to? I had half-
thought of engineering myself for months, long enough to
make it not just a living, but a philosophy: the engineer
In fact, they cared about
everything ~ beerbashes, cars,
football, hunting-- everything
except work.
was the child of the West, the believer in human control
(however partial) of human destiny and thus a defender
of human dignity and rights, an heir of the engineers
of the 1920's lauded by Solzhenitsyn for their "open,
shining intellects, their free and gentle humor, their agility
and breadth of thought, the ease with which they shifted .. .
from technology to social concerns and art."
Meanwhile, back in reality .. .
It wasn't that my fellow-students — and, for all the talk
of women entering the profession, "fellow" is still quite
correct! — only cared about engineering. In fact, they
cared about everything - beer-bashes, cars, football,
hunting - everything except work. I confess to a number
.of faults (and my humor is by no means always gentle),
but I could not feel the slightest sympathy with them.
I was having the hardest year I'd ever had — physics was a
picnic by comparison — and I was demoralized enough
without outside help. I hated them, and hated myself for
hating them, and hated the unending demands; but hatred
itself is not a very consuming passion when you don't
have time even to do that properly - one benefit of an
overloaded schedule! Then all that can be done is to get up
and go to dynamics, even if all that clung uselessly to my
mind was not angular accelerations or momenta, but the
verses of Tsvetayeva:
"Thinking him human they
decided to kill him, and
now he's dead. For ever.
-Weep. For the dead angel . .."
Unseeing I went up the six steps, unconsciously counting,
getting upto go because it is neither dutiful nor wise not to...
"At the day's setting, he
sang the evening beauty
Three waxen lights now
shudder superstitiously . .."
I sat down to wait outside the locked classroom with a
sigh of relief: why was I so weary, why was sitting so
desirable?
"Maybe I'll go home. I feel sick. What a party!"
"You got drunk?"
"Everybody got drunk. We musta gone through a case
of beer by midnight."
"... and lines of light, hot
strings across the snow come from him.
Three waxen candles.
To the sun. The light bearer ..."
"They took away his driver's license, he's got ten

thing about that."
"I'd think they wouldn't let you drive a tractor on a
road — blocking traffic or something."
"No, you can go pretty fast in one of those things, if..."
"... To the sun. The light bearer..."
A secretary came up to stick a piece of paper to the
door.
Once I had dreamed of going to college, and once I
would have been enraged that the class was cancelled so
near to finals. Now I cheered with the rest.
It is one of the peculiarities of the student's life - or at
least it was one of mine - that the sense of time takes on a
strange distortion. I could brush aside decades or centuries
with ease: I had raged at the unlawful injunction which had
destroyed the Pullman strike, laughed and rejoiced at de
Montfort's unexpected victory in the Battle of Lewes,
awakened at midnight to mourn in my bed the fate of the
children of Nicholas II. But in terms of present months,
days, or even hours, I could hardly predict what would
happen next, or how I would feel. Now, going down from
dynamics, I felt relieved but still weary, perhaps ill. Yet I
knew that fifty minutes later I would be laughing. Every-
thing would be all right, and I would go to materials lab in
a good mood (and perhaps laughing mysteriously at my
partners when they asked why), and write a page in my
diary not devoted to the standard subjects of my reading,
my reflections, my political opinions and my long literary
comments interspersed with devoted praise of Aleksandr
Solzhenitsyn.
And although I thought of myself as a most exceptional
nineteen-year-old, it is not very difficult to guess what a
nineteen-year-old is thinking of when a thought like that
one occurs. I was in love. Or maybe (as I tried, fruitlessly, to
tell myself) I was simply in infatuation. I always despised
the fashion of this era of Freud, disgusting materialist,
with its habit of exposing and pouring over every emotion.
My criteria were simple; I was glad when he was happy.
and I was glad to be with him.
We attended the same church. I had become acquainted
with him when I was fifteen. I had admired him but he hadn't
noticed me. We first truly became friends when I was
eighteen. I was in his political science class.
He was not one of the students. He was the teacher.
Professor Tregian.
I had first distinguished myself easily — he had mentioned
his Cornish ancestry in a recitation, and for someone who
had spent the previous summer reading English history,
pinpointing the location of Cornwall was hardly worth
noting. Soon it was almost as if we were equals, not only
in recitation, which in Tregian's case could cover anything —
perhaps even the subject — but also in lecture. He would be
talking about Roman political theorists and suddenly —
from the second row, yet! — he and I would be exchanging
a joke at Cicero's expense. Seeing me idle after having
finished a test before the allotted time was passed, a note at
the end of the returned test gave me permission to read
should such a thing occur again — "I hate to see you
bored and wasting time." And although every other
student was almost invariably addressed by last name, I
soon became "Miss Cathy".
It was not just the distinctions that were significant,
delightful as they were, for I have been honored by
teachers whom I privately held in contempt nevertheless. It
was Professor Tregian himself who made me want to gain
his favor: his so-obvious sense of Englishness (he always
dressed as an Edwardian gentleman, with suits with vests
and a pocketwatch), his self-professed eccentricity, his
irreverent wit, his love of history which I also love, his
tolerance — they brought a sense of perspective to the
closed, fierce world of study.
I began to visit him at his office on any pretext; I began
to visit him at his office on no pretext. Once when I visited
him I was hoarse from a cold; I talked fluently and'
enthusiastically for an hour, went late to my linear algebra
class, and could hardly speak for the next two hours.
Everything in the world was amusing, everything the
subject of conversation; King George V's favorite opera
("The shortest"); the way the St. Petersburg-Moscow
track had been laid (the Tsar had drawn a straight line
between the two capitals with a ruler); old W.C. Fields
movies (" . . . the time that I was lost in the wilds of
Afghanistan for three days, and had to subsist on nothing
but food and water . . ."); whether Bach should be played
on the great Victorian organs he loved or the pure
Baroque ones I favored, but which he called "those
screechy whistles,"claiming all Englishmen thought likewise.
I would have been happy could this have continued
indefinitely, giving me an hour or two of amusement every
week and permitting me to leave secretly convinced of our
mutual superiority to the rest of the world which we so
wittily insulted. But, as you would doubtless guess, this
did not continue. Whether because I was lonely, or because
I was young, or even because I lived in a culture in which
people were regularly expected to fall in love (after all.

would fall in love if they had not heard of falling in love"),
my feelings began to change. I realized that when I was
going to see him, I looked more and more anxiously into
the mirror: and, though it was contrary to my sense of
self-respect to wear make-up or to dress differently for a
man's sake, still those things that could not be considered a
breach of discipline were always thought of; I worried
whether my hair was clean, or my eyebrows plucked. With
each successive Monday - for that was the day I regularly
went to see him - I became more and more fearful lest he
be gone, or have some other business, or simply weary of
entertaining a teenager who, after all, could hardly claim
to be half so good a companion to him as he was to her.
One day when we were talking as usual, I quite suddenly
felt impatient with everything, and had a great desire to —
to what? There is no way to describe it without being
theatrical, but it has to be said: I wished simply to order
him to be silent, to seize his hands, to embrace him and to
have him embrace me.
I looked into his face. He was describing the beauties of
English cathedrals and telling me that, should I ever go to
England, I must see Salisbury - it was built all within one
generation and so had a purity and unity of style, quite
different from most of them ... There was no hope. He was
speaking to a respectful student, perhaps even to a friend,
but not to a woman. To speak at that moment would have
meant to throw away what chance I did have of seeing him,
of speaking with him. I would be merely another foolish
adolescent, unworthy of his trust: who cares for the
company of a moonstruck girl? And, though to be frank
I must admit that this which should have been the first
argument came second, there was the matter of morality.
Even if, wildest hope, there could have been anything
between us, he was a married man; I knew his wife and
children personally. "Thou shalt not" has been thundered
from the pulpit too often to be taken seriously, but
hurting others for one's own pleasure is a different
question; and while emotions can't be produced by a
moral code, they must be encouraged or suppressed by it.
And so I spoke nothing, and things seemed to be the
same on the outside: we laughed about an engineer-friend
of his who swore that a '49 Packard was the best car ever
built and drove a purple one to show his devotion, and he
explained to me why Gladstone was unusual as a Liberal
who was a High Church supporter ("only in England
could you have such a combination") and I reviewed for
him the evidence as to whether or not the Grand Duchess
Anastasia, Tsar Nicholas' daughter, had survived the Ekaterin-
burg massacre. And though I moved my chair so close to
his that our knees nearly touched as I faced him, and
sometimes spoke with an intensity even fiercer than that
which I usually show in discussions, I never said a word.
But when the conversations were over and I went,
invariably late, to my materials lab I would review each
word in my mind, seeking to remember everything.
Finally I had developed a grand design: that on the very
last meeting, I would speak to him, not indeed as a lover,
but yet more freely than I previously had. I would be
grateful for his time, for our conversations; he would know
some of the intensity of my feelings, but yet the dis-
honorable part could remain unknown. Perhaps he would
dismiss me with some comradely word, something which
could be remembered yet which would be safe. There is a
tremendous romantic appeal in the figure of the Lady of
Shalott...
And today was the last time I would see him.
It was nearly time to go up; if I went slowly, it would be
all right. (It was one of my rules to try not to arrive early,
which would show too great an excitement and in general
give more importance to our meetings than they deserved.)
I walked slowly, deliberately, past the English classes, up
the ten steps, around the landing (this one unnamed),
up the eleven steps, down the hall, into the corridor
where the teachers' offices were. It was two minutes
before the hour. A little early, but within the range of
understandable deviation.
I passed the receptionist and went straight to Tregian's
office. He stood just outside the door, discussing something
I could not follow quite energetically with another pro-
fessor — or so I assumed — whom I did not know. When I
arrived, he nodded to me and went on talking. After a
moment I realized the conversation had something to do
with the attempts of the professors to unionize. It was a
thoroughly obscure business as far as I was concerned —
Tregian had never explained it to me, and I didn't consider
it my place to ask — but I was convinced that he was one
of the leaders. A cause always brought out the Celt in him:
you could almost sense him weighing his words against those
of Keir Hardie or Lloyd George.
I blew my nose and laughed a bit, "Perhaps we shouldn't

Why didn't he smile at that? "I'm afraid I can't meet
with you today," he answered. "I'd like to, but there's some
union business that needs to be taken care of."
He was serious. "That's quite all right," I nodded. "I
should study for the finals anyway."
I turned around and walked away from him, still
smiling, and paused in the hallway. I jeered: what a
weakling, what a fool you are! You can have no claim
upon him, yet let him spend 'your' time with anyone
else and you assume this ridiculous tragic air. You deserve
this, yes, and a worse punishment too, and if you don't stop
it and get to work, you'll have a real cause for regrets —
you've wasted an hour already.
What can I say? There are easier tasks than refuting true
charges.
But I would not work.
Instead I went down the hall to an empty room — I seem
to have a genius for finding lonely places — sat down at the
teacher's table and laid my head upon my arms.
It was just as well I had a cold: no one in my lab would
know why my eyes would be red.
That should have put an end to my hopes. But I could
not give up the idea of a last meeting. Since there were
only two days of classes left, and since I had no hours off
coinciding with his office hours, I decided that the only
possible chance would be to drop in right after one of his
classes, while he was still in the classroom.
I arrived on the next to the last day, a bit after ten a.m.,
just as his nine-o'clock class was leaving the lecture — I
never would have dreamed of catching him had I not
remembered that he regularly let his classes out late.
I pushed my way through the crowd to the end of the
inevitable line of petitioners: people who wanted to know
about past tests, or future tests (at least no one could be
asking about that now!), or perhaps a rare one who actually
wanted to discuss something. If there was such a person
now, I would never have a chance. But neither could I
speak in anyone else's presence. I set my books down on a
nearby table and waited.
Finally they were gone and Tregian turned to me with
the amused smile that characterized him in my mind: "Well,
Miss Cathy?"
After the weeks of silence, it was almost repulsive to
think of speaking frankly, or rather half-frankly. But the
other choice was never to speak, and I could not bear that:
suppose some wondrous thing might have happened, if
only . . . the time is short, ten minutes, five, speak!
"I've come to say good-bye," I said.
"I'm sorry to see you go."
I seized on this, emboldened by his previous mentions of
hearing from former students: "Can I write to you from
Ann Arbor?"
"I'd be glad to hear from you."
"Shall I write to you at your home or your office?"
"Either one will do."
As many silly confessions as I have made, I don't know
why I should blush to make one more: I half-hoped he would
prefer his office, which would enable me to console myself
with the utterly unworthy thought that his wife was
jealous of me.
The time is short, ten minutes, five, speak . . . "There
were times when I was lonely" — no one likes being
maudlin, don't appeal to his pity for God's sake — "times
when it was good to have someone to talk to. I was glad
that we were able to have our discussions, and that you
spent so much time with me."
I could see he was pleased. "I enjoyed talking with you."
As from a great distance, and with complete detachment,
I watched the scene: an adolescent attempt to make the
impossible occur. A scene such as this could not be carried
off in a tentative half-pleading way: it would require some-
thing in the grand tradition, an Anna Karenina, and I
could not do that. From the first he had been unfailingly
courteous to me, and, listening to my stumbling half-
confession, he was a gentleman to the last. I had no intention
of repaying him by putting him in the unpleasant position
of trying to deal with an infatuated teenager. That one
service I could do ...
I picked up my books. It was amazing to me how unforced
my voice sounded. "Have you started reading Gulag
Archipelago yet?" I asked. "I've just been reading some
fascinating chapters in the first volume on the development
of Soviet law."
"No, I've been meaning to start it, but I haven't yet.
But I thought you'd read it before."
"Parts, but not in strict order." We went together out
of the room, down the hall, conversing as we did so. No
one would know that it was anything more than a student
following up, perhaps, on a point raised in a lecture.
It was nearly ten minutes after ten: I would be late for
class if I followed him all the way to his office. We came to
the staircase up to the offices, and very simply he said,
"Good-bye."
He was gone.
I paused, trying to find some philosophic consolation,
some meaning to justify the matter. But unless one was
content to quote the dictum of Nadya's roommate in
First Circle — "No, girls, life is no love story" — there
was no sense to be made of it.
But there must be no grief, all will work out . . . Next
semester I would be in Ann Arbor. There would be in-
teresting things there, and perhaps I would meet others.
That depends on God's will, and all things work for the
good of those who love God. Be strong, I must be strong . . .
Perhaps it was not over. I did have permission to write
to him. I would write to him regularly, and he would write
back, surely he would. Perhaps in some lonely, anxious
night I would take out his letters and reread them, secretly
smiling despite the grief, for there would be strength in the
thought that though he never could love me, yet he did
believe in me and was my friend. I would compose a
dozen letters over the summer...
I shook my head. I would send none of them.

WARGAMES:
Tabletop Explorations
By Paul S. Cook and Jeff Diewald
What is "wargaming"?
When most people think of a
game, they think of Monopoly,
or perhaps chess. However, the
modern wargame is much more than
a diversion for a rainy day. It
is a vehicle to explore a situation.
The situation can be the harsh
reality of the 1973 Arab-Israeli
War to the sheer fantasy of a
hobbit-thief stealing treasure from
a dragon's lair.
The term "wargame"
is not really appropriate. "Conflict
simulation" or "simulation game" more
accurately describe the true nature
of the games. A simulation usually models the situation more or less
mathematically, reducing it to a game that allows the player to explore
the eventor situation simulated. To be more specific about the games it
32
Michigan Technic


are board games, miniature rules, and role-playing games.
Board-type simulations are the most popular and the
most familiar to the non-wargamer. The basic format is a
gridded playing surface, usually a map of some sort, on
which counters are moved and/or interact. Most often the
counters represent military units and the interactions are
combat. Given rules and scenarios determine the order of
action, what actions are allowed, and prescribe the results of
these various actions. Often these voluminous rulebooks
disarm and dismay the prospective wargamer; some having
upwards of 50 pages. However most are between 8 and 20
pages, while others are even smaller.
Board games have been created for almost every period
or war in history, including many that have yet to occur.
They range from "Chariot", which is "tactical combat in
the 'Biblical' Era, by Simulations Publications Inc. (SPI), to
"Outreach", which is "galactic expansion in the 30th
Century." They cover all terrains, from the North African
desert of Avalon Hill's "Afrikakorps" to the snowy
Finnish tundra of "Winter War" (SPI). The sea is not
exempt, with "Wooden Ships and Iron Men" (AH) taking
place on the bounding main, or the dreaded U-boats of
"Wolfpack" (SPI) running silently in the deeps. You can
play the role of great generals of history, such as Napolean
at "Austerlitz" (SPI), to Robert E. Lee at "Gettysburg"
(AH). There are air games of many eras such as: "Richtofen's
War" (AH), "Luftwaffe" (AH), and "Foxbat and Phantom"
(SPI).
For those less bloodthirsty and inclined to diplomacy
there are several games where the players must cooperate
with each other to win. Perhaps the most popular of these
is "Diplomacy", sold by Avalon Hill. It depicts the intrigue
between the major countries of Europe in the 19th Century.
Similar games are "Origins of WW II" (AH), "Russian Civil
War" (SPI), and "A Mighty Fortress" (about the Reforma-
tion) (SPI). In these games one learns to appreciate the
finer things in life like alliances, lying, treachery, and
backstabbing.
A new concept that Jim Dunnigan, President of SPI,
thinks is the next direction simulation game development
will take is the "minigame". This idea was pioneered by a
company called Metagaming. Minigames have all the elements
of a larger wargame, but are scaled down in many respects.
This reduces both learning and playing time, making it
possible to complete a game during a lunch hour. Typical
of this kind of game are Metagaming's "OGRE" and
"Wizard."
One type of gaming that is truly impressive to observe is
miniatures gaming. Miniatures are small metal-cast figurines
of men or vehicles, usually hand-painted in exquisite
detail. Rule sets describe techniques for movement and
combat on a tabletop battlefield. Battles range from a
handful (literally) of vehicles to the entire battle of Waterloo
with everyone from Napoleon to the very last horse. Bob
Parkinson, a true enthusiast, has collected an entire German
Panzer division of 1944. His greatest dream is to match his
division against an equivalent American force, which he
says can be done in one weekend on a gym floor.
Another way in which miniatures are used is in the
burgeoning field of role-playing games. By far the most
popular of these games is "Dungeons and Dragons",
published by TSR Games. Miniatures of elves, dwarves,
hobbits, and wizards travel through a fantastic world of
ruined castles and wandering monsters. Of course, the
figurines are not necessary, and many are content to play
with only graph paper and pencils.
The basic premise is that each player controls one or
more characters, each with certain abilities. They travel
through a world created totally by a referee, who uses the

Wargames are nearly as old as organized warfare itself.
Evidence has been uncovered that indicates the use of
games to simulate war in ancient Egypt. Some of these
games underwent an abstraction process that resulted
in the transformation into board games such as chess and
go.
In 1780, Helwig, Master of the Pages for the Duke of
Brunswick, invented a game strikingly similar to the
modern commercial wargame. It was played on a board of
1666 squares, color coded by terrain type. Players used
pieces representing units of various types with different
movement rates expressed in terms of squares-per-turn. In
1795, Georg Vinturinus, a military writer in Schleswig,
developed a more complex version of the same type of
game that used a map based on an actual piece of terrain
(between France and Belgium).
In 1824 Prussian Army Lieutenant von Reisswitz pub-
lished an elaborate wargame system designed to be used in
actual military training and planning. The game, a develop-
ment of an earlier design by the lieutenant's father, made
use of military maps, an umpire, probability tables, and
detailed rules. Although it received a mixed reception in the
Army (in fact jealous officers harassed von Reisswitz to the
point of suicide) the game inspired the formation of a
wargaming club and the publication of the first wargaming
magazine, the Kriegspie/er Verein. Eventually, the wargaming
concept became a generally accepted tool in the German
Army, and when later in the 19th Century the Germans
won their stunning victory over the French in the Franco-
Prussian War, many other nations (rightly or wrongly)
attributed much of the success to the German's use of
Kriegspiel in preparatory training and operational planning.
American Army officers, W.R. Livermore and C.A.L. Totten,
each designed their own versions of the German Kriegspiel,
which met with the same sort of resistance from the military
establishment. Totten's game had the unique feature of
appealing to civilian gamers as well as military professionals.
Wargames were used by many of the major powers shortly
before and during World War I. For the most part, the
games suffered from the preconceptions of their users as to
what was possible and not possible. So, for example, the
use of such biased strategic gaming to test the Schlieffen
Plan failed to indicate the likelihood of a stalemated Western
Front very early in the war. During World War II, the
Germans made very good use of operational level games to
precisely plan major attacks. In particular, the swift march
through the Ardennes, outflanking the Maginot Line, was
thoroughly wargamed in advance. The invasion of the
Soviet Union was intensely wargamed, and this contributed
greatly to the speed and magnitude of the opening German
victories. One of the best known anecdotes about World
War II wargaming concerns the Japanese simulation of the
Battle of Midway. In this very elaborate game, the Japanese
Naval officers playing the role of the Americans launched an
attack on the Japanese carrier force and inflicted devastating
losses on it. When a number of the Japanese carriers were
sunk, the umpires were told to cancel the result (in effect,
the Japanese cheated at their own game) and "re-float"
the ships. The game then went on to indicate the victory
at Midway that the Japanese felt was inevitable. In the real
event, the Japanese carrier force was struck almost precisely
as indicated by the game and with even more disastrous
results. This is but one of the more remarkable instances of
an all-too-typical behavior pattern evident in the military
use of wargames as stochastic devices: when the result isn't
what the planners expect, the temptation to cheat can be
overwhelming.
In the post-WWII era, the military use of wargames
became increasingly sophisticated and widespread. Much
of the advance in sophistication was connected with the
advent of computer technology. The computer allowed
large amounts of data to be stored and manipulated,
freeing the human players from the tedium associated
with highly detailed manual simulations. The ultimate in
computerized gaming came about with the development
of mathematical models of conflict situations that are
entirely played by computer without human intervention.
There is some debate concerning the usefulness of such
computer simulations. The amount of data generated is so
great that it can overwhelm the user, thereby undermining
the very reason for the simulation. As part of an attempt
to deal with this problem, the military (in the US) has been
examining the various wargaming techniques used in
commercial games. In 1976, the US Army contracted SPI
to produce a tactical level game as a training device — the
identical game is also sold to the civilian market as FireFight.

For as long as model soldiers have existed, wargames
have been played. However, it was only shortly before World
War I that such informal gaming began to take on structure
and substance with the publication of H.G. Wells' Little
Wars, the first widely used rulebook for the use of minia-
tures in wargaming. Since then, many such rules systems
have been published, but all have been in essence deriva-
tives of Wells' original work.
In 1953, Charles S. Roberts produced and distributed the
archetype for a new type of commercial wargame utilizing
a grid map and cardboard counters. It was called Tactics;
Its modest success encouraged Roberts (in 1958) to form the
Avalon Hill Company to produce adult games (including
wargames). The first titles were Tactics II and Gettysburg
(the first commercial wargame on a truly historical subject).
The company grew rapidly until 1963 when it ran into an
economic brick wall and almost ceased to exist. Basically it
had overextended itself plus it was caught in the grip of a
dislocating shift of buying from retail to discount stores. The
company was taken over by its major creditor, Monarch
Services. For a time it was internally dormant (so far as
producing anything new) while it was reorganized. Essen-
tially, it divested itself of its design staff and began a conserva-
tive program of producing one or two wargame titles a year,
all of which were designed by freelancers.
In 1966 while the hobby was slowly growing,Christopher
Wagner, then a USAF Staff Sergeant in Japan, began
publishing Strategy &amp; Tactics Magazine as an alternative
to Avalon Hill's house organ, The General. Many of the
people who are now "names" in the hobby first became
associated with each other via S &amp; T. Wagner endeavored
to produce a quality magazine to give shape and substance
to the hobby. After struggling valiantly for two years,
Wagner felt that he had to give up in his virtually single-
handed effort to give the hobby a voice. Casting about
for someone to assume the liability of the remaining
subscriptions, Chris contacted Jim Dunnigan (who had
written for S&amp; T). Reluctantly, Dunnigan agreed — primarily
to have a vehicle through which to test a series of experi-
mental games he and some friends were developing. As
S &amp; T shifted its base to New York, Redmond Simonsen
agreed (also reluctantly) to involve himself once again in
S &amp; T. [in the previous year Simonsen had been working
with Wagner to professionalize the magazine]. After
struggling through its first New York produced issues,
S &amp; T underwent a transformation into the format it more
or less maintains to this day: a military history magazine
with a simulation game in it. At first, both Dunnigan and
Simonsen thought of S &amp; T as a temporary venture. But
the admittedly "rough" games that Dunnigan had designed
brought a freshness to the hobby that it sorely needed. Plus
in one stroke, they doubled the number of game titles
available to hobbyists. As Simonsen began to professionalize
the "look" of S &amp; T and SPI games, and as the two men
took a team approach to game design, the pace of the hobby
began to quicken.
In late 1970, Simonsen and Dunnigan incorporated
as Simulation Publications. Via a program of advertising,
S &amp; T's circulation began to build and sales of SPI games to
its readers began to take on serious proportions. By 1972,
SPI was growing exponentially and became a substantial
competitor to Avalon Hill, which until SPI's advent had
been the only ship in a very calm sea.
The innovations that SPI brought to the hobby are in large
part responsible for its present vitality. The production of a
serious history magazine containing a full-fledged game;
the constant surveying of gamers to discover the titles
they wished to see produced; the quantum jump in the
rate of game production; the multiplicity of new game
systems; the multi-talented in-house design staff — all these
elements and others have made SPI a major force in the
rapidly growing field of civilian wargaming.
SPI's success has encouraged the formation and entry of
other companies into the field, and the resultant compe-
tition and diversity has benefitted the hobby greatly.
SPI, Avalon Hill, and other the publishers are basically
friendly rivals with a common interest. All the major and
most of the minor companies now participate in an annual
convention and show attended by thousands of gamers.
The number of wargamers in the country has been
variously estimated at from 100 to 250 thousand although
the potential exists for a much greater audience. The typical
American wargamer is a college-educated male in his middle
twenties. No more than one percent of gamers are women,
but this is changing as women in general diversify their
interests and activities. Hobbyists offer a wide spectrum of
reasons for playing such complex, time-consuming games,
but most say that wargamers afford them a unique approach
to historical information as well as a highly challenging,
involving source of entertainment and competition.
From its origins as a court curiosity to the highly
developed sophisticated manual simulations of the seventies,
wargaming has undergone a remarkable evolution. There
are now hundreds of wargames in print and the list is
growing by several dozen each year. The level of innovation
and production is several orders of magnitude greater than
it was only a decade ago. Just ahead lies the era of electronic
wargaming as the personal computer explosion impacts in
the US. It's a safe prediction that the next ten years will be
at least as fascinating as the last ten.

tion. The character's develop an identity of their own,
closely linked to that of the player. The death of a favorite
character can often be a traumatic experience.
"Dungeons and Dragons" takes its ideas from the fantas-
tic literature of sword and sorcery, especially Tolkien's
Lord of the Rings and Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and the Gray
Mouser series. The dungeon is composed of many levels,
with each successive level harboring meaner and nastier
monsters. Creatures encountered in a typical dungeon
include purple worms that can swallow a person whole,
a multitude of giants, medusae with petrifying gazes, evil
demons or vampires, and ochre jellies that ooze about like
giant amoebas. Fighters battle with a variety of weapons,
while wizards fling bolts of lightning and balls of fire.
Those more devious become thieves, who have no qualms
about lurking in the shadows and picking their companions'
pockets.
Another role playing game is "Traveller" (Game Designers
Workshop) set in an era of rocket ships and interstellar
exploration. Traveller characters gather wealth, usually by
extralegal means. Other role playing games include "Chivalry
and Sorcery" (Fantasy Games Unlimited), and "En Garde"
(GDW). Perhaps the most extreme example is "Bunnies and
Burrows", based on the book Watership Down.
The playing of simulation games is a rapidly growing
hobby with a quarter of a million adherents at the present
time. Local wargaming groups have formed in many loca-
tions, including Ann Arbor. The Michigan Gamers Council
has an office in Room 4102 of the Michigan Union, and
telephone numbers 668-4821 and 434-3856. They sponsor
numerous regular gaming events, and there are also many
informal groups of students who get together to play.
This past summer the national gaming convention,
Origins 78, was held in Ann Arbor. Over a period of four
days, about 4000 gaming enthusiasts battled heroically
through an incredible number of games of every type and
description. Events included tournaments, seminars, work-
shops, several game auctions and an awards ceremony. The
North Campus Recreation Building was taken over by a
variety of merchants and exhibitors selling games and
supplies to fulfill the wildest dreams of any player or
gamesman.
Gaming is many different things to a growing number
of people, but primarily it is fun. Players enjoy the
competition, the strategy, and the chance to explore
history, real or fictional. For some, it is a harmless way to
release those aggressive tendencies. The games are potential
adventures just waiting for an explorer.

75, 50 and 25 Years Ago
By Karen Zahn
75 Years Ago
To give you an idea of how long the Technic has been
around, it was decided this month to include excerpts
from the magazine 75 years ago, in 1903, in addition to the
regular 50 and 25 years ago. At that time the Technic
consisted of a series of articles published once a year by
The University of Michigan Engineering Society. The
Engineering Society was apparently made up of engineering
students with faculty as honorary members. Among its
honorary members at the time were Mortimer E. Cooley,
Victor C. Vaughan, Alexander Ziwet, and Alfred Noble.
Articles appearing in the 1903 issue included:
• "Factory and Warehouse Architecture" by A.K.
Adler. At the time architecture was included along with the
College of Engineering so articles on architecture frequently
appeared. Mr. Adler discusses the general planning, con-
struction, and power equipment in relation to factory
planning.
• "Anchor Ice" by C.W. Hubbell. This article deals
with the problems the water department in Detroit was
having with ice clogging their pumping equipment when it
pumped drinking water out of the Detroit River during the
winter months. Anchor ice is defined in the article as "ice
which forms upon submerged bodies, due to the radiation
of heat which takes place through water and air into space."
• "Why Engineers Should Advertise" by George H.
Gibson. Unlike the current controversy of whether the legal
and medical professions should advertise their services, the
point of Mr. Gibson's article was for advertising to increase
public awareness of the engineering profession. He believed
that if engineers made their occupation more visible it
would combat problems facing engineers, such as poor
salaries and low public esteem.
• "Telephone Engineering" by S.P. Grace. This article
calls attention to the (then) relatively new field of telephone
engineering. The telephone industry was rapidly expanding
in 1903, with 25,000 phones in Pittsburgh and 100,000
phones in Manhattan with much new skilled personnel
needed to keep up with the projected growth.
• "Screws - A Few Notes on Practice and Experience"
by Edwin H. Ehrman. This article was intended to be "an
aid to machine design or shop management" and presented
the latest features in nuts and bolts.
• "The Status of the Steam Turbine" The latest in
steam turbine uses and design was presented in this 14-page
article.
In addition to articles, the Technic presented some of
the current statistics on the College of Engineering.
Featured was a picture of the new Engineering Building
under construction in the spring of 1903. Its scheduled
completion was Fall 1904, with four stories and 92,600
cubic feet of floor space. The total cost, including labora-
tory equipment, was projected at $250,000. This new
Engineering Building is the current West Engineering
Building. It was built to accomodate the increasing rrumbers
of freshman students being admitted — 268 in 1903
compared to 134 in 1899. There was a total of 609
students studying engineering.
An advertisement for the College listed five courses of
study available — Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering,
Electrical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, and Marine
Engineering and Naval Architecture. The 60 instructors
were billed as "men of professional experience." The work
required: "Experimental Instruction and Practice Work in
general."

How important are grades to success after graduation?
Are all those hours you're putting in really going to get you
somewhere after you graduate? Doubtless, every student has
thought something similar to this at 2 a.m. while working on
an assignment due the next day. In the October 1928 issue
of the Technic Walter Gifford, President of American
Telephone and Telegraph, discusses the significance of
grades in his article, "Does Business Want Scholars?"
Interestingly enough, it appears that 50 years ago good
grades were not sought after by companies hiring business-
men (encompassing engineering, art, and business grad-
uates.) Lawyers and doctors were selected on tfie merits
of good grades, but not businessmen. This was because most
businesses did not make any connection between college and
the gain of knowledge useful to the profession. "Business
believes that a law school teaches a boy law but that a
college does not teach a boy business."
It was stated of business students that: "He is somewhat
apt to think of his college course as an era in itself, with-
out influence on his life after graduation." Business consid-
ered participation in extra-curricular activities as prepara-
tion for the business world. Small wonder that "some
(students) do the academic work merely in order that
they may stay in college to do other things."
Educators at this time (understandably) disagreed
strongly. They argued that to obtain good grades a student
must use his brain and that success in business hinges on
this same practice. They stated the progression to success
runs: good grades in high school lead to good grades in
college which lead to good grades in professional school.
To substantiate these claims a study was done by AT&amp;T
to prove that high grades in college did lead to a more suc-
cessful business career. They chose the salary earned by the
individual as their basis for success. The survey showed
that graduates with high grades (upper third of class)
earned substantially more than those who graduated in the
lower third of the class. This salary difference began shortly
after graduation and grew larger over a period of 30 years.
The survey covered engineering, art, and business graduates.
The results were the same for the individual groups as for
the total. The conclusion: "The longer the best students are
in business, the more rapidly their earnings rise. The longer
the poorer students are in business, the slower their earn-
ings rise." Maybe those problems are worth doing after all,
but there is no guarantee.
In the final paragraph, the article also points out that
there just may be more to success than dollar bills. With re-
duced working hours, good use of leisure time could help
determine success. "Minds trained to scholarship" would
find more satisfaction in leisure time.
25 Years Ago
25 years ago marked the 100th anniversary of engineer-
ing here at the University of Michigan. It appeared in the
form of "a new scientific course including Civil Engineering
in the third and fourth years" in the Fall of 1853. The first
engineering professor was Alexander Winchell, who grad-
uated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Wesleyan
University in 1847 and came to Michigan in 1853. The first
courses which he taught were surveying and "Parker's Aids."
At that time professors designated their courses by the au-
thor of the text they used and an abbreviation of its title.
"Parker's Aids" comes from the text by Parker entitled
"Aids to English Composition." A course in Mechanics
(Physics) was added a term later.
Professor Winchell encountered many hardships in his
new task of teaching civil engineering. The field was new,
there was no text available, he taught surveying for over a
year before there was any equipment, and his students were
less than enthusiastic. As he wrote, "Civil Engineering, hav-
ing been a voluntary study thus far and the seniors being
latterly very much occupied with their commencement
addresses, their examinations in Civil Engineering did not
give me much satisfaction."
In the summer of 1855 Winchell did surveying for the
railroad running from Ann Arbor to Jonesville. After this
experience he wrote: "This I expect will conclude my
practice in the business of Civil Engineering. I have earned
in this job at $5.00 a day, $70.00. The business is hard and
responsible but not unpleasant." Shortly thereafter, Winchell
retired from engineering and transferred to a Professorship
of Geology and Natural History.
The first curriculum for a degree in Civil Engineering be-
gan in the Fall 1855 and offered as engineering courses:
Plane Geodetics, Railroad and Mining Surveying, Leveling,
Nature and Strength of Materials, Theory of Construction,
Architecture, Machines, and Motors. The catalog stated,
"The entire course can be accomplished by the industrious
student in four years, but a longer time may be occupied
upon with advantage and profit." William Guy Peck, a grad-
uate of West Point, taught engineering for two years after
Winchell left, going to Columbia, New York in 1857.
The man who succeeded Peck came about his job in an
unusual way. His name was deVolson Wood and he grad-
uated as a Civil Engineer from Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute in 1857. After graduating he set out for Chicago
because he heard there was a teaching job available there.
By the time he reached Detroit he was out of money, and
leaving his baggage, he walked to Ann Arbor. He introduced
himself to President Tappan and was given the job left
by Peck. Professor Wood stayed with the University until
1872, establishing a separate Department of Engineering
with a four-year curriculum in 1858.

Answers to puzzles on page 19.
1. Many people immediately think of some exotic device,
like an x-ray machine. But the best answer is a very simple
and common item: a window. This problem shows how the
correct solution to a problem is often overlooked because a
person is too busy looking for a complicated solution
instead of a simple one.
2. Pull out a cigarette lighter and set the bag on fire. When
it has completely burned away, the shot can be taken with
no problem. When trying to solve this problem, most people
restrict themselves to finding a way to remove the ball from
the bag. The real problem is how to separate the paper bag
and the ball, regardless of what method is used.
3. To solve this problem with four lines, you must allow
yourself to exceed the imaginary square-shaped boundary
of the dots.
To do it with only three lines, you must rid yourself
of another restriction. It was never stated that you must
draw the lines through the center of the circles. In fact,
the way to do it is like this:
4. Here is one way.
b. This one is tougher.
c. If you were not able to solve this one, you are probably
still allowing restrictive thinking to hinder your creative
ability. The answer is surprisingly simple.
5. 10:03 a.m. Since the quantity of flatworms in each jar
doubles every three minutes, and since one jar begins with
exactly half as many flatworms as the other, this jar will
always have half as many flatworms as the jar that originally
had two. So at 10:00, when the first jar is full, the second
jar will be exactly half full. Three minutes later, the amount
of flatworms in the second jar will double, and it will be full.

Can you identify the chemical
engineer in this group?
You're right if you said all of them.
And you're right again if you conclude
that Kodak offers a wide choice of ca-
reer paths for individuals with strong
technical skills. So it shouldn't be a
surprise that our top management team
is predominantly individuals with en-
gineering backgrounds. At Kodak
plants in Windsor, Colo.; Rochester,
N. Y.; Kingsport, Tenn.; and Longview,
Tex., youTl find chemical engineers in
hard hats performing vital production
staff functions and others deeply in-
volved in design and development.
Other chemical engineers are more of-
ten in business suits, calling on cus-
tomers all over the country as Techni-
cal Sales Representatives. And some
don't stray too far away from the satis-
factions they find in the research labs.
Incidentally, it would be very easy to
find this kind of occupational variety
among mechanical, industrial, or elec-
trical engineers at Kodak.
Some of the members of this group
found a bachelor's degree was all that
lenging job. Other positions are better
suited for someone who has completed
a master's degree. If you prefer to work
now and study later, the Kodak Educa-
tional Aid Program offers opportuni-
ties for full- or part-time learning. Those
bent on a career in research usually
apply to us with Ph.D in hand.
At Kodak, the emphasis is on tech-
nical innovation as a blueprint for
keeping pace with our changing world.
It's taken us—and it can take you—far
from our photographic origins. For ex-
ample, our basic expertise in photo-
graphic emulsion coating was the
springboard to the development of a
new clinical blood analysis system for
health care. Our need for chemicals in
photographic manufacturing led to
the development of a multiplicity of
products including fibers, textiles, and
dyes for apparel and home furnish-
ings. And our imaging abilities gave
us an opportunity to make and market
qualitybusiness equipment like micro-
nlmers and copier-duplicators.
directions, the people who work for it
should expect changing horizons in
their individual roles as well. Where
the future can take you at Kodak de-
pends on a lot of things—like personal
preferences, performance on the job,
and available openings. What we can
promise is the opportunity to explore
many conventional engineering choices
plus a lot of other vital professional

?or the first time in the history of space technology, a single electronics system will perform bott
radar and communications functions aboard NASA's Space Shuttle Orbiter. Meshing the "eyes, ears
and voice" functions into a 260-pound hardware package, results in a significant reduction in weight
and space. Major components such as the transmitter, receiver, antenna and servo mechanisms
perform dual roles.
As a radar, the unit searches for, acquires, tracks and delivers spatial data needed for Orbiter to
effect a quick, efficient rendezvous with other space vehicles. As a communications system, it
provides high-quality transmission and reception with ground stations via two relay satellites. The
Ku-band subsystem will be built by Hughes for prime Space Shuttle contractor Rockwell
International.
Plant engineers now can see an instant picture of energy losses during plant operations. Using
a handheld infrared viewing device, they can pinpoint a wide range of energy-wasting situations—
among them: steam leaks, product-flow problems, electrical overloads, components failures,
machinery hotspots, cable shorts, heating/airconditioning system losses, insulation defects,
chemical/thermal pollution.
The device is an industrial version of the Probeye® Infrared Viewer, originally developed and
marketed by Hughes for use in law enforcement, fire detection and search-and-rescue. It senses
infrared rays radiated by objects within its viewing field and converts the radiation to a red image
viewable through its eyepiece. Temperature differences as small as 0.1 C. are detected and portrayed
by the 7.2 Ib. self-contained unit.
Hughes has free reprints available of technical papers describing important contributions in
areas of research, engineering, and science. Included are the following: "Horn Structures for
Integrated Optics," "High Power On-Off Switching with Crossed Field Tubes," "Aircraft Identifica-
tion by Moment Invariants," and "Gravity Gradient Mapping from the Luncar Polar Orbiter—A
Simulating Study." For copies or information, write to Hughes Aircraft Company, Building 100 M/S
C-666, P.O. Box 90515, Los Angeles, CA 90009.
A bright, high-resolution, large screen liquid crystal projection system that can display dynamic
tactical military situations in real time has been delivered to the U.S. Navy for evaluation. It can
project virtually anything that can be displayed on a cathode ray tube either in raster scan or
random scan mode. Typical applications include symbols, alphanumerics, geographical maps, and
text. Its bright, clear display reduces requirements for specially controlled lighting during briefing
sessions or command conferences.
The system uses a liquid crystal light valve developed by Hughes, and has a reliability never
before achieved in large screen displays. Mean-time-between-failure is estimated at 5,000 hours, and,
as no consumables are required, this results in lower operating and maintenance costs. Other
features are 1,000 line resolution and 30 millisecond response time.
Hughes is currently seeking new graduates in electrical, mechanical engineering and computer
science or other closely aligned disciplines to meet the demanding challenge of our high technology
company. To obtain further information, please write: Manager, College Relations, Hughes Aircraft

The Inside Story
Ah, December! A time for graduation, at least for some of us lucky ones.
Though the Fall term graduates are not nearly so numerous as the Winter term
graduates, they too deserve hearty congratulations for their years of hard work,
and for making it through the hazardous curriculum of engineering here.
The Technic staff is being hit also by graduation, losing two of its more
dedicated members. Bill Cowie, who has put in many long hours as Circulation
Manager, Business Manager, and Managing Editor, gravitates away with a
degree in Aerospace Engineering. In addition, the guy whose graphics grace
the pages, and occasionally the cover, artist John McCarthy, leaves with a
degree in Civil Engineering. I'm sure his work will be greatly missed by those
of you with limited vocabularies. To Bill and GP, and all the rest of the
December graduates, we wish the best of luck in all your future endeavors.
To help counter the effects of studying for finals, this month's issue
features articles of general interest and lighter topics. For instance, have you
ever wondered why your new roommate howls at the full moon? The cover
story depicts junior Steve Hannah's article, "Biometeorology: The Weather
and You." Biometeorology is the relatively new science of the study of how
the weather and changing seasons affect your health and behavioral patterns.
So this time when you blow your finals, you can attribute it to the snow and
cold weather inhibiting your thought processes.
Quick, what is the most basic equation of geometry? If you said the
Pythagorean Theorem, you guessed right. Now who invented it? Why,
Pythagoreas, of course! But not necessarily. Pythagoreas and his band of
followers (the Pythagoreans) are generally credited with discovering the proof
that the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is the sum of the squares
of the two sides. They also discovered many other mathematical relationships
based on their religion of number worship. Associate Editor Guy Zimmerman
reports on the Pythagoreans and some of their other mathematical achieve-
ments in his article, "The Pythagoreans: More Than Just the Theorem." Guy
is a junior in Engineering Science.
With pet rocks on the decline, the newest "pet" craze is sure to be dis-
covered by Christmastime - your very own pet LS&amp;A student. Since this pet
requires a little, though not much, more care than your discarded pet rock,
Jeff Diewald has drawn up more elaborate directions than will probably be
included with your new pet and has entitled them, "On the Care and Feeding
of Your Pet LS&amp;A Student."
Mark Schumack returns again this month with another piece of fiction, a
short story entitled, "In His Anger Lay the Storm." It involves a young boy
who unconsciously through his emotions telekinetically causes changes in the
weather, and the emotional struggles of his nurse in dealing with him.
The issue closes with the final installment of the trilogy on wargaming - this
time an interview with SPI (Simulation Publications Incorporated) President
Jim Dunnigan. Business Manager Paul S. Cook interviewed Mr. Dunnigan
this past summer at the National Gaming Convention held here in Ann Arbor.

The Weather and You
by Steve Hannah
A relatively new scientific field which has been attracting
considerable interest is Biometeorology. This is the study of
how seasons, lunar tides, storms, heat and cold, and sudden
weather changes effect what we do and how we feel. It is
not to be confused with horoscopes or bio-rhythms;
Biometeorology is a science which tries to monitor and
explain biological changes due to weather variations.
Researchers are finding out many ways in which your
body chemistry is effected by the environment. They have
found that the way your body adjusts to shifts in the
weather influences your health. Some individuals adapt to
changes better than others, but all bodies must strain to
adapt to sudden changes in the weather.
Biometeorologistshave come up with interesting findings
on the effects of seasons on your body. For one thing,
several diseases seem to be very seasonal in nature.
Researchers noted that ulcers are more apt to start in
February or March, leukemia has a higher rate of occurrence
in the winter, juvenile diabetes typically starts in the Fall,
and a manic depressive mood is more common in the Fall
and Spring. There also seems to be a correlation between
which season a person is born and their behavior. This gives
some validity to horoscopes. It has been noted that
schizophrenics and mental patients are often born in the
winter. It has also been noted that children born in warm
months have higher I.Q.'s (on the average) than children
born in the winter. Scanning a Who's Who in America one
finds that most people listed were born in the warmer
months.
Biometeorologists have also been studying the effects
of the monthly pull of the Moon on our bodies. The Lunar
tide triggers several violent reactions of the human race.
Police records show that arson, kleptomania, street fighting,
car wrecks, thefts, etc. are on the rise during the full moon
period. Psychiatric hospital data shows that mental patients
are more violent with the full moon. The Moon also
influences the murder rate. Dr. Arnold Lieber, of the Univer-
sity of Miami, Florida, conducted a time analysis of 2000
murders in Dade County, Florida from 1956 to 1970. His
studies show that the homicide rate peaks with the full
moon. A later survey in Cuyahoga County, Ohio showed
similar results. Murders were more frequent and tended to
be more grotesque during the full or new moon period.
Unlike the Moon, the Sun seems to have more beneficial

can actually affect the way we
behave and the way we feel. The seasons,
lunar tides, storms, wind, rain, and
barometric pressure can have a profound
influence on our health and behavior.
effects. People from the temperate zones of the world tend
to be relaxed, free, outgoing at'times, while people from
the Northern latitudes behave differently. They tend to be
taciturn and sullen in the long winter months. They
succumb to winter psychoses which last from a few hours
to a matter of days. They will often drink too much and
tend to have a higher suicide rate. Cold effects people
differently. It has a more adverse effect on thin people, who
have less insulation against the winter winds; consequently
the cold can leave them depressed as well as ill. Chicago
researchers found that in unsettled cold weather more
slender people, rather than heavy, commit suicide, whereas
heavier people have the same type of difficulties in the
warmer climates. Cold weather is bad for people with
heart ailments. In extreme cold the heart attack rate in-
creases due to the increased strain on the body. Common
diseases such as colds and flus are more common in the
cold also.
Warm weather is more beneficial than cold weather, but
it also has its disadvantages. Extreme heat can have very
adverse effects. It has been noted that there is a marked
tendency towards violence during heat waves. In New York
city murder and suicide rates are always highest during July.
People tend to become irritable (especially heavy set people)
because their bodies must work to keep from overheating.
This tends to drain the body of energy, leaving a person
tired and edgy.
One factor which is less obvious is the effect of wind.
Wind is believed to have its effects on behavior but the
exact effect is not known. As an example, consider the
"Foehn" of Austria, Germany, and Switzerland. The
Foehn is a warm dry wind which, when it blows, blows
continuously. Records show that when the Foehn blows
the crime rate increases, the occurrence of mental illness
increases, and epileptic seizures are more frequent. People
in this region take the Foehn quite seriously. An American
doctor in Salzburg, Austria noted one occasion where a
soldier with a cerebral hemorrage was admitted during the
Foehn. A fellow Austrian doctor refused to operate until
the Foehn stopped, saying that during the Foehn "Things
always go wrong. Wounds become infected, nurses fret, a
surgeon's hands are not as sure. I don't know why it
happens, but it does."
Biometeorologists are equally ignorant about the effects
of rain. British researchers have recently found a high
correlation between excessive rain and heart attacks. The
reason for this correlation is not known, but speculators
believe that the amount of rain and the intensity of the
rain may be key factors.
Probably the most astounding weather factors which
effect our lives are the effects of barometric pressure and
electromagnetic waves in the air. It has been found that
electromagnetic waves and changes in barometric pressure
bring about changes in body chemistry and can have very
profound effects. Dr. Clarence Mills of the University of
Cincinnati states that a drop in barometric pressure causes
body tissues to swell, it diminishes the flow of blood and
causes a build up of pressure in the brain. Normal healthy
people can get headaches, become apathetic, become irritable
and are more easily exhausted. In extreme cases, a drop in
barometric pressure can cause certain individuals to act
irrationally and it can leave them unable to maintain normal
control over their behavior. A Toronto study shows that
motorists are apt to be "listless and easily distracted" when
the pressure drops, which brings about more accidents. Dr.
Robert Conquest of the University of Vermont says that a
sharp change in pressure causes a rise in self destructive
acts and this raises the probability for accidents to occur.
Studies show that mentally unbalanced people are affected
more by pressure changes than "normal" people. It is also
shown that "sensitive" individuals and females are heavily
affected, relatively speaking, by the barometric pressure.
Some researchers link the effects of a drop in pressure
to electromagnetic effects. A drop in pressure causes more
positive ions to become available in the atmosphere. They
believe that positive ions cause "physical wars" in one's
body.
Usually the charge in the air is balanced, but in a storm
pressure changes upset the balance. Changes in the earth's
electromagnetic field alter the blood's sedimentation rate,
affect blood coagulation, and can even cause clotting in
susceptible individuals. A positive field can make one feel
anxious and hyperactive as well as depressed, while a
negative field can make one feel happy and lively. Humans
are very sensitive to a change in the electromagnetic field.
Dr. H.E. Landsberg of the University of Maryland says "Even
thunderstorms 200 miles away can have enough of an
effect on the electromagnetic field for people to sense it."
December 1978


people are more sensitive to fluctuations in the field. Dr.
Robert Becker of Syracuse, New York, studied 25,000
psychiatric admissions over a period of 5 years, correlating
the rates of admission to the number of electrical storms
each month. He found that the rate of admissions increased
as the number of storms increased. He did a follow up
study on psychiatric patients undergoing treatment and
found that their biological rhythms (eat-sleep cycles,
alertness cycle, etc.) changed with electrical storms. Even
mentally healthy people were noticeably effected by
thunderstorms.
Pressure variations which accompany storms help people
sense that storms are coming. J.L. Hollander, University of
Pennsylvania, constructed a "Climatron" which exactly
duplicated thunderstorm conditions by varying wind, baro-
metric pressure, and humidity. He found that people with
bone ailments could sense an impending storm better than
normal individuals.
It is believed that the added alertness and hyperactivity
which accompany electrical storms may act to make us
smarter. As an example, observe the peculiar test results
recorded by Massachusetts State College (now the University
of Massachusetts) in 1938. The entering freshmen were
given an I.Q. test before admission to the college. It
happened that a large hurricane was forming at the time the
first tests were given. Just before the hurricane actually hit,
the scores were slightly higher than average. When the next
group of freshmen were tested the hurricane was at its
height and the test scores soared to a remarkably high
average, which is still the highest in the school's history.
After the storm began to settle the scores dropped 10%
lower than average.
The findings of biometeorologists can be very useful
in both the medical world and the industrial world.
Some hospitals are already making use of the findings on
electromagnetic waves. They have installed electromagnetic
wave generators in surgery patient recovery rooms to help
speed recovery. It has also been noted that certain drugs
vary in potency with the weather; this could become a useful
thing for doctors to know because they could vary the
prescription according to the weather.
Industrialists can use biometeorology to help predict
worker output. Several industries have noted that after
long clear spells, a cloudy or rainy day boosts productivity.
This knowledge could help factories produce more and keep
workers satisfied at the same time. They would be able to
predict an overall mood and increase work loads when the
weather was such that workers would be more productive.
From this, it is seen that weather and related changes do
produce differences on how we feel and act, and maybe
even on specific ailments of the body. Unfortunately, we'll
have to learn to adapt to these changes since, at the
moment, not much can be done to change the weather and
solar and lunar cycles.

More Than
Just the Theorem
by Guy Zimmerman
The name Pythagoras is usually associated with an old
man with a white scraggly beard and tattered robe
drawing right triangles in the sand with his cane, pro-
claiming the square of the hypotenuse equal to the sum of
the squares of the other two sides. This almost immediate
association is truly an unfair one, for Pythagoras and the
Pythagorean school did much more than prove this theorem.
The mathematical knowledge assimilated by this group
forms a large part of the foundation of our present day
mathematics.
The history of the Pythagoreans is not known exactly,
partly because they didn't record anything until the end
of the Pythagorean era was near and partly because
members of the school swore an oath never to reveal the
secrets of the school. Along the same line, it was not
uncommon for followers of Pythagoras to attribute their
own discoveries to him. So it is unclear, for the most part,
exactly what was discovered by Pythagoras and what was
discovered by members of the school. In fact, in all his
writings on the subject, Aristotle always refers to 'the
Pythagoreans' or sometimes 'the so-called Pythagoreans.'
Pythagoras was born in the year 569 B.C. (?) on the
island of Samos, off the west coast of Asia Minor. Nothing
is known about his childhood; the only information we have
about him begins with his adult years. It is claimed that he
traveled extensively throughout Egypt, Babylon and the
Orient, where he supposedly learned of their mathematics,
religions, and mysticism. Actually all we know for certain
is that he had a good knowledge of the beliefs and
mathematical concepts of the people of Asia Minor. When
Pythagoras was approximately forty years old, he left the
island of Samos to escape the tyranny of Polycrates, who
had ascended to the throne. He migrated to Crotona, on the
southeast coast of Italy. Here he began to lecture on the
immortality of the soul and the purification of the spirit.
He attracted many students and they formed themselves
into the Pythagorean brotherhood. The group grew in
number and became politically oriented as time passed.
Eventually, the local aristocracy began to feel threatened
and they forced Pythagoras to retire twenty years after he
came to Crotona. He moved to Metapontum, north of
Crotona, where he eventually died. The brotherhood lived
on for nearly a century after his death before it was violently
eliminated; members were killed, meetinghouses were
burned. Survivors fled to other countries to carry on the
work, but by the middle of the fourth century B.C., the
Pythagorean school had disappeared.
In spite of the amount of political power they wielded,
they were essentially a very strict religious order. (It was
not easy to join the Pythagorean brotherhood. Potential
members went through years of study before they were
allowed to hear the voice of Pythagoras himself.) They
were vegetarian and lived a communal monastic life, where
everything was shared and principles of self denial were
encouraged. They all believed the basic philosophic principles
of Pythagoras and (as mentioned earlier) swore a sacred oath
not to reveal them to outsiders. At the end of each day
they were required to practice a self evaluation to decide
where they had gone wrong that day and how they could
improve themselves. The badge of the order was the star
pentagram. Legend has it that a member of the order, who
was dying in a foreign country was befriended by a native
of that country and before he died, he instructed the man to
paint the symbol on his door. Several years after the
Pythagorean had died, another member of the order came
upon the star and after inquiring as to its nature, richly
rewarded the man.
Pythagorean Philosophy
One of Pythagoras' basic pricniples was the transmigration
of the soul. He believed that a person's soul was caught on
a 'Wheel of Birth,' and after death the soul migrated to
another body; sometimes it was human, sometimes it was
not. "Do not strike him," he once said to a man beating a
small dog, "he is a friend. I recognized his voice when he
cried out." It was possible to break the cycle by purification
of the spirit. (We see here many parallels to the Hindu
religion, e.g. coming back to life in another body, im-
proving your next life by purifying your spirit, etc. The
similarity is one basis for the theory of his extensive travel,
especially to the Orient.)
Pythagoras preached purification of the soul through
Pythagoreanism (being a Pythagorean) and through the
study of science. The foremost method of purification of
the soul was the study of Mathematics. The word Mathema-
tics, for which Pythagoras is responsible, did not apply
strictly to what we think of as mathematics. The four
Mathemata were: The study of numbers, the study of
music, the study of geometry, and the study of astronomy.
These subjects were arranged in a hierarchy known as the
Quadrivium of Knowledge (see box). This classification
scheme illustrates the duality principle prevalent in Pythagor-
eanism.
Another tenet of the Pythagorean discipline was the
theory of numbers. Briefly stated, Pythagoras believed that
all things were made of numbers and that numbers were
the cause of all things, in the same way that later thinkers
believed that everything was made of earth, fire, water and
air. He did not say that everything had a number associated

the essence of all things. It is very important to realize
that, by number, Pythagoras meant only the positive integers,
the natural numbers. The discovery of the irrational would
prove very distressing to members of the brotherhood later
on.
Number Theory
Why would anyone think that everything is made of
numbers? The Greeks looked up into the night sky,
connecting stars together with lines to get figures. They
identified each shape with a number of stars. Pythagoras is
also credited with discovering that musical harmonics can be
represented in small whole number ratios: 2:1 for the octave,
3:2 for the fifth and 4:3 for the fourth. Numbers out of
musical scales! These are two explanations often offered
for the development of the theory of numbers.
Principal to the theory of numbers are the concepts of
the limited and the unlimited (Quadrivium of Knowledge).
The cosmos was a combination of the limited and unlimited.
The product of the limited and unlimited was the One. The
One was not a number at all, it was the principle of number,
the beginning of number and all numbers were generated
from it. One was also defined as the limit of fewness or
limiting quantity. Two was the number for the principle of
even and odd, four meant justice, and so on.

through it. A primary example is their theory of the even
and odd. The Pythagoreans had many definitions for even
and odd numbers which all said the same thing but in a
different way. An even number is that which admits of
being divided by one and the same operation into the
greatest and least parts, greatest in number but least in
parts (two halves). An odd number is that which cannot be
so divided. A later Pythagorean, Nichomachus, gives another
definition. "An even number is that which can be divided
into two parts of the same kind and into two parts of
different kinds, while an odd number can only be divided
into two parts of different kinds." The theory of the even
and odd was quite extensive and frequently used. Oddly
enough, the One was said to be both odd and even or
odd-even, because both even and odd numbers arose from
it. Even numbers were considered to be feminine, while odd
numbers were said to be masculine. The first even number
was two and the first odd number was three, so naturally
their sum (feminine + masculine), five, was the number for
marriage.
In the table of the school's ten principles, we see the
even/odd duality again. The table shows the Pythagorean
balance of opposites. This approach to reality gave defini-
tions such as: A number is the result of the limited con-
straining the unlimited to a certain degree.

the pieces
Area: (a+b)2
Area: c2 +
a2 + 2ab + b2 = c2 + 2ab
.'. a2+b2=c2
B
Diagonal of a Sqare
If the diagonal AC is commensurable (having a
common measure) with the side AB, let their ratio
in lowest terms be x:y. Now from the Pythagorean
theorem.
AC2 =
AC2 =
AB2 + BC2
2AB2
This says that AC is even and therefore AC must be
even (if it were odd, AC2 would be odd). So represent
AC by 2q now
(2qK = 2ABJ or
= AB2
A* —B
which implies that AB is even also, but we said
earlier that the ratio of AB:AC =x:y was in lowest
terms and if both are even the ratio cannot be in
lowest terms. Hence a contradiction, the hypothesis
is false and the diagonal and side are not commensurable.

Other Numerical Relationships
When the Pythagoreans discovered that a number or a
set of numbers had a unique property, the number or set of
numbers was very meaningful. As an example, the later
Pythagoreans called a number perfect if the sum of its
proper divisors was equal to the number itself.
6=1+2+3
28 =1 +2 + 4 + 7 + 14
Nichomacus knew of four such numbers and to date only
twelve 'perfect' numbers are known (see box).
Pythagoras defined ten to be the perfect number. Ten is
the sum of the first four numbers, called Holy Tetractys.
10 =1+2 + 3 + 4
They are called holy because out of these four numbers come
the ratios of the musical harmonics. Also in Geometry, one
is the point, two is the line, three is the plane, and four is
the solid. The Holy Tetractys form all the figures of
Geometry! Point, line, plane, and solid. These definitions
come from arranging the proper number of dots in the
right places (through any two points we get a line, and so
on). Representing number in such a fashion was another
habit of the Pythagoreans called 'figured numbers.'
Figured numbers are fairly self explanatory; they are
simply expressing numbers in a geometric figure. Many
different figured numbers were known; triangular numbers,
square numbers, rectangular numbers, pentagonal numbers,
and polygonal numbers in general (see box). Triangular
numbers were formed by adding the natural numbers in
sequence starting from one. Similarly, the square number was
formed by adding the odd natural numbers starting from
one. The number added to a polygonal number to get
another polygonal number was called a gnomon. For
example, in triangular numbers two is the gnomon for one,
because adding two to one gives the triangular number
three.
As before, there were many theorems relating m-gonal
number to themselves and to n-gonal numbers, such as:
A square number is the sum of two successive triangular
numbers.
The Pythagoreans were not only competent arithmeti-
cians, they also developed geometry to a high degree. The
most well known geometric discovery is the Pythagorean
theorem.
c2 = a2 + b2
This is the one thing that everyone knows them for, and
it's the one that they are least likely to have discovered.
There is evidence that shows the 3, 4, 5 triangle was known
to the Egyptians (more evidence for the extensive travel
theory). There is no evidence, however, that they knew that
a triangle which obeyed the above equation was right
angled. This discovery is credited to Pythagoras. (Two
methods of proving the theorem are gJven in the box.)
Pythagoras is also given credit for deriving an expression
from which any number of Pythagorean triplets can be
obtained.
m2 + yz(m2 - I)2 = 1/i(m2 + I)2, m odd
This theorem led to the downfall of the Pythagorean
'Holy number theory.' If the theorem is applied to a square,
we find that the diagonal is equal to \/2 times the length
of the side. The \/2 is irrational, i.e. not expressable in a
fixed number ratio. To the brotherhood, the square and its
diagonal were something natural and beautiful, and to find
that the side and diagonal were incommensurable must
have been the beginning of the end of their number
religion. After the incommensurability was accepted as
fact (proof in the box), a sequence was derived, from
which y/2 could be approximated as close as you like.
Other Discoveries
The sum of the three angles in a triangle equals 180
degrees, right? Guess who discovered it? The list of
Pythagorean accomplishments is pretty impressive. Some
major ones not discussed are:
• They developed a geometric algebra called the Applica-
tion of Areas, which enabled them to add, subtract,
divide, extract a square root and find the real roots of
the general quadratic equation.
X2±px±q = 0
• All five regular solids were known to them.
• They theorized that the earth was spherical, and that
the planets and the sun all revolved around a central fire.
• They discovered that the fixed stars move in a direc-
tion opposite to that of the planets.
• They developed a very advanced acoustics theory and
found mechanics.
As we've seen, the Pythagoreans are responsible for
much of our current mathematics, in that they laid the
framework for future mathematicians to build on. Numbers
were their joy, their existence and their passion. Their
philosophy was a little on the strange side, but there are some
pretty weird ideas in circulation today. At any rate,
Pythagoreanism is not just as simple as a2, b2, c2.

"Five!" shouted Jason as he slammed his gamepiece
hard upon the playing board. "I rolled five!" He glared at
Marietta defiantly.
"No, that's a four," Marietta responded in a calm
voice whose tone was shaped from extensive experience
with Jason's temperament. "You can have that roll over,
then I'll go get you a popsicle, OK?"
The boy's face lit up with the mention of his favorite
treat. He shook his head happily. "Can I have purple?"
he asked. The game was quickly forgotten as Marietta
stood up.
"Yes," she said, "You stay right where you are until I
get back."
Another close one, she thought as she walked through
the long marble hallway leading to the kitchen, he's been
getting this way a lot lately. The temper tantrums were to
be expected from a mentally retarded child, but Marietta
worried because Jason's fits were becoming more frequent.
She had good reason to be concerned about the young
boy's mental attitude. In addition to his mental illness,
Jason had another, more bizarre handicap: his emotions
telekinetically influenced the weather.
The boy knew nothing, however, of the incredible
power he possessed. When he was happy, nature pretty
much behaved normally; but when he became angry or
upset, wind, rain, and lightening tormented the surrounding
countryside. It was Marietta's main duty as his nanny to see
that he stayed happy. Only once in her six years with
Jason had he flared up and released his stormy wrath.
Countless other potential tempests had been averted by her
quick reactions to his outbursts. Above all, Jason and his
secret had to be kept hidden from the outside world. If
society were to discover that the power to create hurricanes
and unleash floods lay within a mentally unstable child, it
would surely demand his destruction.
Marietta knew only vaguely of the history behind
Jason's telekinetic ability. Over the years, she had picked
up dim pieces of the story . . . Eight years ago, Jason's
father. Professor Crownen, developed some kind of mind-
over-matter serum ... he injected it into his body, but to
his disappointment, there was no reaction ... a few months
later his wife became pregnant . . . Jason was born ... his
mother died in childbirth ... at the age of two it was
determined that Jason was mentally disturbed . . . soon
after, his other trait surfaced . . . the blizzards of '77 . . .
Professor Crownan realized his son's freak ability and vowed
to keep him in isolation. He hired a nanny to watch his
son closely and paid her generously to compensate for the
unusual circumstances.
Marietta and Jason rarely saw Professor Crownen. He
was often out of town or busy in his laboratory. Weeks and
months went by when all that Jason saw was the secluded,
lonely world inside the fifty acre estate. To be sure.
Professor Crownen had supplied his son with all sorts of
pastimes and diversions: a playground, a swimming pool,
a small zoo. Jason's simple mind was easily entertained and
so far he had seemed satisfied in his elaborate prison. But
Marietta knew that Jason would not be happy forever in
this place. That was expecting too much. Somehow, she
could not picture him thirty years from now, a grown man,
sinking toy submarines in the pool and playing finger-
games with skittering June bugs in his sandbox. He was bound
to grow curious about what was on the other side of the
high stone wall; and he was bound to escape. Marietta
shuddered when she visualized Jason in the outside world,
trying to understand, becoming harassed and put down, and
finally crying out in his frustrated anger. And then — the
fruit of his frustration storming down, literally, upon
thousands of innocent people. Sometimes, in the gray
troubled thoughts of a sleepless night. Marietta wondered
if it was not wrong for Jason to live.
He slurped his popsicle loudly. Marietta told him that
she was going to the grocery store and would be back
shortly. She found him some games that she knew would
keep him amused while she was gone and left his room,
locking the door behind her. Her watch said 3:30, she would
be back in plenty of time to make Jason's supper.
A warm, fresh breeze blew along Marietta's cheeks as
she drove down the highway. The sun lapped its bright
tongue lovingly across the fields and farmhouses on either
side of her, and struck the road in such a way as to give the
illusion of water-slicked pavement far ahead. She hummed
to the rhythm of the tires bouncing across the cracked
highway. It makes me happy to make him happy, she
admitted to herself.

three miles from her exit when she heard a loud bang and
felt a sudden lurch of the steering wheel. Dam, she thought,
I've got a flat. What now? I don't know how to change a
tire. She pulled over and considered the situation. It was
five o'clock, and Jason would be getting hungry soon. He
always had dinner at half-past five; she would never be
able to make it home in time. She jumped out of the car
and waved desperately at passing motorists.
Finally a policeman stopped. He got out of his patrol
car and lumbered towards her. Hurry up! she thought as he
dragged his feet through the gravel, hurry! The officer
walked up and observed the split tire twisted about its
rim. "What seems to be the problem?" he said in a
concerned voice. Oh, God, she thought, maybe I should've
attempted this myself.
"Officer," she said, "could you please fix my tire? I've
got a sick child at home and I've got to get back to him
right away." The policeman walked over and kicked the
heap of useless rubber.
"Yep," he drolled, "she's flat, all right. You got a jack?"
"A what? Oh yes, back here." Marietta ran around and
unlocked the trunk. She looked at her watch. Five-twenty,
it showed. She frantically searched around under dirty
blankets and rusty chains.
"It's right here, lady," said the policeman, pulling the
device out from an obvious spot in the tire well. "You
just hang on; I'll have this done in a jiffy."
Marietta had never seen anybody so slow. The man
seemed to move as if he had lead weights tied to all his
limbs. She looked up and glanced across the corn fields.
On the horizon she spotted a long bank of dark clouds. A
terrifying feeling filled her stomach. She read her watch:
5:40.
"Please, please hurry up! You don't know how impor-
tant it is that I get home immediately!"
The officer looked up at the frenzied woman. "Lady,
I'm hurrying! You want me to do a good job, don't you?
Or do you want your tire to fall off in the middle of the
highway?" He let go a grunt. "They ought to teach you
dames how to change tires. It sure would save us cops a lot of
hassles."
"Look, over there," she blurted.
"Over where?"
She pointed to the black clouds in the distance. "If
you don't hurry, we'll get stuck in the storm."
"Oh, that's a long ways off. It's not supposed to rain
today, anyway. That'll probably just pass us by."
Marietta bit her lip. If only he knew; if only he knew
what was in those clouds. She looked at the approaching
darkness and saw Jason's face, contorted with anger at the
hunger he was beginning to feel. It's happening again, my
God, if only he knew what he were doing! A wind struck
her face; it had the odor and warmth of Jason's breath.
She felt the air get thick and muggy. The first drops of rain
began to fall as the officer finished his job.
"There you go, ma'am." He threw the jack and damaged
tire into her trunk. Marietta mumbled a hurried "thank you"
as she slid behind the wheel and sped off down the highway.
The rain was falling heavier by the minute. By the time
she reached her exit, she could barely see through the sheets
of rain smashing against the windshield. Other motorists,
stunned by the storm's sudden development, pulled off
to the side of the road.
Branches and other debris blew across her path as
Marietta forced her sputtering vehicle through mud and
deep puddles. I'm almost there, she thought, come on, car,
you can do it! Her heart sank as she came to a dead halt in
the middle of a lake several feet deep. It's only a mile,
she thought as she heaved open the car door and battled the
adamant wind to her feet. / must get to him before it gets
worse. She gained her balance and dove headfirst into the
gale.
The lights in the houses on either side of the street went
off. She remembered the last time Jason had caused a storm,
years ago. This time it's worse, she thought. As if to confirm
her thoughts, a violent gust of wet wind hit her and she
landed heavily on her back. Get up, you've got to move!
She struggled up from the muddy ground and continued.
The rain pelted her face ruthlessly, rhythmically. I couldn't
help it, I got a flat, it wasn't my fault.
Her thoughts grew dark and frightening. He's dangerous;
something must be done. A horrible idea entered her head,
and as water filled her eyes and blurred her vision, she
glimpsed an old wooden chest in the basement: the piece
lay near the bottom in a greasy cloth. / must do it, she
thought painfully, for him, for his father, for myself, for
everyone in the county; I must kill him. I must kill him.
The words reverberated through her skull as if they originated
from a large brass gong between her ears.
She reached the front gates. The wind and rain were
beginning to let up. As she opened the front door, a silver
plane of sunlight shot through the clouds. She plodded
through the house as if she was still fighting the rage.
For the love of God, I must take his life. I pray, I feel, I
know that this is right and is His will. Please give me the
strength to carry through. Please. She trembled from head
to foot as she headed for the basement.
A noise came from the kitchen. Marietta started and
peered around the corner into the room. On the floor in
front of the refrigerator sat Jason, merrily chomping
away at a grape popsicle. The freezer was open and a carton
half full of melting popsicles lay next to him. Water dripped
from Marietta's soaked clothes and formed a puddle around
her feet as she watched the young boy. He felt her gaze and
turned to her, a broad sun-filled smile forming across his
face. From that smile flowed a love eternally unique
between a child and its mother. "Was it a bad storm?" asked
Jason.
Marietta wept, a heaviness tumbled from her heart, and
she knew that she would never harm him. She wiped her
eyes and returned his smile. "Yes, but it's all over now."
Jason pulled another popsicle from the box and stuffed
it happily into his mouth.

Care and Feeding
of Your
Pet LS&amp;A Student
by Jeff Diewald
So you finally went out and blew your wad acquiring
an LS&amp;A student - and now you realize you know
practically nothing about them. Before you take it to the
Humane Society or banish it to East Quad, there are a few
things that might change your mind. (Probably not, but
we'll give it a half-hearted stab anyway.) Properly trained
and housebroken, an LS&amp;A student can amuse for hours
(excepting of course the species Businessadministratus
Accountantus Boringus), provide comic relief from engin-
eering studies (especially Mathmajorus Airheadicus), or
make an excellent Parson's table.
LS&amp;A students come in two types: the Pathetic and the
Burn-Out, both unintelligent. They range about the entire
campus, and are often found loitering on the Diag for
hours, wandering aimlessly about in search of a Frisbee or
Nirvana. LS&amp;A students come in all shapes and sizes,
ranging from terminal Latin majors to 8.8-on-the-Richter
-scale pre-med students. (Warning: Intelligence is typically
inversely proportional to appearance.)
Vast 'herds of LS&amp;A students can be found in such
"idyllic paradises" as West Quad. They survive best on a
free ration of dorm food and are typically resistant to the
unknown horrors contained within. Another major reason
they like it is because some of the top LS&amp;A alumni have
reached a pinnacle of success as dorm cooks and bottle-
washers. These "master chefs" are distinctive for their
flair in ruining Jello.

An LS&amp;A student will drink anything, and caution must
be exercised to replace lids on all open cans of kerosene,
Lysol, and Ma/ola. Any covering will serve to stymie most
attempts to drink the liquid, but some of the more
brilliant ones will ingest the liquid by consuming the
bottle as well. This is not too bad if the bottle contains
mercurochrome, and a large supply is suggested. However,
LS&amp;A students do act like rational college students in that
their favorite beverage is beer. They do differ in the fact
that they prefer to take it intraveneously.
Sleeping accomodations for the standard LS&amp;A student
are not too important because they will sleep anywhere,
at anytime. This usually occurs during their "classes" such
as Major American Comic Books 234, Intensive Procrastina-
tion 442, or Somnambulism 466, but can also be anywhere
else, such as on top of the refrigerator, under the stereo,
or in the hall closet.
LS&amp;A students are fragile and must be cared for.
Windows confuse and bewilder them, creating many at-
tempts to walk through them. Mirrors are worse, frightening
and enraging them. Extreme cases (such as Jockstrapus
Basketweaverus) often pick fights with their reflections
and usually lose. Care must be exercised in home decora-
tions to avoid these situations. Books are a definite taboo,
inciting fear in the most timid LS&amp;A students.
Regular medical examinations are necessary tn order to
prevent the spreading of bizarre diseases, such as bathtub
ring or cooties. Tact must be used when initiating the
examinations, because some LS&amp;A students (usually of the
Premedicus Horribilis or the Confusidas Nursicus varieties)
withdraw into a near catatonic state over the words "med
test." Unusual behavioral patterns follow, with the most
intense studying for days for an upcoming urine test. Others
actually seek out bedpans and dirty laundry in time of
crisis.
It is obvious that the LS&amp;A student is a unique experi-
ment in Nature. We may never solve the reasons behind
that experiment, but many have suggested it is an everyday
example of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. Regardless,
an LS&amp;A student can provide hours of pointless extertain-
ment. With proper care and treatment, an LS&amp;A student
might be an interesting addition to your home or zoo.

Interviews
Jim Dunnigan
TECHNIC: Why don't you tell us about how you got
started in wargame design, and about your personal
background?
DUNNIGAN: I left home when I was 17, went down to
Greenwich Village, and made my way, as it were. A year
later, I went into the Army because I was 18 and they were
drafting people in 1961. I picked up on the military history
in the Army, and then I also picked up on the games with
Avalon Hill. When I got out I went to Columbia to study
history, but I kept in touch with Avalon Hill, and Tom
Shaw asked me to design a game for them. I did, and one
thing led to another. I did a couple more games for them,
and then I started SPI.
T: Could you tell us a bit about the start of Simulations
Publications?
D: I just simply felt that there was more of a demand for
games than the amount of games being published was
fulfilling. I took over a failing magazine called Strategy &amp;
Tactics, which I had written some articles for. I just
designed and published a whole bunch of games on a
shoestring. I put games in the magazine, and one thing
led to another. It was no miracle; we were just fulfilling a
need. Up we went from nothing to over two and one half
million bucks a year.
T: What do you think most gamers are interested in? Is it
the ability to recreate history and explore historical
alternatives, or simply the enjoyment of competition?
D: We have surveyed our customers on that and all those
apply to different degrees. The majority, though, are
interested in the historical information. That's the one
thing all of your historical gamers have in common. Not
all are competitive, not all are there to be entertained, and
not all are there just to get into something technically im-
pressive. But they all would like to understand a little bit
more about the situation. If they just wanted to play a
game they could play parcheesi. If they just wanted to learn
something technical they could read a book. If they just
wanted diversion they could go watch the boob tube.
T: How about science fiction games?
D: The one common line you'll see in our science fiction is
a rationale. Of course we have sort of defined our science
fiction audience. We produce a certain type of game and the
people who buy it will buy it because we have put certain
things in, and the people who don't buy it will not buy it
because we have left certain things out. Be that as it may,
our science fiction games tend to have more of a rationale
applied to them. We'll produce fantasy, but even our fantasy
tends to be done in great detail. The typical historical
gamer is a nut for detail. That's why Strategy &amp; Tactics
magazine has been so successful. The articles that are
consistently well accepted are the ones that give the most
20

Sometimes they think "all these numbers don't mean
anything." They mean something but they don't seem to
mean as much to one who is accustomed to generating
some good prose. But it's a psychological thing. People are
desirous of information, rationale, and some order out of
chaos. That's the one distinguishing characteristic of our
science fiction, and even the fantasy. Give more details and
it is more popular.
T: Do you think gaming should reach a wider audience
than it does now? That is, do you think it has appeal to
more people?
D: The big problem is technical literacy. The only reason
it has gone as far as it has is because since World War II a
large number of people have been given technical educations:
educations in mathematics, in science in general. More
people are exposed to the scientific method. The games are
basically an expression of the scientific method applied to a
social situation, namely history. This has never quite been
done before, and obviously there was a demand for it.
People wanted more understanding, and they had the tools
to gain that understanding, namely the technical education.
But normally a technical education has been used simply to
solve problems, not to create understanding. What the games
are capable of doing is creating that greater understanding.
This is something that is only now becoming more and
more apparent to people. Again, the prerequisite for this
is not so much the methodology, which has been around
since the invention of calculus, the breakthroughs in the
17th century. You had to have a large enough base of
"receivers" of this "skill." So in other words, since World
War II with the expansion of technical education, these
tools went from the "elitist" basis, that could be used by
only a small group of people, to the capability of being used
by a large group. But the group is still limited. In fact,
probably only 10% of the population is trained or has enough
technical knowledge to understand or use these games.
T: A lot smaller percentage of the population is actually
involved in gaming. What do you think can be done, and
what is SPI doing to reach more people?
D: We attend these conventions for one thing. We advertise,
we create introductory games. We simply try and keep in
touch with our market as that is the easiest way to get the
uninitiated into it. It has to be a voluntary thing because
the games require considerable effort to handle. Somebody
has to volunteer for something like that — it's like engin-
eering. You've got to volunteer for engineering. If a guy
goes to school to beat the draft he doesn't go to engineer-
ing school; he goes to liberal arts.
T: What do you think of Avalon Hill's dominance of the
adult non-wargame market?
D: It's fine by me. Actually they haven't got the market.
They're in heavy competition with all the major game
publishers, like Milton Bradley and Parker Brothers, who are
just defining the adult game market in a different way.
However, they are actively and aggressively going after the
adults. They're not doing it in the bookcase format. We go
to the toy show every year, and Howie Barasch, our market-
ing guy, keeps in close touch with the big outfits. They are
very anxious to reach the adults, because this is the big
game market. Actually it always was. They found out
fourteen years ago, when somebody did a survey, that the
adults were buying most of the games. People assumed they
were buying for kids, but that's a lot of bullshit. I suppose
a lot of the electric trains were also bought for adults.
Marketing is a funny business. If you don't ask people
questions, you start believing your own bullshit; what else
are you going to believe? That's why some people come to
grief.
T: Is that part of SPI's philosophy?
D: Yes, it keeps everybody honest. We all generate bullshit.
I sometimes get a nice idea and I really want to believe it
and I have to discipline myself to ask the question, and
the answer isn't always what I want to hear. I put in pro-
posals for games I think are dynamite, like the "Gladiator"
game. I thought that would be great; I had a big long
proposal, and it really took it on the nose. "Orbital," I
thought that would be a great one, with the killer satellites
and whatnot. I sat down and typed it up, handed it in, and
phhhtt. Needless to say we're not doing any "Orbital" or
"Gladiator" games.
T: What is your favorite game that you have designed?
D: I can't give any one favorite. That's a loaded question; I
get asked that a lot. Maybe "Russian Civil War." Sometimes
the latest one I've done. "Agincourt," that's a favorite for
the problems I had to solve, but I don't praticularly care to
play it. "Napolean at Waterloo" is one I consistently like to
play. Perhaps "Barbarossa," or some of my earlier ones, or
"Brusilov Offensive," that's a quadrigame that I just finished.
T: What do you think about the future of wargaming? What
kind of things can we expect?
D: There will be more diversity, and more use of microcom-
puters. There are two main trends. One, more people are
getting into the hobby, giving you a larger base. This enables
you to do more obscure topics. You have to sell a minimum
number of games in order to make it economically feasible
to publish it. As you get more customers a lot of those
special topics which may only pull 5% of the audience can
be done, because while ten years ago that 5% was not
enough to sustain a design, now it is. The second thing is
that the gamers have been in the hobby longer, so they're
getting older, they're growing up with it. The thing is only
twenty years old. The gamers are becoming more knowledge-
able and more widely read, so they demand more. That
gives us both the opportunity and the duty to fulfill them.
T: You mentioned computers. Could you say a little more
about that?
D: Right now the microcomputers have the ability to do a
lot of things gamewise. The main problem is the number
of people who have the machines. Only five percent of our
customers have them now, although another 15% have
indicated a strong interest in buying them. As that penetra-
tion increases the market base increases, and that makes it

75 Years Ago
What kind of responsibilities do engineers have to the
general public? Answers easily come to mind of safety
factors in structures, mechanical devices, and environ-
mental situations, but several years ago engineers were called
upon to make decisions in more diversified areas and even
were founders of general policies. A fine example of this
was presented in an article in the 1903 Technic entitled
"Some Responsibilities of the Civil Engineer," written
by Clarence T. Johnson, Assistant Chief of Irrigation
Investigations for the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Mr. Johnson pointed out that civil engineering was a field
of much diversity which included areas of railroad en-
gineering, land surveying, bridge engineering, street paving,
water workr and sewage disposal, mining engineering, and
irrigation engineering.
Since irrigation engineering was Mr. Johnson's specialty,
he illustrated the civil engineer's responsibilities with an
example of the work civil engineers had done in the western
United States. At the time the western United States was
sparsely settled, due mainly to the scarcity of available
water in many areas. The government offered incentives to
encourage people to settle in this region; however, the
first people to move in would claim land adjacent to avai-
lable water (such as rivers) and use this water to irrigate
their land. This soom led to a little valuable land and much
more useless land. (Irrigated land was worth $50-500 an
acre compared to unirrigated land which was worth as little
as $1.25 an acre.)
At that time the government did not exercise jurisdiction
over waterways unless navigation was involved. Consequent-
ly, water supplies would be exhausted in certain areas,
disputes would erupt between neighbors and communities,
and eventually the courts would be called in to decide the
cases. Oftentimes the courts would not be very effective
in handling the cases, since engineering facts were either
biased or ignored completely.
A little investigation on the part of some clever
engineers helped remedy the situation. They found "the
lawyer profited through the endless litigation that poor
laws afforded him. The engineer who surveyed the ditches
and canals, laid out the fields and measured the water,
first realized the injustice which was being done the
irrigator. The money from the farm went each year to
swell the bank accounts of lawyers who lived in luxury
in neighboring towns and villages."
The engineers took action and saw to it that boards were
established to allocate water to individuals, based on land
needs. Deeds were ussued for water usage, much the same as
75 and 5
Years Ago
by Karen Zahn
were deeds fro land. There was opposition from individuals
whose private interests were stopped by their actions. With
a fair settlement available the dissidence subsided. In
addition, through the efforts of engineers, legislation was
adopted to create the office of state engineer to solve
problems similar to these. In the area of public responsibi-
lity the irrigation solution was a novel incident.
50 Years Ago
Apparently in 1928 engineering students felt there was
not enough interaction between themselves and the faculty,
and they had nowhere to turn to voice their complaints.
The students utilized their newly-founded Engineering
Council to set up a plan through which upperclass stu-
dents could voice complaints or suggestions. The arrange-
ment is described in an article in the December 1928
Technic entitled, "The Faculty Student Co-operation
Plan."
While freshmen at the time had mentors and "the
faculty have had better access to the freshmen classes,"
the rest of the students apparently had no way to officially
voice their views. The plan devised by the Engineering
Council called for "the promotion of co-operation and
co-operative spirit between the faculty and students of the
College of Engineering."
It was decided that the main idea of the plan was the
giving of credit wherever credit is due and also to (give)
a better understanding between faculty and students in
any matter where differences of opinion may exist."
The plan was not for the express purpose to let students
make complaints of "undesirable situations." Furthermore,
the plan had to ensure students a free voice in expressing
thier opinions but must not invite abuse. The Engineering
Council proceeded to draw up a plan which was presented
before the faculty for approval.
The plan consisted of 11 articles, foremost of which was
that all comments must be submitted in writing to the
Engineering Council. The comment or complaint had to be
signed by at least fifty percent of the class or organization
from which it originated. In addition to the signature,
the individual's scholastic average must also be listed. And
on any complaints about a particular class, each signer had
to list all of his grades received on examinations given in
that class to date.

economically feasible for us.
T: Then we're talking about fairly small computers?
D: The microcomputers, like a 16K with an 8K BASIC.
T: What kind of cost are we talking?
D: A thousand bucks.
T: What do you think of engineers as wargamers?
D: They tend to be the more intense gamers. I've always
thought that you can probably divide society into engineers
and liberal arts types. The engineers tend to be a little
weird, they sort of think that science will make us free, that
things can be solved methodically. They're a little leery
of any idea that is not backed up by some rationale. Your
liberal arts folk on the other hand take a broader view, but
they also have their faults in that they tend to deprecate
the analytical approach. They say, "Hey, don't dehumanize
it." I think the engineers if nothing else are a little more
narrow-minded, but ironically, more pure of heart since
they tend to have a critical view of everything. They don't
get carried away. But they also tend to be less articulate, less
literate, too. I always have trouble when I get articles from
physicists or engineers. They do have things to say, though.
and if you can get the guy to write you generally get some
very good material. I think a lot of people go into engineering
because they feel more comfortable with the numbers, and
they feel less comfortable with the written word, reports,
and things like that. They certainly are not encouraged
when they go to work for large organizations and find
themselves generating reports that nobody reads. I mean
the apocryphal story about some sort of engineering
analyst turning out report after report and getting the
impression nobody is reading them. So finally he puts in
little sentences like, "Whoever is reading these reports must
be a real jackass," and seeing what happens. Of course
nothing happens. The report is received, stamped "RE-
CEIVED," and filed away. Nobody was reading it.
The engineers really dig the gaming because it combines
their ability to handle data with their desire to find out more
of the non-quantifiable elements of history or the human
existence. You have the same thing from the liberal arts
type, the non-engineer. They recognize the technological
superstructure, or understructure, of our society, and they
want to understand it. So the games become a meeting
ground for both groups.

THINK VERY HIGHLY
OF US.
FOR A LOT OF
WRONG REASONS.
It might surprise you, but Hughes doesn't make aircraft. What we do has been
expressed nicely by our Chairman of the Board, Dr. Allen E. Puckett:
"We're involved in a wide range of communications technologies, making
sensors that operate on all parts of the electronic spectrum, and computers
and signal processors that issue commands or store and present data.
In the midst of the dramatic electronic information explosion, Hughes
is putting data sensing, communications and data processing
advances to work for people like you and me."
If you're an EE, ME, AE, IE, Physics, Material Science or
Computer Science major, you could become part of this
exciting and challenging commitment. You could become
involved in aerospace, ground systems, industrial electronics,
space and communications and research. And don't
worry about getting lost - at Hughes, we work in small
groups where individual initiative is valued highly.

The Inside Story
Winter is great, for skiers and polar bears anyway. But for the average
unsure-footed student, navigating the slick sidewalks is not something looked
upon with great joy. Perhaps University officials should be required to take
at least one course in elementary chemistry. Then maybe students or anyone
else passing through wouldn't be risking broken legs, arms, and wrists when
walking around the campus. By taking a course in chemistry some principles
could be learned such as the fact that a little sodium chloride does wonders
for calming down an icy sidewalk or that when snow is left to be trod upon
by many thousands of feet in a week, the pressure will cause melting, and
subsequent freezing will produce a very slick surface.
The most hazardous area of campus has to be the immediate outside
of each end of the Engineering Arch. The building seems to have been designed
so that all melting snow drips off over the Arch, where it builds up in mounds
outside each entrance. And there is never any salt on these areas. Why don't
they take some of the salt which is deposited ankle-deep on the footbridge
over Washtenaw and put it on the entrances to the Arch? But on to this
month's issue (which is the real purpose of this column).
Picture yourself in the year 2079. Considering the ever-changing field of
engineering, try to imagine what classes will be required of future engineering
freshpeople. Philip Schulte fantasized into the future and came up with a topic
all up-to-date engineeringunderclasspeople should be familiar with - the matter -
anti-matter reaction. He wrote it up as a short mini-refresher article entitled
"Starfire: Matter — Anti-Matter Power Systems for Starships." Phil is a
senior in nuclear engineering.
Computers now permeate today's society to the extent that they are being
programmed to talk, play music and write poetry. Is it possible that these very
complex machines are capable of conscious, rendering them on their way to
becoming human? The thought is fascinating and perhaps a bit frightening. Jeff
Diewald speculates on the possibility of computers becoming human and the
basis for which this could be determined in his article "Artificial Intelligence
or Has the Teller-24 Machine been Leering at Your Girlfriend?" Jeff is a
senior in electrical and computer engineering.
Industrial engineering senior David Basore writes on a problem facing the
medical field in his article "Research in Industrial Engineering: Cost Control
in Hospitals."
Jeff teams up with his cohort Johnson to deliver the next piece about a
branch of calculus which is generally unknown. In their article "Trivial
Calculus" they introduce the new branch and even include homework
questions to test your knowledge of the subject Jeff is a senior in electrical
and computer engineering.
Managing Editor Guy Zimmerman wraps up the issue with the ever-
popular "The Michigan Technic 50 and 25 Years Ago." Artist Ross Anderson
provided the graphics this month. Ross is a sophomore in chemical
engineering.

The nationwide telecommuni-
cations network carries over 515
million phone calls on an average
business day. Only a small num-
ber of them run into trouble,
such as failing to go through
the network, getting noise on
the line, or being disconnected
prematurely. Craftspeople in
Bell telephone companies fix
most of these problems quickly.
But the causes of some can be
difficult to find among one-
billion-plus miles of circuits and
thousands of switching offices.
For several years the Bell
System used its computerized
Network Operations Trouble
Information System (NOTIS)
to try to pinpoint those causes
by analyzing trouble reports
from all over the country. NOTIS
was good. But Bell System man-
agers wanted it to be better,
more precise in identifying
possible trouble spots. And they
wanted the data in compact,
easy-to-use form.
We assigned a new employee,
Don Hartman, to improve
NOTIS. Don came to us with a
B.S. from the University of
Texas and an M.S. and Ph.D.
from Massachusetts Institute
of Technology. He and his
associates developed a second-
generation system (NOTIS II)
that does the job superbly.
For the new system, Don
developed a mathematical model
of the telecommunications net-
work, including 28,000 local and
long-distance switching offices
and nearly a half-million circuit
groups. Don also designed the
system software and served as a
consultant to the team of Bell
System programmers assigned
to the project.
Each day trouble reports from
the entire country are sent to the
NOTIS II center in Atlanta.
Overnight, the system analyzes
the reports, processes them
through the network model, and
discerns trouble "patterns"
which help identify potentially
faulty equipment. By 8 a.m. the
next day, via data links, analysts
at phone company service centers
receive information on troubles
traceable to circuits or switching
equipment in their territories.
Result: Better equipment mainte-
nance. And better service.
With NOTIS II up and run-
ning, Don has moved on to other
projects. Today he's a supervisor
with broad responsibilities for
planning the telecommunications
network of the future.

Matter - Anti-Matter
Power Systems for
Starships
by Philip Schulte
(Author's Note — The freshman engineering students have
been complaining that their required ENG 797 course,
'Introductory Applied Matter — Anti-Matter Reactions'
is too theoretical. To remedy this situation, Prof. Z.
Cochrane of the Astrophysical Engineering Department has
assigned several of his graduate students to write a series of
articles about the specific everyday applications of the
matter — anti-matter reaction. The following article is the
first in this series. Next term these articles will be collected
into a text and used in the ENG 797 class. Hopefully
these articles will inform the engineering student body of
the many practical uses of this technology, and in the long
term help to provide an interesting and more fully balanced
education to our engineering students.)
and is the base model for all other power/propulsion
systems used on Terran starships (see fig. 1).
SUMMARY
A brief review of force and stasis fields is presented, as
their operational characteristics are vital to the functioning
of the power system. The Mk-VII's operation is then
examined by following the flow of matter/anti-matter
through the four main stages of the system. The flow is
traced from its initial gathering from interstellar gases
(predominantly hydrogen) via magnetic fields ( (1) intake)
through its conversion (2) and reaction (3) stages until the
residual matter and energy is exhausted into hyperspace
( (4) exhaust). The most important mechanisms in each
stage are described and discussed, and basic physical
concepts are reviewed as necessary.
The primary function of the Mk-VII is to generate

INTRODUCTION
This article describes the basic method of operation of
the Mk-VII Matter/Anti-Matter Power System. The Mk-VII
is the most common unit in both civil and military service,

Warp Drive Unit is the propulsion device which enables
faster-than-light travel. The Warp Drive Unit will not be
discussed in this article, as its operation has no direct
relation to the matter — anti-matter reaction. Students

The Inside Story
I really missed the mark last month in discussing icy sidewalks. By
the time the magazine came out the sidewalks were looking less like the
frozen north and more like the overflowed Huron River. Now I'm tempted
to buy hip boots for navigating some of the sidewalks on the Diag. But
hopefully by the time this issue hits the stands, we will be well into the
midst of a warm, sunny Ann Arbor Spring with the sidewalks bare and dry.
Ah, to be able to play frisbee in the Arb.
Mark Schumack leads off the issue with an article on engineering ethics
entitled, "Engineering Ethics- Are They Pointing Us in the Right Direction?"
Most engineers will generally agree that certain practices should be adhered
to when dealing with the general public. Machines, objects, and structures
cannot be made unsafe at any cost, and engineers are increasingly being
called upon to design safety for blatant misuse of an object. But what
happens when the interests of an employer come in direct conflict with
the best interest of the general public, when the problem is not one of
safety? Often ethic rules on this subject are ambiguous and seem to indicate
that loyalty of the employer should override the interests of the public.
As the world grows more complex it remains to be seen who will win out.
Every so often we receive letters commenting upon articles that have
appeared in past issues. We recently received a letter from a student in
Wisconsin elaborating on Guy Zimmerman's article on the Pythagoreans,
which appeared in the December issue. As an incentive for people to respond
to the magazine and also because the letter is interesting, we are printing
it along with a computer program he enclosed which computes Pythagorean
triples, given one leg of the triangle.
Water management was a problem in England up until a few years ago
when the English government put into effect a group of ten regional water
authorities to replace the old local water authorities. Since then, England's
water problems have greatly decreased, and now the United States govern-
ment is looking at the English system as a possible means for alleviating water
problems in several locations in this country. David Laib writes on this
subject in his article, "Institutionalism: Benefits of Regional Water Manage-
ment." The article was written for the Technic as a Tau Beta Pi initiation
project.
What is an engineer's favorite beverage? Beer, of course! We recently
received a press release which described a legal battle between Miller and
Anheuser-Busch in which Miller charged A-B with deceptive advertising of
their "natural" products. To find out some of the less palatable additives

FORTRAN
Engin
Counselor
by Jeff Diewald
Mild-mannered engineer Murphy Finagle sighed deeply
as he picked up his computer output for the thirteenth time
that night. Somewhere, hiding deep within his assembler
program, was a logical error stubbornly refusing to reveal
itself. The crowding at NUBS was unusually light and so
it wasn't too difficult to crawl out from under his hardwon
space under a table.
From somewhere within the throng, he heard a soft
feminine voice moan. "I don't understand..." the voice
cried, "I'll never understand computers." Slipping quietly
out of the main room was a difficult task, but Murphy
finally reached the door, the hallway, and the men's John.
Dashing through the door, he jumped toward the leftmost
stall.
"Hey! This is occupied." a voice grumbled.
"Sorry!" Murphy replied as he burst into the middle
stall. Stopping only momentarily to read the graffiti, he
reached into his backpack and pulled out his trusty
HAL-10000 hand calculator. Stabbing the 'RUN' key
with a practiced index finger, a clap of thunder echoed
through the tiny bathroom and Murphy Finagle underwent
a startling transformation into Starr Fortran - Engin
Counselor!
"Damn electrical engineer," exclaimed the gruff voice
from the occupied stall, but Starr Fortran did not hear
it. Clad in his navy blue tights spangling with gold
lightning bolts and silver integral tables, our hero dashed
into the main room, only to trip on an untied shoelace.
He crashed into the line for the card reader, toppling
the unfortunate people standing there like dominoes, while
sending decks of computer cards flying through the air to
scatter into the keypunching room. Pausing only long
enough to tie his shoe and offer his apologies to the
cursing crowd, Starr Fortran punched a few buttons on his
calculator, locating the programmer in distress. Sliding
through the crowd like error statements flowing from a
typical PL/C program, our hero quickly reached the
site of mounting frustration.
"Hi - I'm Starr Fortran - Engin Counselor, and you
look like you have a problem." His deep voice rumbled
thunderously.
"So do you," she replied, staring at his shimmering
tights. "Oh well, it couldn't hurt to look at it - no one
else has been able to figure it out." Quickly he scanned
the errant output, fluidly manipulating his calculator all
the while. He hummed contentedly over the challenge.
After a few minutes, he stopped and turned to face the
confused student.
"I've fed your program into my HAL-10000. Now, with
a simpje keystroke, I will run it." A paper tape spooled out
Michigan Technic


lected on the table. The girl, now a little less frightened
by this bizarre character, stared at the roll of paper
covered with unintelligible symbols. "It's as I thought!"
he exclaimed. "Your 'READ' statement isn't getting
enough data, so your 'DO' loop just can't do it enough....'.'
"Huh?'' she replied. He pulled out his trusted gold
mechanical pencil that seemed to pulse and glow as he
scribbled across her last output. Then he began giving a
•precise explanation of all he had written. Her eyes went
from confused to interested to awed as his discourse
brought enlightenment, understanding, and inner tranquil-
ity. Then he scribbled for a few moments more, outlining
a few methods to solve her computing woes. Abruptly
Starr Fortran stopped and faced her squarely.
"Can't give you the solutions - it's the Honor Code
you know." With that, Starr Fortran - Engin Counselor
searched for a graceful way to make an impressive exit.
Finding none, he waved good-bye and promptly stumbled
over a group of assembler students who had camped out in
the terminal line. Sprawling face-first into a nearby gar-
bage can, our hero set off a chain reaction, knocking over
two tables and infuriating those who discovered their work
appropriately sliding into the heaps of waste output still
flying from the upended trash depositories. Amidst shouts
of "Jerk", "Turkey", "Damn Electrical Engineers" and
various other non-reproducible threats, Starr decided that
a hasty retreat was the safest alternative.
Back inside, a friend of the recently-aided damsel-in-
distress noted her somnolescent state.
"Hey Bonnie - who was that clumsy oaf?" The girl's
friend waved his hand in front of her still-awed eyes. "Hey
Bonnie - who was that freak?"
"That was no freak," she replied dreamily. "That was
Starr Fortran - Engin Counselor."
*»** ****
Our hero had ducked out the main entrance to avoid
being run through a keypunch, as one of the larger
'accident' victims had threatened. He rounded the corner
to make for the rear entrance, the bathroom, his knap-
sack, and anonymity when a deep, evil voice said:
"Freeze Fortran, we've got you covered!" He froze.
"All right boys - get his calculator." Hearing this, Starr
Fortran knew he was in trouble. If they took his HAL-
10000 fully-integrated, reverse Peruvian notation hand
calculator, he couldn't make the transition back to mild-
mannered Murphy Finagle - or they might unknowingly
push the right combination to transform him back,
revealing his secret identity. He turned to face his enemies,
for the sake of the Free World, Mom, apple pie, and
Chebycheff's Inequality.
"You'll have to take it from me first!" He sneered,
futilely hoping to frighten the four very large looking men.
They crowded closer, now surrounding him. "Stop - or I'll
integrate!" he shouted, waving his calculator threateningly.
They slowed, until their leader glared at each of them.
"Get him!" the largest one yelled, and they dove at him.
"I warned you." Fortran replied, as he punched the
multiply key. Instantaneously, there were three extra
images of himself. It was to no avail, as they tackled him,
still not seeing the additional images. Starr stabbed at
another key and one of the images spoke. "You've got
the wrong one!" His three tacklers and their leader looked
up in surprise.
"Alright Whiledo - you hold this one. We'll get the
others." The one called Whiledo tightened his grip on our
hero's boot Starr kicked his foot free of the thug and
jumped down into the parking lot. Whiledo let out a cry
and the other three looked up, dusting off the dirt
resulting from diving after the three phantasms.
"Fortran - Hold it!" the leader shouted after him, hold-
ing a tape recorder aloft. "We've got your girlfriend.
Now come with us or little Karen Integral buys it." Our
hero halted dead in his tracks. What rogues were these
that would threaten his beautiful confidante, ally, and
fellow computer engineer? "We've got her voice on tape -
and she has a nice little message for you. Now come over
here nice and peaceful like, with your hands in the air and
your calculator on your belt."
Fortran knew they meant business, so he struggled back
up the wall to where his enemies waited.
"Let's hear it." he said, resigned to the worst. Instead,
he heard the droning sound of someone speaking about the
existentialism of reality. "That's not Karen Integral - it -
it sounds like a..." He gasped at the fiendishness of the
trap. "...No! —You fiends! It's a philosophy lecture!" He
yawned, beginning to doze off already, his mind fading
to the monotonous blur of theories about the whyness of
where.
"Yes Starr Fortran, it's a philosophy lecture - and now
we've got you where we want you!" Our hero crumbled to
his knees, his eyelids fighting to remain open.
"No!" he murmered. "I'll resis..." His voice trailed
off as he did, and he collapsed to the ground, asleep.
**** ****
Our hero drifted back toward reality. With a start, he
realized that his hands and feet were bound. Groggily, he
opened his eyes.
"Ah - I see that you are finally awake, Fortran." Starr
looked up to see a large, balding man chuckling to himself.
The man was familiar, someone who he had worked with.
"I - I know you from somewhere." Starr Fortran dug
deeper into his memory. "You're Dr. Algol - the head of
the Computer Science people. I met you when they got
together to discuss the installation of the new computer."
The man bowed deeply, then replied with a scornful
growl.
"Yes, it is I - a humble CCS professor - who should have
been put in charge of the new computer." He sneered, and
Fortran recalled that there had been a small scandal in the
news. From the reports, Algol had started a scuffle with
Professor Cobol of CICE after Dr. Cobol had accepted
April 1979


ferred to jokingly as 'Commodore' Cobol by the staff, had
been the clear favorite after the sudden death of the pre-
vious manager, Dr. Oswit.
"Commodore Cobol has just gotten in the way, like
his predecessor, that bumbling fool Oswit. Fortunately,
I have this." He reached into the pocket of his lab coat and
pulled out a shiny metallic gun, oddly shaped, with a
twisted barrel and a ruby-like crystal at its snout.'"Look
at it Fortran - and see your demise - and that of 'Com-
modore1 Cobol as well!" He waved it threateningly.
"What is it?" our hero asked bravely.
"This is a Real-Time Raygun. I stole it from the high-
energy physics laboratory." He gloated with pride over his
sordid accomplishment. "Do you know what it's for?" He
pressed the warm, pulsing crystal at the end into the
sweating skin at Starr Fortran's throat.
"It was developed for long-range sampling and data
acquisition."
"Correct, Fortran. It can take a little bit of something
from an 'object at long distance - or," he chuckled gruesome-
ly, "sample something at short range. Would you like
me to sample your heart-wall Starr Fortran? Professor
Oswit never knew what hit him - and they all said
it was a heart attack!" Algol slapped his hand to his
knee and laughed insanely.
Fortran grimaced at the thought of this once-excellent
professor. Algol was totally unbalanced and beyond the
ethics of the Honor Code. The madman continued to laugh
until he was apoplectically violent.With a violent spasm of
choaking, the deranged professor stopped and turned to our
hero.
"And you - You will be the capstone of my master
plan." He began roaring with laughter again. "If I can't
have the Amdahl V/7, no one else can! And you're
going to help me!" He brandished the Real-Time Raygun
again. "You - Starr Fortran - Engin Counselor are going
to help me steal MTS!" His laughter grew into hysterics,
and Algol left the room cackling and shrieking.
Starr Fortran - Engin Counselor was worried. How did
he fit into this madman's insane scheme? How could he
warn 'Commodore' Cobol about the devices of Dr. Algol?
Where was his HAL-10000 hand calculator? And would
Dr. Algol untie him and allow an unfettered trip to the
men's room?
He looked around to try and locate himself. He was in
a low room filled with steam pipes and furnace equipment.
The machinery was dusty and unused, either a victim of
the University's energy austerity program, or simply for-
gotten in an effort to keep classroom temperatures be-
low 50° F. The walls, covered with dingy yellowed paint
were cracking and peeling. He could be anywhere on
campus, under any of the older buildings.
Next, our hero began a personal inventory. His HAL-
10000 hand calculator was gone. His private portable
dental floss kit was not. His trusty gold mechanical
pencil was gone. His spare wooden number-two pencil
without an eraser was not He continued down the list,
disheartened by all the little gadgets that were missing and
that might have gotten him loose. Quietly, he reconsidered
the equipment he did have.
Slowly and carefully, he fumbled with his hidden
titanium-iridium nail-file and letter opener. Within a few
minutes he had extricated it from the sheath hidden behind
the integral of cos(n7Tx)sin(m7Tx) and placed it between his
index finger and his pinkie. The air was deathly silent
except for the rough breaths of our hero.
A sharp tremor, rather like an earthquake, intruded on
the quiet and Starr Fortran jumped, launching the letter
opener into the air. It fell behind a decrepit furnace unit,
unheard under the ever-increasing din from above. Cursing
in BASIC, Starr Fortran looked at his fully multiplexed
asynchronous Chronograph and noted the time.
"From the time and the intensity of the sound," he
thought out loud, "I am probably under the Fishbowl in
Mason Hall. No wonder I didn't recognize the building."
Then, to his horror, he saw that the ancient hulk of a fur-
nace that his titanium-iridium nail-file had fallen behind
was a mass of flames. Apparently, his letter opener had
created a spark and ignited some of the oily rags scattered
about the floor. There was no time to think about the
violations to the Ann Arbor fire code as the flames licked
higher and threatened to cut off our hero's only path of
escape. Coolly Starr Fortran fumbled for the dental floss.
It wasn't as sharp as the nail-file, but eventually it would
cut through his bonds.
**** ****
Dr. Algol idly tapped the keys of the HAL-10000 hand
calculator he had taken from Starr Fortran. With his other
hand, he triggered the Real-Time Raygun again - in order
to sample another bundle of twenties from the Ann Arbor
Bank &amp; Trust across the street. He dropped the crisp
sheaf of bills onto his growing stack in the back of the van
and chuckled.
"Never thought bank robbery could be so easy, eh
Dobegin?" His twisted little crony just sat in the driver's
seat, ogling the freshman girls and laughing with Algol.
"That's quite a trick, boss - but how are you gonna
steal the computer? It's a little bit bigger than those bills."
"The whole secret is right here." The slime Algol lifted
our hero's prized calculator aloft. "As soon as I figure this
nuclear powered silicon miracle, I'll be able to set up a
distraction. Who at the Center would think that Starr
Fortran - Engin Counselor would be there to help steal
the computer? He'll cause a distraction, or a calculator-
generated replica of him will and..." Algol pressed the stud
on the strange gun and another wad of bills materialized
before him. "...and we'll have the computer!"
"Somewhere," Algol continued, "in this calculator is a
combination that nullifies gravity. All we do is walk in,
disconnect the Amdahl, and turn the calculator onto
the computer. Then you and Ifthenelse will simply pick
it up and carry it out. If anyone gets in the way - well,
we'll see if they like being sampled!" He pressed the

maliciously. "And Starr Fortran will get the blame!"
The van rocked with laughter as the evil scum Algol de-
tailed his diabolical plans for our hero and the Amdahl V/7.
"Just imagine," Algol grinned, "I'll be able to get a
terminal any time I want!" He continued tapping keys on
the calculator. "It's all in here. Fortran is finished.
I'll figure this thing out, and then, to make it even worse,
I'll sell the plans to the Japanese. Within a week, every-
one will have one at $9.95!" The ruthless master-criminals
howled with glee.
As he fingered the calculator, the display flashed three
times. Algol stopped laughing and punched a few further
sequences, but couldn't repeat the procedure. He snickered
at the thought of something affecting Starr Fortran, and
hoped it was painful. Then he ordered Dobegin to drive to
North Campus, leaving a half-emptied Ann Arbor Bank &amp;
Trust behind.
**** ****
The beads of sweat rolled from Starr's forehead. The
flames were licking at his tights, and the soot from the oily
fire was messing up his integrals. The dental floss was
tight in his fingers as he wearily tried to slice through
his bonds. He felt vaguely uneasy. Intuitively, he knew
that Dr. Algol was playing with his HAL-10000 hand
calculator. He felt further unease when he saw that there
was no escape from the fire, and the dental floss had
only begun to cut his bonds. But - our hero was not the
type of computer programmer that rolls over at the first
fatal error - and he returned to his efforts with renewed
vigor.
Our hero felt Algol hit the last key in a special sequence
before the change struck. Then a wave of nausea swept
over him.
"Have to get that key fixed," he grimaced, as he watched
his body shrink. "I hope he didn't hit a zero!" he muttered
between clenched teeth. His hands and legs slipped from
their bonds and our hero crawled into the seat of the chair.
Then Starr Fortran reached into a secret pocket that had
been unreachable and pulled out an unfolding grappling
hook. Tying it to the dental floss that now resembled
steel cord, he spun the strange combination over his head
and launched it toward an air conditioning vent above him,
praying that his mental calculations of the appropriate
launch vectors were correct.
It caught on the first try, and Starr Fortran, now a
towering fifteen centimeters tall, shinnied up the dental
floss as the fire spread below him. There was no turning
back - the rope below him was already in flames.
Sweating profusely, our hero reached the grating over
the dust-filled vent. Coughing harshly, he slid through the
narrow opening and fell face first into the dusty cavern.
Picking himself up, he grabbed the grappling hook and
ran down the metallic corridor. He knew that the effects
of his calculator would not last long, and he did not want
to revert back to his dashing six foot stature inside an
eight inch air conditioning vent.
Unfortunately, the tunnel seemed to stretch forever.
Engin Counseling was tough work, but it rarely required
marathon endurance, and soon Starr Fortran was panting
heavily. He stumbled over something in the dark and
sprawled into the dust. When he got to his feet, he dusted
off his integrals and then noticed what he had fallen over.
The huge rat noticed him as well. It bared its huge
incisors and charged. Coolly, Starr Fortran emptied another
secret compartment in his uniform - that containing his
stainless steel slide rule. Locking the slide into place, he
extended the crude sword toward the furry menace.
It was almost upon him when another wave of nausea
doubled our hero over in pain. He would soon be returning
to his normal size. Blindly, he thrust the slide rule into
the furry face of the rat. It squealed with pain and tried to
catch Starr inside its slavering jaws. Another tremor jolted
his nervous system. His only hope was to find someplace
big quickly. He turned and ran, the giant rat bounding
after him.
Fortran raced as fast as he could, plunging onward into
the dark, unknown vent. Hearing the rat getting closer,
Starr Fortran turned to look over his shoulder to see if
he would have to face the monstrous creature again.
Blood spurted over the straggly fur of the enraged
beast. It was almost on our hero, closing the space be-
tween them in long loping bounces, when the floor
fell out from under the racing Fortran. He felt himself
falling uncontrollably into a pitch black pit. Then he
bounced twice as the bent turned horizontal and shot
through another grating into a large, well-lit room. Unfor-
tunately, the vent emptied out near the ceiling, and our
small hero was in midair - a long way from the floor.
With a clap of thunder, Starr Fortran regained his
height, and sprawled onto the oily floor. He was in
another strange room, with some old steam-pipes and
pumping equipment. Starr Fortran - Engin Counselor,
struggled to his feet. There were two doors leading out, as
well as a ladder to a hatch in the ceiling.
Faintly, he heard someone shouting, but it was rather
unintelligible. It took a few moments of silence, but our
hero finally recognized it as someone yelling the Greek
alphabet. Since the sound seemed to come from above
him, Starr Fortran climbed the ladder and unbolted the
hatch cover. The latches clicked open, but something
was preventing the metallic lid from springing open.
Starr inched upward and pushed his shoulder into action.
His muscle, combined with the spring releases of the hatch,
popped the opening free.
Fresh evening air flooded into the musty hatchway, and
our hero climbed out. A sprawled and angry Dr. Diag, who
had been standing on the 'M' at the center of the Diag until
Starr Fortran had rudely caused it to send the famous Ann
Arbor orator flying, glared at our hero. He pointed defiantly
at Starr and shouted: "Alpha!...Beta!...Gamma!...Delta!..."
Confused, Starr Fortran turned away. Then he re-closed
the 'M' hatch. A still annoyed Dr. Diag approached our
8
Michigan Technic


back, and the 'man of the "M" ' paused for a moment.
"RhoL.Sigma!" Dr. Diag roared.
"Eta Kappa Nu and Tau Beta Pi!" Fortran shouted
back. Dr. Diag stopped dead in his tracks, nonplussed.
With that, our hero dashed into the night - off toward
North Campus and the evil slime Dr. Algol.
The bus stop was surrounded by its typical melange of
Ann Arbor students. The crowd was bored, still waiting for
the North Campus bus, already thirty-five minutes overdue.
A few people milled about restlessly, continually scanning
for one of the blue and silver behemoths of the streets.
Ernie Cylon, a dashing mechanical engineer late for a
North Campus kegger, never really saw the bizarre blue-
suited figure that ran into him and sent him tumbling to
the pavement What he did see was his last can of Miller
emptying onto the sidewalk. Enraged, he reached out
and grabbed the groggy figure by the neck.
"Why don't you watch where you're going? You sent
my last brew into the gutter. I've killed for less." He
dropped our hero roughly back onto the cold sidewalk.
"Wait,- don't hurt him! That's Starr Fortran - Engin
Counselor! He's helped me out before." A beautiful
black-haired girl reached down to help lift Starr to his feet.
"I'm all right," our hero rasped, as his legs gave out from
under him. "However, I've got to get to the Computing
Center."
"Why? I just came from NUBS - it's open. You can work
there."
"No - that's not it." Ernie offered his hand to help
Starr up again. This time our hero managed to remain
standing. "OK. Ernie...the rest of you..." He raised his
voice so that all could hear. A few turned to look, but
most ignored him. "Dr. Algol, an evil and insane CCS
professor is going to try to steal the new Amdahl V/7
computer tonight. I've got to stop him, but I must get
to North Campus first."
"Wanna buy my Ford?" Ernie said. "It's only $300.
I keep it over by South Quad if you want to take a look at
it." Starr looked at Ernie, then looked up the street.
"Can you take me to North Campus?"
"Sure. I've waited for this stupid bus for almost an
hour. It'll never get here." Ernie motioned toward South
Quad and they loped away. Of course, unknown to
Starr, eight buses arrived two minutes later, but that's
the North Campus bus system for you.
The blue Ford raced up Fuller Road, swerving madly
across the road in order to avoid falling into a pothole and
disappearing forever. Ernie gunned the motor and the
speedometer climbed.
"Nice car, isn't it?" Starr listened appreciatively to the
thrum of the well-tuned engine.
"Except for the caved-in driver's side, it's a beaut."
"Only $300! "Ernie offered.
"I'll think about it." Starr watched the trees blur past
the windows. How could he defeat Dr. Algol without his
Dr. Algol speeds off to North Campus
April 1979


Raygun? It seemed an insurmountable problem. A few
moments later, Ernie touched our hero's shoulder and
Starr Fortran - Engin Counselor knew that his moment
had arrived.
"There's the Computer Center. It looks like it's all
there."
"Uh - thanks Ernie. You may have just saved the compu-
ter."
"Just remember - the car is $300."
"Right. Thanks again." Fortran released the door
handle and pushed. The door remained shut. He tried
again, but the door refused to open.
"Sometimes it gets stuck. Just give it a good shove."
Starr reared back and threw his weight into the recal-
citrant door. It opened easily and Fortran tumbled to the
pavement. Dusting himself off, he closed the car door with
a slam and waved to Ernie. The Ford roared and shot
slowly off down the street.
**** ****
Like a gunslinger at high noon, Starr Fortran - Engin
Counselor strode into the work area of the Computing
Center. It was quiet, with a few souls scattered at
various tables. He waved to the girls behind the output
windows and then walked over to the terminal room.
As he walked toward the express terminal, he felt the

hairs on the back of his neck rising. Slowly he turned and
walked back into his work area.
At the far end of the room, our hero saw a duplicate of
himself, exact to the last lightning bolt. Fortran knew that
this was it - the confrontation that would decide the fate of
the Amdahl, Dr. Algol, and the Starr Fortran Engin
Counseling Service.
Terry Gelthox and Jill Farstar were comparing error
messages in their ECE 270 programs when they were
interrupted by our hero's challenge.
"All right Algol - come on out!"
"Quiet!" Terry hissed, annoyed. A few other heads
raised with angry glares at Starr Fortran. Then Dr. Algol
stepped into view.
"Fortran!!! How did you escape???"
"For cripes sake!" Terry turned to face Algol. "Will
you two please shut up? Some of us are trying to work."
"Silence, you impudent scum!" Algol hissed, raising
the Real-Time Raygun. He pressed the stud and Terry's
computer output vanished in a puff of smoke. Terry yelped
but quickly stifled any further outbursts.
"You're next Fortran. I should have destroyed you
before." The insidious Dr. Algol brought the shining
crystalline end of the gun to bear on our hero.
"Wait Algol. If you kill me now - you'll never know who
the better programmer is!" Then silence spread through the
room like a malignant cancer.
"I am the better programmer!" Algol barked tensely,
his harsh syllables ringing in the now-silent room. Every
pair of eyes focussed on the two combatants. "You are
merely an engineer. Prepare to die!"
"Are you afraid I might beat you Doctor?" taunted
our hero.
"Never!" Beads of sweat collected on Starr Fortran's
brow. He had to distract Algol somehow. And - where were
Algol's henchmen Dobegin and Ifthenelse?
"Well then - shall we have a contest to see who the better
programmer is?" Algol laughed.
"Certainly. You shall die an embarrassed fool Starr
Fortran."
"And if I win?" Fortran asked. "Will you surrender?"
Algol laughed again.
"If you win, you will die immediately. If you lose", you
may live - for a while." Our hero gulped. "The contest
shall be this: I will use the HAL-10000 hand calculator."
Algol glanced at the job screen for the Amdahl. "You
will use MTS."
At this, the girl behind the output window rolled
the steel shutters down over the input windows. "MTS
has gone down!" she shouted, not noticing the conflict
and thick tension in the room.
"I see Dobegin and Ifthenelse have done their work. The
first person who calculates the millionth decimal place of
pi will be the winner. Start whenever you're ready Fortran."
Algol chuckled evilly.
"Shall we move into the terminal room?" Fortran
asked, interrupting Algol's leisurely tapping of keys on the
10
Michigan Technic


glass encased room. Those that had been awaiting the
return of MTS quickly scattered from the terminals when
Algol motioned with the Real-Time Raygun. Starr Fortran
- Engin Counselor seated himself at the Decwriter like a
maestro at a concert piano and began typing.
"Oops! I'd better turn it on first!" he chuckled, com-
mitting a simple mistake prevalent in freshmen.
"Come Fortran - I've almost gotten my program
entered - and you haven't even had a chance to sign on yet -
even if MTS was up. You can't possibly beat me."
Algol gloated, his fingers dancing amongst the keys.
Starr Fortran just smiled and raised his fingers high, the
red 'ready' light glowing brilliantly.
Silently, he dropped his fingers to the keyboard. From
somewhere, a deep, low rumble filled the room. The fingers
started slowly and began a methodical pattern over the
Decwriter keyboard. The music rose, a slowly swelling
growl. Starr typed '$SIGNON' and the music increased,
a lone horn building in volume, centered on the terminal.
"MMM - Dawn of Man from '2001' - He's got good taste
in music!" whispered one of the onlookers, recognizing the
powerful music.
"Sounds like a 'Turns' commercial to me!" hissed
another.
Starr hit the carriage return after the '$SIGNON'. The
computer responded. Everyone in the room gasped. The
music swelled as tympanies pounded in unison with
Starr Fortran's dancing digits.
"How did you do that?" demanded Algol, totally
aghast. "Dobegin and Ifthenelse have disconnected the
Amdahl and MTS!"
"I'm Starr Fortran - Engin Counselor." The music
resounded with its second thematic climax, and the room
rocked with the sound of a hundred drums emanating
from the terminal.
Algol furiously started punching keys again. The music
began to build once more as Starr Fortran created an
entire complicated program before their very eyes. The
gold lightning bolts shimmered electrically on his torn and
soiled tights as he pounded at the keyboard, the music
thundering around them all. Starr Fortran's brilliant blue
eyes twinkled a: his challenge.
The 'Dawn of Man' music climbed to its third and final
resounding crescendo. Our hero's hands were a blur as the
paper spewed out of the terminal. The tympanies pounded
and the glass panels between the terminals and the work
area resonated and shattered. No one in the Center noticed,
everyone being clustered about the two combatants.
The last organ chord lingered and then faded. Our hero
stood to face Dr. Algol.
"The millionth decimal place.of pi is '5'!" The crowd
cheered. Starr stepped aside to show the stunned Algol the
output. However, Starr's torn tights were tangled in the
chair by the terminal and our hero tripped and fell -
directly onto Dr. Algol. Fortran snatched his HAL-10000
hand calculator and tried to reach the keyboard.
Our hero, Starr Fortran, and the evil slime Dr. Algol
rolled on the ground, locked in mortal combat. Starr
Fortran struggled for control of his hand calculator. Dr.
Algol wrestled for mastery of the Real-Time Raygun.
With a blinding flash, the gun went off and Algol and
Fortran were flung apart. The silver weapon of doom shot
into the air, turned cherry red, and disappeared.
Our hero stumbled to his feet, his calculator in hand.
Stabbing the 'Shift Right Algebraic' key, he shifted
Algol's least significant bits away. Algol shrieked, his
body disappearing from the toes up.
"I'll get you for this Starr Fortran!" the deranged
professor threatened, as his last slimy bytes rotated into
the Twilight Zone. Then he was gone. Punching the
'RECALL' key, Debegin and Ifthenelse appeared, floating
harmlessly above the keypunches. Suddenly, the police
entered the room.
"We got your call Mr. Fortran. We'll take these two in
tow."
"How did you call them?" someone in the gallery asked.
"You never left the terminal."
"My program also ran ""HELP PAR=FUZZ'." was the
simple reply. Then Starr Fortran disappeared into the
crowd, another computing crisis averted.
Mild-mannered Murphy Finagle sighed deeply as he
picked up his computer output for the thirteenth time
that night. His logical error was still hiding in the program
somewhere, and the due date had just passed. Where
was Starr Fortran - Engin Counselor when you needed him?

50 Years Ago
In keeping with this month's humorous (?) theme, what
could be more appropriate than to recount humor as was
in 1929? Back then the Technic carried a joke page in every
issue entitled Transitory Slants. Jokes were generally a
play on words, often racial or chauvinist to the point of
being unprintable today. The recent Prohibition, and al-
cohol in general, were widely used topics, particularly where
engineers were concerned.

-OR-
WHO TC INVITE
TG YGUP NEXT PAPTY
by Jeff Diewold
With study days rapidly approaching, this article is de-
signed as a guide to engineers of all types. Because study
days are also used for heavy partying, this brief description
of the various characteristics of each branch of engineers can
be used to help in planning your next wild party.
Aeronautical Engineers
These people are fun to invite to a party, even if it is
just to watch them. A fun-loving group of engineers, they
prefer to relax in their natural element. This means that
they can usually be found floating about 6" from the
ceiling.
Chemical Engineers
Of all the various types of engineers, Chem. E's enjoy
parties the most They delight in helping out a party,
especially if they can tend the bar. There they love to
create maize colored drinks that slowly change to blue.
Afterwards, they can typically be found contentedly
crashed in a corner, the results of these 'new' drinks.
Gvil Engineers
These people are always great beer drinkers. This is
because they do it all the time at home, in order to use the
cans to build pyramids, bridges, and Ann Arbor apartment
complexes. However, a close watch must be kept on these
people when the party is winding down. At that point, they
like to step outside and lay down in the roadbed, in order
to study its construction. This is extremely dangerous if
partying is done near a freeway.
Computer Engineers
Typically the most nervous at parties, these people can't
really relax unless they know there is a connection to MTS
nearby. They also become unintelligible after a few drinks,
usually lapsing into FORTRAN.
Electrical Engineers
Another poor group of partiers, the EE's like to cluster
around the stereo to debate about how many field-effect
transistors it has. They also like to keep their calculators
handy - in order to compute their tolerances to alcohol
(±10%). Also, it is easy to determine just how drunk they
are because their skin goes through the shades of the
resistor color code.
Environmental Science Engineers
Another group who are not good at parties - they tend to
16
Michigan Technic


rug. They grow distraught over the pollutants added to the
shag, to the point of incoherency. The more militant can
get violent, above and beyond drunken shouts of "Ban
fluorocarbons!" and "Nuke the Whales!"
Industrial and Operational Engineers
These people are great for keeping a party alive, because
they worry about such things as equilization of beer flow
throughout the party system. They believe in Selburn's
Axiom that says: "People to get more drunk from empty
glasses." (J. Selburn - obscure heavy partier and part-time
philosopher) Consequently, the lO&amp;E's will make sure that
everyone has a full glass, which is always useful at parties.
Materials and Metallurgical Engineers
These people are frequent partiers, preferring to bring
their own cans rather than drinking from the keg. This
enables them to test out tensile strengths, compute
approximate stress and strain curves, and experimentally
determine impact resistance for that alloy. They also save
the cans to build examples of hexagonal close packing for
their living rooms.
Mechanical Engineers
These people are the handiest people to have at a party
because they know 37 different ways to tap a keg. Because
of this inborn characteristic, they are frequent partygoers -
even though they usually end up socializing with the keg.
These two attributes also lead to an ability to soak up beer
by osmosis.
Naval Architecture and Marine Engineers
These people are great partiers, although it's difficult
to tell how drunk they are because the beer they drink acts
as ballast. Because of their studies, they know how to
maintain equilibrium under the wildest of partying condi-
tions, although a few of the heaviest partiers have been
known to "give up the ship". At that point, it becomes
impossible to remove them from the bathroom because,
after the seasickness subsides, they like to float anything in
the tub and re-live their Ship Dynamics class.
Nuclear Engineers
Of all the engineering types, these are the most unpre-
dictable. (Some say it's due to Heisenberg's Uncertainty
Principle.) Nuclear engineers act strangely under the in-
fluence of intoxicants such as beer, rum, and uranium
hexaflouride. The peaceful sort just sit there and glow
from Cerenkov radiation. The more active sorts can get
pushy and attempt to simulate atomic chain reactions with
the party guests. Under extreme circumstances, some will try
to demonstrate nuclear fusion, usually to the embarrassment
of some poor girl.

than we anticipated. Judging from the response to the
article "On the Care and Feeding of Your Pet LS&amp;A Stu-
dent" which ran last December, there are hordes of non-
engineers out there boiling over the insinuations made about
them. We admit the article was a bit raw in places and tended
to lump other non-engineers into the role of LS&amp;A, but it
was done in good, clean fun. To prove this, we are willing to
be the brunt of the joke ourselves in the rebuttal, written
by a junior in journalism (in LS&amp;A), who thinks that en-
gineers are not all they're calculated to be.
A
NIGHT
TO
FODGET
by Marjorie Bohn
Now I know my brother and I don't get along all the
time, but I never imagined he would do something as cruel as
to set me up for a date with an engineer. I'd heard stories
about this infamous breed of college students, but, as a
naive freshman, I didn't believe them.
I'd spent quite a few hours getting ready for my big date
because I wanted to make a good impression at his friend's
party. I was almost ready when I heard someone fumbling
around outside my door. I peered through the peephole in
the door to see who was out there. Standing outside my
door was, what I was later to discover, a typical enginerd.
He was intensely peering at his watch muttering "5... 4...
3 ... 2 ... 1 .... 0." Before he had finished the word
'zero', a faint buzzing sound came from the direction of his
wrist He immediately pushed a button on his watch and
knocked at my door. It was precisely 9:00. There he was:
my date. The only way to describe him is to start at the top
and work down.
He had combed his hair for the occasion, but had neglect-
ed to wash it. His eyes were brown, I think; it was difficult
to tell behind his two-inch thick glasses. His clothes reflect-
ed his personality (unfortunately). He wore a patterned shirt
that was half tucked in, and striped pants that ended four
inches above his ankles, highlighting his white socks and
hole-infested tennis shoes. He informed me that he had
abandoned the calculator that usually dangled from his
belt for the sake of formality, as well as his white plastic
pencil holder that was always armed with a wide assort-
ment of mechanical pens and pencils.
After I got over my initial shock, we proceeded to the
party (my second surprise for the night). The majority of
the crowd were, of course, engineers. They huddled in
little groups discussing physics while everyone else dis-
cussed physiology. Those that weren't included in the
small groups tended to stare into space and review their
mathematical tables. The ones that did take notice of who
entered the party usually started foaming at the mouth at
the sight of an LS&amp;A girl (or any other female for that
matter!).
Unfortunately, I was approached by one of these frothing
gawkers. His opening line was: "Hey you! Did you hear the
one about the teacher who asked the kid what he thought
about integration in public schools, and the kid said 'I'm
against it unless they've mastered differentiation first!'.
Ha Ha Ha!" I glanced at him and chuckled nervously, grab-
bing my date in order to escape an inconceivable doom.
My next mistake was to pull him out onto the dance
floor. Not only are engineers' musical tastes a decade behind
the current trends (they are just discovering hard rock and
roll), they are also typically poor dancers, and I soon dis-
covered why. Instead of staring romantically into my eyes,
I caught him reaching for a protractor, in order to insure
that our turns across the dance floor were accomplished at
just the right angle! (He said that 33.476 degrees was about
right).
After the fiasco on the dance floor we joined one of the
groups discussing physics. As soon as we sat down, one of
the engineers turned to me and asked me if I had invented
any fudge factors lately. I sadly shook my head 'no'. The
engineer shot a scandalous glare at my date and proceeded
to ignore me from that point on.
The evening went downhill from there. I began to dream
up exquisite tortures for my brother as my date and his
colleagues began reciting something they called "Oiler's"
number, to see who knew it to more decimal places. After
18
Michigan Technic


about forty or fifty digits, they both stopped to argue about
one of the numbers. I thought I'd scream when my date
pulled away from the debate to say: "Great party, isn't it!"
"I guess so ..." I replied, looking around at the room
illuminated by the glow of calculator readouts. "I guess I'm
not feeling too well." My date looked crestfallen.
"But we haven't even started organizing our mecca to
NUBS to play STAR TREK tonight!"
"I guess it will have to wait until next time." I tried my
best to look disappointed. "Can you take me home?"
"OK — but you don't know what you're missing." He
trotted off to retrieve our coats. I hated to be left alone in
the midst of the other leering engineers, but it couldn't take
him long to get our coats. At least I thought it wouldn't
take long. After a couple of minutes I started to wonder
where he had gone. Unfortunately, I had stayed in the same
place too long without him around. Another engineer, fully
accoutered with sixteen different mechanical pencils and
two calculators glided up to me.
"Heard the latest about the Unified Field Theory?" he
lisped, as he pulled his shirtsleeve across his running nose. I
looked about desperately for my date, but he was nowhere
to be seen.
"No. . . " I sighed, meekly awaiting another boring disser-
tation in abstract mathematics.
"Oh . . ." He seemed stunned, and turned away. Finally
my date returned and tossed me my coat. He explained
that he just had to clarify a derivation of the Malina-
Whitfield Hypothesis for a friend and didn't think that I
minded waiting a few extra minutes. I just pulled my coat
on and followed him to the door.
I didn't know what to expect when we reached my apart-
ment, but I was prepared for the worst. However, instead
of attacking me, like other dates have tried, he just grabbed
my hand and shook it shyly.
"Thanks for a swell date. If you ever need help in
FORTRAN, you know who to call." He let go of my hand
gently, turned, and headed for the outside door.
"Uh, . . . sure. . . " I mumbled as he disappeared out
the door.
I can't really blame engineers for acting the way they
do; as I hear, it is uncontrollable. I believe the American
Medical Association has labeled it "enginerditus" and dis-
covered it to be highly contagious. As of yet, there is no
hope of finding a cure, and quarantine in East and West
Engineering has been standard University policy. There are
several symptoms to be particularly wary of:
1. Is your best friend named "Amdahl"?
2. Do you stay up at night calculating the permutations
of a number because you don't believe the teacher's
result?
3. Do you speak fluent FORTRAN?
4. Have you memorized pi to thirty or more significant
digits?
If you answered 'yes' to any of those questions, or you
know somebody that has those qualities, then beware!
You might be the next to suffer this horrible fate.

WE
WORRY
ABOUT
ENTROPY?
by Kestutis Smalinskas
Entropy is an abstract concept which not many people
understand. We are taught that entropy, or the measure of
disorder, is always increasing even though total energy is
kept constant in the universe. Scientists and engineers know
how to calculate and use entropy in energy calculations,
but few know that the idea of entropy is not yet fully
understood and many conflicting ideas concerning the sub-
ject exist.
The most popular theory today is that of entropy always
increasing in the universe, even though total energy remains
constant. Energy is always around. But once it is used, it
is not as available as it used to be. One example is the burn-
ing of coal. We can extract energy from it. It can heat the
steam that drives our turbines which gives us work. But
there are imperfections. That is, friction and waste heat are
also produced. This raises the heat of our surroundings.
Another example is the making of batteries. We can place
magnesium and iron touching each other in a salt solution to
produce electricity. The electricity could be used to propel
slot cars around a track. The end result of the energy
would be magnesium rotting away to magnesium oxide,
heat being generated from the track, and the wearing away
of our toys. One may try to overcome this dispersion of
energy by using the electricity to form magnesium from
20
Michigan Technic


would be impurities in the magnesium oxide. In fact, there
would always be something to prevent us from getting back
to where we started.
Entropy is a measure of how bound energy is. Careful
examination of any process would reveal that energy re-
mains constant, but its boundaries get wider and entropy
goes up. If it were not for entropy, we could use our coal
and magnesium over and over again. There would be no
shortage.
Back in the 1800's, Clausius envisioned a "heat death"
when the whole universe will reach a dead level of temper-
ature. Even though the total amount of energy remains
constant, there will be no means of making it available
since there will be no difference in temperature or energy
state.
Since we may be tending toward the Heat Death, man
may try to be smart enough to refrigerate himself from the
heat. This would only raise the surrounding temperature
higher, and produce an avalanche effect of increasing
entropy. So when we die, it'll be quick! But I don't think
a Heat Death will do us in. From chemistry we know that
at higher temperatures reactions tend to be more endo-
thermic and soak up heat or give less of it off. I believe we
are at a temperature equilibrium right now, and have been
for a long time. The mean temperature will not change. We
will simply "cease to function." It will be a type of suffo-
cation where energy will fail to move about. Energy will be
infinitely dispersed.
Entropy has already begun to take its toll on Earth.
In Eurasia, sheep had grazed in the steppes for thousands
of years until the soil was exhausted. This led to the Great
Migration. One would think that there is a regenerating
biological cycle that Nature usually provides, with the sun
providing some energy. But this additional energy wasn't
enough, and entropy steadily ate away at this cycle.
But the accepted concept of entropy has not been pro-
ven yet. It is still an abstract idea conjured and not fully
understood by man. For example, entropy, as we measure
it, is negatrve in living creatures, including man. Living
things have a tendency to consume entropy. Scientists can-
not explain why. This is the flaw in the concept of entropy.
Clausius may be wrong.
The idea of man consuming entropy may not be far
fetched. For without man, buildings would not exist, iron
ore would never be turned into iron, and roads would not
exist. Man is generally considered to be an orderly creature.
This is evidenced by his books being shelved, his wood piled
neatly in the shed, and his floors swept regularly. Just the
idea of order surrounding man should give justification to
the concept of man consuming entropy. This consumption
of entropy could be a definition of Life!
There are theories which support the fact that we are
totally wrong about our concept of entropy. Einstein told
us that matter is constantly increasing in the universe. He
supports the statement by saying that the universe is bound
by what we observe. There is an end to the universe, but
this boundary is changing. The light from these distant
edges haven't reached us yet. When it does, the matter
relative to our world increases. But this may never happen,
since according to our Big Bang theory, the further away
galaxies are from us, the faster they are moving away. There
is probably a limit where the galaxies are moving away
from us so fast that the light from these distant planets will
never reach us. If matter is increasing in our universe, the
Conservation Law of matter and energy may not apply,
and all speculations of our universe, including entropy,
are off. Entropy may be kept constant by the creation of
matter. According to calculations of W.H. McCrea, steady
state entropy requires that one atom of hydrogen per gallon
of space be created once in every 500,000,000 years.
Obviously, this cannot be detected or measured by any
conceivable instrument.
Boltzmann believed that while entropy is increasing in
our part of the universe, it may be decreasing in other
places. There may come a time when entropy will start
decreasing in our world. Svante Arrhenius supports this
view by advocating the universe as steady-state because "the
entropy increases in the suns, but decreases in the nebulae."
After trying to get the whole picture of entropy, one
may have second thoughts about accepting what is taught
in school. What we are taught is what seems to work in
the world we are confined in, but there is still much doubt
and much left to be explained about entropy. Perhaps some-
day the idea of entropy will be transformed into a new,
more abstract concept. We may even name it something else
and forget all about entropy. Th«n we may understand
more about the universe we live in.

THG GMGIMCGPS
by Tom Fuja
It has recently come to the attention of this magazine
that the number and ferocity of inner-college rivalries has
increased dramatically over the last few terms. While some
amount of friendly competition between departments is
certainly unavoidable - and, to an extent, desireable -
some recent events have crossed the thin line between good,
clean fun and what might be described as civil war.
A few examples:
*When asked by a reporter from the Technic why it
was that the Electrical and Computer Engineering Depart-
ment would be the last department to move to the new
North Campus engineering site, one member of the civil
engineering faculty smirked and replied, "To tell the truth,
we don't want those turkeys up there at all."
* A-grey suited, elderly Professor of Chemical Engineer-
ing was recently 'apprehended by Campus Security spray
painting "Aerospace Engineers Do It With Pelicans" on
the side of the Aerospace Engineering Building on North
Campus.
*ln apparent retaliation, a small group of unmarked
Cessna 210's was seen "buzzing" the fall picnic of the
local branch of The American Society of Chemical En-
gineers. While the Aerospace department denied any
connection, one disgruntled chemical engineering student
immediately called a meeting of what he referred to as
"The Chemical Engineering Defense League."
The Department of Mechanical Engineering recently
announced a change in its annual Beer Crushing Contest,
amending the rules to state that all entries must be designed
"so as to crush one medium sized civil engineering student
(juniorlevel)."One contest official was overheard to remark
that "it would probably take a lot less force than a beer
can."
*lt was recently leaked by a well informed source
that the Department of Nuclear Engineering had clan-
destinely planted small pellets of plutonium in "key
locations" inside East Engineering men's rooms.
*Finally, the Department of Applied Mechanics and
Engineering Science, in a move they said was brought about
by their "second-class citizen" status, voted last Tuesday
to secede from the College of Engineering. At time of
printing, the department had claimed as their own the
bottom two floors of West Engineering, and had issued a
warning that all non-AMES students would enter the area
"at their own risk." The department chairman said that
they were currently considering a merger with The Depart-
ment of Far Eastern Languages and Literatures, in the
literary college; he would say only that the two departments
were suited to each other insomuch that both "get no
respect - no respect at all."
While the list could go on, this should suffice to make
clear the serious and immediate nature of the problem.
While the ultimate solution must come from the college
leadership, the Technic wishes to offer three possible cour-
ses of action which might ease, if not erase, the situation:
*We recommend that Dean Ragone immediately call
an Arboretum Summit, with the chairman from each
department in the college in attendance. It is hoped that
there, under the trees and the solitude of nature, they might
arrive at a compromise acceptable to all.
The various student professional organizations should
be encouraged to have speakers from other engineering
disciplines address their lunch-time meetings. This was
attempted on a somewhat limited scale two years ago and
met with some success. One electrical engineer, after
listening to a presentation by a Professor of Naval
Architecture and Marine Engineering, was heard to com-
ment, "If he didn't smell like kelp, you'd almost think he
was a double-E."
*Finally, in an avenue which offers perhaps the best
chance of success, all efforts should be made to remind
engineers of their common bond in engineering. Specifi-
cally by turning the aggression that is currently within the
college to a common, external inferior - the College
of Literature, Science and Arts is the obvious choice -
perhaps we can avert any permanent damage to the
structure of our great college.
For all our sakes, let us hope so.

23 Years Ago
Twenty-three years ago, the Tekneek was proud to have
a number of writers that the editors knew would be great
successes later in life. The articles highlighted the authors'
schooling and expressed their directions in life.
•The feature article was titled "Einstein is too Complica-
ted - Let's Change That!" and was written by Smolensk
R. Finagle, the inventor of the "HAL" series hand
calculator and clean bathroom graffiti. His article
dealt with legislation banning the Lorentz-Fitzgerald
Transformations, revising the Law of Gravity, and
eliminating the Second Law of Thermodynamics. This
legislation is currently pending before the Supreme
Court in a test of constitutionality.
•A serious look at extraterrestrial life was presented
in "Why we Shouldn't set up Pen-Pals with the
Alpha Centaurians." The author, Felgercarb P. Centon,
explained how the "high interstellar postal rates..." and
the "...extremely slow postal service on Alpha Cen-
tauri..." made the concept of pen-pals impossible,
"Even if the Centaurians had anything intelligent to
say."
•The Tekneek also presented a cultural diversion when
excerpts were presented from a play by Alexei Modelski,
the famous non-Soviet dissident. The play, based on
Modelski's work in Trivial Topology, was appropriately
entitiled "A Torus Line."
37 Years Ago
Thirty-seven years ago the Tekneek presented a couple
of radical viewpoints, one of which sparked the now-forgot-
ten "kidnapping of West Engineering" incident.
•The prime instigator of the affair that caused West
Engin to disappear for three days was an article called
"How to Build Your Own Time Warp." The paper,
enigmatically submitted by someone referred to only
as "Johnson", vigorously denied every principle of
modern physics. When the article was publicly de-
nounced as a hoax by Professor Carruthers Neutrino,
both he and West Engin vanished. Unfortunately, West
Engin reappeared 72 hours later. Professor Neutrino
didn't.
•The second revolutionary article was one entitled
"Women in Engineering - More Fun Than a Slide
Rule" written by Studley "LNX" Hysteresis. The
article demanded equal rights and equal enrollment for
women, based on the moral, ethical, and social benefits
that would result. The topic was debated rather enthusi-
astically, with an amazing number of engineers fighting
the staunch conservatism of the period.
•In a humorous vein, the Tekneek printed a story
called "The Meechigan Tekneek 37 "Years From Now"
which described the "Marvels of the Future." Amazingly,
all the silly things they predicted came true, such as the
moral decline of East Engin and the inability to
get a connection to the campus "electronic slide rule."
April 1979

All the roommates were studying to avoid certain doom.
The calculators were charged and safe in their cases
The circuits all tested and ready to race.
With Dave in his Physics, and Chopper with Aero,
I studied Graphics, all numb to the terror.
When to our annoyance there grew quite a sound
That broke our concentration, our minds to confound.
We stared out our window and to our surprise,
Saw a strange grey-haired man with eight other guys.
"On Duderstadt, on Adamson, on Wise, and on Naylor!
We'll tutor you circuits and series of Taylor.
On Karnopp and Carnahan, on Parsons and Powers .. .
We'll get you through those long study hours."
We heard his voice sing, we heard his voice shout,
And wondered who at Ypsi had let this guy out.
We stared at each other and wondered in horror;
Should we let them in when they came to the door?
"On Einstein and Newton! and on Niels Bohr!
On Da Vinci and Euler! Now open the door."
To our surprise — the professors were real.
They attacked all our doubts with zest and with zeal.
They probed and they calculated to locate our errors
With a speed and a spirit quite beyond all compares.
Faster than sound, but never faster than light,
They showed us the way to do these things right.
The grey-haired old man just sat to the side,
Watching our professors and beaming with pride.
Shortly they finished and got up to go,
Our brains overflowing with what we should know.
Before they could leave us I asked for their cause.
I questioned the old man just what his name was.
His eyes — they just twinkled, and he paused with a nod.
Then he told us impassioned, with a voice rather loud:
"For I am the Spirit and Bringer of Fire.
I am the Knowledge to raise Mankind higher.
These are my servants who, with others of their kind,
Pass onward my dreams in the hope that they'll find
A world filled with Hope, with Peace, and with Loving,
Without smoggy skies, and megaton-shoving.
Use your tools wisely and think of the children . . .
A legacy of wonder is the best you could will them.
So work for the Future and all it may bring
Never maintaining that Science is King.
For now, I may leave you, but my Spirit won't ever.
Reach for the stars. Find your own lever."
He bade us be quiet. Then they shimmered away.
But before he left us, one last thing did he say:
It came through distinctly, although the volume was low:
"Good luck on your finals, and to all four point oh!!!"

THINK VERY HIGHLY
OF US.
FOR A LOT OF
WRONG REASONS.
It might surprise you, but Hughes doesn't make aircraft. What we do has been
expressed nicely by our Chairman of the Board, Dr. Allen E. Puckett:
"We're involved in a wide range of communications technologies, making
sensors that operate on all parts of the electronic spectrum, and computers
and signal processors that issue commands or store and present data.
In the midst of the dramatic electronic information explosion, Hughes
is putting data sensing, communications and data processing
advances to work for people like you and me."
If you're an EE, ME, AE, IE, Physics, Material Science or
Computer Science major, you could become part of this
exciting and challenging commitment. You could become
involved in aerospace, ground systems, industrial electronics,
space and communications and research. And don't
worry about getting lost - at Hughes, we work in small
groups where individual initiative is valued highly.
Hughes - for all the right reasons. For details on

The Michigan Technic, pub-
lisher of this magazine, is a non-
profit organization operated by
students at the University of Michi-
gan. However, there is no other
affiliation with,or financial support
from the University.
The views or attitudes ex-
pressed do not necessarily repre-
sent the opinions of the publisher,
or the College of Engineering.
"The end of October is upon us," I think someone famous said that;
if not I take full credit. Anyway, my name is Nagihcim Cinhcet and I'll
be writing this column again this year. As you may have noticed, the
TECHNIC has changed its logo. We felt that a change was in order, not
because the magazine is any different, but because we just got tired of
the old one. Our new logo was designed by a new staff member,
Gustavo Montiel. Gustavo is a senior in engineering.
Now that I'm a sophomore (well, almost), I can extend a hearty
"Welcome back" to all of you who are returning this year, and to all the
freshman and transfer students I simply welcome you and hope you
have a nice five years here at Michigan.
There is an old saying that goes: the only sure thing in life is death
and taxes. Besides being grammatically incorrect, I feel that it is
incomplete; my updated version is: the only sure things in life are
death, taxes, and a review of the English and Metric systems of units at
the beginning of each term (and I always thought that 'dyne' meant to
eat out at a restaurant). In this spirit we present an article by Richard J.
Lemiesz entitled, 'Interplay of Units and Concepts.' Hopefully, this
article will clear the air once and for all regarding the differences
between a pound-force and a pound mass.
Remember last year, around February, when you said you were
going to write something for the Cooley writing contest, but you never
quite got around to it? We thought you would like to see what the
competition was like and so in the tradition of previous October
issues, the TECHNIC prints the first place, 1979 Cooley award winning
story, only this year the first place story is a collection of nineteen
poems by Dave Fischer.
One of the major concerns of the engineering student who is
approaching graduation is what kind of job he/she will be offered and
how fierce the competition will be within the organization that he/she
is hired by. To aid these occupation minded students, Jeff Diewald and
Mark Schumack have devised a short quiz to determine what the new
graduate's chances will be for promotion in this ever more competi-
tive world. The article is entitled, "How Un-ethical Are You?"
With the increasing incidence of DC-10 engines landing without
their planes, the public has become somewhat estranged to using the
passenger airlines, not that very many people are refusing to fly, they
are just complaining louder. In '50 and 25' this issue, Cindy Kaprielian
talks about the public's feelings about passenger planes and about
aviation in general, a subject that was very new and very much open
for criticism 50 years ago. Cindy, also a new staff member, is a senior in
Electrical engineering.

The standard block of platinum, which is kept at the
Standards Office in Westminster, London, serves as a dual
standard. The particular block represents one standard
British pound of weight and also one standard British
pound of mass. Under the normal action of gravity,
which produces an acceleration of approximately 32 feet
per second per second, a given body can not experience a
unit value of weight and possess a unit value of mass,
simultaneously. Therefore, two unit systems are commonly
employed to express a unit of mass and a unit of weight,
the absolute and gravitational unit systems, respectively.
These two unit systems utilize different amounts of mass to
represent two different standard mass bodies. A similar
situation prevails for the Metric gram and its standard,
the kilogram, at the International Bureau of Weights and
Measures, Sevres, France.
The duality of the British and Metric units of measure-
ment causes no serious problems, but there are difficulties
encountered with the presentation of the absolute and
gravitational unit systems. In addition, these unit systems
have a marked influence upon the interpretations of the
fundamental concepts of mass and weight.
Newton's Second Motion Law pertains to force in
general, and weight being merely a specific type of force
which may be called terrestrial force. If a single standard
amount of mass were to be used in both a general and a
terrestrial force system, the equations of proportionality
from the Second Motion Law may be given for each system
as F = MA and W = Mg, respectively. With the selection of
suitable term values, the constant of proportionality be-
bomes unity and is omitted from the equations.
Set the unit values for mass M to be m, and general
acceleration A to be a. The value for terrestrial acceleration
g is approximately 32 a (British) or 980 a (Metric). The
values for general force F and terrestrial force, weight W,
are:
General Force System
Terrestrial Force System
F=MA (1)
F = ma (British &amp; Metric)
W=Mg (2)
W= 32 ma (British) &amp;
980 ma (Metric)
By the use of a different standard amount of mass, M' of
1/32 m (British) or 1/980 m (Metric), a unit value for
Michigan Technic


and g remain the same, while the general force F' value is
altered.
General Force System F = M'A (3)
F= 1/32 ma (British) &lt;&amp;
1/980 ma (Metric)
Terrestrial Force System W = M'g (4)
W = ma (British &amp; Metric)
It is noted from the terrestrial force equations, Eq. (2) and
Eq: (4), that a unit value can apply to either mass or weight,
depending upon which standard body of mass is being
considered. However, as the acceleration term g is not a unit
value, the values for mass and weight, in each equation,
must be unequal.
A body, regardless of the amount of its mass, may be
involved in either a general or a terrestrial force system, and
this involvement can be expressed in any consistent system
of units. Consequently, both the general and terrestrial
force equations can be stated in either absolute or gravita-
tional units. The force systems, general and terrestrial, are
differentiated on the basis of the acceleration values, a, and
32 a British (or 980 a Metric), respectively; and the unit
systems, absolute and gravitational, are differentiated on
the mass values m, and 1/32 m British (or 1/980 m Metric),
respectively. To differentiate the unit systems on the basis
of an absolute and a gravitational unit of force implies,
innaccurately, that the unit systems are respectively res-
tricted to an absolute and a gravitational force system.
Equations 1 through 4, are set forth in the terms for three
basic quantities; force (including weight), mass, and accelera-
tion. Unit values are given only as; m for mass, a for accelera-
tion, and ma for force (or weight). With the absence of the
unit names and symbols, which are currently in use, the
distinction between mass and weight is quite apparent. Mass
is a single unit quantity for a body .of matter; M = m
(British &amp; Metric), M' = 1/32 m (British) or 1/980 m
(Metric). Weight, terrestrial force, is a multiunit quantity
for a body of matter and a motion factor; it is the product
of mass and acceleration, W' = ma (British &amp; Metric),
W = 32 ma (British) or 980 ma (Metric). Accordingly, the
word pound (or gram), when used to describe a unit of mass
and also a unit of weight, is unavoidably a misnomer for one
of the quantities.
The present unit and unit force systems, absolute and
gravitational, are not complementary and some form of
alteration becomes necessary if they are to accommodate,
in a more coherent manner, the Newtonian concepts of
force, mass, and acceleration. In the absolute unit force sys-
tem the word pound (or gram) denotes a unit of mass, and in
the gravitational unit force system the word pound (or gram)
denotes a unit of weight. However, as seen from Eq. (1) and
Eq. (4), general force F equals terrestrial force W' with each
force having a unit value of ma. It would be appropriate,
therefore, to represent both forces by a single unit expression.
For example, by naming the unit of force ma uniquely
a poundal pd, (or a dyne, dy); the unit of mass m may then
be designated solely as a pound,Ib, (or a gram, gm) in the
British (or Metric) unit system of measurement. The
values for general and terrestrial accelerations a and g are
already expressed in common units; foot, ft, (or centimeter,
cm) and second, sec. The unit general force system, Eq. (1),
uses a standard body of one pound (or one gram) of mass
which gives rise to the so-called absolute units. The unit
terrestrial force system, Eq. (4), uses a standard body of
1/32 pound (or 1/980 gram) of mass which produces the
so-called gravitational units. The force - unit systems,
formulated on these arrangements, are as follows:
General Force - absolute Unit System (G-a)
F = ma (1a)
1 poundal (pd)= 1 Ib x 1 ft/sec2 (British)
1 dyne (dy)= 1 gm x 1 cm/sec2 (Metric)
Terrestrial Force - absolute Unit System (T-a) (2a)
W= mg
32 poundals (pd)= 1 Ib x 32 ft/sec2 (British)
980 dynes (dy) = 1 gm x 980 cm/sec2 (Metric)
General Force - gravitational Unit System (G-g)
F = m'a (3a)
1/32 poundal (pd)= 1/32 Ib x 1 ft/sec2 (British)
1 /980 dyne (dy) = 1 /980 gm x 1 cm/sec2 (Metric)
Terrestrial Force - gravitational Unit System (T-g)
W = m'g (4a)
1 poundal (pd) = 1/32 Ib x 32 ft/sec2 (British)
1 dyne (dy) = 1 /980 gm x 980 cm/sec2
(Metric)
Note: The abbreviations of pd and dy are used for the
force units, poundal and dyne, to facilitate their use in
complex unit expressions; pressure, torque, etc.
On the basis of this example revision of the force — unit
systems; a British gravitational standard weight block would
weigh one poundal and would contain 1/32 of a pound of
mass, and a British absolute standard mass block would
contain one pound of mass and would weigh 32 poundals.
A similar standardization of force (weight) and mass, in
units of a dyne and a gram, respectively, would apply to
the Metric system. Thus, force may be defined, in the
British and Metric units of measurement, by four distinct
and complimentary force • unit systems; General Force -
absolute units, General Force-gravitational units, Terrestrial
Force - absolute units, and Terrestrial Force - gravitational
units.
Several comparative illustrations are drawn between the
present and revised force - unit systems to evaluate their
effectiveness in relating unit values to the concepts of force,
weight, mass and acceleration:
The usual equation for equating absolute unit force F of a
poundal or dyne to gravitational unit force F' of a pound or
gram is F = gF"; poundal = 32 ft/sec2 x 1/32 Ib, and dyne
= 980 cm/sec2 x 1/980 gm. Use of the acceleration term g,
with units of ft/sec2 or cm/sec2, is required to create con-
tinuity between what is simply two different numerical
representations of force. With the unit revision listed above,
only a numerical conversion factor is required to maintain
a consistent concept of force in both unit systems. Equating
October 1979


(British) or 1/980 m (Metric), F = 32 F' or poundal = 32 x
1/32 lb - ft/sec2 (British), and F = 980 F' or dyne = 980 x
1 /980 gm-cm/sec2 (Metric).
The gravitational unit force system, in current gravita-
tional units, does not have an appropriate unit expression for
the mass term m in the equation W = mg. The derived unit
for mass has units of length and time which do not reflect
the inert character of mass. The units of ft/sec2 and cm/sec2,
the time rate of velocity changes, are more indicative of
force, and the weight term W does not possess these units.
The slug (g-pound, etc.) does not produce a gravitational
unit of weight force and, in the revised unit system, it is
regarded as being an absolute unit of mass. Gravitational
unit force system; m = W/g = 1 lb * 32 ft/sec2 (British ? of
mass), and 1 gm ■*" 980cm/sec2 (Metric ? of mass). Revised
force - unit system (T-g British and Metric Units); m' = W'/g
= 1 lb-ft/sec2-^32 ft/sec2 = 1/32 lb (British pound of mass),
and 1 gm-cm/sec2 ■¥ 980 cm/sec2 = 1/980 gm (Metric
gram of mass).
Often a body is simply described as being so many
pounds (or grams) and, in the present unit force systems,
it is implied that the body has that many pounds (or grams)
of mass in the absolute unit force system, and also the same
number of pounds (or grams) of weight in the gravitational
unit force system. This use of the same numerical value and
unit for the mass and weight values of a given body, fosters
the false impression that mass and weight are substantively
the same physical attribute of matter. The fact that the
body is being defined by a single terse phrase of "a body of
X lb (or X gm)"; but, in two different unit systems and by
two different standard amounts of mass, is often ignored.
Much of the misunderstanding of the concepts of mass
and weight can be ascribed to the intermixture of two
different unit force systems with their common, but con-
flicting.use of the unit pound or the unit gram. Numerous
statements are made which contain confusing intermixtures
of units from different unit systems, one representative
statement is as follows:
"If a gram mass falls freely, the earth pulls on it with
an unbalanced force of one gram (gram weight), and
its acceleration is 980cm/sec2 approximately."
In the revised force — unit systems, this statement may be
restated to read:
"If 1/980 of a gram of mass falls freely, the earth pulls
on it with an unbalanced force of one dyne (1
gm-cm/sec2 weight), and its acceleration is 980
cm/sec2 approximately." (T-g Metric)
"If a one gram mass falls freely, the earth pulls on it
with an unbalanced force of 980dynes (980 gm-cm/sec2
weight), and its acceleration is 980 cm/sec2 approxi-
mately." (T-a Metric)
Note: Precise values of acceleration g, for specified reference
positions, have not been used in these statements and
throughout the paper to simplify numerical expressions and
to present a generalized analysis.

Page Flames
Page after streaming page
disembarking upon oceans
of steam.
Swirls atop this late night
cup of tea.
Bundles of tattered pages
strewn about, while columns of numbers
rage endless across sight.
The thin delicate notebook sheets
stacked in corners:
lines intertwining, in overlapping
meaningless combinations —
they are silent now
with six o'clock light
easing into the vacant room.
For moments, after stepping from dreams,
the meaning is gone
it left awhile ago. Leaving clear unmarked
bond, soft to touch
and coarse blank newsprint
for papering the floor.
As day proceeds
again the numbers flick and pop
again poems hiss and sing, jumbled,
once again the sun prepares for
the dousing of paper fires.

Eating our dinner
here on the six-o-clock news
pictures of people
stomaching up to the ground
looking in desperation
for an opening.
Jones Song II.
There is a whispering of Jimmy Jones
that hush has turned now to jokes:
pruning back the claws
to laugh and howl at the creature.
Paint it over with newjweek photographs and
drag krishna into the joke —
just when everyone is bent over
with comedy
the joke is covered in white.
So the shock waves hit in giggles
and whispered koolaid gags
all turn a head and suck in air
but never peer
beneath the tabernacle cloth
in disgust.
Instead
laughter until pain.
Jones Song III.
I've sat in a stare for twenty years
gazing at this plastic trickle
that feeds the tumor-us all.
Growing larger with each inhalation
each contracting shiver
opens a new crack
where the ooze dribbles out.
Leaving pain and silence
sprinkled about; patterns with nine hundred.
The week worth of hundreds
that bowed their heads at the trickle
a stream beneath by chair.
They peeled back their eyelids
in a scream, in a laugh.
I kicked them all away-to haul
their bone loose bodies away.
They attacked the tumor
it welcomed them in
feeding the rag clothed begger
sleeping under a wet disintegrated newspaper.
So they lay strewn about
like wind blown piles of leaves.
Death like paint covering the lawn.
Still the growth enlarges
it grows legs and stretches them apart
whispering - "come in and join"
Then the power generator ran out of fuel
the lights dimmed and slammed the night in.
The silence was now a heavy stench.

Pills prop up my spindle legs,

Dragged up once again
and placed between some legs:
"it's warm, another has to live!"
They have built another machine
worked so hard so long.
Split us right up the seam
leaving our backbone broke
eyes turned earthward mud filling the lungs.
A cancer mound piles up
in irritation
the wound is scratched and kept bleeding
blood collected in a basket with a handle
and burned
trailing a rust plated smoke

Toward paper cups
freezing with a screeching howl.
Still a beet faced man declares:
if there is muscle
we must find ways to loosen it.
Bullets have worked well.
Hobble or die

I'm dragged off
into a room filled with plants
where in my age
I dare now swallow

Haze suspended from my eyes.
Old age suicide
the national tide and lies
a measured mix
of shed tears
for our hopeless deadend disappearing
vapor trail.
Wondering Why We Drag
It was Sunday morning —
frozen blue grass with clover
and taut dead leaves.
The shadows filled
with crystal patches
crawling off with the sun.
We rolled the brown dead leaves
up into tunnels.
Screaming off on bikes
side to side, swaying wheels spinning.

I can tell you with a curving spoon
outlining the crystal sugar fallen
from a doughnut. Coffee turning cold: your bored face.
Each day more wine escapes my trembling lips.
As I stare off into a video projection
some piece of me gone and discolored.
I'm wondering why I drag these dusty old books
from town to town. Long ago I lost that piece of clover
that two pages hold.
Spookey ( a cat )

both of us

The Arboretum Field
I found space in a huge
empty field
attended on occasion; while
staring at piled up numbers
tangent fifteen second.
In celluloid
trips out into the nerves
of air frozen cold:
footage of space
and ships hitting a wave.
In dreams falling
with string trailing off,
flying a kite in that endless field.
I found empty snow
without lines
or dog tracks
Concluded I'm lost
the power of twice ten
a line of ink
expanding into
bands of grey
that themselves grow
until there is fog
trees quietly bow off.
As I stand
my breath a freeze
the dark
empty night sitting open
like the yaw of a smoke stack
seen
from my perch:
strapped on the bottom
of a rising cinder.
Reflection
Christmas trees
dead shoe stuck leaves.
That a mirror holds.
And cats
that grow: ear torn
blood on side
somehow age and die.
The frame so lawful

All time would be caught
not just dressing and comb
if a mirror was the sky
the frame our death and birth.

Last year, we gave our engineers
$439 million to do the kind of re-
search and development in high
technology that make our company
tick. And that makes us the sixth
largest supporter of technological
research in the United States.
In the next five years, our com-
mitment to research will total more
than $2.5 billion.
That's why we're looking for
engineers who look to the future.
Men and women who want to
be a part of the new work being
done in fields ranging from gas
turbines to microprocessors, wind
energy to laser beams.
All of our operating companies
and 39 of their divisions have their
own engineering and development
staff.
And at the United Technologies
Research Center, 1000 people work
on all forms of basic and applied
research.
So, if you want to help us spend
over a million dollars a day just take

Did you ever wonder how your boss, and those people
above him or her, got to those positions of power, despite
their incompetence? Well, it's highly probable that Un-Ethics
was their secret!!! Now, we are giving you your chance to
discover how Unethical you are! Read the following des-
criptions of various practical business situations and circle
the answer that describes best what your reaction would be.
At the end, tally up your score and refer to the scoring
guide to see how well you did. Remember, cheating is not
allowed.
1) A colleague of yours has recently developed a riveting
machine, and the design has drawn high praise from
upper-level management. However, by some mistake, the
praise has been directed toward you. Your reaction is to:
a) Humbly accept the praise and offer your colleague
a thousand dollars to keep his mouth shut. (5 points)
b) Accept the praise and tell your colleague that you
will blow up his brand-new BMW if he speaks out
about the misunderstanding. (10 points)
c) Accept the praise, tell your colleague that you will
stuff his face into the new machine if he says any-
thing, and then submit a ten-page paper to your
superiors on how you think that this particular
colleague is incompetent and should be fired. (15
points)
2) A rival company desires to know a production secret
that keeps your company ahead in sales. They offer you
the car of your choice, an indoor swimming pool, and a
paid vacation to anywhere in the world if you tell them
what they want to know. You:
a) Immediately accept their offer.(5 points)
b) Tell your rivals that you will accept the offer if
they throw in a complete home video recording
system. (10 points)
c) Accept the offer and collect the gifts, but give
them the wrong secret. (15 points)
3) You design a food-processor for an appliance company
and, after several months on the market, a little girl
loses her foot while using it. Your boss tells you that
the company is being sued and that your job is in
jeopardy. You:
a) Offer to design a mechanical foot for the unfor-
tunate girl. (0 points)
b) Declare that anybody who is stupid enough to
put their foot in a food processor deserves to have
it chopped off. (5 points)

YEARS AGO
by Cindy Kaprielian
50 Years Ago
One would have had a hard time bringing the
engineering students of 50 years ago back to earth.
Their main concern was up in the clouds with the new
flying machines. Almost the entire October 1929
"Technic" was devoted to this new technology. The
Dornier Plane, one of the first passenger planes, was
introduced in this issue. The more radical engineering
students were trying to get people to accept the idea
of passenger planes. The membership of the Univer-
sity of Michigan Aeronautics Club was soaring and
members were winning many contests with their
gliders. Even the Architecture College, then part of
the Engineering College, was getting into the action
with work in airport design.
The largest of the newly introduced passenger
planes was the Dornier Do-X, with a capacity for 100
passengers in addition to the crew. Previously, the
number of engines on a plane was limited to three or
four, but the Dornier was forced to use 12 engines to
sustain the load of 100 passengers. The 12 engines
were rigidly mounted to the upper wing, each engine
generating 525 hp to drive their four bladed pro-
pellors made of a special aluminum alloy. The plane
was one of the most efficiently streamlined ever con-
structed up to that time.
There were three decks within the fuselage. The top
deck was occupied by the navigating crew and the two
pilots needed to navigate this great ship. The middle
deck was occupied by passengers. The general form of
this deck was similar to that of the Pullman coaches.
With a push of a button, the passenger could summon
a waiter and order a meal of the utmost excellency in
food and perfection of service. Those were the days!
On the bottom deck, the supply tanks were stored,
with enough fuel for a flight of 1000 miles. The Dornier
plane was considered an aeronautical success, for it
cast aside the words of the Doubting Thomases that it
was an impossibility to build a plane of such enormous
capacity.
The introduction of the new passenger planes, like
all new technology, was met by a wary public. Dis-
approval was caused by misinformed and 'sensation-
man' newspapers which constantly presented to the
public misleading statements regarding the causes of
aeroplane accidents, giving these news items undue
prominence. On the other hand, engineering stu-
dents and aeronautical advocates felt that the public
was not keeping an open mind about the aviation
industry. So our engineering students dug up the 1928
report by the Department of Commerce on accidents
and found that the greater percentage of accidents
were due to the carelessness and inability of the pilots.
Structural and engine failures caused only a very small
percentage of the accidents: apparently it was a low
year for engines falling off planes. The conclusion of
this report was that in considering the miles traveled in

means of transportation than the automobile.
Membership of the Aeronautical Society increased
from 12 members in 1928 to 125 members in 1929.
Members of this lively campus organization were
issued the first Glider Pilot licences by the National
Glider Association. They practiced their gliding skills
by the automobile towing method, which was devel-
oped on this campus by Professor R. E. Franklin. The
students evidently mastered their skills, for they won
prizes at the First National Glider Meet in Cleveland in
August 1929, in spite of being handicapped by the
necessity of flying strange gliders, since theirs crashed
on the first day. First prize in this competition, which
brought considerable fame to Michigan, was won by
Wallace Franklin for the most impressive glider per-
formance. He was towed for 200 miles behind an
airship and proceeded to land his glider in front of the
grandstand. Robert Evans, also from Michigan, won
second prize for the same event.
Architects were just beginning to cash in on this
new airplane transportation. Progressive businessmen
were seeing the need for better landing fields and
more beautiful airports, because the passenger re-
ceived his first and strongest impression of the city
from the airport. Should it consist of formless sheds
and mired runways, it couldn't be expected to inspire
him with the due appreciation of the community
beyond. The following basic principles were pro-
posed for planning an airport. One principle was to
give careful consideration to the preparation of the
fields and runways to insure safety in the operation of
the aircraft. The grounds had to be thoroughly drained
to maintain a firm and solid soil formation during the
wet seasons. Another important principle was the
grouping of buildings. This principle illustrates the
grandiose airport the architects had in mind. It was
advisable, 'to locate the group of public buildings
(passenger terminal, administration building, ticket
booths, waiting rooms, customs and post offices,
hospital, restaurant, and hotel) slightly behind the
hangars, so that the controllers would have an unob-
structed view of the whole field.' Another reason for
locating the public buildings here was to keep the
nervous passenger awaiting his plane, from inspecting
the repair shops, training schools and hangars, where
he would find evidence of accidents, thereby aug-
menting his uneasiness. By employing these prin-
ciples, the airport could play an important role in the
encouragement of aviation, for, as the old adage
states, "build the bird house and the birds will come."

25 Years Ago
When the new school year rolls around, various
clubs on campus make their presence known and try
to recruit new members. The October 1954 "Technic"
did a spread entitled "Activities for Sale," on the
activities going on within the College of Engineering.
Some of the organizations are defunct, but most are
still flourishing. One of the organizations still going
strong is the ever-popular "Michigan Technic." New
students were needed for staff and were enticed by an
annual steak dinner (this practice has mysteriously
discontinued but will be revived immediately). In
their own article of introduction, they claimed that
the "Technic" was the oldest engineering college
magazine in America with the first issue printed in
March 1879. So folks, you heard it here first, it's
"Technic"'s unicentennial year. Let's hear it for the
"Technic"—and here's hoping for a hundred more
big ones.
Another persuasive article appeared for the engi-
neering field itself. The bait was financial security. A
tudy was done on the economic status of the Illinois
Institute of Technology grads, tracing back to classes
before the stock market crash. In 1929, before the
crash, engineering students were earning beginning
salaries of such lucrative sums of $115/month. After
the 'Black Friday' fiasco, the average beginning salary
was less than $100/month. In the 1930's things were
improving, but beginning salaries still hadn't made it
to pre-Black Friday standards. Duringthe40'swiththe
October 1979
25


1954, salaries were at a record high of $363/month
($4356/year). This income put engineers in rank with
doctors, dentists and lawyers in the upper income
bracket.
If money wasn't cause enough to stay in the
engineerng school, then possibly the threat of Russia
graduating more engineers than the United States
was. This finding came from a two year study done by
Mr. Trytten, in conjunction with the Russian Research
Institute at Harvard. The number of Russian engineer-
ing graduates in 1954 was 50,000 while the U.S. in 1954
had a mere 19,000. The cause for such a large flux of
Russian engineers was the Soviet's early emphasis on
science and math for all students in secondary school.
Trytten warned that local control of education, which
may have been the greatest strength in the past, may
become a source of weakness in the future, unless
greater awareness of the importance of education was
developed at the local level.
Nuclear engineers were doing their own promotion
work by trying to sell their ideas for peaceful applica-
tions of nuclear power. During this year, the Univer-
sity ot Michigan hosted the First International Nuclear
(ngineering Congress. This was the first attempt to
:ake what harl been learned about nuclear technology
out ot the wraps of secrecy and into the forum. It w.is
the s'.i" toward free exchange of ideas &gt;\nd discov-
eries necessary for widespread industrial application
of nuclear energy. The concensus of the Congress was
that the progress of professional development in
nuclear power would be determined by the degree of
control by the government security policy. This in-
deed has limited the growth of nuclear power, but
there have been other obstacles which the engineer-
ing class of '54 could not possibly have foreseen, such
as multiple human and mechanical errors in reactor
operation, bubbles, China Syndrome, etc.
Ground was broken on North Campus for the
Memorial-Phoenix Project, U of M's own nuclear
reactor. It was then potentially the most powerful
reactor yet built in the United States, outside of the
Atomic Energy Commission's facilities. The research
reactor was build with a $1,000,000 grant from Ford
Motor Company Fund. The core of Uranium 235 was
to be kept below 20 feet of water. Water was chosen so
that the core could be observed from above, it would
successfully maintain the chain reaction, and it was a
good coolant. The maximum power level of the
reactor was designed for 1000 kw, but operation
would be considerably lower. The reactor would be
located in a reinforced concrete building. The pur-
pose of the reactor was research for industry and
government on a contract basis. The plans were
turned in for design to the infamous Babcock &amp;
Wilcox Company.

Verily I say unto you, marry not an engineer; for the engineer is
a strange being possessed by many devices; yea, he speaketh in
parables which he calleth formulae, and he wieldeth a big stick
which he calleth a slide rule; he hath but one Bible — a hand-
book.
He talketh away of stresses and strains and of no end of
thermodynamics; he showeth always a serious aspect and
seemeth not to know how to smile; and he picketh his seat on the
car by the number of springs therein and not by the damsel
thereon. Neither does he know a waterfall except for its power,
nor the sunset but for its specific heat.
Always he carrieth books with him, and he entertaineth his
maiden with steam tables. Verily, though the damsel expecteth
chocolates, when he calleth, he opens the package to reveal
samples of a new alloy.
Yea, he holdeth a damsel's hand, but only to measure the
friction, and he kisseth only to test viscosity. For in his eye shineth
a faraway look which is neither love nor longing, but a vain
attempt to remember an equation.
Even as a little boy, he pulleth a girl's hair, but to test its
elasticity, and as a man he discovereth different devices, for he
would hold a maiden to his bosom only to count the palpitations
of her heart, and to reckon the strength of her materials.
Alas! his marriage is a simultaneous equation, involving two
unknowns and yielding a periodic function.

the electronics revolution,
The electric car you see here is one of a pair of
experimental vehicles GE is developing for the De-
partment of Energy.
With a projected range of 100 miles at a con-
stant 45 mph, it's so much better than previous
models that there's hardly any comparison.
What's made this Dig difference is elec-
tronics. A GE-designed microcomputer manages
energy flow throughout the propulsion system, regu-
lating power demand to extend the car's range.
The power-conditioning
unit contains another major GE in-
novation: special high-powered
transistors.
They're the world's most
efficient high-powered transistors,
capable of switching 400 volts and
350 amps on or off in less than a mil-
lionth of a second. Yet the silicon
chip that contains them is less than half the size of a
postage stamp!
The high-powered transistors have three
important functions.
They regulate the speed, torque and accelera-
tion of the car's DC motor.
Their high-frequency characteristics also
make them ideal as components for the car's over-
night charging system.
Finally, me transistors play a big role in the
car's regenerative braking system. They help change
the motor automatically into a generator, supplying
braking power to the wheels and producing current
to partially recharge the batteries.
What's coming down the road after this
advanced vehicle? GE engineers are developing one
that's even more advanced. It's a hybrid that will
bum far less fuel than an all-petroleum-powered car
and have even greater range and power than the
all-electric. It too will feature microelectronic con-
trols...but of even greater sophistication.
Looking for new and practical solutions to
transportation problems is just one example of
research in progress at GE. We're constantly inves-
tigating new technologies, new materials and in-
novative applications for existing technologies — in
such areas as energy sources, motors and drives,
aerospace systems.
This takes talent —engineering talent —not
just in research and development, but in design and
manufacturing, application and sales.

ing opportunities at GE, send for our careers

This month's technical feature was written by Mark
Drutowski, and is entitled, "Deep Image White Light
Holography." Mark discusses a method of holography that does
not require coherent light for illumination. Also, he includes a
section describing a method, developed at the University of
Michigan, of improving the image sharpness of a white light
hologram. This paper was written for Humanities 498: Scientific
and Technical Communication, and was adapted for
publication.
We've added two new features this issue, the first is a fiction
column in which we print (you guessed it) fiction. This column is
meant to encourage writing and to give the scope of the maga-
zine a little more variety. So, if you have the urge, write a story
and submit it for publication, after all, how do you think
Hemingway got started? Anyway, this month's fiction won a
second place award in the 1978 Cooley Essay contest. The title is,
"The Time Will Come" and it was written by John Kurtz.
The second of the two new features is a column we call R&amp;D
Update. It is designed to answer the question, "What do
engineers do?" The column is a collection of brief articles des-
cribing new developments (the ones that they're willing to talk
about anyway) in the Engineering community by industrial and
university research facilities.
On the lighter side (all this talk of coherency, serious writing
and working after graduation has got me a little woozy), the
madcap Jeff Diewald returns once again, with two articles that
hopefully will enable you to laugh for a while, even though the
%$&amp;*!#@&lt;j:$# program won't run.
The first is entitled, "The Magic User's Guide to MTS or A Few
Little Known Functions." For information on this article try,

The second article, "The Technic's Assembler Language, VOL
II" is a continuation of VOL I, which was printed in the October
issue of 1978. If you don't find these new commands
exceedingly humorous, all I can say to you is: CCD, BTD, and
RCC. Jeff is a senior in Electrical and Computer Engineering.
Last, but not least, in 50 &amp; 25, Cindy Kaprielian discusses the
construction of new buildings on campus, specifically a new
home for Architecture students, also the question of statehood
for Alaska, and opportunities for Engineers (not drafted) during
the Korean war. Cindy is a senior in Electrical Engineering.

I. INTRODUCTION
In conventional holography, the coherent light
from a laser source (one wavelength), is split into two
beams. One beam is used to illuminate the object. The
unobstructed reference beam combines with the light
reflected off the object, forming a complex inter-
ference pattern at a photographic plate. The devel-
oped plate is the hologram.
When the developed plate or hologram is illu-
minated with coherent illumination, the light is
selectively transmitted or absorbed by the photo-
graphic emulsion so as to create an emerging beam.
This beam exactly duplicates the original light waves
that were reflected from the object when the holo-
gram was made. "An observer receiving these waves
will perceive them as emanating from the original
object; he will see the object as if it was actually
there." (Ref. 4)
A white-light hologram is made using as an object
the real image from a first, or primary hologram. A slit
is placed at the primary hologram and a secondary, or
white-light hologram is recorded. The resulting
white-light hologram can produce an image under
white light illumination.
II. HOLOGRAPHY
The most commonly used form of holography is the
off-axis reference beam method introduced by
Emmett N. Leith and Juris Upatnieks of The University
of Michigan. The following discussion of holography

is a paraphrase of their article, "Photography by
Laser", by E. N. Leith and J. Upatnieks; Scientific
American, June 1965.
"Holography, which can be called photography by
wave-front reconstruction, does not record an image
of the object being photographed, but rather records
the reflected light waves themselves." The photo-
graphic record, a combination of lines, swirls, and
dots, is called a hologram. It contains all the informa-
tion about the object in a complex optical code.
In viewing the hologram (reconstruction process),
an incident coherent light beam is transformed by the
emulsion on the holographic record so as to create an
emerging beam. If the eye intercepts this emerging
beam, it will perceive it as emanating from the original
object, even though the object has long since been
removed.
First, consider the case of a collimated or plane
wave (Fig. 1). The wave fronts or crests are successive
planes perpendicular to the direction of the beams.
Now consider the point scatterer in Figure 2 which
Fig. 1. Plane waves.
Fig. 2. Reflected waves.
LIGHT WAVES ARE REFLECTED from a point scatterer ((op) in a
series of ever expanding spherical shells, called wave fronts, that are
concentric about the point of origin. If the reflecting object is com-
plex (bottom), it can then be regarded as a collection of a large
number of points, and the resulting wave pattern reflected from the
surface of the object can be regarded as the sum of many such sets
of spherical waves, each set concentric about its point of origin. The
central problem of wave-front reconstruction photography is to
record this pattern as it exists at a given plane at some instant of time.

point but a complex object, it can be regarded as a
collection of a large number of points. The resulting
wave pattern reflected from the surface of the object
can be regarded as the sum of many such sets of
spherical waves, each set concentric about its point of
origin.
Ordinary photographic plates are used to record
the amplitude portion of the reflected wave by con-
verting it to variations in the opacity of the photo-
graphic emulsion. However, the emulsion is insensi-

live to the phase of the reflected wave. A standard way
of converting phase relations into corresponding
amplitude variations, which can be recorded on a
photographic plate, is through the technique of inter-
ferometry.
Now consider the case where a reflected object
wave interfers with this obliquely impinging.plane
wave (reference beam) at the screen (Fig. 4). "At some
places on the screen the waves will arrive in phase
[coinciding wave crests] and their amplitudes will add
to produce a resultant light intensity greater than
would be produced by either wave acting alone. This
process is called constructive interference (Fig. 5) and
is responsible for the light interference fringes in the
interference at the screen.
Consider the case where a plane wave is obliquely
intersected by a screen. The resulting wave pattern at
the screen is described by a variation from crest to
trough and so on (Figure. 3). This obliquely impinging
plane wave is often called a reference beam.
Fig. 4. Interference of reflected object wave and
obliquely impinging plane wave at the screen.
Fig. 5. Interference.
TWO KINDS OF INTERFERENCE of light waves are depicted. If two
light waves of diffrent amplitudes arrive at the recording surface in
phase ((op), their amplitudes will add to produce a resultant light
intensity (colored curve at top) greater than would be produced by
either wave acting alone. This process is called constructive inter-
ference and is responsible for the light fringes in the interference
pattern. If the light waves arrive out of phase (bottom), their ampli-
tudes will tend to cancel one another. This process is called destruc-
tive interference and is responsible for the dark fringes in the inter-
fernce pattern.
The phase or the relative position of the wave crests
is now an amplitude variation which can be recorded
by an ordinary photographic plate. To demonstrate
that the phase is indeed represented by an amplitude
variation across the screen, we can interfere this
"recorded phase signal" with the reference beam

once again. The resulting interference pattern will
have the same phase relation as the original as the
reflected object wave (Fig. 6).
"Both the amplitude and the phase of the reflected
object waves can be preserved respectively as
modulations in the contrast and spacing of the
recorded interference fringes. All the information
that can be carried by the light waves reflected from
the object can be recorded [by the emulsion] as an
interference pattern produced by making these waves
interfere with an obliquely impinging plane wave."

object beam) a visible display of the wave pattern of

image appears to be behind the hologram. The real
image cannot be seen directly with the eye. However,
it can be viewed by placing a screen at the position of
the image.

White-light holograms are made in two steps. The
first step requires a first or primary hologram to be
made in the conventional way (Fig. 8). In the second
step, a secondary or white-light hologram is made
using as its object the real image of the primary
hologram and the slit opening itself (Fig. 9).

The viewing or reconstruction process of the white-

an image of the slit (Fig. 10), when illuminated with
coherent light. The observer must place his eyes at the
image of the slit to see the object. At positions above
and below the image of the slit, the object image
cannot be seen.

The grating structure on the white-light hologram will
diffract the light in a way analagous to how a prism
refracts white light illumination into a rainbow. The
result would be two vertically displaced slit images (on
the slit image plane), one for each wavelength or color
(Fig. 11).

Fig. 11. White-light hologram illuminated with

Positioning the eyes at one slit image would
produce the object image in one color. Looking
through the other slit image would result in an object
image of the other color.
Now consider the case where the white-light holo-
gram is illuminated with a continuous variation of
wavelengths or white light illumination. The slit image
would be smeared into a continuous spectrum on the
slit image plane. "To view the white-light hologram,
the observer may position his eyes at any point on the
spectrum; wherever he positions them he will see the
image sharp and clear in the color corresponding to
that part of the spectrum. As he moves his head
vertically the perceived image changes color but
remains sharp and clear. If his head is not in the image
plane of the slit [but further back], he will see the
entire image, but the color will change from top to
bottom. Accordingly, such holograms have some-
times been called rainbow holograms.
Each point on the primary hologram reproduces the
entire image, but from only one viewpoint. Therefore,
the horizontal slit eliminates all parallax in the vertical
direction for the white-light hologram. We lost
vertical parallax but gained the ability to view the
rainbow hologram with white light illumination. The
loss of vertical parallax is unimportant since the
observer normally moves his head horizontally. Also,
the white-light hologram image is extremely bright
since all of the white light is utilized rather than just a
narrow part of the spectrum (one wave-length for
conventional holograms).
In the Electro-Optics Laboratory at The University
of Michigan we developed a technique which enables
white-light holograms to form images having
improved sharpness and low speckle. Improved
image sharpness and low speckle is advantageous in
all white-light hologram applications.
IV. APPLICATIONS OF WHITE-LIGHT
HOLOGRAMS
The areas of white-light holography that appear the
most promising are holographic displays and holo-
graphic interferometry.
Displays
The reduction in the coherence requirement, or
the advantage of viewing holograms with conven-
tional light sources, makes it possible to have holo-
graphic displays. A recent development in holo-
graphic displays is the Lloyd Cross or multiplex holo-
gram. A multiplex hologram can record the motion of
an object as well as its three-dimensional character-
istics.
"In the method devised by Cross, the object is
placed on a slowly revolving platform and is photo-
graphed with a stationary movie camera which takes
hundreds of pictures." (Ref. 4) The resulting pictures
constitute many views of the object. Recall that some
motion of the object is permissible, thus making it
possible to use a live subject as the object.
In the formation stage each picture is made into a
narrow, vertical, white-light hologram. Each suc-
cessive picture is made into a similar hologram
positioned adjacent and touching the one before it.
The resulting composite white-light hologram is
then wrapped into an arc corresponding to the angle
of rotation of the object. When illuminated with white
light, each component white-light hologram projects
a virtual image without three-dimensional character-
istics (due to the narrowness of the component white-
light hologram). "When viewing the multiplex holo-
gram, each eye looks at an object image through
different corpponent white-light holograms (Fig. 12).

opportunity in terms of
career development7
— David A. Dindinger BS, Chemical Engineering
&lt;tt
"I interviewed companies
on campus and off. About
10 big companies in all. And 1
felt Du Pont offered me the
most opportunity in terms of
career development, outstand-
ing benefits and, best of all, the
chance to do some traveling.
"I've been getting
around a lot since I joined the
Company in 1973 out of the
University of Illinois-Chicago. As
a quality assurance engineer in
the Engineering Department, I
inspected equipment vendors
fabricated for Du Pont. I worked
in 10 states in the U.S. and four
states in Mexico. My job now is
reviewing equipment specs and
writing procedures for our
inspectors. It's been a good learn-
ing and growing experience."
Dave's story is typical of
many Chemical, Mechanical
and Electrical Engineers who've
chosen careers at Du Pont.
We place no limits on
the progress our engineers can
make. And we place no limits
on the contributions they can
make—to themselves, the
Company or to society.

kind of company, talk to the

in a stereoscopic viewer, and consequently a three-
dimensional image is perceived." (Ref. 4)
As the observer moves his head laterally, the motion
of the object (previously recorded by the movie
camera and now recorded on the multiplex holo-
gram) can be seen. The complete sequence of motion
can be perceived if the observer walks past the
multiplex hologram.
The multiplex hologram is not dependent on highly
coherent illumination in the initial photographic
process or in the final viewing process. The use of high
powered lasers to illuminate the live subject or view
the multiplex hologram would be inconvenient,
expensive, and hazardous. The middle formation
stage uses a small laser to convert the individual
pictures into narrow, white-light holograms.
The resulting multiplex hologram can be viewed
with conventional light sources. It is a low cost, eye
catching display for use in commercial applications.
Holographic Interferometry
Holographic interferometry is the determination of
very small linear displacements using interference
techniques.
Holographic interferometry can be used to study
periodically vibrating membranes; for example, a
membrane stretched across a loudspeaker. In this
example a speaker was driven by a sinusoidal signal or
pure tone of 1350 Hz. (cycles/sec). (Ref. 5) The mem-
brane is illuminated with a coherent light source. The
reflected beam (off the membrane) combines with a
reference beam to form an interference pattern at the
photographic plate (Fig. 13). The developed plate or
hologram is a recording of the membrane at each end
of its swing. (Ref. 1)
In the viewing process, the hologram image

resembles a contour or topographical map (Fig. 14).
Each continuous fringe represents a constant eleva-
tion (along the axis perpendicular to the membrane
rest position). The elevation difference between
consecutive fringes is equal to one-half of the laser
source wavelength. For red light illumination the
smallest measurable linear displacement is 3.164x10"7
meter. Thus, an accurate measurement of the
membrane's swing may be determined.

Fig. 14. White-light holographic interferogram.
We can apply this technique of holographic inter-
ferometry to contour mapping of solid objects. This
technique is particularly useful for the analysis of
strain and deformation in materials. (Ref. 1)
A one step white-light holographic process has
been applied to holographic interferometry. This
process provides better image quality and some
versatility in image magnification. It is a relatively
simple technique. (Ref. 5)

SHARPNESS OF HOLOGRAMS
A white-light hologram is made using as an object
the real image from a first, or primary hologram. A slit
is placed at the primary hologram and a secondary, or
white-light hologram is recorded. The resulting
white-light hologram can produce an image under
white light illumination.
"The width of the slit is critical. If too wide, the
image is blurred; if too narrow, the image becomes
speckly. The optimum compromise between image
sharpness and speckle is satisfactory if the object-
hologram distance is small (few cm.), but worsens as
the object-hologram distance increases." (Ref. 1)

is large (1 meter). This was accomplished by accom-
panying the slit with a cylindrical lens.
Fig. 1 shows a photographic plate recording the
real image of a primary hologram. In this case the real
image is a point object. The resulting white-light
hologram is signal limited in the vertical dimension to

In the reconstruction process, the white-light
hologram will diffract each wavelength component of
white-light illumination to a different point image
position. The result is a continuous line where the
color changes from top to bottom. However, an
observer will see only one point of a given color at any
position in the viewing plane (Fig. 2).

At a given viewing position, a distance Ze from the
white-light hologram, the segment AY represents the
range of image points which contributes light to the
eye (Fig. 3). The segment AY is also the smearing
effect of a point object when the white-light holo-
gram is viewed from a distance Ze. This smearing only
occurs in the vertical dimension.
Fig. 3. Smearing effect.
It can be shown by geometrical optics that the
smearing factor
AY =* Y(l +
"This equation shows that the smearing due to broad
spectral illumination is such that the image, as viewed
by the observer, is wider than the hologram signal
which produced the image." (Ref. 1) It is obvious that
we want to minimize Y to reduce the smearing in the
vertical dimension.
Consider the case where a cylindrical lens is placed
at the slit position when the white-light hologram is
recorded (Fig. 4). The cylindrical lens is designed such
that the vertical dimension of the point object focuses
at the photographic plate. The horizontal dimension
focal point is unchanged. The resulting white-light
hologram will produce an image which has con-
siderable astigmatism (vertical and horizontal dimen-
sions do not focus in the same plane).
ILLUMINATION
Fig. 4. Insertion of cylindrical lens into white-
light holographic process.
When Y'is very small, the new smearing factor (AY')
will be greatly reduced. Therefore, the image of the
white-light hologram will be sharper in the vertical
dimension regardless of the type of illumination.
We now can open up the slit and reduce the speckle
of the white-light hologram image without affecting
the sharpness.
One might think the astigmatism of the white-light
hologram image would make viewing uncomfortable.
However, experimental results show that this is
untrue. (Ref. 1)

in Engineering
by Gary A. Cluff
There's good news for students thinking about
entering engineering and for engineers who will soon
graduate. Engineers are receiving over 60% of all job
offers, according to the College Placement Council.
The demand for engineers continues to grow every
year and experts don't see a slackening in the long-
term demand during the foreseeable future.
When the demand for a commodity, in this case,
engineering talent, outweighs the supply, that com-
modity increases in value. While many college
graduates are receiving job offers of $10-$15,000 per
year, engineering graduates are receiving offers of
$17-$21,000. Offers are proportionately higher for
persons with advanced degrees.
Each year inflation drives starting salaries up. Four
years from now, the average starting salary for
engineers with bachelor's degrees may well exceed
$25,000 per year.
This year petroleum and chemical engineers are
demanding and receiving the highest salaries, $19-
$22,000 per year. Students graduating with degrees in
the basic engineering areas—mechanical, civil,
electrical and industrial engineering are also receiving
substantial offers.
Students are increasingly opting for any number of
engineering specialties within these basic areas. A civil
or chemical engineer may specialize in an environ-
mental option. While these specialties may be attrac-
tive to some employers, others may be a bit wary of
new engineers who have over specialized. Students
entering the engineering field should explore the
employment opportunities for engineers with
specialties before making that decision. Your
guidance counselor, college admission officer,
engineering college dean or faculty advisors may be
able to offer advice.
Students graduating in engineering should know
that continuing education has become increasingly
important for engineers, either in business or their
technical field.
Experienced engineers find an increasing number
of options available to them. Like students, they find
themselves carefully weighing their choices as each
new opportunity arises. Having begun their career in
engineering, today they may be in sales, plant
management, research, government service or even
in the president's chair of a large company.
A student once said to me, "For four long and hard
years I've trained to be an engineer and now that I am
one, the company wants to make me a manager."
That's often the case. If you have management ambi-
tions, engineering is a good field in which to begin
your career.
A large number of engineers begin their careers
working in business and industry as design engineers,
troubleshooters, production line managers, special-
ists or consultants. Others may work in utilities and
transportation doing anything from design to con-
struction. Engineers who choose a research position
may start in product testing, process improvement or
product development. Federal, state and local
governments also provide a large job market for new
engineers.
The work environment for a new engineers also
offers a wide range of choices. It may be a manu-
facturing plant, a remote field location out of
temporary quarters, a plush office or a private home.
Some jobs require extensive travel, others require
none at all.
Students who are in the process of making a
decision about engineering education should know
they'll need a persistent attitude because engineering
is not easy. Mathematical ability and technical
aptitude will give you a good start. Your education will
give you an opportunity to prepare yourself to assume
a role in society, adapt to the work ethic and under-
stand the free enterprise system.
What do recruiters look for in graduating college
seniors? They look for mature individuals who have
prepared themselves for their career by directing
their education and work experiences toward their
goals. They want people who communicate effec-
tively, knowledgeably, logically and convincingly.
Often these traits and abilities have been enhanced
through campus activities that provide leadership
opportunities, competition and group interaction—
student government, social fraternities, athletics and
civic causes. Equally important, the recruiters seek
individuals who are motivated—people with initi-
ative, drive and enthusiasm.
As an engineer your options are unlimited if you
make the most of your decisions at each opportunity.

The hunter marched through the sticky darkness of
night. It made no attempt to conceal itself or to muffle
footsteps. It's pace was as even as a heartbeat; it's style
was arrogant because it feared nothing. It had control.
It always had control.
The hunted was nondescript, for he was like any
man—a combination of many men. His heart beat
faster, for dawn was approaching, the terrifying time
when he would be exposed to the stalking shadow. In
panic, he ran through the infinite field of rye to the
lake,jumped in,and struggled toswim; but his clothes
weighed him down; he began to drown as dawn
broke.

did. It had observed the scene from the nearby shore.
It mechanistically sighted on the thrashing man and
squeezed the trigger. It did not bother to check the
shot, for it had never missed and never would.
A moist ray of morning gleam cautiously peered
through a ripped windowshade into the dim
bedroom. First, a trickle, then a steady stream of light
spilled over the floor and lapped at the walls. Cock-
roaches skittered in alarm and headed for the
numerous cracks in the cold linoleum. A distant
ticking from a clock repetitiously announced the
arrival of a new second and the passing of an old one
—a second that could never be realized again in its
entirety.
The bedsprings squeaked noisily as the nebulous
dreams faded into reality. Labored breathing and a
hacking cough errupted, scaring even the bravest of
the remaining cockroaches into dark concealment.
Jay slowly sat up, and put his pale feet on the icy floor.
He reached for the splintered bedpost and used it as a
support to pull himself up. The dirty, gray nightshirt
he wore hung limply from his skinny shoulders to his
bumpy knees. He moved deliberately toward the
lone chair in the room over which his clothes were
draped. His arthritis made il hard for him to pull off his
worn garment and the stinging pain made him gasp as
bone ground against cartilage. His breath clouded
and hung in the air for a second before evaporating.
At last, his nightshirt succumbed to his feeble tugs.
Jay paused to catch his breath. His pale skin looked
as if it has been dusted with flour. His varicose veins
made him look like a walking roadmap, and the blood
oozed slowly through the many routes to and from
the flopping heart.
In time, he put on his faded cotton shirt and did the
buttons. Amidst his fumbling, they were mixed up and
came out uneven, but the error was not noticed. Next,
came the old boxer shorts, patched and full of holes.
The gray, cotton pants were slipped on—left leg, right
leg, and a spastic hitch to bring them to his waist.
Frayed suspenders were worked into place, and Jay
bent over to put on a pair of down-at-the-heel
workshoes. He slowly tied the laces, straightened up
and shuffled to the bathroom next to the bedroom.
He washed in the rusty water which dripped steadily
from the leaky faucets and stared in the cracked
mirror. A shadow stared back. Of course, it was only
his own reflection, but it was also his own realization,
for Jay knew that he was old. The trouble was that he
did not know what old was. You see, it's not the kind
of thing that just happens. Asa matter of fact, it started
the moment the babe's little ass was slapped. But one
usually does not realize what is happening until he has
been around a couple decades. One day he looks
across a sunlit valley where the leaves are changing
and yet his soul does not see what his eyes do, or
perhaps, for the first time, his soul is seeing what his
eyes do. He thinks about it for a few months and in
that time the world becomes reality—something it
never was before. A/;ce in Wonderland somehow
takes on a whole different aura. It is hard to accept that
one may never actually chase that white rabbit who is
so habitually late.
But his tears were not for his sister,
but for himself. They werefortying his
shoes for the first time and for crystal
mornings in the sandbox. And they
were for the school play and his first
kiss.
Jay looked up and saw a cat looking in the bathroom
window from a tree branch, but it scampered away.
And then the sun went behind the clouds.
He hobbled into the small livingroom. A shabby
gray carpet tugged at his feet as he shuffled past the
over-stuffed couch, which was vomitting springs and
cushions. He touched a badly scratched rocker, came
to a clock on a table and searched the depths of his
pocket for a key. He found it and cranked up the old
spring, but he wound it too tight and the clock
decrescendoed and stopped.
"Damn."
Jay thought about his busy day as he entered the
kitchen. The sun re-emerged and waves of light gaily
splashed the walls as he crossed the floor and opened
the door to admit a beautiful Irish Setter. She trotted
to him, jumped up, and lovingly licked his hand.
"Lady. Where you been, girl? Out huntin' I bet.
Yeah, that's it, huntin'."
The dog walked in an impatient circle, her lollipop
tongue hanging.
"You hungry girl? Sure."
Jay opened the refrigerator and sorted through the
food before finding a big bone at the back. He put it in
a red plastic dish. Lady meandered over, sniffing. She
clutched the bone in her strong jaws, went to the
door, and whined to go out.
"I knowed you'd wanta bury it. Well, go ahead,"
he said, opening the door. "Hey." The dog turned and
stared at him. "We'll go huntin' tomorrow, okay? You
can run in those woods. Huh? What ya say?"
The dog wagged her tail, turned, and scampered

The old man hummed softly to himself and went
about fixing his breakfast. Eggs, bacon, and coffee
filled the sunlit kitchen with strong aromas.
He left the dishes on the counter, got his hat and
coat, and walked out into the crisp air. His appletree
was heavy with sweet red fruit. He made a note to pick
some as he strolled to the garage. Fall was not as nice
as spring, but the anticipation of a change was in the
air. Somehow, in spite of the impending death of the
forests and hills, the warmth of the sun on his
shoulders made everything okay.
The door rumbled as he pulled it up. Inside was his
Ford. His hands carefully explored the chrome before
he hopped in and backed into the street.
"Wonder what the boys are doin' today?" The auto
hummed effortlessly over the narrow country road.
"Fred probably got that farm in Master. Good deal it
was. I wonder."
The glass made the heat intense so Jay opened the
window. A rush of country air hit him in the face. The
Ohio hills and farmlands rolled him around and over
and under, just as they did to anyone who traveled
their paths. The trees covered the road in places like a
giant tunnel of life and growth; and the exit from the
orange and red leaves was like being thrown in front
of a spotlight. The car sped past a gas station, some
comfortable houses, and he was in town. Cars lined
both sides of the street. Somebody had been married
and the reception was at the Town Hall. Families
shopped and exchanged cheerful greetings when
they met friends. Small children figeted and eyed
candy in store windows, all the time envying their
elders who had the power to purchase the sweets.
And it seemed they could never walk fast or slow
enough to please their parents. Meanwhile, their
older brothers and sisters congregated on street
corners to concern themselves with more serious
matters.
Jay parked and strolled along the sidewalk toward a
revolving, striped pole.
"Mornin' Jay," the men in front of the shop
chorused.
"Mornin' boys," Jay replied as he approached the
gathering of men seated near the door of the barber
shop.
"Pull up a seat and have a smoke."
The morning was spent in desultory talk, mainly
about the weather. The temperature rose and a car
overheated. The driver, a man from Chicago, was very
upset about having to miss an important appointment.
At lunch in the nearby dimestore, they feasted on
ham sandwiches and coffee and teased the counter-
girl. The overhead fan spun slowly to remove the clogs
of heat from the grill. They stayed until as if by some
pre-arranged signal, they rose to go back to their
customary haunt. When they stepped out the door,
they saw the bride and groom leaving the reception
hall across the street. Jay had known them ever since
they were children. Of course, people around there
had always said they were made for each other. The
girl had a twin brother who now followed the bride
and groom at a distance as they walked toward their
car. Tears streamed down his face and wet his tuxedo
as he stumbled down the steps. And he called her
name.
But his tears were not for his sister, but for himself.
They were for tying his shoes for the first time and for
crystal mornings in the sandbox. And they were for
the school play and his first kiss. Yes, they were for
himself—that one irretrievable part of his soul caught
for a fleeting moment. . . .
Why is it that humans must wish
most for those things they may never,
ever have?
Back at the shop . . . "Yankees won the pennant as
usual . . . Damn 'em . . . Boy in the next county was
pinned under a tractor for four hours . . . Damn
Commies . . . Hey, Pete Mac had three touchdowns
last game . . . and so it went.
The afternoon tide of sunshine ebbed and faded
into evening. The group gradually broke up and
started home.
Jay drove home through the enclosing darkness,
and yet the sunset was brilliant. Its intensity trickled
through the woody giants, as he passed through the
long tunnels. How could Jay ever know that at that
same moment a girl had just fallen in love, and a boy
had just gotten a puppy, and ashes went to ashes and
dust to dust. And yetthey all saw the same sun and will
Man ever understand why they all saw different
things?
He parked in the garage as total darkness fell. The
gravel scrunched loudly beneath his feet as he walked
toward the house.
He fixed himself a big supper. Steak, fried potatoes,
and of course, coffee. He finished, belched, and rose
from the table. The moon peeked over the trees like a
small child would over a wall. "Be time for bed pretty
soon."
The phone rang.
"Hello." (continued on page 27)

or
A Few Little Known Functions
compiled by Jeff Diewald
Hidden deep within the recesses of our favorite
operating system, MTS, lurks a number of little used,
vaguely documented commands. In an effort to bring
these powerful tools to light, the Technic Computing
staff has probed andexperimented with MTS,resulting
in the following descriptions.
SMALL
$RUN *PIZZA SIZE MEDIUM
LARGE
PAR=PEPPERONI, MUSHROOMS, KEYPUNCH
HOLES, ANCHOVIES
This function connects a datafile to the VOTRAX
audio system and an outside telephone line. MTS dials
Cottage Inn Pizza and places your order based on the
passed parameters. The order is delivered via the
current ROUTE setting with the default being NUBS.
Orders are distinguished via job numbers issued by
•PIZZA at run time.
$RUN *TIMEWARP SCARDS=FUTURETIME
SPRINT=CURRENT TIME
0=DATAFILE
This amazing function utilizes the Warpdrive option
built into the timer attachment cards. Basically, this
program races ahead to the time specified in the
SCARDS input file and attaches logical device 0 to the
desired datafile. Then, using the CHRONO-
SYNCLASTIC ADDRESS TRANSLATOR with THIO-
TIMOLINE ATTACHMENTS, the hardware returns a
copy of the datafile to the time specified in the SPRINT
file. Thus, complete assignments can be debugged
from the future, after you're had time to do them, to the
present, when you don't have time.
SHUN .RUN
This is a remedial program aimed at LS&amp; A and foreign
students (i.e. those LS&amp;A students who are brave
enough to transfer to engineering). Because the
average reading level is relatively low, they are
encouraged to run "SPOT-RUN" and practice learning
simple English and, afterthat, beginningTechnicalese.
$RUN "IQTIDY SCARDS=COURSE NUMBER
SPUNCH=YOUR BRAIN
This utility program takes an uninteligible, incom-
prehensible course (like ECE367) and issues a series of
COPY commands to the SPUNCH brain (or this device
can be attached to the pseudo-device *DUMMY*).
After all the COPY's are complete, the information is
sorted and calculated in a clear comprehensible
manner, often resulting in an "A" for the course.
$RUN *MAGIC SCARDS INPLITFILE
SPUNCHOUTPUTFILE
This function is based on the assembler call
"WSWW" (Work in Strange and Wondrous Ways).

queues up various incantations and spells. AsCPU time
isavailable.the system transferscontrol to •TWILIGHT-
ZONE*. If effective, MTS responds with the message
"POOF!" indicating that the commands in your
inputfile have been executed. For example, if the
inputfile contains the command $SET PROFESSOR
=FROG, suddenly your professor's suit would no
longer fit! Warning—this comand often exceeds
global time limits, running as long as 15 CPU seconds.
$RESTART is ineffective, as the conjurations cannot be
resumed after interruption. T=15 is the recommended
upper time limit.
$RUN 'MIRACLE 0=GOD-OF-YOUR-CHOICE
A far more powerful version of *MAGIC, this
function is also less likely to produce meaningful
results. NoCPU timeisrequired,astheattached logical
device works instantaneously. Current options for the
'GOD-OF-YOUR-CHOICE' implemented are: GOD,
ALLAH, JESUS, MTS, and MORK-FROM-ORK. Input
and output devices are not specified, because it is
assumed that the 'GOD-OF-YOUR-CHOICE' is
omnipotent and would know what they are anyways.
$RUN *ANSWERSNIFF
SCARDS=PROBLEM
DESCRIPTION FILE
0=PROJECT CCID
1=TA'SCCID
2=TA#rs CCID
This handy student aid searchesout the teacher'sand
teaching assistants' files and searches for any program
or data related to the i nputted SCARDS file. The output
is routed to *PRINT* by default, although it can be sent
anywhere. If *MAGIC is run first, it is possible to get
answers to problems, even though the TA has not
solved them! If *TIMEWARP is also applied, it is quite
common to get answers to problems not yet assigned,
provided a very general SCARDS file is attached.
$RUN *TREK
Unfortunately, this program has recently been
removed from system library files as being a "frivolous"
use of MTS funny money. However, the question has
often been posed: What is frivolous about removing
evil scum Klingons from the galaxy? Just wait until the
Klingon disruptor bolts come screaming down about
the Computing Center and then see their response!

UPDATE
by Dave Bristor
PHONE PROBLEMS LATELY?
Well, everybody has them, right? Ma Bell may not
be at the root of your troubles. Squirrels, rats, and
woodpeckers attack phone lines with relish. Their
collective biting and pecking amounts to hundreds of
thousands of dollars damage annually, which of
course Ma Bell cheerfully passes on to you. That is not
to say that nothing is being done about the situation.
To stop all this expensive snacking, Bell Laboratories'
engineers in Atlanta have developed a new pest guard
that shields aerial cable from woodpeckers and
rodents. It slips over telephone cable and, because of
its shape, prevents animals from getting the best bite
on the cable. The new guard is installed in half the
time of the previous guards and is expected to last
twice as long. It has withstood wind tunnel tests in
excess of 70 miles per hour and is made from a durable
white, fire resistant plastic.
While involved in the research, Bell Labs discovered
that some rodents could develop quite a bite. A grey
squirrel can deliver a nut-cracking 22,000 pounds per
square inch, a gopher can munch down with 18,000 psi
and a common Norway rat develops 7,000 psi. Scien-
tists also determined that in one week gophers can
inflict 90,000 bites, squirrels can chew up to 45,000
times, and rats (comparatively unhungry creatures)
are able to chomp 18,000 times.
The pocket gopher is the worst pest of all, from Ma
Bell's (and hence your) point of view. Their front teeth
can grow as much as 12 inches in a year. If the poor
creature doesn't chew on something, eating can get to
be impossible.
For cable sheathing purposes, engineers screened
aluminum, brass, copper and a variety of other
organic and inorganic materials. Stainless steel came
out on top as the most "rodent proof" and has been
used extensively where applicable. In areas west of
the Mississippi, more than 150 million feet of highly
rodent-resistant stainless steel covered wire have
been installed by the Bell System. The white guard has
passed and been proclaimed fit for use after trial
periods in New York, the Southwest, and the Pacific
coast. It is now available to Bell Telephone Companies
nationwide. Tough luck, rodents.
METEOR WEATHER VANES?
There's more to the word meteorologist than meets
the eye, now that engineers at the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign have begun to use the trails of
falling meteors to track the winds of our upper (80-100
kilometer, or 48-60 mile) atmosphere. A team of
November-December 1979
21


Avery is attempting to learn about these higher
altitude winds and their circulation patterns in an
attempt to relate these movements to the weather
closer to us here on the ground. The 80-100 km region
has been coined the "meteor region" because the air
is dense enough there to break up the meteors. The
"falling star" trail is composed of charged particles
that can reflect radar waves transmitted from high
powered transmitters. By recording the patterns of
these reflections, the winds can be tracked.
Data is being analyzed with hopes that these
elevated winds will help explain some of the causes
behind our everyday weather. The engineers are
looking for some relation between variations in
atmospheric motion that occur from season to season
as well as from day to day. As of now, little is known
about the effects of these winds on the lower
atmosphere or vice-versa. The data is also being used,
along with temperature readings from weather
satellites, to determine possible relationships be-
tween the winds and temperatures. Such an associ-
ation has long been assumed by meteorologists; now
experimental verification is on the horizon.
HAIL TO THE NUKES AT WESTINGHOUSE!
The National Safety Council has awarded its highest
honor for occupational safety to Westinghouse
Electric Corporation's nuclear fuel fabrication plant in
Columbia, South Carolina. The facility has received
this award twice before, adding up to an astounding
6,610,185 man-hours of work without occupational
injury for more than three consecutive years. The
plant fabricates nuclear fuel assemblies for pressur-
ized water reactors throughout the world. The fuel
made there generates five or six percent of all the
electricity produced in the United States. Considering
the recent publicity accorded problems with nuclear
power and its proper handling, the congratulations
given Westinghouse deserve equal time.
TEXAS INSTRUMENTS ANNOUNCES ENTRY
INTO THE HOME COMPUTER MARKET
Texas Instruments, the people who brought you the
first pocket calculators, announced the introduction
of their personal computer to the market on June first
of this year. The computer is said to be truly easy to use
due to their Solid State Software command modules
which plug into the main console and give the user
instant access to a wide variety of programs. The
computer has been designated as the model TI-99/4
and for $1150 includes a console complete with alpha-
numeric keyboard, socket for command modules,
16K random access memory (RAM), many sound
effects, a 13 digit floating point ANSI BASIC, and 16
colors for graphic displays and games on the included
13 inch color monitor. The separately priced com-
mand modules range from $19.95 to $69.95.
Unlike most other personal computers presently
available, the TI-99/4 does not rely on cassettes for
mass storage of programs. Cassettes take from half a
minute to half an hour to load, and have a nasty
tendency to fail at the most inappropriate times, such
as when you are showing your computer off to a
friend. Tl instead uses command modules which have
programs encoded on read only memories (ROMs).
The modules, each of which can accommodate up to
five ROMs, are simply plugged into place and ready to
use. Some currently available modules include Video
Graphs, Home Financial Decisions, Football, Invest-
ment Analysis, Video Chess, and Speech Construc-
tion.
For those of you interested in experimenting with
synthesized speech, Tl's Solid State Speech synthe-
sizer can be attached for another $150. The synthe-
sizer has a built in vocabulary of 200 words, and more
add-on vocabularies will be available in the future.
Home programmers can also create their own words
and phrases, making talking computer games a reality.
Now you can hear as well as see what goes on aboard
the Enterprise the next time you play Startrek.
I'm sure that the TI-99/4 sounds like a lot of fun up
till now, right? But Joe Engineer can alsojustify its cost
too. Tl BASIC, which is built into the system console
(and hence not readily replaceable) is a 13 digit,
floating point expanded version of The American
National Standards Institute specification BASIC.
Available to the programmer are 24 statements, 14
commands, color graphics in 16 colors and sound and
music cover four full octaves. A beginners guide to
BASIC accompanies the TI-99/4, and for the more
experienced programmer, Programming BASIC with
the Tl Home Computer, is available from McGraw-
Hill.
Last but not least, Tl has (or will have) some options
available for the TI-99/4. The aforementioned Solid
State Speech synthesizer is available, as well as a pair of
joysticks. The joysticks each provide a 360-degree
lever and a side mounted "fire" button. Offerings in
the near future will include a printer, a disk memory,
and an RS-232 interface for connecting the computer
to external devices (such as a modem).

50 and 25
YEARS AGO
by Cindy Kaprielian
50 Years Ago
Have you ever wondered what it would be like to
walk around Unversity of Michigan's campus 50 years
ago? The newest building was the new Architecture
Building. After 20 years of planning and steady
growth, the building was finally complete, giving
architecture students a place of their own. The first
handful of architecture students had to study in the
single attic room of the old Engineering Building. As
the class size grew, they needed more room and
expanded to the north and west wings of West
Engineering, the old Mechanical Engineering Build-
ing, and even the Pharmacology Building. The
completion of the Architecture Building gave the
students spacious drafting rooms, a well-lighted
library, a museum, and a lecture auditorium. This
building's front facade and tower faced South
University Avenue, and the beautiful lawn of Martha
Cook. Have you guessed which building this is yet?
The old A &amp; D, of course, no longer accommodating
architecture students, but all students learning the
power of the computer.
The rest of the campus is easier to visualize by
reading the class of '29's criticisms and future plans for
the campus. The campus had been altered slightly,
that Fall semester of 1929, by the construction of a
boulevard which approached Hill Auditorium and the
Women's League Building. Some students were
disappointed that North University Avenue wasn't
closed to traffic because traffic lanes cut off and
separated the University buildings. Some students had
hoped that all streets, including State Street would be
closed to auto traffic, to keep the campus more
united. Besides, they argued in the 1929Daily, dorms
would probably occupy much land west of State Street
some day so the traffic would have to be cut-off
anyway. Perhaps at the corner of Williams a fine
monumental entrance like the famous Harvard Gates
could be erected. It would be splendid if the whole
area could then be entirely surrounded by a great
wall.
The main reason given for enclosing the campus
was that there were many beautiful buildings on
campus such as the Union, Angell Hall, the Main
Library, the Architecture Building, and the Clements
Library. Unfortunately, they were not set in such a way
to view them all at once and fully appreciate their
beauty. The campus had grown awkwardly, more by
need than design. It was hoped that it would mature
and time would bring that mellowness. However,
there were some exciting plans in store. At some
future date at the other end of the mall, across from
the Main Library, a campanile (Bell Tower) was
planned. Another plan was the placing of the new Law
Library at the end of Oakland Avenue.
In addition to these exterior changes, the campus
was about to undergo interior changes as well. The

moderne" furniture movement started in Europe in
1899, 30 years earlier. The architecture students were
well versed in "art moderne" and many were
planning to take part in it. The newest thing about
modern furniture was that one had the privilege and
freedom to select all the strong, bright, and cheery
colors one wished which wasn't true of the traditional
furniture. Furniture in America had gone through
three major phases. The first was the Colonial Period
when simplicity and utility was stressed. Life was close
to nature and furniture best suited to needs prevailed.
The second phase was the Victorian age which went to
the extreme of superfluity and elaborateness without
regard for good taste and style. This occurred when
the population and wealth of this country was increas-
ing. Each piece of furniture was placed so that the
particular scheme of the room would not be upset,
resulting in artificiality. The third phase, just
beginning, was the Modern Period. The idea was to
strip away artificiality and think in simple and bold
terms, to save space by putting shelves in davenports
or headboards.
25 Years Ago
This story may be a little fishy, but it's true. 25 years
ago Alaska's statehood was being debated in
Congress. The first bill to admit Alaska into the Union
was introduced in 1916. Since 1931 a new bill had been
introduced to each new Congress. As of 1954, Alaskan
statehood was still being debated. Apparently one of
the strongest organized opponents was the canned
salmon industry based in Seattle. The canneries were
afraid of increased taxation and labor regulation of
their cheap, transient labor. The salmon people knew
that their use of fish traps on Alaskan shores would be
prohibited if Alaska became a state. Alaskans felt that
the traps were detrimental to the supply of salmon.
Use of traps had already been outlawed in Canada,
Washington, and Oregon. Apparently the fish
industry held out for four more years until Alaska
became a state in 1958.
Meanwhile, soldiers were out defending the
idealogical freedom of our 48 states in the Korean
War. In those days everyone heard the call of duty and
consequently there was a serious shortage of
engineers. Most students had no trouble staying in
school long enough to get their B.S. degrees by
qualifying for deferments by class standing or by
doing well on the Selective Service College Qualifying
Test. But once the students go through the B.S.
program, it was difficult getting more deferments for
any reason: graduate work, occupation, or even
fatherhood.
Due to the shortage of engineers, engineers with
degrees who could remain in the United States had
excellent job opportunities. Hints for selecting
employers were outlined by "Technic"journalistT. H.
Earle. First of all an engineer had to decide to what
degree he wished to speculate because there was no
such thing as absolute security in money or the men
which made up the organization. To help decide on
the security of an organization, one should know a
representative history of an industry. In the early
stage, Earle said, there's not a market yet for the
product. The business is considered a high risk
venture. This risk situation was well illustrated by the
dozens of auto companies which formed and went
out of business. However it would have been worth a
risk since . . . "now car companies rank among our
most stable industries." The next stage is a growth
period after the company has gained wide appeal. The
market develops rapidly and there is no sign of satura-
tion. The next and possibly final stage is when the
market levels off and starts to decline. The company
may decide to diversify or they may fade as the case
with the buggy whip business. The engineer, Earle
suggested, should decide on the risks he or she wishes
to take before selecting an employer. A high risk
company should only be considered by people who
know they could be happy and retain health under
prolonged conditions of extreme uncertainty. Most
students who have made it to their senior year, he
pointed out, have proven their adaptability to this
kind of uncertain environment by making it through
four years of quizzes, midterms, finals, homework,
etc.
The demand for engineers was high, but the
demand for the "Michigan Technic" wasn't. The
circulation rate was abysmally low, only 500 copies per
month for a college of 2000 undergrads. The main
complaint of Joe Engineer was "Why should I spend
money for a bunch of technical articles and stuff like
that? If I want to read engineering I can do my
homework!" The editor agreed to print more jokes
and features to get more readers, but reminded
people that the magazine was trying to fill the
engineering-educational gap by bringing industry
closer to campus. He thought their job was worth the
reader's trouble and the reader could voice their
opinion by laying $.25 on the line for a "Technic." I
think that that quarter was the bottom line for the
poor circulation. Nowadays that bottom line is gone.
"Technic" is probably the only thing that has gone
down in price since 1954, but it's value hasn't. No
excuse now Joe Engineer!

"Hello, Jay, This is Chip."
"Chip? . . . CHIP STUBBS, you scroundrel. Where

"One at a time, you old goat. Didn't think you'd get
rid of me that easy, didya? I'm over at Edon doing
some business."
"Probably something illegal or immoral if I know
you. You'd never change."
Chip laughed. "You know me too well. Long time
huh?"
Old times and places were revisited. People
remembered. Experiences retold. Then a click and
silence—total silence. It made Jay want to shout to
make sure he hadn't gone deai
It was late and time for bed. Jay felt a growing pride.
He had done it. He walked into the kitchen with
distinction and stopped. The counters, dirty and
cracked, watched him. The empty icebox stared. He
searched the cupboards before finding a lone crust of
bread which he ate, washing it down with rusty water.
As he chewed, he looked out the window. Yes, the
cracked, red dish rested on top of the mound of dirt.
His old Ford skeleton rested on four cement blocks.
The tires were gone. In the far distance, he thought he
could see the moonlight bouncing off the headstones
of the cemetary on the hill.
A paper on the counter read, "Dear Sir: Your phone
bill has not been paid, so regretfully we must . . ."
He tore it to shreds and dragged to his lonely room.
He struggled with his clothes, crawled into bed, and
listened to a distant ticking. He remembered telling
his father once that he had figured out that God could
not be all-powerful as even He could not turn time
back and make it exactly like it was the first time,
simply because you can never really repeat the past;
and oh, we try so hard to do so. Why is it that humans
must wish most for those things they may never, ever
have?
And he remembered reading once that if you drank
some of this, you would get bigger, and if you drank
some of that, you would get smaller, or it went some-
thing like that. Maybe he didn't read it; maybe it was
true.
Yes, the autumn night was silent, and really—aren't
they all? Night never changes, only we do.
And yes, the autumn night was silent, but the ticking
of the clock grew louder and louder and drowned the
muffled sobs.
LS&amp;A students, in an effort to demonstrate their superiority over engineering students, have developed
their own magnetic tape memory system, shown here. Each spool can store up to ten bytes of informa-
tion. That may not sound like much but as one of the LS&amp;A designers commented, ". . . it's twice
as good as we've ever gotten before."

With this drill bit,GE is putting
diamonds back into the earth.
The diamond is Man-Made
diamond developed by General
Electric. Man-Made diamond
crystals are pressed into a
polycrystalline "blank." When
this blank is attached to drill
bits like the one pictured
here, it provides a highly ef
ficient cutting tool to probe
deep into the earth.
Drill bits which in-
clude diamond blanks can
as much as double the
penetration rates of steel
bits in drilling for oil and gas
In one of the most successful
applications in the North Sea,
these drill bits cut the cost of bor
ing through shale by nearly 30% — for a
total saving of close to $300,000.
Two remarkable engineering breakthroughs
were required for the development of these drill bits.
First came the synthesis
by GE of Man-Made
diamond itself. Pio-
neering the tech-
fracturing which occurs in large,
single-crystal natural diamond.
Instead, these disks tend to
microfracture, constantly expos-
ing new cutting edges with-
out destroying the diamond
product.
Creating new en-
gineered materials is an im-
portant example of research
in progress at GE. Recent
developments include a
proprietary epoxy catalyst
that's cured by ultraviolet
light. GE work in ceramics
led to the Lucalox" lamp —a
highly energy-efficient form of
street lighting.
GE is constantly investigating new
technologies and innovative applications for
existing technologies —in such areas as electrical distribu-
tion systems, electronic components, environmental sys-
tems. This takes talent —engineering talent —not just in
research and development, but in design and manufac-
turing, application and sales.

Can you identify the chemical
engineer in this group?
You're right if you said all of them.
And you're right again if you conclude
that Kodak offers a wide choice of ca-
reer paths for individuals with strong
technical skills. So it shouldn't be a
surprise that our top management team
is predominantly individuals with en-
gineering backgrounds. At Kodak
plants in Windsor, Colo.; Rochester,
N. Y.; Kingsport, Tenn.; and Longview,
Tex., you'll find chemical engineers in
hard hats performing vital production
staff functions and others deeply in-
volved in design and development.
Other chemical engineers are more of-
ten in business suits, calling on cus-
tomers all over the country as Techni-
cal Sales Representatives. And some
don't stray too far away from the satis-
factions they find in the research labs.
Incidentally, it would be very easy to
find this kind of occupational variety
among mechanical, industrial, or elec-
trical engineers at Kodak.
Some of the members of this group
found a bachelor's degree was all that
was needed to prepare them for a chal-
lenging job. Other positions are better
suited for someone who has completed
a master's degree. If you prefer to work
now and study later, the Kodak Educa-
tional Aid Program offers opportuni-
ties for full- or part-time learning. Those
bent on a career in research usually
apply to us with Ph.D in hand.
At Kodak, the emphasis is on tech-
nical innovation as a blueprint for
keeping pace with our changing world.
It's taken us—and it can take you—far
from our photographic origins. For ex-
ample, our basic expertise in photo-
graphic emulsion coating was the
springboard to the development of a
new clinical blood analysis system for
health care. Our need for chemicals in
photographic manufacturing led to
the development of a multiplicity of
products including fibers, textiles, and
dyes for apparel and home furnish-
ings. And our imaging abilities gave
us an opportunity to make and market
quality business equipment like micro-
nlmers and copierduplicators.
When a company is open to new
directions, the people who work for it
should expect changing horizons in
their individual roles as well. Where
the future can take you at Kodak de-
pends on a lot of things—like personal
preferences, performance on the job,
and available openings. What we can
promise is the opportunity to explore
many conventional engineering choices
plus a lot of other vital professional
options.

What?!! Nineteen Eighty?
Ten years since Kent State. Four years 'til 1984. A score years
until the turn of the century. Where, oh where did the Seventies
go?
The Dynamic Seventies—Watergate, Vietnam, the Opec oil
embargo, inflation, unemployment, what a decade! Looking
back, I'd rather look forward, but let's be fair. There are a couple
good things about the seventies, foremost in the minds of all
you disc flingers is the expansion of the Frisbee empire. Dave
Bristor's article, "When a ball dreams, it dreams it's a Frisbee,"
deals with the history of the frisbee and some of the current
aspects of the "world of frisbee." Dave is a junior in electrical
engineering.
This month's fiction is a story by Dave Fischer entitled, "T
Formation." This story won third place in the 1978-79 Cooley
essay contest. Incidentally, the Technic is always looking for
aspiring young writers and if you'd like to have something
you've written; fiction, technical or humorous, published, why
not submit it to us for publication.
Well, you did it again. It's Thursday night, you've got a
program due Friday, you've just read the problem and now
you're packing for the Rocky Mountains. Fear not, for the
nimble-wilted Jeff Diewald has captured this nauseous feeling,
for you to savor over and over at your leisure, in a poem called,
"A Programmer's Lament."
In 50 &amp; 25, Cindy Kaprielian enlightens us re the contents of
the January issues of the Michigan Technic in 1930 and 1955. 50
years ago the topic of the day was the automobile, specifically,
how to get mileage up and keep cost down. Sound familiar?
Don't fret, the industry is prepared to take another fifty years to
find an answer. 25 years ago, while the freshmen engineers were
locomoting and bebopping to the sounds of Don Kennedy,
some students were taste testing a new potato and the Engin
Council was trying to convince a stubborn faculty that course
evaluations were a good idea. Cindy is a senior in electrical
engineering.
For those of you who have been complaining that the Technic
doesn't do anything for the Mechanical engineering students,
we say: Ask not what the Technic can do for you, ask what you
can do for the Technic. Actually, we didn't know that ME's could
read, but to show that we're not biased, we present, on the back
page, "Hardware Standards."
Have a happy 1980. Nagihcim Cinhcet

it Dreams it s a Frisbee
by Dave Bristor
At first glance, a Frisbee1 doesn't look like much.
Not even at second glance. But a Frisbee hides its true
potential until it is put into its natural habitat—the air.
Frisbee is a game or sport that anyone can enjoy. You
don't need to be seven feet tall or weigh 300 pounds to
do it well or have fun at it. It may take a long time to be
great at it, but it doesn't take much to be good.
Compared to most other sports, Frisbeeing is both
safer and cheaper. Many people think that the Frisbee
is some sort of a passing fad that has already been
around too long. The fact is that it has been around
since at least 1947 and people were throwing metal
discs with the same enthusiasm almost a century
earlier. Frisbee is not about to die along with disco in
the eighties, it has taken a firm stand as a fun game and
a competitive sport and is here to stay.
There are a few stories as to where the Frisbee orig-
inated, but the most widely accepted ones, both seem
to wind their way back to the Frisbie Pie Company in
Bridgeport, Connecticut. The company produced a
variety of baked goods, including cookies and most
naturally, pies. Herein lies the controversy. There are
two schools of thought regarding the Frisbee'sorigin:
the Pie-Tin School and the Cookie-Tin School. The
Pie-Tin people claim Yale students bought the pies for
their own worth, but soon discovered that the tins
they came in flew pretty well. The thrower would yell
"Frisbie!" to signal the catcher, because catching the
metal pie tin was something else again. Upholders of
the Cookie-Tin School agree with the story save for
one small detail—they insist that the original proto-
type of the Frisbee was the cookie-tin lid that held in
the goodness of Frisbie's sugar cookies. Undoubtedly
both were thrown, although the original forerunner
of today's discus plasticus may never truly be known.
Two things gave way to the development of the
modern Frisbee: plastic, and west coast inventor Fred
Morrison. In 1948, flying saucers from outer space had
captured the imagination of America. As a boy,
Morrison had flung other discs—paint can lids and the
like. Why not give everyone their own flying saucer?
He originally tried to perfect the pie tin, endeavoring
to make it a better flier. He soon turned his attention
to the new stuff of the day—plastic. Plastic seemed to
be ideal stuff for a Frisbee; it was lightweight, and
could be molded into any shape. The original Frisbees
were made from a butyl stearate blend. They worked
fine as long as the sun was up, but then became brittle
and if not caught, would shatter into a million pieces.
Morrison solved that problem by offering to replace
any broken Frisbee as long as all the pieces were
returned. He probably replaced three or four all told.
Fresh out of USC and looking to make a profit. Rich
Knerr and A. K. Melin were impressed by Morrison's
flying saucers that they saw flying around the southern
California beaches. They liked this simple thing that
employed the principles of physics. In late 1955 they
cornered Morrison and invited him to their San
Gabriel factory and made him a proposition. On Janu-
ary 13,1957, flying saucers began to fly off of a produc-
tion line that has since sent over one hundred million
flying around the world. At first the saucers had
problems catching on outside of California. On a pro-
motional trip of the campuses in the Ivy League, Knerr
first heard the term Frisbee. Students told him that
they had been throwing the tins around for years, and
called it Frisbie-ing. Knerr liked the terms and
borrowed them, having no idea of their historical
origins. Thus, in naming his saucers "Frisbees", he was
off by one vowel. Since 1957, Wham-O has made more
than 15 different models of Frisbees. There have been
rivals, take-offs and copies, but none have done as
well commercially or have flown as well as the discs
put out by Wham-O.
The Frisbee reached its current status in the sports
world thanks to Ed Headrick, general manager and
vice-president of Wham-O. In 1964 he designed and

predecessors. Jhe Pro model caught on, and Frisbee
was no longer just a game. Headrick subsequently
founded the International Frisbee Association and
later helped organize the California Masters Guts
team, which beat all comers at the International
Frisbee Tournament in 1968. Ultimate, another serious
game, developed late in 1969 in New Jersey. The
Moonlighter appeared, and the Navy began an
experimental program using Frisbees as flares; this
cost U.S. taxpayers nearly $400,000. The Frisbees,
when ignited, were a flop, and so was the program.
But the Frisbee was no longer just a fad—it was here to
stay.
Frisbee has evolved even more in the seventies.
Tournaments have sprung up all over the country,
including one here at U of M which is held annually.
The first 100 yard throws were made, overcoming an
obstacle that, like the four minute mile, are now
commonplace at tournaments. Flying Disc World, a
bimonthly Frisbee journal, became available in 1974.
Later, two Frisbee champions toured the U.S. with the
Harlem Globetrotters. Man and dog alike have shown
their expertise at football games over the last few
years. The Rose Bowl World Frisbee Championships in
the late summer of 1974 brought together many of the
best players in a display of Frisbee excellence that led
to the crowning of the champions of the world.
Frisbee flight should be relatively easy for anyone
with a smattering of physics background to under-
stand. A diametrical cross-section of a Frisbee looks
something like a wing, and a flying Frisbee does have
many of the properties of a wing. It could, in fact, be
called a rotating wing, for it works on the same set of
physical principles. Like a wing, a Frisbee in flight has a
slight positive angle of attack—in other words, its nose
is pointed slightly upward with respect to its direction
of motion. This causes air to hit the undersurface and
give it a "push" upward. You can experience this same
force by holding your hand out the window of a
moving car: a flattened hand will feel various pushes
up and down concurrent with positive and negative
angles of attack. In addition to these, your hand will
also feel pushed back—this is drag, a force inherent in
the design of any Frisbee. Air flowing under a Frisbee
naturally must leave; it does so at the trailing, or rear,
edge of the disc. The lip, or cheek, of the Frisbee
opposes this flow of air, and the disc ultimately ends
up slowing itself down.
The stability of a flying Frisbee is due to its spin. A
Frisbee with little or no spin doesn't get very far
because its orientation is constantly changing. Hence,
the position at which the upward force of the air acts
also constantly changes, and the Frisbee flops to the
ground. A spinning Frisbee, on the other hand, has
angular momentum by virtue of its rotating mass. This
angular momentum remains constant unless acted on
by a torque. The larger the angular momentum, the
more torque it takes, acting over a period of time, to
change the angular momentum by a given amount. As
you may know from playing with gyroscopes, a
spinning object has a resistance to having its orien-
tation changed. Thus, once a Frisbee is put in a straight
flight path, its flight continues straight, and a toss that
starts curved will continue curved. The force of^air,
while helping the Frisbee stay up, also slows down the
disc's forward velocity and it's rotational velocity.
Hence at the end of a flight, the angular momentum
changes at a faster and faster rate. This explains why a
right-handed backhand delivery produces a clock-
wise spin and ends its flight with a curl to the left.
The aerodynamic qualities of a Frisbee have been
extensively developed and little can be done to
improve upon them apart from smoothing the
surfaces as much as possible to lessen friction and
hence drag. The stability of a Frisbee could be im-
proved by giving the disc a greater angular

weight to the outer rim, but this in turn would mean a
greater gravitational force and hence less "float" in
flights. Of course, a limit is set by the strength of the
material the Frisbee is made from. The Whiz-Ring is a
Frisbee with no center, hence it has a greater angular
momentum and exceptional stability.
Anyone who has ever gotten involved in a game of
Ultimate Frisbee may be tempted to never touch a ball
again in their life. Many popular Frisbee games are the
outgrowth of traditional games, such as Basebee and
Folf. The first known Frisbee game was an original, the
previously mentioned game of Guts. This game was
introduced at the 1958 International Frisbee Tourna-
ment, but it is not clear who thought it up. Officially,
there are five players per team, but any number can
play as long as the teams are evenly matched in
number. The field is a rectangle 15 yards long and
wide enough so as to allow each player three feet on
either side; this works out to ten yards with the
recommended five man team. The object of the game
is to throw the Frisbee uncaught past the opponents
line of defense. The defense must try to catch the disc
single handedly, although it may in fact be knocked
about considerably before actually being caught. An
uncaught throw is one point for the throwers, while a
short, out of bounds, or high throw is a point for the
receivers. The throw is returned by the player who
first touches the oncoming Frisbee unless someone
else catches it. Scoring follows the same rules as ping-
pong: play continues until 21 points; 20-20 ties must
be won by two points. A Frisbee in Cuts can achieve
considerable speeds, and gloves are not uncommonly
worn in tournaments.
Another increasingly popular game is Ultimate
Frisbee. The game has its origins at Columbus High
School in Maplewood, New Jersey in 1967. Onlookers
tend to see Ultimate as a mix of football, soccer and
basketball. Teams of seven per side play in organized
tournaments, but any number can make for an
enjoyable game. The field is officially 60 yards long
and 40 yards wide; endzones are taken to be endless.
The object is to score goals by catching the Frisbee
behind the opponents goal line. Teams switch sides
after each goal. Play starts with a "throw-off", similar
to a kickoff in football. The receiving team has the
option of catching the Frisbee or allowing it to land in
their endzone. The Frisbee is advanced only by
throwing. After a catch, the receiver is allowed a few
steps, but only enough to stop running. If the Frisbee
is dropped or grounded, possession goes to the
defending team. Defenders naturally take possession
on interceptions. Guarding is allowable, but since
Ultimate is not a contact sport, any contact with the
thrower can constitute a foul, causing play to restart
from the point of infraction. In official games the time
limit is two 24 minute halves with a ten minute break in
between. Once you've played it, you too will probably
agree that Ultimate is indeed the Ultimate game.
Another very popular Frisbee game is Folf, short for
Frisbee Golf, can be played almost anywhere that
there is something moving slow enough to hit. Trees
are very popular targets. The Arb is probably one of
nature's best Folf courses. Holes can be "set up" as
play proceeds, or can be a previously agreed upon
course. Folf develops all your Frisbee skills. A good
course has long shots to test the strength of your arm
and short shots to test your accuracy, and everything
in between.
A popular game in the dorms on campus is fondly
known as Death Frisbee or Hallbee. Players take
opposite ends of a hall and try to get the Frisbee past
their opponent. Play continues until the players are
exhausted, hurt, or told to stop.
We are fortunate enough here at U of M to have an
organization devoted entirely to the advancement of
Frisbee. The U of M Frisbee Club, or Michigan
Wolverbees, meet every Tuesday and Thursday from
six to nine pm at the Coliseum. The first hour is usually
spent f reestyling and arriving, and the rest of the night
is devoted to the pursuit of Ultimate. Since 1974, the
Wolverbees have hosted an annual tournament
towards the end of the Winter term. Competition
includes Guts, freestyle, Ultimate (played on Palmer
Field) and a modified version of a distance throwing
event: instead of seeing who can throw the farthest,
judging is based on who can hit the opposing wall at
CCRB the most times! The tournament is scheduled to
take place in the middle of April this year. Naturally
the event is wound upwithabigbashattheendofthe
weekend. For more information about the Wolver-
bees or about the tournament, contact Barry Fielding
at 994-0467.
Frisbee is a sport for everyone—even for dogs. One
of the foremost players of the game is Ashley
Whippet, the mouth of Frisbee. Football crowds roar
their approval as Ashley shows his stuff. Dogs even
have their own organization within the IFA—the K-9
Corps.
Frisbee is many things to many people. It can be an
enjoyable way to spend an afternoon, and it can
provide great exercise. Players enjoy the mere fun of
throwing a simple looking plastic disc and watching it
really fly as much as they enjoy the rigors of
competition. So go ahead, toss a Frisbee—it's the
ultimate.

T Formation
by Dave Fischer
There is this thing down on the road—well it is on
the expressway to be more exact. An overpass. A huge
polyfooted concrete structure resting for a bit and
letting cars drive across its back. They have even built a
road over it. Grey searing asphalt laid down in a month
then lines. Now the bridge becomes trapped by this
grand belt of road tethering it down to this particular
time and place.
Constant ticklish progressions of cars send
vibrations down into the very bones of this bridge.
Word passes along all of these bridges by way of metal
lines that run through and parallel to the roads. It
passes from bridge to bridge. This day's news told of a
bridge being killed.
They haul up a heavy ball made of metal, held with a
cable of wire. All these attachments are friendly
components—none meaning any harm. Somehow
this combination was sewn together to form
destruction for an old bridge. The ball was floated,
with much smoke and grinding of gears, up a metal
column swaying in the wind. A blue sky and hot sun
glanced off of the column. This old bridge, growing
the whiskers of cracking cement and the rusting of
guard rails, could feel the intense pain shoot through
its tie rods going deep down into the footings as the
ball laid into the bridge's back. The old one could see
the blue sky and the ball of lead stopping at about
twenty meters in a pause—a stillness that can last for a
breath or a blink or a rolling grain of sand loosened
and windlaunched. The bridge in still time space: the
flick of a highway workers eyelash. Then the click of
gears a final heave from the hollow metal mouth of
the motor and the apologetic babble from the ball.
Eddies of air all around carrying the, "forgive me I've
been made to do this. It's out of my control now. I..."
The bridge wishing that this and the cable's constant,
"I agree entirely with the ball here, he does have a
point..." would cease. Silence would be more
welcome to the hobbled old bridge.
It always struck the bridge how little anything else
involved in this whole procedure had to say about it.
What came from these places was that routine talk
concerning a painful nut or a still bolt, how good a
new can of oil tasted, or complaints about the human
pushing the buttons. The only comment the old one
heard once was, "yes of course I can hear him cry—
but I'm not the one ramming into him, I mean that has
very little to do with the filtering of fuel..."
The bridge finally died and was hauled off part by
crumbled part. Nerves stuck out here and there, and
grey mounds of cement filled in the empty spots in the
hauling trucks. The whole bridge was taken out to this
graveyard where other bridges lay, where buildings
that didn't quite fit the design of the day fell shattered,

worms, with airplane wings and the same type of
rocking chair a former politician just paid a lot of
money for. All this run-off is buried a suitable distance
from anywhere. It will be made into a ski resort when
the pile becomes tall enough.
Now a new bridge crawled into the old one's place.
As always the restrictive belt of road was placed over
the bridge's back before the others could warn it to
move. To quickly get the hell away—go to Canada or
underwater. But the trap was at the young one's feet
before he could see and now only days and sun stories
were in his future. But knowledge of the whole
procedure was out and all the bridges knew about it.
They could only sit and wait until the next bridge
would be chosen.
However, Havey "Moon Numb" Snow didn't know
a thing about all of this when he began painting the
bridge near his house. He knew about as much as
those that destroy the bridges which is absolutely
nothing. You see metal and concrete have a whole lot
of trouble conversing with their creators and
destroyers—which just so happen to be man. It's not
that the means of communication are that much
different, or even that the basis of experience is t^hat
deviant—a bridge knows what the sun and cars are.
No, the problem is rooted in human ears and in
grandfather clocks believe it or not. Bridges use
vibrations much like we do. The major difference is
that bridges are on another level of the communica-
tion spectrum. Oh sure, there are some bridge sounds
that man can hear, things like wind blowing over the
railings and rain splattering the roadway, however,
these sounds are like a burp or a growling stomach. A
bridge can't do diddley with these as far as
communication goes. Bridges are held to sitting and
watching while the moving world flows past. This is
kind of the same for all of these assemblages; freaked
out folks like high voltage power lines, or heavy
machinery. They all have this fate which is man. Man
has these ears that can't possibly catch the patter of his
toaster in the morning, he also has these clocks that go
so impossibly fast for things like rocks and glass
windows to even get a word in edge-wise.
A bridge has a way of seeing and of feeling that also
stands in the way of communication. A blue sky is
simply felt, as is the shadow of a wrecking ball
zooming off across the sunlit skin of a bridge.
Temperature has a lot to do with the process, as does
light. Vibrations are an overload: they hurt and they
tickle. Time to a bridge is so much slower: a weeks
worth of wrecking ball catch is but a second for a
bridge. Yet every nuance of that second is "seen" and
is "felt."
So there is man and his problems on one side and
there is the bridge not across but on the other side: no
bridge at all. Only silent concrete, which is more than
likely the only way Havey would have wanted it. It was
the flat, smooth concrete, outdoors and protected
from rain, that drew Moon Numb. A muralist's dream
and the highway traffic was an audience everyday.
One drawback was that Havey wasn't a painter. Oh, he
had painted a few houses and one barn—but never a
large picture. Havey wasn't a muralist he was a
disabled Vietnam vet who liked to draw. Havey only
had one leg, and his locomotion was assisted by one R.
G. Ripplejoint plastic-silicon leg. It made him walk
with a jerk tapering off into a slight hobble at the end
of his gait. Havey was tall: seven-foot-two with an
enormous blond beard and long hair that hung down
in front of his eyes.
A sheepdog once crossed that particular bridge that
I speak of. The bridge thought that the dog was rather
odd in appearance: tongue hanging out intently
observing its own feet trot along—hair like crazy and a
weaving curve for a walk. This dog went by the name
of Marvin. Marvin was owned by a middle aged
alcoholic named Jones who drank a pint of whisky a
day. Quite a religious activity this was: at about five
o'clock everyday, on his way home from work, he
would stop at a store (One in particular to be exact. As
all attend one church building at the exclusion of
others; people don't sample a new church every
Sunday.) and purchase his whisky and a pack of non-
filter cigarettes. The cashier didn't even have to ask
him what he wanted. Jones never took Marvin
anywhere. Instead Marvin roamed free, coming and
going by way of a little rubber door that was fitted into
the back door on Jones' home. At seven o'clock
Marvin would come bashing in through the trap door
expecting to be fed. Some of the time Jones would be
laid out on the couch, unable to focus on the ceiling
or feed Marvin. At other times Jones would feed
Marvin without any problems at all. The night always
ended the same: Jones would be out cold on a couch
or on the floor or on any other nearby horizontal
plane, zoned out of his mind. Jones often gave Marvin
beer. Marvin was quite fond of this practice because
when he drank a lot, about a half a can, he would feel
great. Marvin would run around a little then dive onto
the couch if Jones had gotten there first. By and large
though, it was a shitty life for the sheepdog. Marvin
caught a heel in his rear more than once and he had
enough trouble watching out for his own feet much
less Jones' too. So life was kind of rough and filled with
an alcoholic's violence.

came bashing through the rubber door (he was even a
bit late) and Jones was nowhere to be found. Marvin
decided to get out while he could. Back out the door
he went, out into the fields he knew so well. Out
towards strips of road that rub palms with the farmers'
work. Toward resting fields of ultimate confusion.
Leaving Jones was a good thing for Marvin because if
he had decided to hang around the house he would
have just been caught by the "society," carted off and
gassed. Jones didn't come home that day because he
was slowly fading from visual and spiritual contact
with this earth. He had been fired that morning and
out to the bar he went. Weaving out into the
afternoon sun at about one o'clock and watching the
gleam of chrome echoing off into the colors that shot
by in the street, Jones didn't see the sewer grate
grabbing onto the tip of his shoe and sending him
flying out into the blur of a bright red Buick. The Buick
was driven by Jim Nesyob and his wife Hatty, that's not
to say they were both driving but just to give you the
idea that they spent a lot of time together, both being
retired and all. Later, on witness testimony, James
Nesyob was cleared of any responsibility for the
accident. They were still working on Jones three hours
after he was hit, but some important parts were
missing so they shut off his fuel letting Jones drift off.
Marvin met Havey on the other side of the bridge,
after he had examined the roadway for discarded food
or any other interesting piece of road history. The
bridge had that same old problem of not being able to
tell Marvin how odd he stuck him as being. Another
communication gap at an interface between the
bridge and something else. Dogs can hear whistling
though and Havey was whistling his head off so
Marvin decided to check him out.
Now, sheepdogs can't really see, they can see very
little with their eyes. They feel a little like a bridge
feels. They have a way of avoiding collisions with
objects and finding all sorts of unfindable things
without the aid of sight. Sheepdogs kind of feel the
changes in the air or the vibrations of house carpet.
When they follow a ball around the house (the ball on
some predetermined journey of its own) they aren't
looking at the ball. What they are doing is a careful
study of the hair that always curtains a sheepdog's
view. Long strands of light is what they see, moving
every once and awhile with dirt on the ends of shaggy
turns and curls. All of this is constantly dangled in
front of the dog's field of vision. This makes a sight
bound anchor in reality a boring one indeed. Instead
sheepdogs learn to notice the changes that occur in
their sliced up changing world. Learn to catch the
sound of a ball going from carpet to linoleum.
Sheepdogs never have to worry about smashing
Jones-like directly into signs that say NO EXIT on
them. Marvin was basically concerned with just living.
This was Marvin's way. A well practiced way.
Now there developed, on this summer day, on this
bridge crossing over a freeway, another set of
interfaces in communication. There was the bridge
and Havey, which due to reasons already given was an
uncrossable interface. There was Marvin and the
bridge, which is a theoretically better combination
except for the fact that sheepdogs, as has been said,
rely on a very introspective approach to life avoiding
the problems of being sight hampered. This being the
case, Marvin was so wrapped up in trying not to walk
off the side of the bridge—falling into high speed
traffic—that the bridge really didn't have a whole lot
of a chance to say anything to Marvin. On this
particular day a third interface existed: the one
between Havey and Marvin. Now some people can
cross this interface and Havey was such a person.
... he also has these clocks that go so
impossibly fast for things like rocks
and glass windows to even get a word
in edge-wise.
Havey's whistling drew Marvin and when Moon
Numb offered Marvin some beer out of the only can
that he had (poured into an old styrofoam cup found
by the highway side) as far as Marvin was concerned
communication had occurred. Marvin had found
someone that he liked the looks of: coming up over
the hill of the bridge's back, to follow this whistle, kind
of a Rolling Stone's waringhouse blender mix,"seeing,
or feeling, this slightly off kilter towering blond crazy,
clenching a joint in his teeth and a beer in his fist and
staring. Watching the traffic stream by and gazing at
the flat panels of concrete under the bridge then
watching the traffic stream by and gazing at the flat
panels of concrete under the bridge then watching
the traffic stream by. Marvin observed Havey swagger
up to the flat concrete, set at about a 45 degree angle,
and measure the size of each slab.
Traffic screamed past. Marvin kept his distance—he
had more than once smelted the Moody carcass of a
squirrel or a cat laid out near the side of a road. With
their legs placed in a stiff rejection of this end the
animals lay. Marvin didn't forget such things as the last
night screams that woke the hair strewn dog from
dreams of running—screams so closely coupled with
12
Michigan Technic


merge as one—screams anchored on the other side of
any dream. Leaving a shivering dog in the dark. A
silent summer night.
Havey finished as the sun was lowered into the
outlying fields shooting gold light into a mass of
tangled confusion, an occasional tree erupting from
the whole mess. His car was parked on the dirt service
road to the bridge. One tire was just about drowning
in a sink hole filled with water. Luckilythe tire still had
several square decimeters of tread exposed to the air.
It is exceedingly hard to hold your breath and support
several thousand pounds of metal and vinyl; takes
incredible will and concentration. This tire just wasn't
ready for that. He did manage to convince the other
tires to help him out a little and when Havey pulled
away this tire was the first to notice that the car had put
on some extra weight. The tire noted that the increase
in weight would just about correspond to the weight
of a large dog or a pre-teenager. Another tire quickly
declared that Havey didn't own a large dog nor did he
have a pre-teenager. So as a heated argument began
between the frame and all four of the tires Havey and
Marvin drove off down that belt of road that holds the
bridge at bay toward the small farmhouse where
Havey lived.
Havey had all means of modern convenience. He
didn't really haveany high-tech appliances, but Moon
Numb imagined he had all sorts of things. He had: a
stereo system, a huge studio, an electric can opener
and knife sharpener, a big tank of laughing gas in his
living room, a cable television, another leg, a finished
mural, his girl at home, a ranch in Montana, and a big
friendly sheepdog. Marvin was definitely starved. That
smoke in the car had produced an enormous appetite,
along with a pleasant feeling quite unlike the beer
feeling. During the ride home Havey had smoked a
marihuana cigarette and blew the smoke into
Marvin's face the whole way home. Marvin paced
back and forth in the front seat letting out an
occasional squeal. The sheepdog then started to climb
from the back seat to the front and from the front to
the back, nearly getting Moon Numb into an accident.
Marvin would slowly turn and perch with his front legs
over the back of the front seat then he would push off
with his hind legs and bound across the obstacle.
What sights Marvin saw gazing out the rear window:
trees zipping by, dogs running the length of their
yards in mock pursuit of the car. Old ladies watering
geraniums carefully arranged in wooden planter
boxes painted blue and peeling near the joints, then it
was Marvin back up front for a look at Havey and an
intermittent tongue hang. This back and forth run
persisted until they pulled in the shady alcove around
Havey's farm. Cats, chickens, three cows (Who loved
to just stand in the sun and eat grass all day long while
setting up various patterns with their bodies every two
hours. Some parts of the day they would be spread out
on the edges of the field, at other times they would be
standing in a rough T configuration which was their
favorite. With this pattern they rotated who got to be
the bottom of the T, as this cow got to stand on top of a
hill and look bored) all housed in a small barn. Havey
farmed a limited acreage—just enough to keep living
in a reasonable state. He did get a check from the
government every month. You see his leg was worth
three hundred dollars a month to the government.
This Havey gladly took. Havey wasn't bitter at all, in
fact he felt kind of lucky about the whole thing.
Havey's patrol commander was the one who
stepped on the landmine. Havey was the third closest
to the explosion, he can remember Captain Reese
stepping into the mud which bubbled up in reply.
Reese fragmented into several large pieces and
landed in a blood sprayed circle around the group of
men. Private Hanson was the next in line; his shattered
limbs lay all askew of his torso and Havey saw him as
simply a heap of flesh. Moon Numb himself was
quickly aware of his own right leg sending a pulse of
pain into his head, he maintains that he shall never
forget that pain. As Havey began to vomit from the
sight that lay in front of him the pain hit like a large
wrecking ball, at this point Havey fainted.
He was to wake up, next to Hanson, in a hospital
well within South Vietnam's border. Both men were
sent to the states and given some kind of shiny metal
on a ribbon. Hanson still lives in a vet hospital where
they are trying to teach him how to use a wheelchair.
Which is normally not that hard a thing to do but in
Hanson's case only one arm was available to push the
wheels, an electric chair was suggested but Hanson
insisted on powering himself hence his increased stay
at the hospital. Every morning at nine o-clock they
bring him some food and help him wash. At nine
forty-five he has a therapy session which lasts until
twelve forty-five. This is filled with weight lifting and
strong talks about progress and reintegration into
society (Hanson usually asks the lady if she would like
to dance). After his session he is wheeled into lunch
after which he is free to do as he pleases. Hanson then
does some reading and asks an orderly to wheel him
up to the drug dispensary where Hanson has made a
friend of the man that stacks the boxes and without
much prompting from Hanson he returns to his room
with a little extra baggage. Lately he has been eating
Valium, feeling quite calm about the whole thing. This

Havey learned how to use his leg right away. As
soon as he was out of the hospital Havey bought a
small farm with a run down farmhouse that he was
able to fix up and thirty farmed acres. Ten acres rest
and ten are Moon Numb's woods (although Havey is
the only person that calls the woods the Moon). The
farm gives Havey just enough to make his situation
comfortable.
Havey's wife, Cathy, had left him while he was in
Vietnam: sitting on a tarp covered stack of boxed
ammunition outside of the base camp, running a
thumbnail under the envelope seal, a dog laying in the
dirt and rolling on his back—flies exiting from the dust
cloud, other soldiers passing a bamboo pipe all
around, thick smell in the air, thumbnail finishing its
trip along the seam, words quick passing ... read it
twice, and that was all... "I've stored your clothing at
your parent's home ... gone to take a job out west."
Disappearing into the folds of a country composed in
roads, bridges, and small concrete towns. Not much in
the way of reasons, something about "it" not being
there anymore. Kind of like butterflies on the wild
peas that grow in Havey's resting fields. Bitter little
pods splatted with purple flowerspecks; all tangled in
a pile of twine and noise. And these butterflies, like
small pats of yellow on ice, flit out into the blue sky up
gaining height and dodge quickly to the right or left
disappearing into a crawling cloud. So Cathy went
with Havey's little girl Susan. All that was left was a
color Polaroid photo, creased on one of the edges;
Cathy holding a six month old Susan, both wrapped in
white and grey blurred forms of the background.
Havey tore Cathy out that day, being careful not to
mar Susan, now it sits in plastic only two arms,
disembodied, holding a small baby out in space. Two
weeks later Havey woke in that hospital, thanking the
sky for his life.
Farmer Neeb's daughter came by one day, asking
Havey why he was painting his farmhouse bright
orange with red trim and why Havey had, one week
previously, painted his small barn grey with one large
red ball on each side. Havey saw this young eighteen
year old girl walking up his pathway. "Hi, I'm Ann
Neeb, why are you painting your house orange ... we
can see it from our house way off over there and christ
it's bright." Havey came slowly down the ladder being
very careful not to have his plastic leg slip on a rung
and send him out into space which had happened two
days ago. "Are you hungry Ann?" Well she joined
Havey for lunch and they talked well into the
afternoon Havey's brush hardened in the sun. Ann
started to visit more often. Love was growing between
the two and one day Ann just stayed there. Farmer
Neeb was not a moral and religious man so no
objection was sounded—in fact he kind of liked
Havey.

PROGRAMMER'S
LAMENT
by Jeff Diewald
My name is Doyle Reichards
and a programmer's what I'll be
if I can only get output
from the computer back to me.
We got the problem statement
two and a half weeks ago.
I've been writing since last Wednesday
just to find the program flow.
The algorithm's impossible,
the task—immense in scope
and to make it e'en more difficult
the computer just can't cope.
I finally finished writing
my arm all twisted and sore.
I planned my day-long assault of NUBS
and headed out the door.
The work began at three o'clock
as soon as class was done.
"I'll beat the maddened user rush!
and soon my job will run!!!"
I arrived at NUBS at just past three-fifteen
and walked into a zoo.
The keypunch line was eighteen strong,
and the job queue—forty two.
At five-oh-five I found myself
in possession of a keypunch.
I hastened as my stomach growled
my last meal being lunch.
I typed and punched, yea, verily!
I punched and I did type.
By nine-fifteen, I'd got it right.
My card deck—it was ripe.

A typical NUBS scenario (on a good day)
I swaggered to the reader line
(queued behind sixteen)
At long past nine, I fed them in
to a punched-card gobbling machine.
I watched the omniscient job list screen,
as my job made eighty-one—
queued up for some high-speed printer time
or waiting just to run.
My stomach growled threateningly
as the clock pushed to eleven.
Where was that first shot computer run
that would put me into heaven?
The place had filled completely,
and many cried with sorrow.
Others screamed, and some just cursed,
for the due date was tomorrow!
At one AM precisely
they called my number loud.
I cried out "Here I am!"
as I fought on through the crowd.
I grabbed my output quickly
(I'd had output shred before)
and gasped in heightened horror
at my errors—fifty four.
I hurried to my hard-won space
clustered beneath a table,
and began to search my lousy code.
"Aha—A missing label!"
At two-nineteen, I'd found them all
my errors lined in red.
"I've fixed it now—It must run true .
or else the Amdahl's dead!"
Soon again, my fingers danced
to fix my ailing deck.
By half-past three, I'd typed my last
and did a double check.
I stumbled to the reader line
my strength beginning to fade.
I stabbed the reader buttons fast,
starting to sweat for my grade.

but my cards would not go through.
I rang the bell and panicked fast
wond'ring how many cards were chewed.
The operator removed my cards
and chuckled with strange glee.
"You'll have to get in line again
to retype these cards—these three."
I got back in the keypunch line
and grumbled nasty nouns.
The express keypunches didn't work,
and thirteen others were "down".
At five AM, I freed myself
from the hot and crowded room.
I went back to the reader line
to punch a new computer doom.
At five-twenty-two, my output finally came.
A stack of paper piled thick.
As I went through page by page,
the results just made me sick.
The output was correct—almost,
a case I hadn't thought of—
had crept into the database,
(the cases TA's love)
I started a hasty rewrite
of a major block of code.
I knew the sun was rising
as I watched the system load.
The logic—it was flowing
like a fine and heady wine.
I knew that I'd be done in time
with output that was fine.
Then a moan sang out most baleful
and rose up from the floor.
A wail very sorrowful
that echoed door to door.
My fears grew exponentially
as someone cried with grief.
I dared not to confirm my fears
(but I do admit relief)
I knew it all was over
and my face wore a saddened frown.
For despite all my hard fought battles,
the stupid computer had just gone down.

UPDATE
by Neal Donaldson
Pfoudler has introduced a replacement for asbestos
or fibrous gaskets for glassed-steel process equip-
ment. Nothing too exciting about this discovery, ex-
cept that asbestos has come into intense disfavor lately
as it is a cancer causing agent and does not react so
nicely with the aveoli in your lungs; this has been
discovered to be the case with more and more forms
of particulate matter. An example of the concern is
the recent hairdryer recall. These gaskets make their
way into machines which among other things make
consumable drugs. Asbestos in aspirin you say? Did
that pill you popped after that last long weekend feel
fuzzy going down? While the danger of fuzzy pills
seems a bit remote, the potential exists here for elim-
inating some asbestos hazards.
Engineers at Motorola have designed a new close-
circuit television camera with applications for banks,
retail operations, public institutions, and among other
things, "educational facilities". A new advancement
in proctoring exams perhaps? The electronic answer
to the honor code? It's not quite clear what they had in
mind with this, or where the university would use such
a system. Perhaps the U uses electronic evesdropping
somewhere already. Let's hope that there is not a
substantial need or demand for this type of equip-
ment here.
Texas Instruments has come out with a talking lan-
guage translator which utilizes speech synthesis.
Modules are available in English, French, German,
and Spanish. Each module contains about 1,000 words
of which half are spoken and displayed, and half
displayed only. As a learning tool, it has a memory
which can be used as a drill for translation and
pronunciation. The French is pronouced with a
Parisienne accent and the Spanish is that of the
Americas and Mexico. The device which is hand held,
retails for $250 and the modules retail at $50 a piece.
Sort of expensive if you were hoping you could use it
on your next language quiz.
The Miller Brewing Company announced a record
5,252,097 beer and beverage containers collected over
93 college campuses last spring involving 938,321
students in a sponsored contest. This works out to a
little over 5 containers per student. Can it possibly be
beer is losing it's long standing popularity with the
average American college student in that they
couldn't even handle a 6-pack over the course of a
school year? While Michigan wasn't included does
this trend extend here too? Then again they didn't
make mention of how many kegs were turned in. Now
let's see, how many kegs can close to one million
people finish off? Hmmm . . .
Over crowded classrooms a problem? Lear Siegler
Inc. has an answer to help increase individualized
instruction. From the land of mellow-speak and disco
rollerskating, California, comes computer assisted
instruction (CAI) where tutorial programs are
presented over video display terminals. A student calls
up a program covering a concept that is wished to be
reviewed and the computer then guides the student
through exercises to prompt skills and development
in that area. One desirable feature is then the avail-
ability of help whenever you need it. Satisfactory
results are claimed in it's usage in a community
college in California where it was implemented. Then
again, Lear Siegler has never heard of NUBS. So much
for the availability of help when you need it.
For all you space cadets out there (or those with
cosmic outlooks) comes news from NASA. A compe-
tition is being arranged for the fall of 1980 in which
experiments will be proposed by high school and
college students to be run aboard the space shuttle.
Winners of the competition will be selected in the
spring of 1981 with final development of the experi-
ments being done that spring and summer. The flights,
will be arranged for late 1981 or in 1982. This is not the
first time they've done this, similar programs were run
aboard the 1976 Viking mission to Mars and Skylab
where some of the results were made available in the
Austrialian Outback.

YEARS AGO
by Cindy Kaprielian
50 Years Ago
The January 1930 "Michigan Technic" was an auto-
motive issue, reporting the newest technological
advances in the auto industry. Reading it, you would
expect to get the feeling of, "We've come a long way,
baby." But no\ The titles of their articles were "The
New Front Wheel Drive Automobile" and "The Small
European Car," both topics very much in the public's
eye today.
After five years of exacting experimental work, the
Auburn Automobile Company introduced the first
"stock" front drive automobile. While front drive cars
had been used in racing competition for a number of
years by such men as Harry Miller and Barney
Oldfield, the "Cord" car was a new engineering
development. The exclusive advantage of this was the
possibility of designers to place the rear seat on the
same level as the front seat. Due to the absence of a
drive shaft found in all rear-drive cars, it was possible
to keep the height of the car top down to the low
height of 58 to 61 inches. This gave the car not only
distinctive lines, but also kept the location of the
center of mass low—providing one of the many safety
features of the car. This sizing down of the new
"Cord," along with its ease of handling and comfort,
helped the car sell itself.
The first outstanding thing observed of the
European car was the small wheelbase. An inspection
of the bodies revealed that many unique steps had
been taken to obtain body room. Leg room had been
a problem but was overcome by a "well" in the floor
of the tonneau. The "well" provided leg room, by
allowing the rear seat passengers to put their feet
under the front seat. Another notable feature of the
body construction was an attempt to achieve extreme
lightness.
Probably the most interesting thing about the small
European car was the midget power plant. To the
American motorist accustomed to lifting the hood
and finding space underneath well filled) it was
something of a shock to find in a European car an
engine which the American disdainfully called
"wheel-barrow size."
The general performance of these small cars was
really quite remarkable when the fuel economy
obtained was considered. The Austin "Seven" would
go about 45 miles per gallon of gasoline and would
attain a top speed from 40 to 45 miles per hour.
Fuel costs were one of the major reasons why the
low-priced car was so small. Practically all the gasoline
fuel in Europe had to be imported. By the time the fuel
had gone through the necessary custom payments,
the cost per gallon averaged from 35c to 60&lt;t, depend-
ing on the country in which it was purchased.
The American auto makers of small cars thought it
would prove of great interest to watch the success
attained by these small cars. Undoubtedly there was a
place for such cars in this country, but it had yet to be
seen if the motoring public would accept them as
hoped.
25 Years Ago
No, the Engine Bounce does not have any
connection to the Bounce for cling-free drying. The
event was a 1954 freshmen engineering dance and was
everything but a wash-up. Up on the stand was Don
Kennedy and his Orchestra. The slide-rule pushers
and their dates seemed to enjoy themselves as they
did everything from the mambo to the two step, and
even the Bunny Hop (all horrors).Some said that the
men of the engine school were 'completely out of it'
as far as the social life was concerned, but those
bopping freshmen engineers showed them.
Another successful result of this year was the
response of 2,100 taste tests. Of what you ask? Irrad-
iated potatoes. The 2,100 people indicated no off-
flavoring as a result. This process of irradiating
potatoes was proposed so that- potatoes could be
preserved for over a year, a process that made good
sense economically. Farmers could benefit by the
increased storage life of their crop, because they
could grow more potatoes and sell them throughout
the year. Firms preparing potato chips or canned or
dehydrated potatoes could use local potatoes during
the full year wihtout relying on more expensive
shipments from other parts of the nation between
seasons. This radiation process would make use of the
cooling fuel elements or radioactive by-products
from a nuclear reactor as the source of radiation. The
potatoes would be dumped on a conveyor belt to be
carried on a ten-minute trip into a thick-walled
22
Michigan Technic


The dosage they received would destroy those cells in
potatoes that caused growth.
A sign of a successful student battle to voice their
opinions are the faculty evaluation forms handed out
at the end of the semester. 25 years ago, faculty evalu-
ation was but an idea being tossed around Engine
Council. The students felt the evaluations would help
instructors improve teaching methods and course
offerings. Annoying mannerisms of an instructor, the
quality of his voice, his preparation and presentation
of that subject matter, the level at which he pitched his
instruction,whether he stimulated thought or
squelched it were all points which the student
questionaire could bring out. A large problem with
designing a survey, was that teaching is an extremely
complex thing and no one has yet discovered a single
set of qualities which can distinguish a good teacher
from a bad one. A number of faculty expressed doubt
as to the worth of any student opinion polls; they felt
that a student was in no position to judge whether the
material in a course was covered adequately or
whether the text was sufficient for the course. In
particular, they cited the presumptuousness of a
student organization setting up criteria for their
instructors. Apparently student presumptuousness
preempted faculty pressure allowing faculty evalu-
ation to pass.

In his will, the late Dean Mortimer Cooley left funds to be
used in the Engineering College
. . . for prizes for Engineering students, those who expect to
make engineering their profession. It shall not, however, be
used for'promoting greater knowledge along purely
professional or technical lines, but rather to encourage and
promote "Study and research, the object of which is to
develop and promote the interest of the Engineer in non-
technical fields, in which, because of his technical and
professional training, he can render a service for mankind
which is not now being rendered by anyone. In other words,
to create an interest for the Engineer in what are now non-
professional activities . . . in short, to develop, broaden, and
enrich the Engineer's education.
Dean Cooley's funds support the Cooley Writing Contest
sponsored for currently enrolled undergraduates in
Engineering.
ELIGIBILITY
All currently enrolled engineering undergraduates are eligible.

8 years ago, we designed turntables
to track records.
Today we're designing turntables
to track the sun.
SOLAR CELL RECEIVER ASSEMBLY
What you're looking at is a turntable that measures
146 feet in diameter — a turntable programmed by
computer to track the sun's azimuth while concen-
trators track the sun's elevation. Nine of these turn-
tables are being designed to power marine-mammal
life-support systems at Sea World in Florida.
The photovoltaic concentrator system uses
high-intensity silicon solar cells to convert sunlight
into electric power
and is under study by
General Electric for
the U.S. Department
of Energy. Parabolic
troughs on each
turntable are formed
of aluminum sheets
covered by a reflec-
tive film laminate.
They are angled to
concentrate energy
on a focal line of solar cells. DC power generated by
the photovoltaic cells will be converted to AC power
providing up to 300 kw of peak electricity—enough
power to service about 40 average homes.
Water circulated through copper coolant
piping in the solar cell assembly and carried to ab-
sorption chillers would be used to air-condition a
iSo° Water

shark exhibit. The generation of electricity and
simultaneous ability to air-condition makes tne GE
system unique.
Our Sea World application is a test project. It
will include researching ways to reduce costs to
make photovoltaic systems practical for commercial
or industrial-scale use.
Looking for new and practical energy
sources is just one example of research in progress at
GE. We're constantly investigating new technologies,
materials and innovative applications for existing
technologies — in such areas as medical systems,
transportation, engineered materials.
This takes talent — engineering talent—not
just in research and development, but in design and
manufacturing, application and sales.

SCIENCE/SCOPE
Major developments toward an optical filter that can be tuned electronically to specific wavelengths oi light
have been reported by Hughes scientists. The device is tuned by a microprocessor that varies the electric field
distribution onto an electro-optic crystal. One filter with a lithium-tantalate crystal has been operated across
the visible light spectrum from deep blue to deep red. Another has been tuned into the infrared portion of the
spectrum. The device promises to find important uses in pollution monitoring, multispectral imaging, and mon-
itoring color consistency in a wide range of commercial products.
Using digital techniques to perform image processing tasks like scan conversion and information storage, a new
microprocessor-controlled display system is finding a wealth of applications from medical diagnoses to non-
destructive testing. The system, called the Hughes Anaram 80" digital signal processor, is designed to create
images with the natural look of analog displays while providing the data-handling benefits of digital techniques.
The system can display 60 images per second, freeze one picture for an hour, enhance obscured detail, and
display four pictures simultaneously for comparative analysis. Uses include medical ultrasonography, X-rays,
radar, graphics terminals, and image transmission.
An advanced goggle that allows soldiers to see at night has been developed by Hughes for the U.S. Army's
Night Vision Laboratories. The device, called a holographic one-tube goggle, employs thin-film diffraction
optics and advanced electronics. It amplifies dim visual light and near-infrared radiation, then superimposes
the enhanced image over the wearer's view. Aided by studies on how the brain overlaps the field of view of
each eye, human engineering specialists designed the goggle so that the image intensiiier tube, which extends
from above the bridge of the nose, would not block any portion of a person's view.
An Exotic chip that would alert a pilot when he has been detected by enemy radar promises to open a new arena
in modern electronic warfare. The unique wafer, called an integrated optic spectrum analyzer (IOSA), would
allow a pilot to prepare for a dogfight, turn on jamming equipment, or take any other appropriate action. The
device works by having a surface acoustic wave device convert processed radar signals into sound waves.
These sound waves interact with light from a tiny solid-state laser and cause the beam to bend toward a detector
array of charge-coupled devices. The amount of deflection indicates the frequency of the radar signal. The IOSA
is being developed by Hughes for the U.S. Air Force.
Highly complex microcircuitry soon may be mass produced with a technique being pioneered at Hughes. The
approach, called ion beam lithography, has been used to make very large-scale integrated circuits (VLSI's)
having circuit lines as narrow as 0.1 micrometer, about 4 millionths of an inch. These minute dimensions have
been possible only by tedious, painstaking methods that use an electron beam to draw circuitry on a wafer. Ion
beam lithography, however, is faster and less costly because it uses a collimated beam of protons to "photograph"
circuit patterns from a mask onto a whole chip.
Hughes is currently seeking new graduates in electrical, mechanical engineering and computer science or
other closely aligned disciplines to meet the demanding challenge of our high technology company. To obtain

Have you noticed how large classes seem to be getting lately?
Maybe its just that the classrooms are shrinking, but in either
case the squeeze has hit the TECHNIC too. The EE department
decided that it needed the room that we currently use (3077 E.
Eng.) and they are relocating us in the basement of East Engi-
neering. Alas, the fond memories we leave behind . . .
This issue we present the conclusion of T-formation, a fiction
short story by Dave Fischer. The first part of T-formation was
published in the January 1980 issue of the TECHNIC and in case
you missed that issue and you would like to know how the story
began, stop by the office and pick up a copy of the January issue.

Our feature article this month was written by Joseph Gold-
berg and is entitled, "Psychomotor Testing of Individuals

causes of muscle tremors and some of the different tests that
have been developed to measure the tremors. Joseph wrote this
article as an electee project for Tau Beta Pi, he is currently
finishing his Master's in IOE and is planning to pursue a Ph.D. in
Psychology.

Individuals Exposed to
Toxic Chemicals
by Joseph Goldberg
Have you ever noticed the small movements, or
tremors in your hands? While many body functions
are simple to measure, such as heart rate and blood
pressure, tremor is not. This article presents a descrip-
tion of some of the tests which have been developed
to quantitatively measure this tremor and other cen-
tral nervous system (CNS) related functions, such as
memory. These tests involve both motor skills and
cognitive skills, and are therefore known as psycho-
motor performance tests. Industrial Engineering Pro-
fessor Gary D. Langolf has been primarily responsible
for their development over the last three years,
through a grant from the National Institute for
Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Before
describing some of these tests, I shall attempt to
answer the question, "Why would anybody want to
study these effects?"
In the first half of this century, many workers in
industry were exposed to relatively large amounts of
toxic substances as part of their daily schedule.
Potentially dangerous neurotoxic chemicals such as
mercury, lead, and carbon disulfide would occasion-
ally cause outbreaks of poisoned workers. Some of the
symptoms seen among the affected workers were
shaking of the limbs, excitibility, loss of weight, and
changes in blood pressure. After the 1940s, studies
were conducted and the allowable exposure limits to
these substances were lowered, meaning that an
industry was legally responsible to keep its workers
healthy and safe from any work-related harm (1968
OSHA Act). This lowering of limits has stopped the
outbreaks of poisoned workers and has led to the
establishment of industrial hygiene programs in
various industries. These lowered limits are being re-
evaluated for possible long-term, slight effects on the
human body. Dr. Langolf's work over the past three
years has specifically studied the effects of elemental
mercury exposure on the human body.
One industry where workers are exposed to
mercury on a regular basis is the chlorine producing
industry. Here, mercury serves as the cathode in an
electrolysis process that produces chlorine and a
caustic chemical. Workers may be harmfully exposed
to the mercury through inhalation or absorbtion.
Inhalation of elemental mercury vapor causes
absorbtion directly into the blood through the alveoli
in the lungs. Absorbtion through the skin is slower
than through the lungs, but may allow a greater
potential exposure because it is stored in the pores of
the skin. Once in the blood, mercury will store itself in
the kidneys and the CNS. Traditional measures of ex-
posure have been the blood and urine mercury levels.
The present research had three objectives:
1. To determine if current allowable exposure levels
cause subclinical effects in an individual, or those
decremental effects not easily detectable in a clinical
atmosphere, such as a doctor's office.
2. To determine what level of mercury exposure man
be allowed in order to produce no decremental
effects (clinical or subclinical) among the workers.
3. To determine what harm the present allowable
levels cause to individual workers in the mercury
industry. This objective differs from the other two in
that it searches for an individual effect rather than a
group effect. The ultimate value of research such as
this lies in the ability to protect the health of these
individual workers.
Data has been collected from quarter-annual field
testing at two large chlorine producing plants, using
various psychomotor tests, which will now be
described.
THE TESTS
Tremor Tests. The first test was a measure of neuro-
muscular tremor present in the worker. Previous his-
torical records have noted that individuals with very
high, uncontrolled expsoure to mercury have shown
very gross shaking of the limbs. These modern tremor
tests have sought to untangle the tremor due to the
nerves and muscles from the very gross limb
movements, so sensitive devices were designed. The
instrumentation shown in Figure 1 allows the subject
to hold onto a handle, in a pistol grip fashion, and
point a light metal rod at a target. The rod is attached
to a linear potentiometer which can measure both
changes in movement and acceleration due to small
Michigan Technic


the potentiometer was fed through an amplifier and
recorded on an instrumentation tape recorder. A
number of different tests were possible with this
device, such as having the subject hold the rod as
steady as possible, or following a moving target, in
order to introduce some intent on the part of the
subject.
Another test of neuromuscular tremor involved
measuring the small movements in a subject's index
finger. This test involved holding down a metal reed as
steady as possible, while the subject simultaneously
monitored his performance on a small cathode ray
tube. A dot was presented on the tube, which corre-
sponded to a tenfold magnification of the subject's
tremor. The worker was instructed to hold the dot as
steady as possible, while a recording of the amplified
tremor signal was made on a separate channel of the
tape recorder.
These tremor recordings were, after each testing
period, subject to a spectral analysis on the Industrial
Engineering department's mini-computer. This
analysis effectively broke up the complex tremor
signals into separate bandwidths, allowing one to
isolate the neuromuscular tremor. Sources such as
breathing rate and heart rate could also be isolated,
and thus disregarded.
Memory Tests. The second classification of tests,
introduced in the third year of the study, were tests of
memory function. Since memory is a product of CNS
functioning, it was theorized that the brain, and
specifically its ability to memorize and manipulate
information would show marked decrements with
chronic mercury exposure.
A subject's memory span, or the number of digits
that he can remember, upon immediate recall, 50% of
the time was tested by presenting digits on a micro-
computer. The workers were presented with many
trials of numbers, each trial differing in length, whose
numbers were randomized both between and within
trials. The worker viewed a list or trial, then recalled
the numbers in the same order as their presentation.
The results were analyzed on MTS to determine the
length of trial that a subject could remember half of
the time. This was their memory span, which ranged
from approximately 3 to 8 digits for the industrial
workers.
A second test of memory, in which memorization
was combined with a test of reaction time, was
employed in testing the workers. Utilizing a second
microcomputer, the subject was asked to memorize a
set of either 2 or 5 numbers, to be known as the 'posi-
tive set'. A response box, with buttons for 'yes' and
'no' responses, and an LED display were presented to
the worker. His task was to watch the display for a
number—if this number was a member of the positive
set, he was to press the 'yes' button as fast as he could,
and the 'no' button if the number was not an element
of the positive set. It has been shown that a subject's
reaction time will increase as more numbers are to be
memorized as part of the positive set, and will
decrease with fewer numbers in this set. The brain is
thought to scan through the positive set before
making each choice, and thus it was theorized that
those individuals with chronic CNS damage might
respond slower due to a slower scanning rate.
Other Tests. Other psychomotor tests run in the
previous three years of research included:
—maximal rate of finger tapping,
—following a line through a maze as fast as
possible, and
—measuring the physiological maximal nerve
conduction velocity in the forearm.
These tests were added or dropped along the way for
various reasons, but the third test has an added advan-
tage of not being subject to motivational effects on
the part of the subject.
RESULTS OF THE TESTING
In all of these tests, it is important to note that many
variables may have an effect on a subject's per-
formance. While many of these are accounted for in a
detailed questionaire submitted to each worker,
many variables still exist. These additional variables
have less of an effect on predictions of tremor when a
large sample of workers is used. In other words, the
overall results cannot be used to predict a specific
individual's exposure at a specific point in time.
Results from the tremor testing indicated that
neuromuscular tremor tests may be a sensitive
indicator of mercury exposure, but these results are
still in the analysis process. The memory tests, while
also still in a preliminary data analysis stage, have
indicated marked decrements in these aspects of
cognitive function in mercury-exposed individuals,as
based on previous research in this area. In addition,
previous research indicates that early effects of
mercury toxicity are reversible. Thus, if a regular
psychomotor testing program were implemented, a
worker suffering acute exposure to mercury or certain
other CNS affecting substances may be removed from
this area if exposed before the damage becomes per-
manent. These tests have an additional advantage of
being inexpensive, and simple enough to be run and
interpreted by the plant nurse or physician.

T Formation
by Dave Fischer
(Editor's note: This is the conclusion of the story T-
Formation by Dave Fischer, the beginning of which
was published in the November-December issue of
the Michigan Technic.)
When Marvin and Havey piled out of the old wagon
there was Ann sitting under one of the trees sketching
clouds on manilla wrapping paper with a grease
pencil. Havey took Marvin off into the kitchen and
opened up a can of cat food for him. Marvin thought
that this was just fine and it wasn't long before he'd
found a nice comfortable spot to sleep. Unfortunately
for Marvin there was a cat in the house. They quickly
became friends except for this one cat habit: you see
cats can not resist climbing on sheepdogs laying there
like some giant weed covered mountain—with
movement of all types; leg quiver dreams and the
constant up and down respiration. That night the cat
made his approach from the northern slope which just
happened to be Marvin's ass. The cat dug in and
started the climb. Marvin freaked out cruising outside
going right through a rusting old pushed out screen
door, the cat desperately hanging on. Marvin decided
that the barn was a much better place to sleep. The
rooster woke him and the embracing couple that was
Ann and Havey in early pre-sun morning.

her closed eyes. I'm out, it's cold, sharp, wet mint, dry,

window seeing lines with flips and coils, color blocks
stretched and tapered in twisting sheets of moving
blue. Dancing lines of black on a white noiseless plain.
Greens sliding down into fat rushing blimps. Reds tear
like arrows into the distant past of thin back into
resolution that escapes capture except in long
molecular dreams of color circling an area statistically
determined. Even more—to the light and its union a
change and heat and color with a scream out under an
even lit bridge on a earless empty road.
It was eight o'clock when Havey loaded the car with
two gallons of paint and a small satchel of brushes,
crayons and sketches. Siskin jumped right into the
back seat, he liked that alot more than the front. They
were off, Havey blowing smoke into Siskin's face.
Siskin shaking his head and hanging his tongue out.
The bandanna slapping up against one side then
another of Siskin's neck—he couldn't even feel it. The
bridge swung into sight. They stopped and Havey tied
Siskin on a long-long rope that gave the mountain of
hair a range just short of the highway.
This is what the bridge felt that night: its wallscould
feel a rolling tickly thing along an outer layer of skin.
The bridge was concentrating hard because he had
heard that when this feeling came death followed,
cracks noted and sections being marked off. After a
short time of this (it took Havey a couple of hours) the
bridge felt something that was previously only
reserved for metal areas and bottom sections (where it
happened now) in patterns that gave the bridge things
like BIG MIMMS 382 and other such things. Tonight
something was different though, it had to do with this
wet cool feeling touching the bridge's skin. Tonight
the lines spoke in whispers and stanzas of full coating
color and the bridge was learning. But what did it
mean and why did that crayon make the bridge so
uneasy?
The word went humming out in the morning upon
the steel and lines that run with the road. The bridge
had some questions to ask of another down the way.
An old railroad bridge built of cement and steel.
Tracks were laid down a narrow trough spanning the
highway below. A station wagon passing under with a
small girl peering out the window over luggage
packed—at a train of changing colors. Blue with DT&amp;I
written in white and reflecting the sun, orange PENN
LINE flashing in front of a yellow Chicago System
loaded with empty boxes. Lines of cars on orange
webbed metal—some with aluminum blinders. Cars
moving off into a blue dusty caboose with some
smoke trailing out into the freezing cold winter day.
The window fogging as a Ford LTD wagon speeds off
down the painted asphalt road, swirling snow into
small tornados and drifting sheets. With an exhaust
misting blue smoke out to dance with the powder.
This bridge was feeling the steel ball and Havey'scar
bridge wanted to know a few things. Questions were
answered flicking back and forth across rows of steel
net laid out in mud and sand. The bridge learned of
the pointed instruments and the symptoms of cracks
and greying texture. The bridge was told of the
marking in wax, the drilling, and the probing. Those
painted sections sitting thin and foreign, scab-like,
waiting to become a wound. The bridge learned much
that day while the sun poured down. But some things
were still missing from his situation. Missing was the
careful probing or the burrowing deep into hard to
reach bridge bowels. Further they didn't even hit the
bridge with a shovel on the footing. But one sign was
true; the marking shook a tremble deeply in the
bridge.
Thoughts of protest entered the bridge's mind
along with how it could be done. The idea isn't truely
alien among the stagnate structures. The floors of
buildings do it quite often, airplanes statistically rate
high among its advocates, and cars do it all the time.
Bridges as solid as they are quite seldomly do this
terrible thing. Suicide on a team level is what I'm
speaking of. And it is simple, all it takes is a democracy
of feeling between a majority of the structure. A
matter of letting go in a timed masterful demonstra-
tion of destruction; and inflamed self death for a
reason. Every rod and all of that concrete, in one
massive push, forcing apart meaningless electrical
bonds stealing molecules from other atoms in lines of
terror and loss. And in a rumble (everything is nicely
timed: a particularly heavy truck, a newly formed
crack, a train with too much vibration, in short, some
kind of key movement with a shift in some small, but
detectable variable) the steel springs loose and cracks
appear and with a low growing howl the whole thing
comes crashing down. The painting is done you know.
Havey only needed two more nights, he had gotten
so much done the first night. He lined off huge areas
of the concrete and had painted in some colors. Havey
didn't dare go back to the bridge for two nights. He
felt that the law might mind, because he hadn't asked
about doing the painting. Havey knew his design
would have been rejected because of safety or a law
written on paper someplace. The truth of the matter
was that there wasn't any law stating that paintings can
not be done on freeway overpass walls, but Havey was
right in that they would not let him paint it was a
matter of policy.
Nobody was waiting for Havey and Siskin when they
pulled up at three o'clock in the morning tofinish the
mural. Certainly not any law officers. Patrol man

In a recent experiment, scientists at the General Motors
Research Laboratories studied changes in chemical bonding
during the dissociation of oxygen molecules on platinum.
Preliminary surface work has explored an interesting
new phenomenon: the mechanism of oxygen dissociation
over a wide range of temperatures.

what conditions will
oxygen molecules dissociate into sin-
gle atoms on a platinum surface?
What is the mechanism for oxygen
dissociation? Those are the kinds
of questions that Dr. John Gland
and his colleagues at the General
Motors Research Laboratories are
investigating to get a better under-
standing of the chemistry behind
catalysis.
Their work has valuable prac-
tical implications for the automotive
field, where catalysis is used to re-
move harmful emissions from auto-
mobile exhaust. Most cars built in the
U.S. use catalytic converters filled
with beads containing platinum to
chemically transform carbon mon-
oxide and unburned hydrocarbons
into harmless CO2 and water.
While it has long been known
that catalysts are an effective way to
convert these gases, little is known
about precisely why and in what
order the basic atomic reactions
occur.
In seeking answers to these
questions, surface chemists study
the elemental composition and geo-
metric arrangement of atoms in the
first few atomic layers of the surface
and the means by which atoms and
molecules from the gas phase bond to
the surface.
In his most recent work, Dr.
Gland has been studying the adsorp-
tion and desorption of oxygen on
platinum single-crystal surfaces.
This is important because oxygen is
the agent that must be adsorbed on
the surface to react with carbon
monoxide and hydrocarbons to con-
vert them to CO2-
The experiments were con-
ducted in a stainless steel ultrahigh
vacuum system equipped with an
electron energy analyzer and a mass
spectrometer. The electron energy
analyzer allows one to measure the
concentration and character of the
oxygen adsorbed on the platinum
surface. The mass spectrometer is
used to measure the desorption of 0^
as the platinum surface is heated.
Mathematical analysis of the desorp-
tion process allows one to character-
ize the chemical bond between the
oxygen and the platinum surface.
In these experiments, the plati-
num surface is covered with oxygen
at the extremely low temperature of
-179°C (almost the temperature of
liquid nitrogen) by exposing it to
gaseous O2 molecules. The oxygen
remaining in the gas phase is
pumped away, and then the desorp-


observed as the platinum crystal is
gradually heated to 1000°C.
The oxygen was found to de-
sorb from the surface in two
distinctly different temperature
regimes-part at -125°C and the
rest at about 425°C. By using the
oxygen-18 isotope, it was estab-
lished that the low temperature de-
sorption represents oxygen that was
adsorbed on the surface in a molecu-
lar form while the higher tempera-
ture desorption corresponds to
oxygen adsorbed in the atomic form.
From an analysis of the desorption
process, it was possible to establish
the complete energetics. Oxygen
molecules from the gas phase strike
the surface and are weakly bound (37
kj/mol). The adsorbed oxygen mole-
cule can either desorb into the gas
phase (37 kj/mol) or dissociate into
atoms (33 kj/mol). The atoms are
bonded very strongly (200 kj/mol) to
the surface.
I_RO
.ROM the desorption analysis,
it was also possible to deduce the
mechanism for the dissociation proc-
ess. The interesting conclusion that
results is that the formation of O
atoms on platinum is a two-step proc-
ess-oxygen is adsorbed in a molecu-
lar state and then dissociates to form
atoms.
The GM scientists were most
interested in learning how this ad-
sorbed molecular species is bonded
to the platinum surface. Fortunately,
another technique was available to
determine the bonding. The tech-
nique is called electron energy-loss
spectroscopy and is quite new—there
are only six or seven such instru-
ments in the world. The measure-
ments not only confirmed the
existence of the adsorbed molecular
oxygen but showed that it was bound
by the transfer of two electrons
from the platinum surface into the
antibonding 77g orbitals of oxygen.
"This was most exciting" said Dr.
Gland, "because this is the first time
that this type of oxygen bond has
been observed on a metal surface.
"We're getting closer and
closer to a more specific understand-
ing of catalysis," says Dr. Gland.
"The more we learn about simple
chemical systems, the better we'll be
able to control more complicated sys-
tems. That has excellent implica-
tions for protecting the environ-
ment."

words, "that multi-colored mess on the Harold
Newman bridge". The good badge Dixon had done as
his orders had implied: if possible locate the vandals
(of course this wasn't possible) and contact public
works to clean the defaced surface. The public works
functioning as they should it would be days or even
weeks before the sandblasters would arrive. That
night Havey did notice the new crack in the bridge;
off toward the right side of the bridge and leading a
trickle of water down into a moss covered road's edge.
The line was kind of beautiful, it didn't bother Havey
at all as he applied the paint to the smooth walls. He
led a line of black about in an arc of flight and black
lines flew around like tree limbs or running arms and
legs. Line upon line appeared as silent cricket ticks
faded off into the squish of rubber shooting past, the
driver never seeing this tall blond painter arching his
colors and lines in the shadows. And Havey's scream
was taking form: he painted loudly of violence in
abstract form and of floating lines ready to attack a
running flower petal outlined in shadows of bursting
color. There was green to be had, like algae blooms
around which run the lost and translucent planeria.
There was red in explosions of powder and skin and all
was hidden in the sparse lines, held back to the ana-
lyzing eye. It was a simple field of flowers or just
shapes and colors. Now, as noted a while back, a
human can't talk to a bridge. This isn't totally the case,
you see the bridge was concentrating real hard to try
and figure out what all of this painting meant. Every
new line became etched in the bridge's soul, was
followed, examined and puzzled over. These lines
were starting to say things that the bridge didn't like.
The bridge was already nervous having convinced
everyone to let go at the proper time if this was the
end. It had learned a few more things about how the
death came; the orange trucks coming from a
building way off down the road, the re-routing of
traffic, and the flagman looking bored. Now this
painting was talking directly to the bridge. It told of
the arcing swing a wrecking ball follows and the
explosions in concrete, of ripping pieces away and
carting them off in huge trucks. That night the bridge
made its decision. It seemed to the bridge that a stand
had to be made against this endless bargaining with
bridges in general, this slavery followed by death.
Even if it wouldn't change anything it would take
some of the humans with it. The death is quick, not the
slow cancer offered by the trucks of orange. So it was
set: when the trucks were just getting there .. . well
Boom . . . dust and crunching sheet metal. Havey
finished that night, leaving his initials in black and
slipping off with Siskin after taking several Polaroid
photographs of the painting. Havey had no idea that
he had communicated with the bridge. Those cold
drying lines sung out to the bridge and Havey hadn't
told it many nice things. The bridge saw what Havey
was saying—violence, and Havey didn't know that
someone had been watching.
Havey knew that his art would soon be gone,
perhaps in a week—it might even last the winter. Art is
temporal in the moment and moments are locked into
growth, life and death. Here was a painting with a
different time scale; those who would catch morning
sunlight cutting an arc across brilliant tones of color
sound flowing out from a deep speeding shadow,
coming at them as in a dream on a night's band of soft
grey static, would be hopefully a little more
enlightened. They might not even know it happened.
Havey and Siskin stepped out of the morning's
warming light into the softly lit farmhouse. Siskin
padding off into a corner, first making sure there were
no cats about. Havey went into the bedroom,
undressed and kissed Ann on the eyelids. She rolled
close, warmly embracing him, one of her thighs
somehow silently thrown across his legs. Only one leg
was warm, the other she had grown to accept as part of
Havey's bed. This is how they were frozen, while a
fluttering shade cooled and warmed the light hugging
the edges of the blue room.
The bridge was becoming paranoid of all. It had let
out a small rumble when an orange Ogden and
Moffetti truck and trailer approached, catching itself
just in time. This only served to increase the bridge's
lack of nerve. Havey's mural was seeing its' first day of
sunlight: several drivers staring as they sped past,
flowing lines etched into a blinking sixty-five mile an
hour flash of color and stabs of black. The bridge did
have a name. It was called the Harold Newman bridge.
Harold Newman was this old Farmer who owned a
house sitting square in the path of highway number
ten when it was being built. This was forty years ago,
Harold received a letter one day telling him that his
house was worth so much and he simply had to go
down to the county circuit court and they would
award him the money for his house. Bullshit, thought
Harold—I was born in this house and I intend to stay
right where I am, I've got two oak trees that have not
grown an inch in ten years, they just get fatter and
fatter, and I don't want to leave their shade. So when
the bulldozers appeared on the horizon one morning,
far off over the corn fields, Harold decided if they
were going to knock his house down they would also
need to knock Harold down. Three weeks later they
were upon him. Harold was chained to one of the
oaks, causing the bulldozers to stop three feet in front
of his body. Harold laughed a clear loud laugh as the

area were standing around, shifting from right foot to
left, watching the whole progression of events. Ann's
father was even there. They watched as the sheriff
pulled up, hacksawed Harold free from the oak,
replacing Harold's selfimposed chains with his own.
Chrome plated chains shining in the afternoon light.
Harold still laughed as they carted him off—resisting
federal orders or some such official sounding reason.
It wasn't hard for them to put the old man in the state
home, he just laughed and laughed. There he died
one night of a codeine overdose. So the story of
Harold Newman was well known in area and the
bridge that went up over the very ground where oak
roots still send up shoots every summer (every
summer they are chopped back) was soon to be called
Harold's bridge. The bridge preferred to go by
Harold.
Harold, as we said, was very nervous. So when he
saw, off distant down the road, only two days after
Havey had finished his work, the caravan of orange
trucks (it was only three trucks but the bridge saw
more) slowly pulling up the road, large humped
orange wheel wells with double tires to support the
heavy vat filled with fine sand, Harold decided he was
ready. He only had to wait for something. The truck
pulled up onto the shoulder of the road and moved
under the bridge. Men grasping for hoses and engines
idled high, glasses being put on and earplugs. Hoods
covering their faces. God, thought Harold, this is
worse than anyone said. Heavy boots kicked into the
walls, mud flying out onto the shoulder of the road.
Mr. and Mrs. J. Nesyob were out for a pleasant drive
this very same day. Hatty was driving today because
Jim could only see ten feet in front of himself, this had
something to do with all the wine he had imbibed
tonight before as he could normally see fifteen feet in
front of his feet. They had a fire engine red Buick with
a white interior. In reality Hatty shouldn't have been
driving either, she only had about a five foot
advantage over Jim. They were listening to country
music on the radio and enjoying the impressionistic
looking landscape that rolled past. Hatty was upon the
detour cones that closed off the right lane of traffic
leading under the bridge before she knew what was
going on. She hit the first bright day-glow orange
cone and sent it flying off toward a young man taking a
drink of beer from out of a brown paper bag, a
cigarette propped atop his left ear. Hatty reacted turn-
ing the wheel a little too violently to the left, this sent
her in a path directly toward the middle of Harold's
three legs. She hit it at about fifteen miles an hour and
everything would have been OK, both Jim and Hatty
wore seat belts, if Harold hadn't have had different
plans for this little crash.
Ann woke before Havey and Siskin for that matter.
It was ten and the day had turned a cloudy grey, traces
of mist in the air blowing about the front yard,
moisture collecting on the windows. She took an
orange and a bowl of yogurt out of the refrigerator,
heated up some water for tea, and took the whole
collection out onto the front porch of the farmhouse.
As she sat and ate she watched the mist flowing like a
river, swirling among the corn and wheat, bleeding up
the trunks of trees planted in fence-like rows, trailing
far off into the distant grey void. She watched the red
and white sun slowly burn a hole in all of this water.
Ann was twenty years old. She had worked in a local
tomato canning factory for the past two years saving to
go to school. This is what she stared at through the
intricate curling woodwork of the trellis. She knew
she would leave Havey and travel off to Ithaca, New
York, there she would attend an institute of higher
learning. Ann wanted to teach English History.
Thoughts went back to Haley, the first boy to make
love to her, five years ago now, was it five? She had
been fifteen, largely ignorant, Haley was the son of a
farmer several miles from the Neeb's farm. Ann lived
with her father Leroy and her mother had died when
Ann was twelve, leaving Leroy with Jack, Bill and Ann.
Jack and Bill had left the farm three years ago. Jack
lived in Los Angeles and made his living selling illegal
drugs, while Bill lived with his wife Helen in Pittsburgh
where he owned a Chinese restaurant; Bill Woo's in
pink and green neon with an arrow alternating
between impotency and lazor straight, cutting up the
black evening. Ann was left to fix meals for Leroy, do
the wash, and work at the Prince Nester tomato
canning plant. All day Ann would take a lever and
rotate a small half-sphere scoop of metal over passing
tin cans. The desired result was that the scoop would
empty its temporary guts into the tin can. Ann came to
know Haley by going down to his father's farm one
day to help Leroy store his grain. Leroy rented silo
space from Haley's father because a new silo was
much more expensive to build these days. Ann saw
Haley standing over by some horses, his thumbs kind
of hitched through his belt holes. He came over, "Hi,
my name's Haley." "Ann. Ann Neeb." A movie one
night and before she knew it they were in his barn late
one night. He was making her shiver in a nice way. His
hand tracing the hand tooling of a saddle he had seen
three weeks ago, out in Bakersville, although he
wouldn't have made the connection. Tracing on her
thighs this motion and soft touch that he felt was
incredibly original and creative. Things peeled away
that night and Ann was initiated. She took care of
herself and she had gone to bed with three men

fade with time, sex become a ritual. Any fresh breezes
slowly die with time until it is over, like the summer's
green leaves turning gold in the rust autumn sun. The
beauty of her friends lie in this final burst of red, some-
times a harsh wind filled with sand. Often a quiet pact
that time wouldn't widen the gap. That the tree would
remember always that summer weight of green. The
promise as gold falls away, flying off into the fields, all
that remains is the nagging memory of a promise
wrapped in blinding yellow and rust. Haley was a lot
like that. He went off as summer ended to work in
Alaska. Ann got one letter then there was only hollow
space, memories, a certain way of putting a group of
thoughts. She remembered how Haley's lip twitched a
little the day he had left. Ann finished her tea, the last
lukewarm gulp, filled with acid taste. She had told
Havey that she was to leave this morning and go back
home to Leroy. She had to pack and drive a pick-up
with her possessions up to the university. Her years of
working had left her with enough money to do it. She
went into the bedroom, lightly kissed a sleeping
Havey goodbye, and hoisted a laundry bag full of what
she had managed to accumulate in Havey's house
upon her shoulder and was gone into the sun filled
morning. Down the grey rock strewn road. Out
towards where Leroy left a trail of smoke sliding up
into the air behind his tractor. As she walked she had
to admit she was crying.
Siskin had woken, gone and stolen the cat's food
and rumbled up against the screen door, flying out of
the house about an hour after Ann had left. The three
cows were all standing head to tail in one straight line
that pointed way off at another cow standing about a
half a mile away. As Siskin rambled past the front cow
watched him carefully for any response at all. Siskin
had learned long ago that cows should be ignored.
Their humor was much too out of touch; I mean what
is humorous about three cows, all packed close side
by side, walking off into a field beyond a hill, cows
sniggering until they knew they could no longer be
seen, then out and out laughter from beyond the hill,
so pleased were they with their formation. Siskin
didn't even give them a glance as he went down the
road looking for, well, whatever. Siskin was in short
order finding himself near a road made of cement. Far
down the road sat this army green hump that moved.
Siskin was interested so he went up to see what was
there. Sitting by the road was Dave Olgeror, smoking a
joint, all of his earthly belongings stashed in the drab
bag he sat upon. Leaning up against his knees was a
sign that said MEXICO on it. He playfully held the joint
up to Siskin, "how about a hit dog". It wasn't long
before the two of them were climbing into the back of
a pickup. As the pickup rolled off toward Canada,
Dave decided to call this great mound of a dog Hugo.
So Hugo and Dave did at one point get down to
Mexico, and that was the last we heard of Marvin.
Harold cried out to every seam in his total being,
"NOW!". With a sigh the cement floated for about
five seconds then down it came. The rumble shook a
nearby bar, out of which was walking Bobby Dean, a
worker with the sand blasting crew, who had been
sent out for beer. The rumble was gone quick—there
were no screams, just the slamming of the Coral
Gabbels screen door. Bobby dropped the bag and ran
out toward the mountain of dust rolling in all
directions away from the bridge. Under thousands of
tons of hardened mud were the flattened remains of
three highway workers and two old near sighted
people sitting in a car that was now forty centimeters
tall—if you can call it sitting. Harold was gone, out into
a void. A dark sunless place where there is nothing;
only a deep thud, rhythmic and slow, only warm moist
air. Harold was becoming so small and so tired. He
woke from a sleep about a century later, a sleep filled
with dreams of movement and hair. The moment he
had hit the highway they all knew; up and down the
road it spread. The paint on the road vibrated for days
with discussion. Bobby sat down on a large slab of
concrete, silence all around. Wind blew the dust
around and pieces of Havey's mural could be seen
facing various directions. Bobby sat in a trance, staring
off down the road, cars beginning to collect—sirens
far off down the tunnel that was the highway. Bobby
turned his gaze to a white glistening rock with some of
that graffiti on it that looked like a man falling. Bobby
began to sob for his brother who had been working
the sand hose. Pieces of orange metal stuck out of the
pile of rubble and fire leaped out of dark little caves
twisted in the sun and dove back under.
Havey awoke at about three o'clock. Ann was gone.
Siskin didn't answer his yells. He slowly unstrapped his
leg throwing it on top of the bed. Using crutches he
made his way to the kitchen, opened a soda, swung
himself out the door and went to sit down at the picnic
table near the side of his house. He drank from a
sweating glass and stared off into his fields. The
crutches lay strewn in the grass behind him and his
fingers ran around the edge of his stump as he
watched ice cubes slide off the table, shoot out in the
air and land sparkling in the green. His mind was kind
of blank.
Off in California Mr. L. Nesyob, a fine chemist, re-
ceived a telegram from his brother Frank. It began,
"Our parents have died . . .". A train blew a horn of
warning as it rumbled past a road. The rails singing.
The boxes a blur.

UPDATE
by Neal Donaldson
General Electric
General Electric announced the completion of the
world's largest wind turbine in Boone, North Carolina
recently. Sitting atop Howard Knob in the middle of a
planned picnic ground, it generates on the average
2,000 kilowatts of electricity operating when the wind
blows between 11 and 35 mph. According to one
source it would take 50 such windmills in Ann Arbor to
equal the capacity of a modern large nuclear or fossil
fuel power plant given Ann Arbor's average wind
speed of 15 mph. GE says though that one produces
the electricity for 300-500 average size homes with
wind speeds of 25 mph.
Large enough to give Don Quixote second
thoughts, it stands some 10 stories tall (140ft.) with 100
foot long rotor blades. Including all the hardware and
supporting tower, it weighs a total of 350 tons. It is
supposedly capable of surviving winds of up to 150
mph with its blades stowed.
While it seems the stats on the mill's energy produc-
ing capacity are impressive, especially considering the
cost of the energy source, the costs involved in
building the mill are substantial, and the lion's share of
its life span is used simply regaining the energy that
was used in building it. Just to make 350 tons of steel
requires a large amount of energy input. However,
here is another step towards capturing that age old
energy source of windpower for an energy hungry
America.
Another energy note from GE deals with a method
of reclaiming methane from the decay of organic
matter in sewage treatment plants, landfills, and even
cow manure digesters. One cynic suggested another
possible waste source for methane production: from
the use of the university's vast reserves of dorm food,
"I often thought that there might be some productive
use for it," he said.
The methane is part of a gas produced by anaerobic
digestion processes at sewage treatment plants (or
landfills). Approximately 60% of the gas is methane
with most of the remaining 40% composed of carbon
dioxide. The problem in reclamation is being able to
separate the two parts. GE uses a membrane which is
permeable to carbon dioxide, but holds back
methane which is then siphoned off. The resulting
product is 98% pure methane which can be added
directly to natural gas pipelines as natural gas is itself
mainly methane.
At present, the gas produced by sewage treatment
plants are either flared off to the outside air, burned to
warm the sewage treatment process, or used to fuel
internal combustion engines that produce electricity
to run the plant. Some large treatment plants produce
enough methane daily to heat 2,500 homes in a
Northeastern winter.
With landfills, the gas either slowly seeps to the
outside air, or as is often the case becomes trapped in
pockets. This trapped gas is a potential safety hazard
and explosions from trapped methane have occurred
in Michigan in recent years. Many landfills are being
equipped with pipeline systems to allow the gas to
escape and be burned in open air flares. Methane
production usually lasts for about ten years, so long
term reclamation is impossible. That is no problem
though since more than 1 million tonsof solid waste is
dumped daily at landfills around the country.
So far, 550 treatment plants and landfills have been
identified as potential methane reclamation sources
using the GE membrane. Also, organic waste can be
processed to produce methane such as forestry and
agriculture waste using what could be thought as a
"cooker". Cow manure is another source for this
method, and while this may seem a rather humorous
option, it would serve to cut down in a practical way a
very real pollution problem which is more serious
than most people would think. Asany rancher will tell
you, here is a never ending raw material source.
GE claims its membrane process is 1/2 to 1/3 as
expensive as comparable systems now developed. If
all the potential sources are fully utilized, the methane
production could supply 5% of our current natural gas
needs by tapping an otherwise wasted energy store.

50 and 25
YEARS AGO
by Cindy Kaprielian
50 Years Ago
The 1930 Tectonic portrayed the rather sinking
position of the U.S. in trans-Atlantic transportation.
The change from wood to steel boats and the
introduction of the steamship happened during the
westward movement, so the investors put their money
in this internal development. Meanwhile, Great
Britain and Germany developed large merchant
fleets. An emergency U.S. fleet was initiated during
the first World War, but these ships were slow and
didn't improve postwar conditions.
Congress tried to stimulate transatlantic shipowners
and constructors after WWI by passing the Jones-
White Merchant Bill and the Merchant Marine Act.
The Bill allowed shipowners to borrow up to 3/&lt; of the
cost of the ship with low interest. The Bill also allowed
increased compensation for mail carriers. The Act
lowered interest rates on loans from 5!/2% to 3Vi%.
However, the incentive for a fleet of high speed,
service boats across the Atlantic for passenger vessels
came not from within the U.S., but an international
prize called the Blue Ribband. The past competition
had been won by Germany, Great Britain,and France.
The Blue Ribband Fleet of 1930 was won by the
Germans Breman and Europa. The Breman, 1000 feet
long and 100 feet wide, held the record for the fastest
trip across the Atlantic in 4Vi days at an average speed
of 27.83 knots (32.05 mph).
The power of these huge vessels was usually stated
comparatively. For instance, the new airplane carrier
ships of that time had 200,000 horsepower or enough
to supply power and light for a city of 700,000 people.
The city of Tacoma, on the west coast used a vessel as
an emergency electric station during the first part of
winter during the dry season. This was done without
taxing the generators of the ship, or even extending
them to their limits.
The author of this article describing the Blue
Ribband, Ivan J. Wanless, gave his views about why the
Germans were able to succeed in winning the Blue
Ribband so often.
The constructors in Germany are not better than
those in the U.S., but the difference is in the attitude of
the people. Instead of remaining passiveunti/times of
national peril, a program of steady advancement is
continually followed. The interest that the people
themselves take in the progress of their nation was
shown at the launching of the two vessels, the Europa
and the Bremen. A national holiday was declared on
the inauguration, and 200,000 people saw the launch-
ing. It is more this type of national pride and
patriotism that helps to keep a nation great, than the
type we see practiced at home.
Even though this competition encouraged the
production of such vesels, nations were worried of the
potential danger of these ships. At that time, Germany
and Britain had a number of fast boats that could easily
be converted into cruisers carrying 6" to 8" guns.
On the lighter side of competition was the
Harmsworth race for motor boats, an annual inter-
national competition begun by Lord Northcliffe in
1903. Each year the race was held in the country

had won five times, France had won once, and the U.S.
had won eight times. The first race, at Queenstown,
England, was won by Napier I of England with an
average speed of 19.53 mph. In 1920, speed boat
racing was revolutionized by a Michigander, Com-
modore Gar Wood, from the Detroit Yacht Club.
Wood spent $100,000 on the construction of Miss
America I &amp; Miss Detroit IV. With these boats, he set a
world record of 61.51 mph.
The Harmsworth Trophy Race of 1929 was held at
the Detroit River. Gar Wood entered Miss America VII
and VIII which won 1st and 2nd place respectively at
speeds of about 90 mph. The Detroit News made a
survey which indicated that more than 450,000
spectators attended this event. This race had a far-
reaching impact in the improvement of design and
construction of fast and dependable motor boats. The
Harmsworth Trophy Race commanded a position in
the motor boat world parallel to the position held in
the automotive world by the International Speedway
Races at Indianapolis.
25 Years Ago
It is fun to make predictions for the future. The
authors of February 1955 Techn/c were no exception
to this rule. They predicted automation, electronic
marvels, and changes in engineering education.
What's even more fun than making predictions is
looking back on them and seeing how close they
came to how we live today.
D. S. Harder, Vice President of manufacturing at
Ford, coined the word "automation" and gave his
definition of it as a new manufacturing method, which
would increase the productivity of assembly plants,
and result in a higher standard of living.
"The Secret of American Prosperity" had once been
summarized by a Swiss economist addressing French
economists as "Mass markets," "Scientific research
applied to production," "The U.S. passion for produc-
tivity," and "The spirit of competition." Automation,
Harder suggested, would serve to promote all of these
qualities.
Many criticized Mr. Harder's idea because automa-
tion would displace labor and cause widespread
unemployment. He responded to the criticism with
these ideas: "In my opinion, automation will do just
the opposite. It will create more jobs, create more
products at less cost, and increase the number of
products to consume.
"Our industrial history clearly demonstrates the
ability of American business to continue to improve
old products and to create new ones, all for the
purpose of expanding markets. Inventive genius
combined with the spirit of competition has been the
driving force behind the continual expansion of our
productive forces. I am certain that any technical
advance such as automation can be absorbed in our
total economy without even a ripple on the surface."
"In the News," for the February 1955 issue of the
Techn/c forecasted these "electronic marvels" as
coming soon. Some have made it and yet others we
are still waiting for today. Marvels of the electrical
industry include cordless electric clocks automatically
regulated by short wave from Arlington, VA., picture-
on-the-wall television, New York to Paris flights in
three hours, and oven roast in a few minutes, and
luminous ceilings. Within five years (1960) many
homes would be heated by electricity at the cost of
present fuels [1955]. Flexible lighting is not far off, with
every room having luminous ceilings which can be
varied in brightness and color for any seeing needs.
Switches will turn on lights automatically, as one
enters the room. New types of insulation will allow
room for 18 cubic feet of food storage space, both
frozen and conventional, in the area now required for
an 8 cubic-foot refrigerator. The G-E official pointed
out, however, that, as in the flowering of the electrical
age, its continued growth will demand the best in
human imagination, ingenuity, fortitude, and plain,
hard work.
Dr. Klein, Professor of Aeronautics of California
Institute of Technology gave a 50 year forecast on an
engineer. It's been 25 years so we should be halfway
there.
The engineer of the future will be much better
educated than his present-day counterpart. He will
have a solid foundation in the basic sciences, and will
in addition be given a background in economics,
industrial management and psychology. ... He will
know that the number of geniuses available in the
industry is effectively zero. ... He will know that
neither mechanics nor pilots can be expected to give
continuous and unfailing attention. He will know that
all devices fail. ... He will be immune to such false
objectives as 'do it electrically.' He will recognize from
his psychological studies when he, himself is prej-
udiced and in important cases will accept good
suggestions even if they come from disagreeable
individuals. ... He will be trained to recognize the
cycles in human optimism and pessimism so that he
can evaluate his performance properly. . . .
Education to prepare the designing engineer for his
job will consist of an academic training roughly
equivalent to that for a present-day Ph.D., plus an
internship under careful supervision.
I think the University of Michigan is trying to live up
to this last promise.

HERE'S ONE ENGINEERING OPPORTUNITY
YOU WON'T GET IN PRIVATE INDUSTRY.
If you're thinking about a
technical position after graduation,
think about this.
How many companies can offer
you a nuclear submarine to operate?
The answer is none. Equipment
like this is available only in
one place—the Navy.
The Navy operates over half the
nuclear reactors in America.
So our training is the broadest and
most comprehensive. We start by
giving you a year of advanced
technical education. In graduate
school, this would cost you
thousands, but in the Navy, we
pay you.
Once you're a commissioned
Nuclear Propulsion Officer, you'll
earn a top salary. Over $24,000
a year after four years. And
you'll be responsible for some
of the most advanced equipment
developed by man.
The Navy also has other
opportunities in surface ships
and aviation assignments. If you
are majoring in engineering, math
or the physical sciences, contact
your placement office to find out
when a Navy representative will be
on campus. Or send your resume to:

near
net-shape
blank.
The 10-pound part
is the forward shaft in
the high-pressure tur-
bine of a General Elec
trie CFM56 jet engine.
The metal it's
made of is Rene 95, a GE in
vention. Rene 95 is an exotic superalloy of nickel, cobalt,
columbium, tungsten and 17 other elements.To fabricate
a forward shaft from Rene 9s by conventional methods,
you start"with a 450-pound ingot. After forging, pressing
and machining, you end up with a single 19-pound
shaft...and more than 400 pounds of expensive scrap.
That's a distressing waste of critical raw materials
and of the energy it takes to mine and refine them.
So GE engineers turned to near net-shape form-
ing: fabricating the finished part from a blank shaped as
closely as possible to the shape of the finished part.
But how could such a blank be created without
starting with a 450-pound ingot? To solve that problem,
GE engineers developed a truly unique application of
powdered metallurgy.
Virgin or vacuum
induction-melted Rene 95 is
argon-atomized to create a
powder. The powder
fscreened for particle size) is
loaded into containers
roughly shaped like the final
part. Then, in an autoclave,
the material is consolidated to
virtually 100% density (that's a
breakthrough) at high pressure (15K
psi) and temperature (20oo°F.). The
process is called hot isostatic pressing.
The result is a 120-pound ingot ready
for machining and close to the shape of the finished
CFM56 shaft.
The saving.in materials is more than 70%. In dol-
lars, literally millions will be saved over the next decade.
The process is a remarkable example of cost-effective
engineering.
Inventing new materials and better ways to use
them is just one example of GE research in progress. GE
is constantly investigating new technologies and innova-
tive applications for existing technologies—in such areas
as power systems, information services and major
appliance manufacturing.
This takes talent—engineering talent —not just
in research and development, but in design and manufac-
turing, application and sales.

takes a hard look at telephone traffic.
As a result, calls flow more
smoothly through the nationwide
network.
Shortly after Trevor Byer
came to Bell Labs in 1976, we
asked him to join a design team
tackling a big job. Their task:
find a way to determine the
accuracy, completeness and
timeliness of the hundreds of
millions of traffic measurements
collected weekly in the Bell
System. The job was important
because engineers and managers
at each Bell telephone company
use the measurements to assure
that enough equipment and
circuits are available to meet
customer demands.
The solution that Trevor Byer's
team came up with was the
Centralized System for Analysis
and Reporting, or CSAR. Trevor
focused on determining how-
much information telephone com-
pany managers needed, and how
that information could best be
reported to them. His responsi-
bilities ranged from software
design and systems engineering
to field testing of reports and
training of CSAR users. With a
BS and MS in Electrical Engi-
neering from the University of
Illinois, Trevor was prepared
for the job.
Here's how CSAR works. Once
a week all the Bell telephone
companies transmit performance
data from their computers to a
central computer in Piscataway,
N. J. Overnight, CSAR analyzes
the information, organizes it
for use in many ways, including
management reports designed
by Trevor, and stores it for
retrieval the next day.
From their own computer
Bell Laboratories
From Science: Service
terminals, CSAR users in the
telephone companies request a
variety of reports: from sum-
maries of switching system
performance for an entire com-
pany to detailed performance
of individual switching systems.
The reports can be displayed
graphically to summarize
performance trends over weeks,
months, or longer.
CSAR is one of more than a
hundred computer-based systems
used by the Bell System to pro-
vide better network performance
and better service to customers.

Gee, here it is September again and Ann Arbor has its crowds back. To get a
clear idea of how much the students are a part of Ann Arbor, one has to live here
during the summer and witness the sudden change around the first week of
September.
Anyway, welcome back to the returning (excuse me, continuing) engineering
students, and welcome to your home for the next five years to the new engineer-
ing freshpersons.
To the students who have not seen the Technic before, this is a magazine pub-
lished by engineering students for engineering students. And this is the time of
year when we need more people on the staff. You would think that from several
thousand engineering students that we wouldn't have any trouble getting new
staff members, but this is hardly the case. For some reason, we never seem to
have enough people on the staff. So if you want to join an organization that gives
you more than just equations, but also experience in the real world (we have bud-
gets, deadlines, and standards to keep up just like any other business), and would
like to meet some real nice people, come on down to our office. It's in the base-
ment of East Engineering, room B-47. If no one is there, slide a note under the
door and we'll get in touch. No pushy salesmen, just friendly people interested in
the same things you are-passing.
To those who have seen the Technic in years past, we hope that you will notice
and appreciate the changes this year. Along with a new editorial staff, with the
first co-editorship the magazine has ever had, we hope to make the magazine a
bit more readable. This means that the articles will be supplemented with more
photographs than before, and an effort will be made to include more articles with
greater impact on the engineering students' own life. That is to say, articles like
Dave Bristor's article on microcomputers will be included rather than some
article on the latest lab findings on propagation time of signals inside microcom-
puters. We feel this will make the publication more interesting.
Once again, welcome to good ole' A2 and have a good year!

for the
Engineering
Student
by Dave Bristor
As a student enrolled in engineering at the Unrver
sity of Michigan, you will have to deal with a com-
puter of some sort whether you like it or not. Your first
encounter very well may be through Engineering 102
or 120, where you will meet MTS, the Michigan Ter
minal System and the Amdahl 470/V8 computer that
MTS runs on Chances are increasing that you will also
be introduced to another computer in your stay here
at the U., a computer that may prove to have a more
significant impact on your work and life in the future:
a microcomputer.
Microcomputers evolved as a result of the miniatur-
ization of electronic circuits. Present day techniques
allow manufacturers to put hundreds or thousands of
electronic components (i.e. transistors) on a piece of
silicon one quarter-inch sqaure. These techniques are
referred to as Large Scale Integration (LSI). Because
they are relatively easy to produce in large quantities,
LSI circuits have become very cheap. This allows the
computer to enter markets and applications that were
previously handled by other, more expensive meth-
ods. You have probably realized this with the influx of
electronic handheld games and microcomputer con-
trolled appliances (your car may even now have a
microcomputer controlling the emissions system).
Microcomputers are being used by various engin-
eering departments at U of M: some chemistry labs
use Commodore PET's, the first mass-produced per-
sonal computer; APPLE ll's are used by the Aerospace
department to simulate a very expensive computer
graphics terminal; and the ECE department offers
classes which both use microcomputers as tools
(Radio Shack TRS-80's) and teach students about the
operation and construction of microcomputers.
The microcomputer circuits mentioned earlier are
not complete computers, however; more precisely
they should be termed microprocessors. A micropro-
cessor is the foundation of any microcomputer system
such as an APPLE II or a PET. A microcomputer con
nects the microprocessor to other devices which
allow a human being to communicate with it and have
it perform desired operations. A typical microcom-
puter system consists of the microprocessor, input
and output devices, and some memory. The block dia-
gram in figure 1 shows how these components interact
with each other. Two types of memory are shown in
the diagram: internal memory (RAM, for Random Ac-
cess Memory) and secondary memory. A computer
functions by executing instructions which are stored
in RAM. The contents of RAM remain constant only as
long as power is supplied, "however, and this gives
reason to have secondary memory. The most common
form of secondary memory for a microcomputer is a
common, everyday cassette, with floppy disks (which
resemble 45's but are magnetically coated) becoming
more and more popular as their price drops. In prac-
tice, after a program is put into RAM, it is saved by the
operator onto a cassette with a normal recorder. At
some later date, the computer may be turned on, and
the program loaded back into memory from the
cassette. &lt;
Any microcomputer must have a way of communi-
cating with its operator. The most common devices
today are typewriter-like keyboards and CRT's (Cath-
ode Ray Tube-similar to a TV but without the re
ceiver electronics). The keyboard is thus familiar to
everyone who has ever typed. CRT's have no moving
or mechanical parts to wear out and are quiet and fast
(like the microprocessors that control them). Some
manufacturers offer attractive I/O (computer jargon
for input and output) features with their computers.
The APPLE II comes standard with color video for at-
taching to color TV's, which has made this unit partic-
ularly attractive to the general public. Many types of
printers are available ranging from electrostatic screen
printers (which print an entire CRT screen in a matter
of seconds) to letter quality printers such as modified
IBM Selectrics. Other devices that have unusual and
interesting applications are joysticks, such as those
found on some arcade games, light pens, which recog-
nize what is being pointed to on the CRT. speech syn

remain on even when the computer is turned off.
All this electronic hardware is nor sufficient for a
human being to communicate effectively with the
microcomputer. Computers speak a very unreadable
language consisting of electronic pulses. These can be
interpreted by the aforementioned I/O devices in a
manner of ways. The user may, however, may inter-
pret these somewhat differently. To facilitate com-
munications between computer users and the ma-
chine itself, computer programs termed "languages"
have been written and are available for all microcom-
puters. The most prominent language for microcom-
puters today is called BASIC (an acronym for Be-
ginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code). BASIC
was developed in the early 1960's at Dartmouth Col-
lege to make programming computers easier for those
new to the scene. With BASIC, the programmer in-
structs the computer with understandable statements
such as PRINT, INPUT, and GOTO. There are now sev-
eral different versions of BASIC on the market, not all
of which are compatible with each other, and very
few of which are compatible with the original BASIC
developed at Dartmouth. Other languages are also
available, primarily for users who have invested in a
floppy disk system, and include FORTRAN, PASCAL,
COBOL, and more recently, PL/I. These and BASIC are
so-called high level languages (HLL's) because they
are easy for people to work with. They all translate
statements such as IF X=0 THEN Y=7 into a code
understandable to the computer. This code is termed
machine code. Computer programs are not normally
written in machine code because of the complexity in-
volved, and because machine code varies from micro-
processor to microprocessor. Another very useful lan-
guage, however, which is also microprocessor-depen-
dent, is assembly language. Assembly language is only
one step above machine code, yet its use is often in-
dispensable. A machine language program consists of
strings of zeroes and ones which are instructions to
the computer and must be entered manually through
switches. Assembly language makes use of the afore-
mentioned I/O devices to allow the programmer to
use instructions such as ADD A,7. Assembly language
is not nearly as easy to use as an HLL, is more tedious
to use, and quite error prone (just ask anyone who has
tried it). However, it doesn't take much thought to
realize that the first computer programming language
had to come from somewhere, and even HLL's are
computer programs.
Microcomputers, as you may guess, have many ap-
plications outside labs that engineering students often
find quite useful. As I recall, most engineering fresh-
men dread typing their humanities papers. Computer
programs called word processors allow their users to
type a paper into the computer's memory. In addition,
and of great importance to terrible typists like myself,
word processors allow the insertion and deletion of
punctuation, words and even sentences at will. Even
entire paragraphs can be moved at the push of a few
keys. Assuming a printer is hooked up, one more press
of a button and presto! a perfect paper (well, no typos
anyway-perfection is often up to the professor).
All engineering students will encounter graphing in

printing coordinate pairs, triples, and on up, and even
plotting graphs right before your eyes. When pro-
grammed properly, they can help a student finish his/
her homework faster than he/she could compute the
square root of Pi. Coordinate n-tuples can be put onto
paper by the student, or if a printer is available, the
graph can be obtained directly. Graphing abilities of
computers don't stop there, either. Programs are avail-
able which calculate regressions and perform curve
fitting, given a set of points.
Many non-computer classes require some program-
ming for homework and/or project assignments. An
MTS computer account is invariably supplied for
these purposes, but in most cases the professors are
more interested in results than whether the results
were produced by MTS or by another computer. Using
your own microcomputer not only saves the Univer-
sity money, it saves you from having to deal with the
hassles ever-present at NUBS or the Center. And if you
own a microcomputer, chances are good that you are
familiar enough with it to make the job easier than
with MTS.
If you do need to use MTS, you'll be pleased to
know that almost all microcomputers can be used as
remote terminals. The only additional piece of equip-
ment required is a phone hookup, or modem. Your
programming can then be done from the comfort of
your room. Microcomputers have an added advantage
over many devices sold as terminals. Since they have
their own programmable memory, they can be used as
so-called "intelligent" terminals. Intelligent terminals
allow special functions other than those that MTS pro-
vides. Most allow you to write a program into your
own computer's memory, then sign on to MTS and
execute the program. This saves the expense of doing
program file editing using MTS funds. Your dollar re-
sources can thus be spent running and debugging
Fortunately, microcomputers are not all work and
no play. There are a multitude of games available on
the market and many are others are easy to write.
STAR TREK is perhaps the classic computer game. Ver-
sions are available for virtually every microcomputer
on the market. Programs can be purchased ready to
use on cassettes (or floppy disks) or in books; in the
latter case they are virtually always in BASIC. More
recently, ADVENTURE has become very popular in
micros and is available in machine language versions
only on cassette or disk for some microcomputers.
ADVENTURE is a computerized version of the famous
Dungeons and Dragons and is probably the most inter-
esting games written for a computer. Be forewarned!
If you start an ADVENTURE, it may take you days,
even weeks, to finish.
Many other games are available for microcom-
puters. Chess has several competent and competitive
versions on the market; there is even a world champ-
ionship of microcomputer chess in which the various
programs compete against each other. Many card
games, even bridge, can be found, and of course
arcade-like video games are out, too. Prices for games
range from less than $5 for simple games like Master-
mind to more than $25 for a full-blown version of
ADVENTURE.
Personal computers, as microcomputers are some-
times referred to as, can also keep track of personal
business. Programs can be purchased or written which
will keep track of your bank accounts, phone bill, ad-
dress book, and almost anything else you may ever
need to keep tabs on.
I may have sounded over-optimistic in writing some
parts of this article, but it is not my intention that
everyone rush right out and purchase a micro. The
price is still slightly prohibitive-upwards of $500 for
a minimal system. Prices have dropped in recent
months as sales rise and the price of electronics such
as the microprocessor itself, drops. More information
can be found in any of the several microcomputer
magazines such as BYTE or Kilobaud Microcomputing.
Beware, however, that the magazines are written by
and for owners of microcomputers who are generally
quite into the subject, and that microcomputing is not
for everyone. The purchase of a microcomputer repre-
sents an investment not only of money, but of a sub-
stantial amount of time in learning about the opera-
tion, use, and programming of the unit. A solid recom-
mendation is that the prospective buyer check into
one or more of the users groups concentrating on the
particular machine under consideration. They will be
able to give out both good and bad points of the micro
as well as supplying a wealth of inside information not
supplied By the manufacturers. Many users groups
also have program libraries which supply software at
a small cost.
With the§ continuing advancement of electronics
technology, prices of microcomputers will drop.
Microcomputers are even now becoming more and
more prominent in industry and in the home. Some
prominent industry leaders believe that in the future,
most or all of our daily information such as news and
mail will be delivered electronically via computer net-
works. They forsee a microcomputer of some sort in
most homes across the country. And as the price/per-
formance ratio becomes more favorable, most indus-
tries will adopt microcomputers in some capacity. It is
almost certainly to your advantage to become famil-
iar with microcomputers and microprocessors today
to take full advantage of them tomorrow.

Tracing The Brain's Activity
PET differs from its predecessors at the most fundamental
level of subatomic physics as currently perceived. To
appreciate the processing of the brain images, it is useful to
consider how these images are originally produced.
Formerly, emission techniques involved a patient's drink-
ing a "nuclear cocktail" of weakened radioactive solution
whose active ingredients were foreign elements such as
radioactive iodine. When these tracers were absorbed in
specific areas of the body, they continued emitting their
natural gamma radiation, thus enabling scintillator cameras
to detect their location. A problem with this method stems
from the uncertainty of knowing whether or not these tracers
have altered the normal biochemistry of molecules. For
example, it is believed that some tracers change the spatial
configuration of certain proteins and enzymes.
The solution to this problem lies in creating radioactive
tracers that are themselves the elemental building blocks of
organic molecules, such as carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen.
Using the radioisotopes of these small atoms would allow
virtually any organic agent to be traced precisely (i.e.,
quantitatively) to its uptake site in the body. In an intriguing
article in the August issue of the Research News (Vol. XXXI,
no. 8), Blanchard Hiatt described the hope that PET holds for
breakthroughs in the treatment of such baffling afflictions as
epilepsy and multiple sclerosis. The ability of this technique
to disclose metabolic information is indeed impressive.
Since the natural tracers have shorter half-lives than the
"foreign tracers", the equipment for isotope production must
be on-site, and this entails the purchase of an expensive
cyclotron. In fact, the larger part of the price tag is budgeted
for the production of the radioisotopes themselves.
Coincident Photons
The more expensive tracers pay a dividend derived from
the unusual mechanism by which the tagged isotopes decay.
Positively charged electrons, known as positrons, are spit out
of the unstable tracer nuclei. Since they play the role of
"antimatter" to the "matter" role of the electrons, these two
opposite annihilate one another.
The positrons give emphatic evidence of their split-second
existence. For each annihilating pair, two photons are
emitted in opposite directions. "Photon" is the term used for
electromagnetic radiation when it is necessary to speak of
light as quantized energy. By triggering photon detectors
arranged circularly in coincidence at 180°, PET counts only
those photons which result from annihilation while rejecting
any extraneous gamma rays. Because the detectors are able
to discriminate between extremely small time intervals, the
signal-to-noise ratio produced is extremely high.
Tomographic Reconstruction
The word "tomogram" is from the Greek word for a slice or
section, and is suggestive of how the scanners are arranged
to view the head in cross-section. A large number of detector
elements are mounted around the circumference of a circle,
pointed toward the center (fig. 1). By rotating the detectors'
wheel, it is possible to obtain measurements of the radio-
activity along parallel rays. These ray projections amount to
line integrals of the radioactivity intensity at a given angle of
rotation 0:

= f(x,y)dy'

(Graphic by Larry Dong)
(b) Filtered projections, each with negative side components which correct for the star-artifact
outside the image area (Graphic by Larry Dong)
referred to as a "profHe" and n of these profiles, taken around
180°, constitute the raw material for tomographic recon-
struction of the radioactivity in the brain. This is because for
radioisotope emission, p is directly proportional to the total
detector signal (neglecting attenuation of the gamma rays,
which is negligable).
The entire problem of reconstruction is then to derive the
density function f(x,y) from the measured projections p(x,0).
If this goal is achieved, a three-dimensional reconstruction is
immediately realized by stacking these cross-sectional
functions one atop another (the z direction in the Cartesian
coordinates shown in fig. 1). Not only is this method neatly
ammenable to display on a cathode ray screen, it also solves
the problem of viewing structures which are obscured from a
particular view.
Back-Projection
This problem was first tackled in a very straightforward
manner by two medical doctors who developed a non-math-
ematical approximation to the true density levels. Known as
the back-projection technique, it relies on linear superimpos-
ing each profile (fig. 2). Although images of the desired struc-
ture are observable in some fashion, there is a characteristic
star-shaped artifact associated with this method (fig. 2 a) so
that even though one desired plane is selected, it is blurred
by the very process of eliminating the unwanted plane.
The PET technique uses a back-projection technique, but
it filters the profiles before back projecting in such a way
that the blurring errors due to the superposition outside of
the actual object region are exactly compensated for. Before
this ingenious technique can be discussed, it is necessary to
learn some of the language of analytical mathematics.
Two-Dimensional Fourier Reconstructions
Engineering students are usually introduced to Fourier
analysis in a junior level class which is heavily mathematical
in content, perhaps resembling a complicated set of foreign
grammer rules. True proficiency eludes the beginner in a first
course, but the underlying principles are quite simple. Bas-
ically, the guiding tenet of Fourier analysis is that any func-
tion can be written in terms of its frequency components by
an infinite sum of sine and cosine terms (harmonics) of
frequencies differing by an integral value. Humans have
built-in "Fourier analyzers" for sound waves; our ears
separate complicated sound patterns into frequency compo-
nents proportional to the energy present at that frequency
by utilizing a band of nerves which fire only when excited by
a particular frequency.
The situation is more complicated with two dimensional
signals such as tomographic images, but the original density
function can still be represented by a sum of sine and cosine
waves propagating in various directions across a plane. In
the Fourier plane, the amplitude of the sinusoidal waves is
denoted by a Fourier coefficients F(k^ky) and is a measure of
the power of frequency k in the spatial plane profiles (fig. 3).
For example, if the true object has many rectangular corners,
then its Fourier transform would possess larger coefficients
at higher frequencies than those of a smooth object.

does motivate the "convolution" method
Id)
(O
The overall procedure can be summarized in the following
manner. For illustrative purposes, we start with an object and
just two projection profiles (fig. 3a) The Fourier coefficients
of these projections are then calculated and equated to the
two-dimensional Fourier coefficients at a corresponding
angle in the Fourier plane (fig. 3b) Then, an interpolation be-
tween each value is made to provide a rectangular array of
Fourier coefficients (fig. 3c). Finally, sine and cosine waves,
with amplitudes given by these Fourier coefficients, are
added together to provide a reconstruction of the original
object (fig. 3d). This is another way of stating the inverse
Fourier transform The object has been actually
reconstructed.
The beauty of the method is that it is entirely mathemati-
cal. It has been practical only in the past twenty years
because the large number of calculations required for each
transform made it prohibitive. In fact, even with the advent
of digital computers, implementation of Fourier techniques
have awaited the development of the Fast Fourier Trans-
form, which exploits the cyclical nature of sinusoidal func-
tions, thereby greatly reducing the number of calculations
required.
When Fourier reconstruction is compared with back-
projection, a surprising relationship appears. The Fourier co-
efficients of the back-projected image F(k„kv), the approxi-
mations of the back-projections, are equal to the exact Four-
ier coefficients F(k„,k¥) divided by the frequency k. In fact,
this means that the lower frequencies are over-emphasized
due to the rotation of the detectors around a center point.
The result is that the blurred back-projections can be sharp-
ened, thereby yielding the exact images by multiplication of
the Fourier transforms by r, a technique that has been called
"rho filtering" or "one-over-r filtering" (see below, equation 6).
THE MATHEMATICS OF THE FOURIER TECHNIQUE
A transformation is an operation which relates functions
in the time (or spatial) domain to unique corresponding func-
tions in the frequency domain As a starting point, take the
Fourier Series, a representation of a periodic function by an
infinite sum of sinusoidal terms, with varying coefficients at
integral "harmonic" frequencies.
By using the Eugler identity:
e* = cos 6 + j sin 6
it is apparent that it is possible to develop a Fourier Series
with complex coefficients. By this simple motivation, it can
be shown with just slightly more work (see references) that a
continuous Fourier transform exists which correlates non-
periodic time or spatial information contained in a signal (or
image) to the frequency domain. This Fourier Transform is of
the form:
poo . |;
f(x)e-jkxdx
If each profile of radioactivity at each angle is trans-
formed thusly to the frequency domain, a two-dimensional
graph can be constructed (Fig. 3).
Finally, the "inverse transform" can be used to return the
useful mapping to its spatial domain equivalent: the desired
true density function.
However, this is not the technique used by PET. The con-
cept is important as regards this paper in providing the
necessary mathematical justification for the Convolution
technique (below).

ier plane is equivalent to a convolution integral in the spatial
domain. (See box: Convolution). This theorem implies that
there are two equivalent ways to deconvolute the starry-
smeared back-projections; either by frequency-domain filter-
ing or by a convolution in the spatial domain.
Having developed the theoretical groundwork, the Fourier
Transform technique can be abandoned; the equivalent
alternative, the soolled "convolution" or filtered back-
projection is the method actually used in PET.
Filtered Back-Projection
For a graphic demonstration of this technique, consider
again a uniform circular object and four filtered projections,
p*(fig. 2). Points inside the circle receive a uniform density of
the signal during the back-projection, but points just outside
the circle receive large negative components from such p*
functions.
To understand how this filter function is determined, it is
necessary to write the explicit mathematical expression for
the back-projections:
p(rcos(00),0)dfl!&gt;(
(2)
where B is the back-projected image. The argument rcos
(6,&lt;j&gt;) selects only those rays which pass through the point
(x,y) (see fig. 1), and the integration must be carried out
around 180°. Remember that B(r,&lt;£) is only an approximation
of the true density function f(x,y) in Cartesian coordinates,
and will still have the star-shaped artifact of the simple back-
projection.
Now recalling that the profiles p(x,&lt;£) are related to the
true image by equation 1, the profiles can be transformed
from the Fourier domain as follows:
F(r,0)exp(i2irR.x)dR,
(3)
where F(r,0) denotes the Fourier transform fro the actual
density function in polar coordinates. Every time Cartesian
coordinates change to polar, dxdy changes to rdrd0. Thus,
equations 2 and 3 can be combined, giving the following ex-
pression for the back-projections:
{2r poo
R ~' F(R, &lt;*&gt;) exp (i2ir • Rcos (&lt;/&gt; - 6)) RdRd0
o Jo
This expression is more easily written as the following: ''
B(r,&lt;/&gt;)
= ff-' fR-'F(r,0)]
F(r,0) =ff-'(R-')*f(r,0) (5)
This last expression states explicitly what has been dis-
cussed previously: the back-projections B(r,0) are the result
of convolving (the symbol * is used to denote the convolu-
tion operation) the true density function f with the inverse
Fourier transform of 1/R, the solution to which is 1/r.
CONVOLUTION
Physically, the notion of a convolution operation between
two functions arises whenever a measurement is taken of
some time (or spatially) dependent variable. Convolution is
variously referred to as a "running mean", "smoothing",
"blurring" or "smearing" —all of which intuitively suggest the
result of "convolving" one function with another.
For example, when the profiles of brain activity are ob-
tained by rotation around 180', the true density function is
blurred by this very rotation process. The measurement pro-
cess introduces an over-emphasis of slowly changing den-
sities toward the center of the circle.
The convolution operation is denoted concisely in the fol-
lowing mathematical terms:
r
J -a
f(T)'g(t-T)dr
It might be more helpful to study a graphical depiction of
convolution as well. It can be shown in the figures below
that the backprojection function is reversed, B(r-t, 0) and
"dragged" over the ramp function r(t). The overlapping areas
are multiplied and added at each interval (corresponding to
the integration). The resulting true density function, f(r»,
has indeed been blurred or spread out.
The convolution operation is denoted by the * symbol and
has the further interesting and relevant property (see
references) of being related to the Fourier mathematics by
Eq. 5, the so-called convolution theorem.
fig. 4
January-February 1981


Hence we seek a technique whereby 1/r can be decon-
volved from B(r,0), and this technique is the filtered back-
projection used in the PET project. The "filtered" portion of
the name comes from considering the expression equation in
the Fourier domain, where the transformed profiles are
modified by the value R. It is analogous to multiplication by
a "ramp" function or filter (fig. 4). Thus,
(7)
By invoking agin the convolution theorem, we can change
Eq. (7) to a convolution in the spatial domain and sidestep
the Fourier domain completely. However, the analysis has
assured us that our techniques are valid. There have been
some shortcuts taken, one of which has ignored the infinite
bounds of integration on the integral of Eq. (3). Of course,
there must be definite bounds on the radius of the object,
making the integral finite. Also, digital processing implies a
sampling of the projections at finite intervals w, and this
automatically leads to a frequency cutoff km-Vjw. This
frequency cutoff imposed by the sampling rate is referred to
as a "band'limiting" process. Its main effect is to limit the
spatial resolution, although it also leads to an overshoot, or
"ringing" artifact at sharp edges (for instance, at the skull-
cerebral fluid boundary). With the use of special filters, this
ringing can be eliminated from the final reconstruction. This
latter technique is beyond the scope of this article.
Finally, the explicit solution of equation 7 can be shown
to be:
-R
^~ «.»•-*•»„
(8)
This is quite easy to implement using a computer. Eq. (8), a
convolution type integral, is simplified in its actual compu-
tation by the fact that the sin2 term is either 0 or 1, depending
upon whether x'-x" is an even or odd multiple of w; this is a
computational shortcut similar to the Fast Fourier
Transform.
In sum, this technique reconstructs physiological struc-
tures by processing a detected signal which is proportional
to the amount of radioactivity at a point within the patient.
Although the technique of filtered back-projections is based
on the Fourier reconstruction, it is actually accomplished in
the spatial domain, and as a result, each projection can be
processed as measured without a lengthy detour through the
Fourier plane. The reconstructed image can be displayed
seconds after the last scan has been completed. Clinically,
this is an important factor, since all data gathering must be
done while the patient is lying still, so that the image will not
be blurred. Also, the intensity of the radioactivity absorbed
by the patient is only detectable for several minutes. Thus
the ability to obtain quick, "nearly live" pictures of the brain
is paramount to the PET concept.
Aquaintance with the basic techniques used by PET
should prove increasingly helpful and interesting because of
the dramatic potential of innerspace exploration Quiet
predictions of breakthroughs in the study of epilepsy and
multiple sclerosis have heralded PET's coming; in the months
and years ahead, it will surely produce some newsworthy
developments.
It might be premature to imagine Walter Cronkite on cam-
pus for the first epic PET scan; reducing the complexities of
the technique to the lowest common denominator, just as he
did so resolutely during the outer-space program. Actually,
PET is indeed marvelously suited for television. Using a se-
quence of "still shots" of reconstructed images, it is possible
to convey the impression of brain activity seen "live". A
simple sneeze becomes a dramatic eruption of chemical
activity within the brain, and already neuroscientists are
contemplating a study of the patterns of thought itself.
There is a thread of almost Zen-like beauty woven into the
fabric of the PET imaging technique: man's mind striving to
perceive itself.

Learn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my

his native town to be the world, then he who aspires to
become greater than his nature will allow.

The words "genetic engineering" invoke visions of tailor-
made babies and Hitler's Ubermenschen in the minds of
many people. However, the recent developments in the field
of genetic engineering deal with industrial processes — not
the creation of new human forms. These developments in-
volve the use of gene splicing, the inserting of new genetic
material, to force bacteria to produce useful products.
In a 5-4 ruling on June 16, 1980, the Supreme Court de-
cided that new forms of life created by this process can be
patented. Patenting will allow the establishment of a vigor-
ous and highly specialized bioengineering industry by giving
protection to processes developed by the small forerunning
companies in the field. This decision is regarded as a land-
mark that will allow scientists and manufacturers to go
ahead with the development of organisms to perform a vast
variety of tasks.
Cenex, a leading company based in Bethesda, Md., alone
has identified 107 existing products, such as insulin, alcohol,
or plastics, that probably can be manufactured in five to
twenty years using genetic engineering techniques. The total
value of the goods produced in this way could exceed 25
billion dollars a year. This revenue will bolster our economy
and contribute many new jobs to the marketplace.
These economic considerations and the technique's incal-
culable value in the amelioration of human suffering and the
improvement of human living are the reasons why this re-
search should be pursued and we should not, as Dr Franken-
stein suggests, remain ignorant in so valuable a field.
The basic tool of genetic engineering is recombinant DNA
(deoxyribonucleic acid). DNA is a large complex molecule
found in the nucleus of most cells and is the carrier of the
genetic code. It is made up of two long strands of four dif-
ferent types of basic chemical parts called bases, abbrevi-
ated A,T,C, and C. The two strings are wound around each
other in a double helical configuration. The bases in the two
strands are always paired with each other across the helix in
a specific manner: A pairs with T, and C pairs with C. A gene
is a long sequence of base pairs with the information content
encoded by the order of the bases. A typical gene is about
1500 base pairs. The simplest organisms, like single-celled
bacteria, usually have enough DNA for 3000 to 4000 genes.
Cells of higher organisms differ only in the amount of DNA;
the size of the typical gene does not change appreciably.
The cells of the human body contain about 1000 times the
amount of DNA contained in a bacterium, or enough for 3 to
4 million genes. All DNA is identical in chemical composi-
tion, no matter where it comes from. The same four bases
make it up; only the order and number differ. This is what
allows genes from one organism to be put into another.
Because the two strands are complementary, you can sep-
arate the DNA strands, add the proper bases, and two identi-
cal DNA segments will be produced. These segments are
also identical to the original segment. This ability to form
new strands is the key to recombinant DNA.
Recombinant DNA is DNA prepared in such a way that it
can be recombined with other DNA to form a new combina-
tion of genes. This preparation can be accomplished in
several ways but the end result is the transference of genetic
information from one organism to another.
The most useful way of performing this transfer is to splice
the desired genes into a small, circular strand of DNA called
a plasmid. A plasmid carries the genes for self-replication
and any gene placed in it also gets replicated. This is how
bacteria are used to produce a desired product. The desired
genes are placed in an organism, the organism is cultured to
form millions of replicas including the desired product, and
then the product is separated and purified. Eli Lilly and
Cenentech's procedure for manufacturing insulin is a good
example. Synthetic genes for the A and B chains of human
insulin are placed into the pSC101 plasmid of Escherichia
co/i, the bacteria is fermented, killed and broken up, and the
two chains are purified separately. The chains are then com-
bined using standard biochemical techniques.' Other tech-
niques mimic the production of antibiotics in that the pro-
duct is excreted as a waste product.
The fact that genes from one organism can be inserted
into another gives rise to one of the major fears accompan-
ing this research - that a researcher will inadvertently place
the genes for some disease into an organism which escapes
the laboratory and causes an epidemic or destroys the envi-
ronment. This possibility is extremely small, if not non-
existent, for several reasons.
First, researchers are banned from using certain viruses
and bacteria in genetic experiments. While this does not in-
sure that experimenters will not use a restricted agent, the
recent example of Dr. Samuel I. Kennedy at the University of
California at San Diego will serve to illustrate what can
happen if the incident is discovered. Dr. Kennedy mistakenly
cloned a virus which was on the restricted list (although it is
now cleared for use) and was subsequently suspended for a
period of time. This penalty is more than sufficient to a
researcher on the forefront of such a field to discourage such
actions because of the time he loses on his experiments and
the possibility of losing his grants.
Second, strict containment procedures are followed in the
handling of any organisms. These procedures are very effec-
tive as proven by the past record of microbiology. In 25 years
of research at Fort Detrick on millions of samples of the
most virulent and communicable pathogens known, only 423
laboratory infections were seen. Moreover, only one prob-
able case of secondary infection was reported. Similarly, in
the Communicable Disease Center of the U.S. Public Health

case of transmission to a family member. With the weakened
organisms used in genetic engineering, this risk drops to
almost nil.
Third, the organism used for almost all the experiments is
a debilitated strain of Escherichia coli, a bacterium com-
monly found in the intestines of animals. This strain is called
f. coli K12x1776 and was developed by Dr. Roy Curtiss III.
He started with E. coli K12, a strain already weakened by 50
years of culture in laboratory media and selected for certain
reproducible mutations to further weaken it. x1776 now
needs so many extra nutrients and is succeptible to so many
agents it cannot live in even germ-free rats.2 3 This insures
that even if the organism escapes its containment it cannot
survive.
Fourth, the organisms so altered by the process are still
99.9% original DNA and 0.1% foreign DNA. The probability
that such an organism could have a vastly greater virulence
and habitat is exceedingly small. Such an occurence could
be likened to walking into a hardware store, randomly selec-
ting a bolt or screw, forcing it into the case of a fine Swiss
watch, and improve its functioning-ludicrous.
Another common fear is that a terrorist group will use the
technique to start an epidemic. There is simply no reason to
use such a technique for these purposes. It is much easier to
grow an already existing organism like Clostridium botuli-
num, which causes botulism, than to clone a new, probably
ineffective organism via genetic engineering.
The most prevalent fear is that the technique will be used
to alter the human form. The process of genetic engineering
is simply not capable of performing such a feat. The million
of genes necessary to form a viable human are far beyond
the capabilities of the technique to manipulate. Only very
specific genes can be isolated and transferred. The use of a
bacterium as a biochemical factory is far away from the
development of a new human being. I can only say that the
brave new world of Aldous Huxley is not yet upon us.
Title 35, United States Code, Parti, Chapter 10, paragraph
101 states:
Whoever invents or discovers any new
and useful process, machine, manufacture,
or composition of matter, or any new and
useful improvement thereof, may obtain a
patent therefor, subject to the conditions
and requirements of this title.
This paragraph is the basis for patent law. It did not specifi-
cally include lifeforms, however, until 1930 when Congress,
under pressure from plant growers, added the Plant Patent
Act to the Code. Title 35, United States Code, Part 1, Chapter
15, paragraph 161 states:
Whoever invents or discovers and asexu-
ally reproduces any distinct and new variety
of plant, including cultivated sports,
r lutants, hybrids, and newly found seed-
lings, other than a tuber-propagated plant or
a plant found in an uncultivated state, may
obtain a patent therefore, subject to the
conditions and requirements of this title.
This portion of the title was intended to protect newly de-
veloped varieties of flowers that growers were producing.
The basic protection offered by patents is in Title 35,
United States Code, Part 1, Chapter 14, paragraph 154:
Every patent shall contain a short title of
the invention and a grant to the patentee,
his heirs or assigns, for the term of seven-
teen years, subject to the payment of issue
fees as provided for in this title, of the right
to exclude others from making, using, or
selling the invention throughout the United
States, referring to the specification for the
particulars thereof. A copy of the specifica-
tions and drawings shall be annexed to the
patent and be a part thereof.
In addition to this, the Plant Patent Act added Title 35,
United States Code, Part 1, Chapter 14, paragraph 163:
In the case of a plant patent the grant
shall be of the right to exclude others from
asexually reproducing the plant or selling or
using the plant so produced.
This protection is the reason patents are granted. They allow
an inventor to gather the fruits of his labors without fear that
a larger, more established company or individual will begin
production and elbow him out This protection has proved to
be invaluable time and time again and a couple of examples
will serve to illustrate this.
In the early Fifties the xerographic process, a method of
copying printed matter was developed and patented. After
many patent challenges and court battles the patent was
upheld and Xerox has grown to the corporation it is today.
This could not have happened had patents not been in
existence.
"Silicon Valley" is a nickname given to an area south of
San Francisco that sports a profusion of small semicon-
ductor companies. These companies produced specialized
semiconductors whose architectures are protected by
patents. These patents are what allow these companies to
compete with large companies like Texas Instruments who
have a massive marketing and distribution network. Without
them, "Silicon Valley" would still be a line of used-car lots.
The Supreme Court decision will now afford the same pro-
tection to companies in the genetic engineering field. The
decision was made on a case brought by the Ceneral Electric
Company on behalf of Ananda M. Chakrabarty. Chakrabarty
developed a type of Pseudomonas, a common bacterium,
that degrades crude oil into carbon dioxide and protein. The
patent application was filed on June 7, 1972. The United
States Patent Office disallowed the claim, stating that bac-
teria were not covered under the Plant Patent Act. The
Patent Appeals Court then refused to offer a decision, leav-
ing it up to the Supreme Court to decide. The reason for the
decision was that the present laws do not specifically bar the
patenting of microorganisms. They did leave the door open
for Congress to amend the laws but the lack of activity on
Capital Hill probably means that such alterations will not be
forthcoming.
As of June 30, 1980, there were 114 patent applications

Genentech and Eli Lilly's insulin process and eight for
Biogen's interferon (see below). Now that patents will be
approved, companies will be free to continue their pursuits
without having to worry about possible infringement. This
should cause an explosion in research and development with
the resulting benefits proving to be invaluable.
The range of products that can be produced via this tech-
nique is wide and diverse. The medical, agricultural and
industrial fields are expected to benefit greatly from this
process.
The medical field is going to be the first to realize these
benefits. Eli Lilly has begun a 40 million dollar program to
build two factories, one in Spake in the United Kingdom and
one in Indianapolis, Indiana, to produce human insulin. The
first trials were begun last summer at Guy's Hospital in
London, using the synthetic insulin on healthy volunteers.
Last fall, tests began on diabetic patients.4 It is expected that
the human insulin produced by the technique will alleviate
some of the problems involved with using equine and pro-
cine insulin as presently used as well as lower the cost con-
siderably.
The mass production of human growth hormone will be a
boon to the estimated 10,000 American children who suffer
from dwarfism Present supplies come from pituitary glands
removed from cadavers and it takes 50 to 80 cadavers to
provide a single year's dose. Researchers also hope the
hormone can be used to treat stomach ulcers and burns by
stimulating the natural healing processes of the body.
Interferon is potentially the most rewarding product
manufactured by the technique. It is a natural virus fighter
currently being used to combat hepatitis, shingles, herpes
and other viral infections. Researchers hope it will be effec-
tive against certain types of cancers as well. Presently,
interferon is extracted from human white blood cells and so
is very scarce and expensive. A single course of treatment for
a cancer patient can cost $50,000. Using genetic engineering,
the availability will skyrocket and the cost will plummet,
aiding patients greatly.
Other medical uses are in the production of pure vacines
which do not use the disease organism as the source, thus
eliminating the present danger of evoking the disease in
people being immunized, in the manufacture of endorphins,
naturally occuring pain relievers which may replace mor-
phine and other opiates, and other drugs and substances like
other hormones and enzymes.
Agriculture is expected to benefit in several ways. Among
them is the possibility of adding the nitrogen-fixing capa-
bilities of soybeans to corn and wheat and reduce the
amount of petroleum-based fertilizers needed. Also, vac-
cines against hoof-and-mouth and related diseases are being
developed.
Genex has developed a type of yeast to increase the yield
of fermenting grain into alcohol. This will cut the costs of
producing gasohol and stretch our dwindling petroleum
supplies. Other researchers are developing microbes that
change sugar into plastics, again reducing our dependency
on petroleum. Some researchers feel that as much as 10 to
20 percent of all the organic compounds required by the
chemical industry could be made in this manner.
With the proper safeguards, genetic engineering is a safe
and extremely useful process as shown by these examples. It
is a field of research that should be pursued and developed
because of its huge potential to improve human living. The
Supreme Court's decision to allow organisms to be patented
will allow the establishment of a specialized and energetic
genetic engineering industry that will revolutionize the
medical and other fields like the semiconductor industry
revolutionized the electronics field. The vast range of
products and uses and the economic benefits that this
industry will provide in the terms of jobs, services, and
capital gains far outweigh the minimal risks incurred.

The University of Michigan, last of the great engineering
schools to adopt a Co-operative Educational program (if, in-
deed, one is adopted at all), will finally be ready to make a
decision this month on whether to assign a student-faculty
committee to investigate the issue of a co-op program for
the Ann Arbor campus (The Dearborn campus already has a
Coop program).
Basically, a co-op program is one designed to supplement
course work with actual experience in industry. The experi-
ence part is not actually part of the degree, but the purpose
of these programs is to give the student much-needed train-
ing on the job, so that the student is better prepared upon
graduation to enter the work world. Currently, the University
of Michigan's Ann Arbor campus is the only remaining large
engineering school which does not, in general, offer such a
program to the student. Only the Aerospace department and
the Naval Architecture departments have accredited such
programs, with NASA and the Navy, respectively.
The fact that engineering students at U of M do not have
this opportunity puts them at somewhat of a disadvantage.
When a company, faced with the decision of who to hire for
an opening in the company, will invariably hire the engineer-
ing graduate who has several years of experience instead of
one with only theoretical knowledge It has long been recog-
nized that practical experience can be as valuable as college
courses once one enters the work world.
There has been a committee organized by the Engineering
Council called the Cooperative Educational Committee. The
committee conducted a survey of engineering students as
well as the engineering faculty to find out how much interest
these two groups showed in such a program. Also surveyed
were schools which already have co-op programs, to gather
information concerning the implementation and operation
of co-op programs.
Most of the reasons the college has not yet adopted a co-
op program are economic. But is is easy to see that if U of M
does not adopt some sort of program, we may well lose our
status as a highly respected engineering school as a result of
insufficient preparation of students for "the real world."
Look in the next issue of the Technic for a more detailed
article which will explain in depth co-op programs which are
of such vital interest to engineering undergraduate students,
and give more information on the status of such programs on
this campus.

75, 50 and 25 Years Ago
by Jim Lisi
Fellow engineers, the business world awaits us! But what is
really out there? How much will we earn and what kind of
position is in store for us in the wild world of industry? The
Michigan Technic has dealt with these fears in several
articles that have been written over the past 75 years, and
here are a few highlights:
25 Years Ago
Salary has always been one of the major concerns in
choosing a profession. Engineering is no exception, but we
have been blessed by starting salaries that can be three times
what a man or woman makes in a forty hour week at mini-
mum wage. Today, the average starting.salary for an engi-
neer is about $19,000 and the person on minimum makes not
quite $7000 a year. In 1955 the average annual salary rose
4.5% (at that time engineering salaries ranged from 4,500 to
7,000 dollars). The survey that obtained this data was
completed by the Executive Compensation Service at the
American Management Association. The study revealed that
in 1955, the average beginning engineer received $4,500 a
year (how's that for inflation?). The median pay for industrial
engineering positions was approximately $6,000 annually; for
chemical positions, $6,500 and for electrical and mechani-
cal, $7,000. These salaries were just about the same as those
of production foremen and other 'middle management' per-
sonnel. Still these are only starting figures; a good engineer
could travel much farther up the pay scale. Today's begin-
ning figure of $19,000 promises a secure future for the engi-
neering graduate.
50 Years Ago
After a start in engineering, many possibilities and avenues
are open to the engineer. In 1931, the Michigan Technic ran
an article on three UM engineers that went on to "join in con-
trolling the destinies of a great technical society" (sic). The
interests of these three were similar and they all became offi-
cers in the organization called the American Society for
Steel Treating. Ray T. Bay less (class of 1914) became the
assistant secretary in charge of technical activities and A.H.
d'Arcambal (1912) became Vice-President. But the focus of
this article was on John M. Watson, who became President
on the first of January, 1931. He entered the College of Engi-
neering and Architecture in 1906 and gained his diploma in
1909, with a B.S. in Chemical Engineering. He began with a
Texas Portland Cement Company immediately after gradua-
tion as a chemist. He left in March of the following year and
continued his work in the laboratories of the Packard Motor
Car Corporation where he specialized in Metallurgy. After
two years there, Mr. Watson had enough experience to trans-
fer to Wilkes-Barre Pennsylvania to become the engineer of
tests for the Sheldon Axle Company. But then he transferred
again, and five short years after graduation he was back in
Michigan with the Hupp Motor Car Company and remained
there at least until the writing of the article. In his time, Mr.
Watson had become well known as both a metallurgist and
an engineer and for his papers on the preparation and heat
treating of steel.
Mr. d'Arcambal also holds a degree in Chemical Engineer-
ing and was employed as a Consulting Metallurgist with the
Pratt and Whitney Co. in 1931. Mr. Bayless, after working
with a number of companies as a metallurgist, became a
member of A.S.S.T. in 1922. The article on these men con-
cludes in this way, "It is significant that the experience and
training offered by the University of Michigan, is such that
our graduates can hold their heads high among the grad-
uates of other technical schools, and more than share the
honors that are awarded to the successful engineer. Michi-
gan is proud of them, and is happy to congratulate these
three alumni upon their signal honor and success."
Although Michigan is still highly regarded in the technical
world, current economic winds seem to be threatening this
once lofty position. Always at issue is a university's ability to
lure, financially or otherwise, a quality faculty. There is a
growing concern about Michigan's future position in the fa-
culty market; will the blue-chip Ph.D.'s follow the ever-
deepening flow of industries to the Sunbelt?
75 Years Ago
In 1906 a U-M graduate wrote a letter to engineering stu-
dents about his profession, mechanical engineering. This
graduate, E.S. Reid (class of 1893), tried to explain what a
mechanical engineer has to be. The article, "A Talk to
January-February 1981
19


three years after the first manned flight at Kitty Hawk and
during the thrilling first decade of the automobile. Yet his
advice seems worth heeding today, by all the engineering
disciplines, ever though his style seems a little stilted. What
is the overriding qualification an aspiring engineer (presum-
ably male or female) should possess, according to Reid?
"Most of you young men find that things mechanical have
an absorbing interest for you You would count it an
honor to be a builder and a maker in the mechanical world.
That is right. And you must have that idea so strongly that it
will hold you steadily to the task of preparation and make
you impatient to do the real work of an engineer and make
you know you will enjoy it.
"If you are to enjoy your work you must do it well, like it,
live it. You cannot do this unless you have health. The
college preparation may be confining; still it has consider-
able recreation and many diversions. But later the wear and
tear of business, the steady grind of work. . .will be too
much for you unless you are equipped with good health.
Then too, there is the natural mental equipment or aptitude.
You must be a chap who is intent on knowing how things are
built and why things are built as they are; then there is a
possibility of your being good material for a future mechani-
cal engineer," wrote Reid.
What about job hunting? This alum apparently took a
page from Horatio Alger in the chapter on "hustle":
"Someone must give you a chance. Now every man who
has chances to give is a busy man. Such men belong to a
busy world. They have little time for you... If you want con-
sideration, go yourself. Your letter of application is not you.
You may be hours away from the man who reads your letter.
He thinks he might use you. If you were on the spot, alert
and keen for work, he would snap you right up. As it is, he
hesitates to ask you to come to him. . .
"It is not hard for you to see that the world's work can con-
tinue to go on very readily without your help at all. In fact
you must make a place for yourself in it. . . Influence and
friends will not do. You will be disappointed if you rely on
them. Rely on yourself. Do your own hustling."
Even in 1903 there was apparently considerable special-
ization in each branch of engineering. Reid wrote:
"We all do not want to follow the same line of mechanical
engineering. You may fancy some one line more to your lik-
ing than any other. Perhaps you are right, but you may be
sure that almost any line which happens to first offer itself to
you has many interesting points and advantages. It surely
has a future career for someone. Why not for you? At any
rate you will be wise to stay at it until it has given you some-
thing worth while or until you are sure you have exhausted
its possibilities for you."
When E.S. Reid talks, young (wo)men are advised to listen.
A man of great conviction about engineering, he concludes
that "you can rest assured you have chosen a profession
which will fully satisfy your aspirations. It will give you
abundant opportunity for work and an honorable career."

Picture yourself in electronics
at Kodak.
It can be an exciting picture for a new
engineer or science graduate. Because
Kodak is rapidly accelerating into the elec-
tronic technology of tomorrow. We need
bright ideas and fast thinking to help us
apply this technology to the more than
30,000 products Kodak markets.
That leaves no time for leisurely appren-
ticeships. You could find yourself immedi-
ately in projects involving microprocessors,
microprocessor controlled servo systems,
laser writing, digital data processing, an-
alog signal processing, input/output inter-
facing, opto-electronics, or experiment
monitoring and control equipment.
You may work on designing products,
developing components that go into prod-
ucts, or creating equipment to manufac-
ture components and products.
If you're interested in a career in elec-
tronics and have a degree with course work
to match your interest, we look forward to
discussing the diversity and opportunities
you can enjoy with us. See a Kodak campus

The electric car you see here is one of a pair of
experimental vehicles GE is developing for the De-
partment of Energy.
With a projected range of 100 miles at a con-
stant 45 mph, it's so much better than previous
models that there's hardly any comparison.
What's made this big difference is elec-
tronics. A GE-designed microcomputer manages
energy flow throughout the propulsion system, regu-
lating power demand to extend the car's range.
The power-conditioning
unit contains another major GE
innovation: special high-power
transistors.
They're the world's most
efficient high-power transistors,
capable of switching 400 volts and
350 amps on or off in less than a mil-
lionth of a second. Yet the silicon
chip that contains them is less than half the size of a
postage stamp!
These high-power transistors have three
important functions.
They regulate the speed, torque and accelera-
tion of the car's DC motor.
Their high-frequency characteristics also make
them ideal as components for the car's over-
night charging system.
Finally, the transistors play a bie role in the
car's regenerative braking system. They nelp change
the motor automatically into a generator, supplying
braking power to the wheels and producing current
to partially recharge the batteries.
What's coming down the road after this
advanced vehicle? GE engineers are developing one
that's even more advanced. It's a hybrid that will
bum far less fuel than an all-petroleum-powered car
and have even greater range and power than the
all-electric. It too will feature microelectronic con-
trols...but of even greater sophistication.
Looking for new and practical solutions to
transportation problems is just one example of
research in progress at GE. We're constantly inves-
tigating new technologies, new materials and in-
novative applications for existing technologies—in
such areas as energy sources, motors and drives,
aerospace systems.
This takes talent — engineering talent — not
just in research and development, but in design and
manufacturing, application and sales.

The Michigan Technic, pub-
lisher of this magazine, is a non-
profit organization operated by
students at the University of Michi-
gan. However, there is no other
affiliation with,or financial support
from the University.
The views or attitudes ex-
p ;ssed do not necessarily repre-
-t t the opinions of the publisher,
or the College of Engineering.
Whoa, here it is at the end of a term again? Boy, this one sure flew by in a
hurry! Seems like all my friends have got jobs now, and I'm still stuck here. How
come I always seem to take twice as long to do something as anyone else? Ah,
well, 1982, here I come!
If you will be so kind as to peruse our Technic Staff list, you will see that ifs
grown substantially since our last issue. This is thanks to the mass meeting which
we held on that important thursday at the beginning of March. I'd like to wel-
come aboard all those new people, they're a great bunch, and I am going to at-
tempt to get in touch with those who could not make it to the meeting but got
word to us they were interested anyway.
Now normally, I don't like to duplicate the table of contents on this page (guest
editorials notwithstanding), but I want to call your attention to the article by
Stephen R. Undy in this issue on the co-op engineering program. This University
doesn't have such a program and I think it would be to the benefit of all if one
was introduced here. The administrative costs mentioned in the article could be
at least partially overcome by, perhaps, an extra fee for the students in the pro-
gram, or even by the companies participating in the program. What the heck,
most of the companies which would be interested give pretty good size dona-
tions to the U of M outright (some of which would pay for the program entirely),
so maybe they should be asked to contribute. I think we should all support this
program. If you rea//y want to see this come about, then write a letter to the
deans office expressing your support Student rallys, petitions and poster cam-
paigns do not attract nearly the attention of individual letters, since each letter
must be opened individually, read, and replied to (if you ask for a reply, which I
strongly recommend). I cannot emphasize how important this letter writing cam-
paign is, so do it now, before you forget! With enough student input, we can bring
the program to the U and make our education work for us!
And now, to provide that occasional needed study break around finals time,
we present you with this fourth and final issue for this year of the Michigan Tech-
nic. We've tried to keep the contents light reading so as to make sure this is a
relaxing issue. Good luck in the job market and/or see you next fall!

takes a hard look at telephone traffic.
As a result, calls flow more
smoothly through the nationwide
network.
Shortly after Trevor Byer
came to Bell Labs in 1976, we
asked him to join a design team
tackling a big job. Their task:
find a way to determine the
accuracy, completeness and
timeliness of the hundreds of
millions of traffic measurements
collected weekly in the Bell
System. The job was important
because engineers and managers
at each Bell telephone company
use the measurements to assure
that enough equipment and
circuits are available to meet
customer demands.
The solution that Trevor Byer's
team came up with was the
Centralized System for Analysis
and Reporting, or CSAR. Trevor
focused on determining how
much information telephone com-
pany managers needed, and how
that information could best be
reported to them. His responsi-
bilities ranged from software
design and systems engineering
to field testing of reports and
training of CSAR users. With a
BS and MS in Electrical Engi-
neering from the University of
Illinois, Trevor was prepared
for the job.
Here's how CSAR works. Once
a week all the Bell telephone
companies transmit performance
data from their computers to a
central computer in Piscataway,
N. J. Overnight, CSAR analyzes
the information, organizes it
for use in many ways, including
management reports designed
by Trevor, and stores it for
retrieval the next day.
From their own computer
terminals, CSAR users in the
telephone companies request a
variety of reports: from sum-
maries of switching system
performance for an entire com-
pany to detailed performance
of individual switching systems.
The reports can be displayed
graphically to summarize
performance trends over weeks,
months, or longer.
CSAR is one of more than a
hundred computer-based systems
used by the Bell System to pro-
vide better network performance
and better service to customers.

Assuming a forced nonchalant air, I leaned against
the corridor's yellow cinderblock wall. I didn't sit
down and relax because I wanted to remain sharp and
quick when it was my turn to interview. There were
other people waiting in the cooridor for their own
interviews. Some sat quietly, diligently concentrating
on developing their first professional ulcers. Others
chattered nervously to whomever had the misfortune
of sitting next to them. But all of them studied their
neighbors, from head to toe, carefully sizing up and
subconsciously hating the competition. Some sat in
isolated chairs or clustered on the three vinyl couches
that were spaced along the corridor Occasionally one
would look up from a textbook he was pretending to
read or cease conversation when one of the dozen
little doors opened and a company representative
called out a name.
The interviewees all pretended to be calm, but in-
side they were all going through mental anguish and
their emotions were wound into tense little knots. Any
uninvolved observers could easily pick out the tell
tale signs: tight drawn up shoulders, busy talking
hands, wetting of pants. Perhaps part of the anguish
was a result of having to wear those stamped-outof-
the-same-mold conservative interview suits, at least I
thought so. I was always of the opinion that you could
turn any bright and aware college senior into a quiver-
ing mass of Jello just by making them wear a navy
blue three piece, a starched white shirt, and some
ghastly maroon tie. Or maybe their tension was the
sickening awareness that they were busily attempting
to sell their souls to some pointy-eared representative
from one of the countless corporations. Well, it must
be scary to willingly sacrifice your individuality to
become a corporate clone. For what? Twenty thou-
sand a year and a false sense of security. At least I had
bigger plans.
I smiled inwardly at my appraisal of my fellow com-
petitors. Their black dress shoes seemed to clash with
all their young innocent faces. The clothes they all
wore and their nervousness were both symptoms of
"The Came." All of them had to be aware of the fact
that they were playing an immense game. A demean-
ing game in which they had had no part in writing the
rules.
I too, had once played the game, by the "rules", and
had lost. Then I'd played it straight and had allowed
my personality to shine through-and had lost again
But today I was going to interview for the job that I
would not let pass by. This time I was going to play a
game of my own creation, and take this job.
Looking at my watch, I knew that in a few moments
it would be my turn. I inspected my clothing, brushed
a smudge from my black leather pants, and straight-
ened my lace-up leather vest. My riding boots might
have been a bit too bold, but, hey, I was wearing a
white shirt and a red tie. Pushing off the wall and
standing up straight, I knew I was ready for the inter-
view. After careful research I found that AIC had
everything I desired in a company: a shoddy corporate
structure, inept administrators, and many power hun-
gry, boot-kissing yesmen. Also by some seemingly
accidental occurence, AIC had become a significant
multinational with holdings in twenty four countries.
Yes, I would go far at AIC.
The door to my interview room opened and some
poor sap staggered out. It looked as if the company
rep. had easily won the half hour mental fencing
match. The student seemed confused; he didn't know
whether to let out a sigh of relief or to cry. Deciding
not to make a decision, he used his shirt sleeve to
wipe the perspiration from his brow and by the way he
looked, he could have wrung out his suit as well.
Whew! This interviewer might be tougher than I
thought.
The company rep waddled into the hallway and
called out, "Julian Alexander?"
I confidently walked toward him and thrust out my
hand.
"Hello. That's me."
"Hello, my name's Wallace Dorfmann. Please come
in."
He grinned fiendishly and crushed my hand with a
steelvise handshake. I followed him into the claustro-
phobic little room while shaking my hand to regain
circulation. He dropped into his chair and I slouched
into mine. Wally eyed me suspiciously and scribbled
something into his notebook. He probably wasn't into

Wally looked about forty-nine, maybe a little older.
He wore his graying hair in an Army buzzcut. I marvel-
ed at the way his crowsfeet started at the corners of
his gray eyes and delicately curved down his cheeks
to be lost in the folds of fat around his neck I was
slightly intimidated by his size. He seemed to com-
pletely fill the little room and crowd me into a tight
corner. Wallace was about six foot four and wide
enough to have once been a pro-football player or
maybe even a gladiator, but now he was only obese.
His belly hung over his belt and his neck spilled out
over his collar. God, even his hands were fat. His eyes
bulged out as if his whole suit were squeezing him too
tight. He kind of reminded me of old Mr. Toad in "The
Wind in the Willows."
Mr. Toad scanned me from top to bottom and from
right to left, and then he croaked, "Yesterday I spoke
with this student who slouched so deep into his chair,
I thought he was going to fall asleep Needless to say,
he didn't get a job with AIC."
I began to straighten up but instantly relaxed. So
the mind games were already beginning. I counter-
attacked, "You don't mind if I smoke do you?"
I lit up before he could answer, yes or no.
His face screwed up and he puffed, "Well-yes I
do."
I replied with "genuine" regret, "Oh, I'm very sorry.
I'll just finish this one."
Touche.
Wally grumbled under his breath. I wasn't sure, but
I thought it was something about "these young
upstarts."
"Julian, I'll start by telling you something about our
company. Then I'll ask you a few questions to deter-
mine if your interests and qualifications match our
needs. After that I'll leave the floor open to you. Is
that all right with you?"
I nodded in silent agreement and hoped I wouldn't
nod off during another dull orientation speech.
"Amalgamated Industrial Conglomerates is a man-
agement and holding company for some fifteen
assorted companies. What we basically do is use our
managerial experience to run these companies for
their owners and stock holders. And attempt to use
our group buying power to all of our mutual advan-
tages. We're kind of a budding Ceneral Motors. Ha,
ha, ha."
Boring, boring, boring. Oh, a joke. "Ha, ha, ha."
He chortled some more and went on, "We have
plans to expand our managerial staff and —garble,
mumble, blah"
Knowing all this, I stopped listening and focused
my eyes on the pulsing vein on the side of Wally's
head. Then I turned my smile, nod, and look interest-
ed muscles on automatic, and thought of sunny
beaches, the texture of my girlfriend's hair, and
running barefoot in the sand.
". and so, Julian, your work experience and scho-
lastic performance seem very acceptable. But what
we have to find out is if you are really and AIC kind of
guy"
Uh - oh, what? AIC material, huh? If old Wally only
knew how well I'd fit into AIC.
"So tell me, what impresses you most about our
company?"
"Well, I was very impressed with the way your com-
pany destabilized the country of Muracow and install-
ed your own hand picked president to free up its min-
eral resources."
Wallace looked flustered, then burst out, "You
should know full well that the special Senate Subcom-
mittee found us innocent of any wrongdoing of that
nature."
As a rebuttal, I gave him a knowing smile.
He glowered at me and asked, "What single class
have you taken that you think will help you most at
our company?"
Here was my chance to impress him "I received an
A + in Dirty Tricks 510."
"Is that a Business course?"
"Of course." I snickered to myself.
He seemed pleased and busily scribbled some
more. Then he studied my resume and frowned, "What
does this mean here? Close connections with God?"
This was part of my new strategy, lie up a storm.
"Well, my uncle's a priest and he owes me money."
He looked at me with disbelief and continued,
"How about this? Friends in the Mafia?"
"My dad's a fight promoter and he knows all kinds
of people. Is there anyone you really dislike?"
He silently shook his head and had a pale blank
expression on his face. I wondered if he thought I was
serious. He hunched down and launched a loaded
question.
"What position would you like to apply for in our
company?"
"Ideally, I'd like to work in AlC's main offices rather
than in one of the individual companies. This would
fit best into my plans as to where I'm going to take
your company. A job I wouldn't mind starting with is
to work with you, recruiting. That way I could hire the
kind of people I think are necessary to turn AIC
around."
In instants, Wally went from cool to full boil.
"Work with me? Your plans? The kind of people you
want? Why you cocky bastard." He rose out of his
chair and spouted, "Why don't you just leave right
now!"
I leaned back, calmly lit another cigarette, and
waited for Wally to run out of breath. His face had
turned from red to a deep shade of purple after I lit
up, but now he was rapidly running out of insults.
Eventually Wally stopped sputtering and stared at

A Decision
by Stephen R. Undy
The University of Michigan Engineering School
doesn't have a co-op program. Does it need one?
While an article of this scope can't hope to answer
that question definitively, perhaps the reader will feel
better prepared to advance an opinion on the topic
after reading it. Presented here are some of the factors
involved in deciding whether a co-op program should
be introduced here.
A co-operative education program is one that
allows engineering students to alternate semesters
working in industry with semesters studying full time.
A student enrolled in this type of program may thus
graduate with two years of working experience in his
field.
Michigan is one of the few major universities that
doesn't have some sort of an engineering internship
program. MIT, Stanford, Purdue, Illinois, Michigan
Tech and U of M Dearborn are but a few of the
colleges that feel that a co-op program is a valuable
part of an engineering education. The programs vary
widely from institution to institution; the University of
Cincinatti requires that all of its' engineering students
take co-op, while at Purdue, a student must have a 3.0
grade point average to qualify for internship. Though
they differ slightly, all of the programs take five years
to complete.
The question arises as to why Michigan doesn't
have this type of a program. In October, the Engi-
neering Council formed a committee to try to answer
that question and to see how a co-op program would
fit into Michigan. This committee, headed by J. Clarke
Anderson, wrote to schools with internships to gain an
overview of what types of programs exist nationwide
The committee also surveyed faculty, students and
technical societies to determine their opinions.
The committee stated in its report that "there is a
definite interest at U. of M." for a co-op program. The
committee has slowed down its activities, waiting for
official authorization to continue any useful activ-
ities. They need the support of the Deans' office to
become a voice of the engineering college. They hope
that such support will be soon forthcoming.
From the students' standpoint, a co-op program has
several real advantages. First, a student gains practi-
cal experience. This is not only beneficial to finding
permanent employment, it also provides an environ-
ment where (s)he can gain insight into what (s)he is
learning in class and why. For many, the concrete
application of engineering theory helps them better
understand such theory. So, co-op could be consider-
ed a teaching aid.
Another advantage is that a student is guaranteed
an engineering job and that the student will be
coming back to the same company. This is something
a summer job cannot always offer.
The biggest advantage the student feels immediate-
ly is monetary. A student can earn enough to pay for
school. At Purdue, for instance, a co-op student earns,
on the average, $17,000 while an undergraduate.
The only major disadvantage to co-op for the
student is that it does take an extra year (it rarely takes
less than 4Vi now at Michigan anyway —ed) That
means one less year at the professional salary level
for the co-op student.
How many students are really interested in a co-op
program? When the co-op committee surveyed the
various technical societies at Michigan, it found that
30% of their members were interested - a substantial
number. In fact, a similar survey in 1970 showed the
same results.
Even more impressive was the response to the
student surveys. Fully one hundred percent of the res-
pondents were in favor of a co-op program. Many
surveys had some very encouraging comments written
in:
"Knowing what I know now, as a senior, actual field
experience provides a valuable basis for further
book work. If implemented I would urge my brother
. .to sign up immediately"
Michigan Technic


dents' opinions as a whole, it does indicate that a co-
op proposal deserves serious consideration.
The official veiwpoint here at Michigan is far more
complicated. The faculty sees things in a different
way than the administration does.
The co-op committee found that the faculty had no
major objections. Professors in some departments,
such as mechanical and naval, are in favor of bringing
co-op to Michigan. These, and other, departments are
already heavily involved with industry and an intern-
ship program would not be hard to implement. In fact,
the mechanical engineering department presently has
a version of co-op available. The same professors that
endorse coop, however, also have fears that their
relations with industry might become decentralized
with the advent of co-op. They don't want it to take
away any contact they have with industry.
By far, the administration is faced with the toughest
decision. They see many advantages, but also many
disadvantages.
Some say that U of M loses prospective students
because of our lack of a co-op program. Instituting a
program here would definitely attract students who
want job experience or who would normally be
unable to afford the tuition here.
It can be argued that the quality of education here
(already high) would be greatly improved. The
teaching philosophy at Michigan is theory-oriented.
We are a research institution. It is debatable whether
a co-op program would complement this philosophy
or not.
In any case, starting a co-op program and then sus-
taining it would be quite expensive. A co-op coordina-
tor would have to be hired, his sole purpose to
organize and maintain the program. This is no easy
task. His job is not even clearly defined at this point.
He would also need a staff that would vary in size
with the number of students participating. This would
cost the college from $75,000 to $125,000 yearly.
There are also hidden costs. More classes would
have to be offered spring-summer term to provide
students working fall or winter terms with the
necessary courses. This would mean that professors
normally doing research during the summer would be
forced to teach classes. Research would be cut down,
and since research provides the university with a large
portion of its funding, this would represent a loss in
income.
There is one more viewpoint to consider, that of
industry. A company with co-op would be assured of a
highly qualified, experienced worker when they hire a
co-op student upon graduation from the five-year
program. According to Clarke "Two thirds of the
people at Purdue get hired by the company they work
for."

me, unsure as to why I was so completely unper-
turbed.
Now it was my turn. "Mr. Dorfmann, do you remem-
ber that sweet young coed you picked up in the bar
last night?"
Wally's jaw dropped, his tongue hung out He
carried the expression of someone being garrotted
from behind. It was difficult to keep from laughing. I
put my hand over my mouth and pretended to cough.
"Now Mr. Dorfmann, please sit down."
I beckoned him to a chair. He was beginning to
sweat.
"That woman's name wasn't Suzi and she really
wasn't an eighteen year old college student. Oh, you
might feel better if you loosened your tie."
Wallace regained a little self control. "Now I don't
know what you're talking about boy. And you can't
prove anything, so just leave."
I reached into my shirt pocket and then slid a photo
across the table. "Wally, did you know you photo-
graph quite well wearing nothing but socks and elastic
supporters? By the way, is this your correct home
address?"
Poor Wally acted as if he was ready to have a
seizure or something. He quivered and shook like a
person trying to wake up from a bad dream
"I'm sure your wife and daughters would appreciate
seeing these photos. And how old are your daughters?
Sixteen and -"
"I'm going to call my attorney, and, and - now what
do you want Julian?" he pleaded.
"You can start by calling me, Mr. Alexander."
Wallace was crushed, with some gagging, he said,
"Please Mr. Alexander, what do you want from me?"
I blew a smoke ring at him. "I'd like you to recom-
mend me, with four stars, for trainee as an executive
assistant in the main office, your office."
"Bu, bu but-wait."
I stood up and shook his now limp hand, then open-
ed the door
"Thank you for interviewing me and I'll be expect-
ing a job offer in the mail in a week to ten days. While
you're at it you can ask all these other candidates to
go home. After all, there's no need to talk to any of
them anymore, is there? Have a good day."
Wally sank into his chair and quietly sobbed. His
chin rested on his chest and his arms hung limply at
his sides.
Walking home, I began to whistle. That had been a
good interview. Yes, I was going to go far at AIC.

Tunable semiconductor lasers can now measure specific gases in
automotive exhaust with 25-millisecond response time. A successful
strategy for improving laser reliability developed at the General Motors

.HE ACHIEVEMENT of long
lifetime and frequency stability
makes the lead-tin-telluride diode
laser a practical infrared spectrom-
eter. Earlier innovations brought to
this laser the characteristics of in-
creased power, higher temperature
operation, greater efficiency and
wider tuning range.
Operating in the 5- to 10-mi-
cron range, the PbSnTe laser spec-
trometer can resolve the time-
dependent emission of carbon
monoxide, sulfuric acid vapor,
methane and other species of inter-
est in automotive exhaust. This
permits measurement of tran-
sients in carbon monoxide to car-
bon dioxide gas conversion in a
catalytic converter. This capability
represents a significant advance
over conventional spectroscopy in-
strumentation. The laser is also
being tested by NASA for use in
detecting the molecular species in-
volved in chemical reactions in the
stratosphere.
New knowledge of the proc-
ess by which laser reliability is
compromised has been revealed in
fundamental studies conducted by
Dr. Wayne Lo and his colleagues at
General Motors. Dr. Lo's investiga-
tions have demonstrated that laser
lifetime and stability are limited by
the development of excessive elec-
trical contact resistance. He has
been able to stop increases in re-
sistance by devising a multilayer
ohmic contact consisting of
different metal films. This
configuration has extended laser
operating lifetime to more than
1,000 hours and increased shelf-life
an estimated 25 years.
Slow degradation due to a
gradual increase in contact resis-
tance was observed in idle lasers
stored at room temperature, but
not in lasers maintained at a max-
imum temperature of 77 K, despite
several hundred hours of continu-
ous operation. These results sug-
gested the temperature-dependent
process of diffusion.
Degradation occurred pri-
marily on the p-type side of the
laser, where the contact consisted
of a thin layer of gold followed by a


probe analyses revealed that in-
dium, a semiconductor donor, was
diffusing through the gold layer
into the crystal, apparently causing
a reduction in hole carrier concen-
tration near the p-surface. This
effect was counteracted to a great
degree by sandwiching a thin layer
of platinum between the layers of
indium and gold. Laser reliability
reached a full year.
When degradation was still
observed, although to a reduced
extent, Dr. Lo advanced the hypoth-
esis that diffusion and transport
were taking place along grain bound-
aries in the polycrystalline con-
tact layers. He proposed replacing
the Pt-Au barrier with a three-layer
structure. Since palladium film
structures have fewer grain bound-
aries than those of platinum, provid-
ing fewer leakage paths for the in-
dium, Pd was tested in place of Pt.
D,
rIODE LASERS composed of
Pb086Sn,, ,.,Te and fabricated with a
variety of contacts were main-
tained at 60° C in order to acceler-
ate aging, with periodic
interruptions for testing. The re-
sults showed that a multilayer
structure of In-Au-Pd-Au, in which
the grain boundaries tend to be
misaligned, provides maximal re-
duction of indium penetration,
confirming Dr. Lo's hypothesis.
The misaligned boundaries
force diffusion to take place lat-
erally, which slows transport into
the crystal. The additional layer
slows the process even further.
Solving the contact problem
represents the culmination of
efforts that began at General
Motors with the development of an
"ingot-nucleation" vapor transport
method for growing crystals. The
resulting crystals are of high pur-
ity, with a dislocation density of less
than 1000 cm.2 Lasers made from
these crystals incorporate a low
temperature cadmium-diffused p-n
junction. This process, invented by
Dr. Lo, increases the laser's output
to five milliwatts.
A tuning range of 500 cnr1
and pulsed operating temperatures
of up to 140 K are achieved by a
two-step annealing process. This
technique induces a graded carrier
concentration that increases infra-
red light confinement in the laser
structure, thus reducing losses and
increasing output.
"These innovations," says Dr.
Lo, "combine to produce a laser
that allows us to make measure-
ments previously impossible."

People building transportation to serve people


75, 50 and 25 Years Ago
by Jim Lisi
During the past century, large advances have been
made in the area of transportation We moved from
earthly travel to air travel and, now to space travel. In
1906, the University of Michigans' experimental ship
tank was coming to completion In 1931, this country
was assaulting the airspace with the flying devices
known as dirigibles. And in 1956, the country was pio-
neering the way towards modern space travel as it
launched satellites to gather information about the
earth. Stories about these topics were published in the
Michigan Technic as these events unfolded. Today,
they are a part of our history as the building blocks of
America's heritage of being the leaders in the worlds'
transportation field.
75 Years Ago
In 1906, Herbert C Sadler, a professor of marine
engineering, wrote an article on the Universitys' ship
testing tank. The tank itself is 300 feet long, 22 feet
wide and 10 feet deep. The length of the tank is the
minimum length that can be used in order to allow for
starting, obtaining uniform speed, and stopping. The
width and depth are large enough so as not to have
any influence on the action of the model under test.
Spanning the tank is a travelling truck which runs on
rails set on either side of the tank This truck is run by
a 25 hp. motor which varies in speed from 10 to 800
feet per minute.
The models used are ten to twelve feet long and
represent vessels of any size. These represent a full
sized ship and the resistance of the hull is calculated
by Froude's law of comparison. This is done in two
parts as the frictional resistance is determined by the
hull material and the wave resistance is determined
by the testing. Mr Sadler says, "The subject of resis-
tance of ships forms is one which requires a large
amount of investigation, and it is expected that the
work done at the University will help towards the
solution of many problems and prove a benefit to the
profession of Naval Architecture as a whole."
For those who may not know where the testing tank
is located, it can be found in the east wing of the West
Engineering building in the basement The tank is one
of the major engineering feats of the early part of the
century, and is a distinguishing characteristic of the
University because it remains as one of only three
privately owned testing tanks in the country
50 Years Ago
In 1931, zepplins were the crafts that ruled the sky.
This was the age of the Hindenburg and the disaster
that cost Nazi Germany much prestige in the pre-
WWII world The U.S*was very much involved in the
development of dirigibles, although the Germans led
the field. The Michigan Technic article, which ran in
May, 1931, began like this, "Down in Akron, Ohio, a
great structure is nearing completion. When complet-
ed, the capability of this masterpiece of engineering
ingenuity will far surpass anything yet known in the
world today, and, in all reality, is the fulfillment to the
dreams of many great men." This dirigible was the
Navy project called the 'Akron."
These ships were lighter than air ships. They were
supported by huge volumes of hydrogen gas. As you
know, hydrogen gas is highly flammable and great
precautions were taken to prevent explosive acci-
dents. Although this fact was well known at the time,
dirigibles remained one of the most popular modes of
travel In the first World War, 88 zeppelins took to the
air for the Germans, all utilizing hydrogen gas, and
became easy targets for incendiary bullets. These
craft were well appreciated for their ability to reco-
noiter and spot enemy plans before they were sprung.
The Akron was a special ship. It did not employ hy-
drogen gas, but instead, used helium gas. This reduced
12
Michigan Technic


They claimed that the possibility of a fire on the
Akron could only be due to the gasoline used in the
engines and that this possibility was less than if you
were actually driving an automobile. Collisions
caused the fires in cars and this was next to impossible
in an airship. The ship itself, was to be 'the largest,
most modern and strongest ship in the world.' It had a
cubical lifting gas displacement of 6.5 million cubic
feet and a total cubical displacement of 7 million
cubic feet. By comparison to the ships of that day, it
would be two times the size of the 'Graf Zeppelin' and
abot two and a half times the size of the Goodyear dir-
igible 'Los Angeles.' The total lift of the Akron was
403,000 pounds with a useful lift of 182,000 pounds;
this was a 45% useful lift as compared to the Los
Angeles' 39%. Another advantage to the Akron was. in
the positioning of its power plant. Previously, the hy-
drogen ships had to place their motor outside of the
ship in cars attached by outriggers so as to supply
ample ventilation and prevent the possiblity of a
spark reaching the explosive hydrogen. But, in the
Akron, the motor could be placed inside the casing
because of the use of helium. This was a great advan-
tage because it reduced drag and allowed greater tra-
velling speeds, although it gave the crew less room to
work in.
The ship ran on eight 560 hp. motors, giving it a
total horsepower of 4480 and an estimated maximum
speed of 83.8 miles per hour. When travelling at
cruising speed, 50 knots, the range without refueling
was 10,500 miles, enabling it to travel around the
world with only one refueling stop.
Today dirigibles have been outmoded by motorized
and jet propelled aircraft.
25 Years Ago
In 1956, man was making his first steps toward
space travel. The 1957-58 year was called the Inter-
national Geophysical Year as ten man-made satellites
were launched in order to obtain data on the earth.
These satellites would circle the earth for two weeks
or two months, gathering data on the ionosphere. Be-
fore this, readings were difficult to take because brief
rocket flights into the upper atmosphere were short.
The use of satellites allowed instruments to be placed
in the sky and more accurate readings to be taken for
the first time. The first of the man-made moons
launched during the ICY was elliptical in shape, about
30 inches long and consisted of three stages. The in-
struments contained in the satellite gathered informa-
tion on the composition of the earths' crust, the
precise shape of the globe, ultraviolet radiation from
the sun, the action of cosmic rays and the electrical
currents in the ionosphere. Several different tech-
niques of gathering information were tried on the
different satellites as we examined the best method
for gathering data.
These space missiles were fired into orbit at an
angle of 40 degrees. Within two minutes of takeoff,
the 21.5 Ib. head would have a velocity of 4000 mph,
dropping the first stage 30-40 miles above the earth.
The second booster raised the speed to 11,000 mph to
an altitude of 130 miles, while the third stage acceler-
ated the rocket to 18,000 mph and into the orbit that it
traveled around the earth. Michigan experts helped
greatly in paving the way towards launching the first
satellite. Research groups here at the University of
Michigan were involved all along the way. One elec-
trical engineering group took part in over 400 rocket
firins in an Air Force project from 1946 to 1956.
As they looked into the future from the fifties,
many things have come true in accordance with
their expectations. They looked for satellites to relay
television signals, which has already happened, and as
launching platforms and refueling stations for-space
ships. Even this may be coming true as the space shut-
tle is prepared to be launched in the early part of April
(editors' note: if everything goes on schedule, the
shuttle launch will have occurred by the time this issue
is out) Back then, the cost of the project was $28
million; try doing it for that today-heck, one of our
Navy's aircraft is $29 million!

The curse of senioritis
A deadly bad disease
imbues an uneeded wanderlust
to escape to fantasy.
The curse of senioritis
It makes the pages blur
and the eight AM lectures —
their meanings start to slur.
The curse of senioritis
It makes the will go limp.
The mind just floats on by
just like the Goodrich blimp.
The curse of senioritis
you just don't give a damn.
You've stuffed it in for so long now
there's no place left to cram.
The curse of senioritis
means your stomach's nearly dead
from ulcers over long gone tests
and sleepless nights of dread.
The curse of senioritis —
In class they say you snored.
The juniors are attentive
but the seniors all are bored.
The curse of senioritis.
Your grade cares are all gone.
A short funeral dirge before exams —
but the malady lingers on.
The curse of senioritis
affects us every day.
Some students catch it freshman year —
now they're at MSU!
The curse of senioritis
It's caught so late at night.
The homework's pushed you to the ropes —
so why not throw the fight?
The curse of senioritis
means you've fought almost four years.
For some, those nuts, have stayed here more-
(I think — too many beers!)
The curse of senioritis
means it hurts to go to class.
You'd rather interview for bucks
and merely work to pass.
The curse of senioritis
means soon your life will thrive.
You'll soon be like those 'normal' folks
whose workday ends at five (pm).
The curse of senioritis
strikes Chuck, or lill, or Bob.
It's non-discriminatory
and it always ends in a job.
The curse of senioritis —
You thought you'd escaped its' rule—
But now you're stuck in a boring job and you yearn again for school!

RIGHT THROUGH YOUR
SENIOR YEAR.
If you're a junior or senior
majoring in sciences like
math, physics or engineering,
the Navy has a program you
should know about.
It's called the Nuclear
Propulsion Officer Candidate
Program (NUPOC for short)
and if you qualify, you
can earn over $800 a month
right through your senior
year. Then after 16 weeks of
Officer Candidate School,
you'll get an additional year
of graduate level technical
education. This would cost
thousands in a civilian school,
but in the Navy, we pay you.
It isn't easy. There
are fewer than 400 openings
and only one of every six
applicants will be selected.
But if you make it, you'll
have unequaled hands-on
responsibility, a salary of more
than $33,000 in four years, and
gilt-edged qualifications for
jobs both in the Navy and out.
Ask your placement officer
to set up an interview with a
Navy representative when he
visits the campus, or contact
your Navy representative at
800-841-8000, or send in the
coupon. The NUPOC Program.
Not only can it help you
complete college. It can be the
start of an exciting career.

FORTRAN
A language modelled after Egyptian hieroglyphics. Upon
learning this, King Tut rolled over in his grave.
This language was written by a man with sixteen fingers,
and can only be used effectively by a similar person.
This language was designed to make people who know
nothing about computers think they do.
This 'compiler compiler' is used to create languages that
are usually laughed at.
A very terse language, allowing only one letter com-
mands. Ambiguity is very common.
The only language written by people who knew nothing
about computers.
The language used by Gomez Addams to run his train
layout.
Since most of the languages on MTS are written in
EXPL, this is the one to blame for all your troubles
This language is proof positive that the founders of IBM
were Italian, for it consists entirely of spaghetti code.
This language converts all S's, SH's and Z's to TH's, e.g.
INPUT = She sells sea shells by the sea shore'
OUTPUT = 'The thells thea thells by the thea thore.'

The effect of using this language is like having your
brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round

This language produces many errers.
While your program starts out small, it keeps rolling
along until it has gathered all memory, known and con-

Dack into the earth.
The diamond is Man-Made
diamond developed by General
Electric. Man-Made diamond
crystals are pressed into a
polycrystalline "blank." When
this blank is attached to drill
bits like the one pictured
here, it provides a highly ef-
ficient cutting tool to probe
deep into the earth.
Drill bits which in-
clude diamond blanks can
as much as double the
penetration rates of steel
bits in drilling for oil and gas.
In one of the most successful
applications in the North Sea,
these drill bits cut the cost of bor-
ing through shale by nearly 30%— for a
total saving of close to $300,000.
Two remarkable engineering breakthroughs
were required for the development of these drill bits.

GE as a leader i n superpressure science.
Then GE invented the technology which com-
pacts the small, powdery Man-Made diamond into far
larger disks (as large as 12 mm. in diameter by as much as
i mm. thick). Since these disks arc composed of many
nonaligned crystals, they resist the massive destructive
fracturing which occurs in large,
single-crystal natural diamond.
Instead, these disks tend to
microfracture, constantly expos-

out destroying the diamond

Creating new en-

developments include a
proprietary epoxy catalyst
that's cured by ultraviolet

led to the Lucalox" lamp —a
highly energy-efficient form of
street lighting.
GE is constantly investigating new
technologies and innovative applications for
existing technologies—in such areas as electrical distribu-
tion systems, electronic components, environmental sys-
tems. This takes talent —engineering talent —not just in
research and development, but in design and manufac-
turing, application and sales.

Does Technical Challenge
TUrn You On?
You may find exactly what you're looking for at Procter
&amp; Gamble.
The fatty alcohol distillation unit shown above was de-
signed and built by P&amp;G engineers, as is almost every-
thing else we use in our business. This includes process
lines for more than 50 consumer products, monitoring
and control devices, high speed packaging equipment,
pollution control systems, and building and warehouse
facilities. Much of this work is state of the art. A new
plant, for example, has a main boiler taller than our 11-floor
General Office headquarters building in Cincinnati!
In Fiscal 1979-80 we spent over $227,800,000 on R&amp;D alone,
an amount greater than any pharmaceutical company ex-
cept one, or any of the giant petroleum companies except
one. Total expenditures during the same period for build-
ings and equipment were over $765,403,000.
Procter &amp; Gamble is growing and diversifying. We're into
food, chemicals, paper, medical products, coffee, toilet
goods and cellulose now, in addition to soaps and deter-
gents, with more yet to come.
If technical challenge turns you on, sign up for a P&amp;G

From The Dean's Desk...
September is a time both of excitement and confusion for a university. Both students arriving on campus for the first time
as well as those returning to resume their studies sense the fall as a time of beginning, of renewal, in their quests to pursue
their educational goals. Although it has been some 20 years since I first suffered the disorientation of the "lost freshman"
syndrome, moving into the Dean's Office over the summer has brought with it a touch of deja vu. But now that I have finally
found where they keep the paper and pencils (rather, how to use the wordprocessor), it seems an appropriate time to make a
few comments concerning objectives of the College over the next decade.
For over a century the College of Engineering has ranked among the leading engineering programs in the world with claims
to unusual strength across the full spectrum of technical interest. It may surprise some of you to learn that today every one of
the academic programs offered by the College is ranked among the top such programs in the nation, with several of these
programs generally being regarded as national leaders. It is our belief that the College will play an even more critical role
during the next decade as the State and the nation become increasingly dependent on engineering to revitalize industry and
the economy. Today our nation faces an engineering manpower crisis of unprecedented proportions that poses the most
serious implications for national productivity and defense. This year some 20,000 engineering positions will go unfilled. The
projected engineering manpower needs of the nation for the next decade far exceed the capacity of its engineering colleges.
Fortunately both our students and faculty are aware of these needs. The numbers and quality of students applying for
admission to the College have never been higher. Indeed, we can state with some justification that those of you enrolled in the
College today are the most outstanding group of students we have ever had. Furthermore, through the extraordinary efforts
of our faculty in research and instruction, we continue to be ranked among the top 5 engineering programs in the nation.
Certainly there are some serious concerns. Over the past decade we have seen a significant deterioration in public support
of higher education in Michigan (as your tuition bills make painfully apparent). The difficulties posed by decaying physical
facilities, obsolete equipment, and our inability to complete the North Campus move are also reasons for concern.
Yet we face the next decade with a new sense of optimism about the future of the College. There is no question in our
minds that our primary objective will be a total dedication to the achievement of excellence in education, in scholarship and
research, and in the professional activities of our faculty and students. It is not enough to be simply one of the best. Our goal
is to become the top engineering program in the nation, and we will approach the next decade with this goal foremost in
mind. Certainly the quality and dedication of the students in the College is consistent with this objective. So too is our faculty
distinguished by its commitment to excellence in teaching and research. Furthermore the College will face a decade of new
opportunities, as the State and the nation become increasingly aware of the importance of engineering education in
revitalizing industry and the economy. By working together, we can take advantage of these opportunities and work to
achieve a degree of excellence in the College that will be a source of pride for decades to come.
The Inside Story
Gee, where'd my summer go? Let me tell you, they go lots faster when you're taking classes. I never once saw a beach,
went camping or on a picnic, and only went to one concert, which was a dud. What do I get from all this? The chance to
graduate sooner. I'm not getting out in four years, though, I took some time off. Oh, well, six years is better than never.
But, thinking about it, many of the incoming engineers will graduate exactly then—never. If the University of Michigan
can't get its act together and stop with the 18% tuition hikes, they will end up losing students. I have never seen any signs of
the university cutting back properly. Take a walk through the buildings some night (real late). See all the lights? That's right,
they burn 24 hours per day. The only place they seem to be cutting back on the lights is in the libraries, where they have
replaced every other fluorescent bulb with a dummy bulb. Now, how come they can't do that in all the hallways—and leave
all the lights where they're needed. Surely, no one in the University is going to support the idea that the first thing that should
suffer is academia—that would be abominal. I bet they could save enough to run all the lights, if they just shut off half of all
the hallway lights (excluding dorms—I am just referring to buildings in which no one, or few people, remain at night) say,
between midnight and 7 a.m.
The engineering students, and all students in general, are expected to look to their professors to set an example in modern
living. So, what do we find? I know of at least two professors who ride bicycles to work. Hooray for them! I also see many
professors driving to work in very large cars, all alone. Shame, shame!
Or how about just plain courtesy? Have you ever experienced the frustration of going to a professor's office during 'office
hours', to find that there was no one there? For gosh sakes, I've gone to professors' offices where they had hours posted for
the previous year's winter term! Now if that isn't the absolute height of uselessness. . . ! You'd think they could at the very
least take down outdated office hours, and leave a note when they don't plan to be there.
Gee, sure seems like our faculty need to shape up. Some of them sure do set a miserable example for us to follow. At least,
we find that the higher-ups (deans, department heads, etc.) are fairly responsible about such things, but parts of the
teaching/researching staff, it appears, are only fit for professing because they aren't mature enough for anything requiring
more responsibility. But don't misconstrue what I'm saying—I've had a few profs that were decently responsible—but if I
print their names here, shouldn't I print those of the 'bad boys?' (A note to the profs—if this part of the column offends you,
you are probably one of the 'bad boys,' but if you find yourself in agreement, you probably have nothing to worry about.)
Ah, well, in spite of it all, we can get an excellent education here, and become real live 'injuneres.' So, enjoy this, the first
of approximately seven issues (in engineering, you'll learn to work with approximations) of The Michigan Technic. And
remember—it's your magazine. You want to see something in print? Submit it to us, we'll print it (we're that desperate).
Better yet, come down during our office hours (right on the door, we'll be there), and we can get better acquainted.


How to Survive in the Engineering College
by Andrew Santangelo
Welcome to one of the best engineering colleges in the country.
Michigan has been recognized by many corporations and research
institutions as "one of the very few giant universities that has
achieved both quality and quantity education."1 What does this
mean to you, the new Michigan Engineering student? It means that
you can get an excellent education here, but that you must use the
facilities available here to make the most of your stay here. This is
especially true for engineering students.
One of the first things you'll find out is that instructors love to
assign volumes of homework. This really is necessary, because
engineering is the sort of field that requires a "learn by doing"
approach—you can't learn to apply the theory unless you actually
apply it. However, you may find yourself bogged down by the load.
One of the best solutions to this problem is to eat a good meal, then
head for one of the many libraries on campus. Any one of these
libraries offers a place (or places) specifically for the purpose of
studying, with the appropriate quiet atmosphere. There, you'll be
able to get comfortable (but not so comfortable so as to fall asleep,
though many do), and start grinding away at that homework. And,
believe me, if you value your grades, you'll get all your homework
done, and on time, even if it means missing that "big party" down
the hall. You're here to learn, not party—you should make it a rule
to go to parties only after you have gotten your homework done (or
at least a substantial part of it). There will always be parties to
attend, even if you miss one, but most instructors won't let you
make up missed homework. If I sound like your parents, it's for
good reason. Chances are, they went to college and made the same
mistakes you will—they know what they're talking about. At a
tough, competetive school like Michigan, you either make the grades
or drop out—and that would be a serious waste of time and money.
So get that homework done. If you don't get right down to it, you'll
find yourself "pulling all-nighters" just to pass.
All right, so now you say "I went to the library to study, but I just
couldn't understand the stuff—what a big waste of time." Many
new students experience this, and they approach the problem in one
of two ways: 1) Go buy a six-pack and forget it. Unfortunately, this
usually results in failing grades and expulsion. 2) Get help. Find
someone else in your class to do homework with. It's a good way to
make friends, and two heads are always better than one. If you can't
find another student, or don't make friends that easily, go to the
instructor—that's why he/she holds office hours, so go ahead and

make good use of them. But before going in for help, make sure
you've really given it a go—make certain you really know where the
problem is. Instructors can't do much if you go in and say, "I don't
understand anything." You have to tell them what you don't
understand. Besides, making friends with an instructor can't hurt.
You may get some hints that weren't presented in class, or you may
find out something about the next test. You may even find out about
some fascinating research your instructor is doing.
No matter what else you do, use the facilities at Michigan and get
all your work done, even if it costs you some sleep.
Now you've gotten your homework done and have some free time.
What should you do? If you like to party and have a grand ole time,
Ann Arbor is your town. With bars and nightspots surrounding the
campus on nearly every side and all those dorm parties, there's no
reason to be bored. Then again, maybe drinking and carousing isn't
your thing. There are myriads of pizzerias and pinball joints to go to
with a group of friends for your evening/weekend entertainment.
If you prefer more productive goings-on, you still have a plethora
of opportunities around Michigan's campus. For example, there are
many professional societies for those who would like to become
more involved in a particular field of interest (see the approprate
engineering department for more details). You could also try to join
an honor society, participate in the engineering council, help publish
the Michigan Technic, or get involved with some professor or
graduate student on a research project.
Whether you're after social stimulus or intellectual stimulus, it's
here at Michigan, if you're willing to go find it. There is, as I said
already, absolutely no reason to be bored here.
Now we come to the most important question. What field should
you go into? There is no simple answer to this question. You should
never go into a field which doesn't interest you. Engineering isn't
easy, and it's much worse if you dislike what you're doing.
Regardless of which field you choose, your salary will climb as you
become better at whatever it is you do, and that happens much faster
if you enjoy it. For a given degree level (Bachelors, Masters,
Doctorate), salaries for the various fields are very ciose, with a few
exceptions (see Table 1), so starting salary should not be the basis of
your decision. Only if you have strong interests in several fields
should you let salary influence your decision. And don't forget to
weigh in such factors as how many employers there are in need of
this kind of engineer, how much room for advancement there is, or
how easy (or difficult) it would be if you decide to change your field
at a later date. For more details on these and other aspects of the
employment picture, go to the Engineering Placement office, room
128 West Engineering.
For more details on starting salaries, see the table at the end of this
article.'Once again, let me emphasize that after being in the field
several years, your salary depends more on how well you perform,
rather than which field you choose, or e.ven what degree level you've
attained. In fact, during the time it takes to get an advanced degree,
you may be promoted so much that you'll be earning more than you
would had you started later with the more advanced degree. So don't
go for a higher degree unless it's because of a sincere interest in the
field, because the monetary benefits are only slight, if existant at all.
Still don't know how to choose? The engineering college sponsors
information sessions in the winter and early spring. Go to these, they
help a lot, and there will be people present who can answer your
many questions. You should go to at least three of these sessions,
and I recommend that you go to as many as your schedule
permits—you may become interested in something you never gave
any thought to before.
So there you have it—engineering in a small nutshell. As long as
you make good use of the school and its facilities, and the social life
which abounds here, life at Michigan will be survivable—or even
fun, if you're an optimist. Congratulations on your acceptance to
the University of Michigan College of Engineering, and good luck in
your college and professional careers.

Timetable
by Thomas M. Schultz
Cold. A simple word. Yet all other adjectives and descriptive
modifiers paled into insignificance at its intensity.
Despite the extremities of the weather, however, life still existed in
this stark, frozen wasteland. Like some artic wagon train, a
semi-circular collection of quonset huts huddled together against the
gale-force winds, the surrounding mound of snow failing miserably
as a wind-break. The only lighting in the area came from jury-rigged
spotlights, attached to the top of tall, wooden poles bolted onto the
corners of various huts. In the heavy snowfall, they shone down on
the structures in a diffused glow, revealing little more than dim
outlines.
Enclosed in a perpetual cloud of snow kicked up by its treads, a
small snow-tractor suddenly appeared through an opening in the
wind-break. The craft's headlights, uselessly futile against the
swirling, white curtain, reflected back upon it like an aura, revealing
tired red paint where snow and ice had failed to attach themselves.
As it pulled up to one of the huts, a small figure emerged from the
tractor and opened a large, garage-size door in the building's side.
Waving to someone inside the craft, it turned and started across the
"compound" toward one of the other huts.
Home was always good to come back to, even if it was in the
middle of an arctic wasteland.
This was Greenland, 840,000 square miles of ice, snow, and
desolation; though here at its northern tip, where the annual
six-month "night" was already well into its seventh, and a nine-day
blizzard was showing every indication of lasting three times that
duration, it required but little imagination to believe that this was
some other planet altogether. The huts comprised an arctic relay sta-
tion, built and manned by the army, and referred to by its high
command as army intelligence at its finest.
To the men who served there, it was Hell on Earth; and that one of
the more affectionate descriptions.
The station's current complement had perhaps more reason than
usual to dislike their present duty assignment. After six months of
perpetual darkness, they were all ready to sell their own
grandmothers for a glimpse of daylight, and the unexpected
extension of the phenomenon was unwelcome to say.the least. To
make matters worse, their tour of duty had ended six days ago, but
the army refused to send in a plane with their replacements until the
blizzard abated somewhat. (Or at least so they surmised. The storm
made actual radio contact impossible, so they were forced to supply
their own reasons.) As a result, the crew was now a 20-man jumble
of tightly stretched nerves and growing neuroses.
At his desk in the duty hut, Major Dylan Scott, the station's com-
mander, was failing in his latest attempt to do the weekly
paperwork. He looked up as the wind howled by in a particularly
heavy blast, causing the thick, foam insulation behind the hut's
inner wall to creak loudly, then began reading the page in front of
him for the third time. A moment later he frowned, cast a look of
guilty realization around the empty room, then turned the page right
side up.
"Wondered why Wolfe's typing suddenly looked like Mandarin
Chinese," he muttered. He ran a hand through his dark, curly
hair—which together with his similarly colored moustache and khaki
army fatigues made him look like a Latin American revolutionary—
and gave a resigned sigh, then began to assemble the clutter of
papers which hid his desk top. There was always tomorrow, he
mused.
Abruptly, the door opened, the wind slamming it inward like a
battering ram.
"HeyI" Scott sprawled forward across his desk, trying to protect
the scattered sheets against the miniature cyclone that suddenly
raged around him. In the doorway, a bulky figure of snow-caked
olive green labored to reclose the panel, then turned and thrust back
its thick, fur-lined hood, revealing close-cropped brown hair and
brown eyes. Scott grimaced and sat up.
"Thanks a lot, Wolfe." The corporal shrugged, grinning
sheepishly.
"Sorry, Major. I couldn't hold on to the door with these gloves
on." He tried to flex a hand inside one of the thick coverings. "You
know, a seal could probably use this thing for an overcoat."
Scott grimaced again. "Look, give it to me later, Wolfe. What'd
you come in here for?" Brian removed his parka and pointed at a
small mini-computer in the rear corner of the room. Next to it was a
small console, displaying a set of eight digital readouts.
"Gotta check the numbers. You know the routine."
"Numbers," Scott echoed. He laughed humorlessly. "You must
have recorded those things enough times to fill ten logbooks. Does
anybody actually read them?" Brian shrugged.
"Don't ask me, Major. I'm just following orders. You're the one
who's supposed to have all the answers."
Scott's gaze narrowed. "Hmm. Thanks a lot." He finished
gathering the papers, then put them aside and went to stand next to
the corporal's chair. His eyes briefly scanned the panel.
"They never seem to change, do they?" Wolfe looked up from the
logbook.
"The readings? No. But then neither does the weather around
here."
Scott raised his eyes to the roof, listening to the wind try to take
the hut with it on its frigid journey. "Yeah, tell me about it."
"Hey, Major!" The door opened suddenly. Scott's eyes widened
in dismay.
"Henderson, close the—/"
The rest of Scott's sentence was lost in a torrent of wind-swept
papers. The sergeant halted in stunned surprise, his lower jaw falling
open in astonishment; then realization took hold and he quickly
turned and shouldered the door closed again. Looking back to the
room, he halted a second time, but this time because of the
venomously stony expression on Scott's face.
The major watched silently as Henderson's face appeared from
under the hood of his parka, once-impish blue eyes now painfully
surveying the results of their owner's actions. Running a nervous
hand self-consciously through his short, blond hair, he gave a deep
sigh and smiled in some manner which was probably supposed to be
disarming, but more closely resembled abject terror.
"Uh—sorry 'bout that, Major." David's soft Texas drawl was
heavier than usual, as it always was when he was under stress. "That
wind's blowin' a mite hard out there. An' whoo-eel It's colder'n a
witch's—"
"Henderson!" Scott stopped him. "If I hear that 'brass bra'
remark one more time, you're gonna be wearing one, understand?"
Slightly deflated, the sergeant nodded. "Uh, yes sir, Major.
Sorry." He gestured toward the floor. "I'll, uh—I'll pick up the
papers for ya'."
Scott's half-smile was anything but friendly. "Oh, that's real
considerate of you, Henderson. I'd really appreciate that."
Henderson started to grin in relief, but as Scott's face hardened
again, it disappeared. "Now what do you want?"
"Oh, yeah." Relieved to change the subject, the sergeant
brightened. "I just wanted to tell ya' me'n Cap'n Delaney got back.
He's over puttin' the Sno-Cat away, an' he said if you wanna join
him, he's goin' over to the mess hall for a cup o' coffee."
"Or what serves for it around here," Scott quipped. "Okay,
Henderson. I'll go play Nanook of the North. You get busy with
these papers." He looked over at Wolfe. "How cold is it out there,


looked up at him with a wry smile.
"Hey, it's only seventy-two below. That's six degrees warmer than
yesterday." Henderson, now free of his coat and gloves, clapped his
hands in mock glee.
"Well break out the swimsuits an' suntan lotion, we got us a
reg'lar heat wave!"
"HendersonI" Scott said dangerously. He pointed at the floor.
The sergeant nodded weakly.
"Uh—right, Major. I'll get right on it." Scott watched him bend
down and begin gathering the scattered sheets, then shook his head
in exasperation and went to put on his parka.
Through gaps in the heavy, swirling snowfall, the vast landscape
surrounding the station spread out before Scott as he walked.
Despite the lack of sunlight, and heavy cloud cover, the eternal white
shroud transformed the darkness into an eerie twilight, which every
man at the station had come to be grateful for.
When all you've got to look forward to is six months without
sunlight, you take what you can get.
The distance across the compound was only about thirty yards, yet
it took Scott almost ten minutes to traverse it—walking against the
wind was like taking a running jump into a brick wall. By the time he
reached the mess hall, he could barely see past the icy mass which
had formed on the fringe surrounding the edge of his hood. Fum-
bling with the knob through his gloves, he finally opened the door
and stepped inside.
On a bench along one wall of the makeshift foyer, Captain Eric
Delaney, Scott's negro assistant, looked up from removing his
boots. "Is that you, Dylan?" Scott, removing his gloves and
thrusting back his hood, nodded.
"Unfortunately." He shivered slightly, and blew on his hands.
"Man, it is cold out there! Did you order this weather?"
"Who, me?" Delaney asked hi mock incredulity. "Me? Dee
orig'nal Geo'gia kid? Why, whe'e ah comes from, dey pass out
winte' coats if'n dee temp'atu'e fall below even sixty-five degrees!"
Scott rolled his eyes in exasperation. "Oeez, what is this? First
Henderson and now you. You guys take a bottle out there with you
or something? I make a simple comment, and suddenly it's the Amos
V Andy hour!"
Eric frowned. "The who hour?" he asked innocently. Scott
grimaced at him.
"Cute, Delaney." They both looked up as the door opened and
Brian Wolfe stepped in and began removing his parka.
"What are you doing here, Wolfe?" Scott asked. The corporal
looked at him.
"Major, can't I go anywhere without you asking me that? I
finished taking the numbers, and a cup of coffee sounded good.
Besides, everybody else is over here anyway."
"Did Henderson finish picking up those papers?"
Wolfe's eyes gleamed mischievously, and his lips tightened hi a
suppressed grin. "Well, he was almost done, then I got ready to
leave. All I did was open the door, and, well—" He shrugged
noncommittaly. "You know, I don't think I've ever seen a grown
man cry like that before."
Scott restrained himself from laughing out loud, but his chuckling
grin provided the same response. "Wolfe, you've got a really cruel
sense of humor sometimes, you know?" The corporal smiled
strangely, not sure whether he was being reprimanded or congratu-
lated. Scott's grin widened. "Maybe that's why I like you so much.
"By the way," he turned back to Delaney, "I take it Callahan
didn't get here with the supplies." The captain shook his head.
"Nope. We thought he might try an air drop if he couldn't land,
but no dice. We even waited an extra half-hour."
"A half-hour?" Wolfe laughed unamusedly. "You might as well
have made it a year I The stars hip Enterprise couldn't fly through
that storm."
"Thank you, Mr. Spock," quipped Scott. He looked back at
Delaney. "I didn't think he'd show up, but thanks for going out
anyway."
The captain waved the gratitude away. "Forget it. It gave me
something to do besides sit around here and twiddle my thumbs. But
next time, do me a favor, eh?"
"What's that?"
"Choose somebody besides Henderson." Scott laughed and
pushed through the swinging door into the sparse dining room.
For a quonset hut, the mess hall was unusually well-constructed
inside. An aluminum dividing wall separated the kitchen/serving
counter area from a not unattractive dining room, furnished with
semi-modern (in the army, that meant at least post-World War II)
tables and chairs. The yellow walls—the only ones in the entire
camp, save for those of the small medical clinic, which were
painted—had lost some of their cheerfulness through constant com-
petition with the dreariness outside, yet still made the hall a popular
gathering place for both on- and off-duty personnel; all of whom
(with the exception of Henderson) were presently accounted for. The
scattered assortment of men did not rise at then1 commander's
entrance; partly because Scott had dispensed with such arbitrary
formalities for the duration of their assignment, and, he reflected
wryly, partly because none of them even noticed he was there.
The major approached the large, gleaming coffee urn and filled a
mug for both Eric and Brian, then got one for himself and followed
them over to the last remaining empty table. Briefly luxuriating in
the feeling of the hot liquid flowing down his throat, he paused
bemusedly to listen to the conversation at the next table. Among the
complement of men seated around it was Jerry Baker, a graduate of
the University of Michigan, who was expounding on the athletic
excellence of that school's current football team—a not uncommon,
but always lively occurrence.
As his victim this time, Baker had chosen Thomas Jackson, who
had the unfortunate luck to be a graduate of Michigan's long-time
rival, Ohio State University. It was a role he'd been playing on and
off for the entire six months of their assignment; a role which, to
Baker's infinite delight, was not always to his liking. As Baker fell
into the usual pattern of sports-oriented insults and epithets, Scott
let go of the conversation to focus on whatever it was Delaney was
elucidating about now.
"Right, Dylan?" Eric was asking. Scott hid his lack of knowledge
about the basis for the question in a swallow of coffee.
"I always am. What about this time?" he asked.
Delaney frowned slightly in confusion, then smirked knowingly.
"That you don't have an ego problem, and always know what's
going on around you."
Caught, Scott took another swallow of coffee, peering at his assis-
tant over the rim of the mug while he tried to think of a suitable re-
joinder. Lacking one, he put down his cup and looked at Wolfe.
"Corporal, let me give you a tip about choosing a second-in-
command."
"Yes, Major?" Brian asked innocently, obviously enjoying the
little interplay immensely.
"Never choose one with a—"
With a what Brian never learned, for a large crash interrupted
them at that moment, and they looked over to see Jerry Baker laying
on his back on the floor, rubbing his jaw in a mixture of puzzled
surprise. On the other side of the table, Jackson was on his feet,
towering over him as much as the intervening structure would allow.
"Take it back, Bakert"
"Lieutenant! "Stan's voice cut through the confusion like a shot,
and the entire mess hall was suddenly gripped by a tense silence.
Jackson glanced around the room as if suddenly realizing where he
was, then started across the room toward the door. Delaney moved
to stop him, but Scott held him back.
"No, let him go. I'll talk to him later."
"But Dylan—"
"I said I'll talk to him later!" Scott snapped. Delaney, taken
aback, nodded.
"Uh—okay, Dylan. Whatever you say."
Scott paused, noting the pained concern in his second's eyes, then
sighed and rubbed his forehead.
"I'm—sorry, Eric. I guess rank doesn't have its privileges when it
comes to tension. It's just that this is an unusual situation, and
pulling Jackson on the carpet right now in front of everybody
wouldn't be to anyone's benefit."
Delaney nodded, relief replacing the concern in his face. "S&lt;


But you've got yours, plus ours, plus those of seventeen other guys."
Scott grinned wearily. "Yeah, and someday it'll all be yours." He
composed himself into a figure of stern authority and walked over to
face Baker, who, now on his feet, wore the look of a man waiting for
the guillotine to drop. Scott eyed him silently for a moment.
"Well, Baker?" he asked finally. "Would you mind giving me an
explanation for all this?"
"It wasn't me, Major. All I was doin' was talkin' about Mi—"
"About Michigan's football team, I know," Scott interrupted.
"Three cheers and a bottle of beer. What did you say that made
Jackson hit \ou?"
"Nothin*. Major, honest. I was talkin' about Michigan's team,
an' he tells me to shut up already. So I says, 'Why? Just 'cause the
Buckeyes couldn't fight their way out of a wet paper bag?' Then he
up an' hits met Powl Just like that."
"He has been acting kinda strange lately," said Wolfe, coming up
next to Scott. "Real moody, like he's got a lot on his mind."
Scott raised his eyes to the roof, listening to the wind sweep by
outside. "Don't we all, Wolfe?" He looked a Baker. "I think that's
enough Michigan football for awhile. We're all walking around here
with our nerves wound tighter than watch springs, and—"
"Not me, Major," Baker interrupted, holding up his wrist. "I
wear a digital."
"Baker!" The sergeant cringed.
"Sorry, Major."
"Now until we get outta here, this is the city of brotherly love,
understand? Nobody steps on anybody else's toes, or gets in
anybody else's space. Got it?" There were scattered nods and
"yessirs". Scott nodded.
"Good. Then I think it's time to go find out what's wrong with
Jackson."
"You want me to go with you?" asked Delaney as he turned
toward the door.
"No, thanks, Eric. I don't relish having to play Sigmund Freud on
my own, but I don't want it to look like we're ganging up on him,
okay?"
The captain nodded. "Sure, Dylan."
"Besides," Scott nodded toward the rest of the company, who
had resumed their positions around the tables, "I think you better
stay here and keep an eye on these screwballs. No telling how many
more Jacksons we might have, just sitting around waiting to erupt."
Delaney scanned the hall, scrutinizing them. "Hmm. Good idea."
He looked back at Scott. "And good luck."
"Yeah, thanks," said Scott dryly. "I think I'm gonna need it."
During this walk across the compound, he didn't even notice the
cold.
As he opened the door to the barracks, Scott almost stepped on
Jackson's parka, which lay in a heap on the floor. Laying it on a
nearby bunk with his own, he decided to save the appropriate
reprimand until he knew more about what was going on.
Jackson, lying on his bunk in the far right corner, stared
broodingly at the wire supports of the bunk above him, and did not
even look up as Scott approached. In fact, he gave no indication that
he knew the major was there at all. Regarding him silently for a few
moments, Scott began to wonder if somebody'd slipped up on his
psychological profile, allowing him to be assigned here when he
never should have been.
"You want to talk about it?" he asked. Jackson turned to stare at
him with tired, haunted eyes, setting off a warning bell in the back of
his mind.
"No, sir." He turned away again. Scott felt one of his eyebrows
raise in mild astonishment, and quickly pulled it back into place.
"Look, Jackson, I know this place isn't one of the more thrilling
spots to be assigned to, especially since we're supposed to be home
already. But you can't let it get to you like this. I mean, c'mon, we're
all in this together."
Jackson laughed humorlessly. "Yeah, you'd think so, wouldn't
you?"
"Now what's that supposed to mean?"
Jackson signed. "Aw, nothing, Major. Look, Baker was getting
on my nerves, and I wasn't in the mood. I didn't mean to hit him, it
just happened. I'll do KP for a week if you want, alright?"
Scott shook his head. "Uh-uh. That might take care of the
symptom, but not the ailment." Jackson frowned.
"Say what?"
"Wolfe says you've been acting strange lately, like you've got a
problem. I want to know what it is."
Jackson raised up on his elbows, nodding knowingly. "Oh, well,
if Wolfe said it—"
"Is there a problem?" Scott insisted. The lieutenant grimaced
reluctantly.
"Major, it's—it's not a problem. It's just . . ." He trailed off,
unable to find the words.
"It's just what, Jackson?"
Jackson looked away in silence for a moment, some internal
struggle visible on his face, then suddenly stood up and went to stare
out a window. Scott waited patiently, not wanting to push too hard.
Finally, Jackson turned to look at him.
"Major, what would you do if you knew about something that no
one else was aware of; a situation that—well, that had the potential
of causing devastation on a large scale?"
Scott felt his eyebrow creeping up again, but this time he let it go.
Of all the things he had expected Jackson to say, that was definitely
not one of them. "Devastation? Look, all I want to know is what's
bothering you." Something in the lieutenant's gaze stopped him,
filling him with an unsettling feeling of disquiet.
"You're serious, aren't you? What do you know, Jackson? Just
how 'large' a scale are we talking about?"
Jackson hesitated, as if knowing what was coming, and was
reluctant to endure it. "I'm talking about—about a global scale."
"Global scale!" Scott's incredulous response was out before he
could even think about it. "Jackson, that's—!" He broke off
abruptly, his voice catching on the final word. But it came through
anyway.
"Crazy?" Jackson said, reading his eyes. He sighed resignedly. "I
knew that's what you'd say!"
"Look, Jackson, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it to come out that way.
But I was expecting a little more—conventional reason for hitting
Baker. Just what is this 'situation' you're talking about?"
Jackson regarded him silently for a moment, then walked to his
locker and extracted a worn, spiral notebook. He handed it to Scott.
"What's this?" the major asked, scanning the first page. He sat
down at the room's central table and began leafing through it.
"My job, remember? Those are snowfall records for our entire
tour of duty here. Do you know the average yearly snowfall for this
region?"
Scott threw him a wry grimace. "Sure, doesn't everybody?" He
continued to flip through the pages. "Why?"
"Because the total snowfall, just in the six months we've been
here, is nine percent over that yearly average."
"So we've run into an unusually bad stretch of bad weather."
Jackson shook his head. "No, that's what I thought at first. But
just out of curiosity, I started digging back in the records from
previous duty crews. Do you know that in the past five years—and
probably before that, I haven't checked back that far yet—the
annual snowfall has increased from five to thirteen percent every
year!?"
Scott stopped flipping pages.
"What are you trying to say?"
Jackson pointed at the notebook. "Flip ahead a couple pages.
There should be a couple newspaper arti—yeah! Right there! Have
you read those?"
Scott shrugged warily. "I remember seeing them in one of the
papers Callahan brought us a few weeks ago, but I didn't read them
Michigan Technic


Jackson nodded. "Yes, that's right. Scientists have reported that
the Antarctic ice sheet is beginning to collapse into a trench between
two of the plates that form the outer shell of the earth. As it does so,
it melts and releases water into the sea. If it continues, it could have
drastic effects on the coastal outlines of every major continent on the
planet."
"Is this what's bothering you?" Scott asked. "Jackson, this is—"
"No, Major, that's only part of it. Look, think of the earth as a
hollow ball." His hands traced a sphere in the air. "Around the
outside of the ball are the tectonic plates which support the
continents. Now on the bottom is the Antarctic ice cap, which is
slowly melting and releasing water to the oceans. So already we've
got an imbalance forming."
"Jackson, what are you getting—"
"Major, please. I'll explain everything, but I have to do it in my
own way. Right now, I just need you to listen." Scott nodded in
consent.
"Alright, Jackson, I'm listening."
"Okay, now, if the snowfall here keeps increasing like it has been,
then the entire northern ice cap is going to start growing. The larger
it gets, the greater the pressure it exerts on the earth's inner core.
Eventually, the internal pressure will reach a level where the only
way it can relieve itself will be to increase the earth's internal
volume, by raising the surrounding plates.
"In simpler terms, raise the sea floor."
Scott was drawn to his feet in spite of himself, cold realization
clutching at his stomach. "Do you know what you're saying? What
you're suggesting! That'll be enough to destroy at least half of the
present existing land mass. You're predicting the end of the world!"
Jackson's expression didn't waver so much as a fraction. "Very
possibly."
Scott couldn't remember ever having experienced such a long,
pregnant silence. The world seemed to have vanished outside the
tired, gray building as he stood staring into Jackson's face. The
lieutenant gazed steadily back at him, his thoughts unreadable
behind his stony expression. Finally, Scott found his voice.
"Jackson . . . Jackson, you can't be serious."
"Can't I?" A sad smile tugged at his mouth. "Major, do you
believe in God?"
Too many things at once. Scott shook his head. "What are you
talking about?"
"God, Major. Are you religious?"
"Yes, I'm Catholic. So what?" Jackson moved forward slightly,
as if maneuvering for a kill.
"Then tell me, Major. Don't you think it's ridiculously impossible
that out of all the stars in this galaxy alone, this is the only one He
decided to put life on?"
"Jackson, what—?"
"Because, Major; let's say that there's a thousand planets out
there with life on them. If you were God, how would you make sure
they were all mature enough species to be allowed to develop
further?"
Scott frowned, trying to answer the question, be amused at being
proclaimed God, and figure out where Jackson was heading all at
the same time. "I—I don't know. Give them a test, I guess." For the
briefest of moments, he was sure Jackson was going to hug him.
"Yes! That's exactly right! And the ice caps are our test! They're
the timetable!
"If we have the wisdom to not only recognize the situation, but
subsequently find a solution to it, then we've matured enough to be
declared a viable species. If not, then we all better start watching
Star Trek reruns, 'cause that's the only 'future* we're ever gonna
see!"
Scott let a long moment of silence go by as he tried to put his
jumbled thoughts in some semblance of order. Every instinct he had
told him not to listen; to lock Jackson up before he became even
more unhinged. But something in the back of his mind wouldn't let
him. Some small part of him screamed at him to—.
No. Scott pushed the thought away before it could even form. He
couldn't start questioning now. His own self-control was shaky
enough, without starting to think about—.
He pushed that thought away, too.
"Jackson," the words came hard, "don't take this wrong." The
lieutenant tensed perceptibly. "I don't think you're crazy, or need to
be locked up or something. But your whole story . . . you've been
isolated here for a long time, with barely marginal living conditions.
You've been—we've all been subject to unusually heavy stress. It's
bound to have had some effect." The lines of Jackson's mouth
hardened.
"You don't believe me," he said quietly.
"I didn't say that. I mean, you're hardly a raving lunatic or
something. And I have to admit, some of what you said made
sense."
"But—" Jackson said, his voice edged with bitterness.
"But what do you expect me to do about it? You're talking about
the end of the world, here!"
"Dammit, Major, tell somebody! Get some of our genius
scientists up here to look at the conditions! They have to see what's
happening!"
"They don't have to do anything, Jackson!" Scott retorted,
bristling at the demanding tone in his voice. "And just how do you
propose I get them up here? If I tried to tell anybody about this,
they'd have us both in straight jackets!"
"But you can't just stand by and do nothing!"
Scott was about to do just that, but something in the back of his
mind stopped him. "Okay, Jackson, look. If you apologize for
hitting Baker, I won't say anything more about it. As for the rest of
it, I'm not going to report you, or lock you up in the med-hut or
anything. But I can't warrent sending out a red alert bulletin that the
end of the world is coming! Once we're back in the States, if you
want to bring this up to the proper authorities, I'll support you. But
that's as far as I can go, Jackson. Understand?"
Jackson's gaze was coldly aloof. "Yes, Major. I understand. I

you're going to stand by and do nothing when it's quite possible that
the fate of the world is resting in your hands!"
"Oh, now wait a min—"
"No, you wait a minute!" Jackson cut him off. "The way it's
snowing out there, we may not get out of here for another month\
By that time, there'll be at least another five feet of snow on the
ground I The way bureaucratic red tape works, we may already be
too late to stop this thing! We have to warn somebody now!" He
turned abruptly and started for the door. Scott, momentarily discon-
certed, started after him.
"Alright, Jackson, just hold it right there!" The lieutenant
whirled to face him.
"I'm sorry, Major! It's nothing personal, but I can't let you stop
me. There's too much at stake here."
"But you're not even sure you're right!"
"I'm as sure as I have to be! If I'm wrong, then I'm wrong; but I
can't take that chance." He turned away again. Scott tensed angrily.
Well, if he wouldn't listen to common sense—. He took a following
step.
"I'm warning you, Jackson, that's far enough!"
It was indeed far enough; far enough for Jackson to reach a
nearby locker and pull out its owners' duty pistol. Scott froze in his
tracks.
"No, it's not, Major. You can give me a court martial and lock me
up for the rest of my life if you want. But if I give up now; if I'm
right and I don't go through with this; I'll have to live with the
knowledge that I might have been able to stop it, and didn't. And
there isn't a jail cell on earth that could compare with that kind of
self-imposed Hell."
He began moving toward the door again. Scott took a desperate
step forward, but was halted by a sharp gesture from the gun.
"Major, please. If you won't help me, at least don't fight me. I
don't want to hurt you."
"Jackson, wait!" But he was gone, out into the glacial darkness.
"Jackson, you'll freezel" Scott ran to the door, but the numbing
cold stopped him from following any further.
"Jackson! Jackson!"
Only the howl of the wind answered. Scott ran back inside the hut
and grabbed his parka, threw Jackson's over his shoulder, then
ventured into the cold once more.
The wind tore at him as he walked, unyielding snow raking his
face like claws. His hands began to feel numb, and Scott realized
he'd forgotten his gloves. Cursing silently, he tried to alternate them
between holding onto Jackson's parka, and jamming them deep into
his pockets. That helped, but it also made it harder to balance
against the wind.
The ankle-deep snow seemed to suck at his boots, and a sudden
mound sent the major sprawling. Scott's curses were violently vocal
this time, though they remained unheard over the wind. Struggling
to regain his feet, he reached out to grab Jackson's parka from
where he had dropped it—and recoiled in horror.
The mound was Jackson, laying motionless in the snow. His skin
was coated with frost.
"Dylan?"
Scott's eyes opened to a blinding white glare, and he quickly shut
them again, irritated tears flooding them like a river. Preparing a
moment for the silent assault, he opened them again.
A shadowy figure stood over him.
"You awake, Dylan?" it asked.
"Delaney?" His vision slowly came into focus, revealing the
captain's grinning features.
"Yeah, it's me. How do you feel?"
"Terrific," Scott grumbled. He tried to wipe his eyes, and found
his hands bandaged. "Hey, what's going on? Where am I?" He tried
to sit up, but Delaney pushed him back.
"Ahh, just hold on there, Mr. CO. You're in the med-hut, and
the doc says that's exactly where you're gonna stay for awhile. You
got a real good case of frostbite there, pal."
"But how'd I get here? What—" He broke off abruptly, horrified
remembrance filling his eyes. "Jackson." He sat up and grabbed
Delaney's shoulders. "What happened to Jackson!"
Pained regret clouded Eric's face, and he shook his head. "We
found you both out there unconscious in the snow. Jackson's alive,
but he's in a coma. Frostbite, exposure, severe hypothermia. Doc
says he may never regain consciousness."
Scott's mouth opened in shock, and he sank back onto his pillow,
eyes wide with horror.
"No!" he said quietly. "No, it can't be!"
Delaney nodded reluctantly, "I'm sorry, Dylan. I wish it wasn't
true, but it is. What was he doing out there without his parka, for
chrissakes?"
Scott looked away for a long moment, unable to meet his
assistant's eyes. The pit of his stomach twisted with painful guilt.
"Trying to save the world, Delaney." He turned and met Eric's
puzzled gaze. "He wanted to save the world, and I wouldn't help
him."
"Dylan, what are you talking about?" Scott shook his head.
"Look, don't ask me to explain it. I'm not sure I could even if I
wanted to. Jackson simply believed that changes in the polar ice caps
were creating a situation that could potentially bring about the end
of life on this planet as we know it." He shrugged wearily. "I don't
know. For all I know, he might even have been right. I'm no
geologist. Maybe that storm is just the after-effects of the first
shock."
Delaney grinned suddenly. "Oh, that's right. You don't know
about that yet." Scott rowned.
"Know about what, yet?"
Delaney walked to the window and pulled open the blind, filling
the room with bright, streaming sunshine. "The storm's over,
Dylan. We can go home."
Scott sat up in disbelief. "Over? It's really over? We can get outta
here?" Delaney nodded, grinning. Scott started to sink back in
joyful realization, bhen bolted upright again.
"The radio!"
"I put Wolfe on it a half-hour ago," Delaney said, waving him
back. "He should be through to the base within the hour." Scott's
shoulders sagged relaxingly, then he started to climb out of bed.
"Hey, where do you think you're going?" Delaney asked.
"I've been cooped up with you loonies for over six months. I want
to be there when he gets through."
"But the doc said—"
"I don't care what the doc said," Scott cut him off. "I'm gonna
be the—" He paused as Brian appeared in the doorway, looking like
he'd just seen a ghost.
"Wolfe, what's wrong?" Delaney asked. The corporal looked at
them with haunted eyes.
"I—I couldn't raise the relay station at Strom fjord, so I started
scanning the frequencies to see if I could find someone else. I finally
found a ship that thought it was somewhere off the coast of
Labrador."
"A ship?" asked Delaney. "Did they patch you through?"
"Wait a minute," Scott interrupted. "Thought they were off the
coast of Labrador?"
Brian stared at him blankly. "Labrador isn't there anymore,
Major. Neither is Stromfjord. There's been some sort of disturbance
in the sea floor. They're buried under a mile of water. And Major?"
Scott could only nod reflexively.
"The effect is growing, Major. New York'U be under water within
the week, and the rest of the east coast following soon after. No one
seems to know how to stop it, or even what's causing it."
The world spun around Scott as he sagged against the bed,
groping for support. He could not meet Delaney's shocked gaze, or
answer Wolfe's questioning one. The timetable had run out, and the
one man who might have been able to do something about it now lay
in a coma Scott himself had caused.
Self-imposed Hell, indeed!

the answer
to questions
you haven't
asked yet.
In engineering, as in other areas of
knowledge, one new question often
leads to countless others.
When you start to investigate suppliers
for the electronic components you'll need
in the course of your future design work,
you'll want to consider not just product
suitability and quality, but to ask other
important questions, as well: What is the
breadth of the supplier's product lines?
What's their commitment to research and
product improvement? Are their people
competent and easy to deal with? Are
they responsive to my needs?
At TRW Electronic Components Group,
you'll find favorable answers to a lot of
questions about resources—both
products and people—that you'll need to
do your job effectively. And, if you're
thinking about the question of where to
go for a rewarding career, TRW may just
be the answer to that, too.

to a higher challenge.
Texas Instruments.
For years you've been
y proving to your professors
just how good you are.
Now it's time to prove it to
yourself.
With a higher chal-
lenge. With Texas
Instruments.
Prove yourself where innovation's the rule,
not the exception.
As a matter of corporate policy, TI has
built-in budgets for new, innovative ideas. If
you have a revolutionary concept that
deserves to lie put to the test, the money's
there.
That's just part of the TI challenge.
Prove yourself in the world's "hot"
technologies.
No technology is hotter, or more fantastic,
than microelectronics. And no company is hot-
ter in it than TI.
Example: The TT 59 handheld calculator
has more than twice the primary memory
capacity of the three-ton computers of the
1950s.
And l(x)k at these credentials. TI is:
• The world's leading supplier of
semiconductors.
1 The inventor of the
integrated circuit,
• The inventor of the
microprr)cessor.
The inventor of the
microcomputer.
The inventor of the
handheld electronic
calculator.
• The inventor of the LCD digital watch.
• The designer and producer of the most com-
plex MOS chip.
• The inventor of single-chip solid-state voice
synthesis.
• The largest producer of microelectronic
memory products.
• The world leader in Very Large Scale
Integration.
• The primary supplier of airborne radars to
the U.S. defense program.
• The leading developer and producer of
infrared and laser systems.
• The world's foremost geophysical survey
company.
Prove yourself where you have the freedom to
grow.
Because TT is like many
companies in one, you
have the opportunity to
move laterally from one
specialty to another as well
as move up. Without
changingjobs.
TTs advanced system
for lateral career mobility lets you move up
faster. Because the freedom to move sideways
is the best way to compare technologies and
define career goals early on.
The frequently published TI Job
Opportunity Bulletin lists openings at all TI
facilities and gives TT people first crack at
them.
Prove yourself where it counts.
TI has been acclaimed as one of America's
best-managed companies because we've
stayed young and vital while growing big.
One major reason for our high energy is
our move-up environment. New people don't
get buried at the bottom of a pecking order. So
p»^ if you gel a good idea your
^ first week on the job, it
gets heard. And you get
K rewarded.
At TI, you get every
chance to show what you
I can do. And prove what
*• you deserve.
Prove yourself in an international company.
TI has hometowas in 19 countries on six
continents. You'll find manufacturing in
Singapore. Dallas. Tokyo. Nice. Buenos Aires.
And many other cities around the globe.
TI has hometowns to match your lifestyle.

with software.
Most copper is found deep under-
ground. But the Bell System's 100
million miles of copper cable have
tons of it above and below ground.
That copper provides vital circuit
paths to transmit customer voice,
data and video signals for today's
Information Age needs.
And Luis Castellanos, seven
years out of undergraduate school,
supervises one of the groups that
helps Bell System companies mine"
all that copper. He works with one of
the largest computer hardware and
software systems in the world—the
Trunks Integrated Record Keeping
System (TIRKS). Every day it
"mines" the vast Bell network for
available circuits and equipment. As
a result of efficient use of network
facilities, the Bell System saves
millions by eliminating the need for
certain capital expenditures.
Plus, there s more to TIRKS than
"mining copper." It also configures
circuits and assigns components
needed for each circuit path. That
allows Bell companies to respond
faster to customer requests for com-
plex services like video and data
transmission. Employees are more
productive too, because TIRKS
helps them set up circuits and fore-
cast facility needs.
Before TIRKS was available,
keeping track of communications
circuits and facilities required enor-
mous amounts of paperwork and
manual calculation. Every day, the
average Bell System company
handles orders involving 1500
circuits and up to 7500 individual
components associated with them.
Each detail has to be specified
and accounted for.
Now, thanks to people like Luis,
TIRKS keeps track of all that infor-
mation instantaneously using com-
puters. Information is up-to-date. It's
instantly available. And it's more
accurate.
According to computer scientists
like Luis, the benefits from TIRKS
are just beginning. He believes that,
as more computer hardware and
software systems like TIRKS
interact, new benefits for customers
may be possible, as well as
additional productivity increases
for employees.
Luis joined Bell Labs with a B.S.
in computer science from Pratt In-
stitute. Under a company-spon-
sored graduate study program, he
attended Stevens Institute of Tech-
nology for his M.S. in computer
science. At the same time, he
worked part-time assuming respon-
sibility for a large piece of TIRKS
software. Working with design
teams, he gained valuable insight
from experienced members. Now,
his technical performance has
earned him a promotion to
supervisor.

International Paper —a company
that hires more graduating engi-
neers than all other disciplines
combined —offers some advice
on one of the toughest decisions
you'll ever make.
Look for a real challenge.
Engineers are most impor-
tant to companies with real
technical problems to solve.
At International Paper,
engineers in every discipline...
electrical, chemical, mechani-
cal, industrial, civil, computer
science, and more.. .face chal-
lenges like these in the 1980's:
How to bring paper mills built
fifty years ago into compliance
with tough EPA standards...
how to conserve energy in a pro-
cess that's more energy-intensive
than aluminum... how to design
automated packaging systems to
match the speed of today's pro-
duction lines.. .how to reduce
waste and squeeze maximum
value out of an evermore-costly
fiber resource.
Tbugrur clean air and water quality standards
require innovative approaches.
You'll be solving some of the
challenges from the ground up:
IP is investing more than four
billion dollars in five years to
modernize and expand paper
mills, packaging plants, and
solid wood products facilities.
One such project: the world's
most advanced containerboard
mill, nearing completion in Lou-
isiana at a cost of $575 million.
Make sure management is
technically oriented.
Engineers do best in compa-
nies where management under-
stands the challenges.
IP's chairman and chief
executive officer is a member of
the National Academy of Engi-
neering. Five of the company's
seven executive office members
are engineers. So are many other
senior management executives
and many line managers. Man-
agement understands the techni-
cal needs of the businesses, and
supports the people who contrib-
ute to solutions.
Try to join an industry leader.
A company's size and
strength affects the resources you
have to work with, the impact
your work can have, and the
range of opportunities available
to you.
International Paper is near
the top ten percent of Fortune's
500 list, with sales of over $5 bil-
lion in 1980. IP makes more
paper than all of Scan-
dinavia—more than
any other company in
the world. We're the
world's leading pro-
ducer of paper packag-
ing, and a growing force
in solid wood products.
IP is also the world's
largest private owner of
forestland, with over
seven million acres.
Every share of IP stock

is backed by one-seventh of an
acre of wholly-owned land.
Get a good start.
A new Technical Career Pro-
gram orients you to IP, exposes
you to the many technical career
paths available, and helps you
select successive job assignments
that match your talents, experi-
ence, and interests with the
needs of the company. From the
beginning, both on-the-job and
formal classroom training help
you to improve your own abili-
ties and build a rewarding career.
And you choose your own long-
term direction—a continuing
and expanding role in science

by Neal Donaldson
It was in 1882 that the first issue of what was to become the
Michigan Technic was published. In the 100 years since, the
Technic has evolved and changed, reflecting as much the
times as the writers and the audience for which it was in-
tended. We are the oldest engineering college magazine in
America, and the oldest student publication on campus. Al-
most every engineering college publishes a magazine similar in
scope and intent, so we must have been doing something right
for so many to follow our lead.
The Technic, though, has had some problems in recent
years. Staff shortages, cash flow difficulties, and a reduction
in the number of quality article sources for publication have
taken their toll. We as a staff, and perhaps the engineering
college itself, have become complacent. We may be the
oldest, but you cannot live on history.
Why the problems? Some are, unfortunately, self-afflicted.
Some are inherent as a student publication. Turnover, lack of
continuity, other commitments as a student all add to the
problems in turning out a publication. But other schools are
faced with this. How do they manage to handle it? Why is it
that Purdue has more photographers on their staff than we do
staff? (They have approximately 100 people working on their
magazine.) Why is it that Ohio State of all places was able to
put out what was judged the best all around magazine at the
Engineering College Magazine Association convention held in
Raleigh, North Carolina last spring? It surely isn't because
they make friends easily. They generated quite a bit of ani-
mosity from every other delegation when they questioned the
motives of one of the sponsors of the convention repeated!:,
and groundlessly from the floor.
These schools and others are able to publish quality publ:-
cations for one main reason: support. Without support, yes
cannot function, and it's support that the Technic is lackiE
right now.
So what are we on the Technic doing about our problem'
First and foremost, recognizing that there are problems ac:
that they need to be dealt with. Second is establishing tk
directions that we would like to see the magazine take. Third
is establishing ways to deal with the problems as they stand
and move in the directions we set forth. A memorandum vras
submitted to the Dean's office outlining some proposals re-
cently, and at least one at this date has borne fruit. To serve
as an incentive for staff members, elective credit was soughi
for work on the magazine. Three credits in Humanities are
now offered to anyone who works on the staff and does cer-
tain minimum requirements. There is not the rigid structure
that you find in classes offered for credit in the college. Dis-
cussions are being held with the Dean's office and the Engi-
neering Council regarding further proposals, and action on
those now proposed.
As we, as a magazine, undergo this self-evaluation process,
it seems appropriate to us to know what the college com-
munity would like to see from the Technic. We are, after all, a
voice of the Engineering College. We would like to know your
opinions. Stop by the Technic office in B-46 East Engineering
to talk, or leave a note.

Cargo Cult Science
by Dean J. J. Duderstadt
A fascinating phenomenon known as the "Cargo Cult" has
been discovered on a number of islands in the South Pacific.
These islands were inhabited by primitive, stone age cultures
until their first contact with Western civilization through the
voyages of Captain Cook. The natives were overwhelmed
with Western material goods, which they referred to in their
pidgin English as cargo." During World War II their fondest
dreams appeared to come true as the Allies developed several
of the islands into military bases. Planes would land, and
soldiers would come bringing with them enormous quantities
of "cargo."
After the war, the soldiers left and the planes flew away,
taking the cargo with them. Now the natives pray for the
planes to return. They have developed a religion about the
return of the cargo, a "cargo cult." They fashion bamboo
shoots into primitive guns and march about like the soldiers
did. On one island they have cleared off areas of land to look
like a runway, and placed fires along side it to attract the
planes. They even made a wooden hut out of old cargo crates
for a native to sit in, with two wooden pieces on his head like
headphones and bars of bamboo sticking out like antennas.
They pray to this figure and wait for the planes to land.
The natives appear to be doing everything right. The form
is perfect; it looks exactly the way it looked before. But some-
thing is wrong. The soldiers do not return. The planes do not
land.
As members of a sophisticated culture, we find the cargo
cult amusing. Yet, as the Nobel Laureate physicist Richard
Feynman has noted, despite our sophistication, in many ways
we tend to approach modern science and technology in ways
remarkably similar to the cargo cult. Feynman has coined the
term "cargo cult science" to refer to many approaches to
science in our society today that appear to follow all the ap-
parent precepts and forms of scientific investigation, but that
are missing something very essential because they simply do
not work —the planes do not land. We can all think of ob-
vious examples such as astrology, the biorhythm fads. UFOs
(close encounters of the third kind, the search for ancient
astronauts), strange creatures (the Abominable Snowman,
the Loch Ness monster, Bigfoot). Unfortunately, many
aspects of engineering have also become infected with cargo
cult science, particularly in those areas of technology that
have become highly controversial and are debated vigorously
in the public limelight.
But what is missing from these pseudosciences, these Cargo
Cult Sciences? Feynman suggests that the missing ingredient
might be identified as "scientific integrity," a principle of
scientific thought that corresponds to an utter honesty, a
leaning over backward to consider and present all aspects of a
scientific investigation.
The principle of scientific integrity is particularly important
in Engineering practice. If you are doing an experiment, you
should report everything that you think might make your
results invalid. You should present not only what you think is
right about it, but also other causes that could possible
explain your results; you should mention other ideas you
considered but have rejected because of another experiment
and why you have rejected them to make sure that others
know it.
Details that could throw doubt on your interpretation must
be given, if you know them. You must do the best you can—if
you know anything at all wrong, or possibly wrong—to ex-
plain it. If you concoct a theory, for example, and advertise it
or publish it, then you must also put down all of the facts that
disagree with it, as well as those that agree with it.
In summary, the idea is to try to give all of the information
to help others to judge the value of your contribution, not
just the information that leads to judgement in one particular
direction or another. We have learned from experience that
the truth will eventually come out. Other experimenters will
repeat your experiment and find out whether you were right
or wrong. Nature's phenomena will agree or disagree with
your theory.
You must be careful not to fool yourself, since you are fre-
quently the easiest person to fool. After you have avoided
fooling yourself, it is easy not to fool other scientists or engi-
neers. You just have to be honest in the conventional was
after that. But you also have an important obligation not to
fool the public. It is this type of integrity, this kind of care not
to fool yourself or others, that must be embraced to avoid ex-
cursions into cargo cult science.

SCIENCE.
A new all-optical logic device could make many electronics systems immune to
effects of natural or man-made "noise," including lightning strikes and radio
interference. Hughes scientists have fabricated a high-speed optical device
that uses no electronic signals. It is made of discrete components, including
four reflecting surfaces and a slab of non-linear material (gallium arsenide).
The device has shown optical bistability (flip-flop behavior) with switching
times of 3 nanoseconds and switch energies under 100 microjoules. Although
propagation delays have kept the device's speed under the theoretical limit up
to 10 gigahertz, the speed will be increased by further miniaturizing of the
device on an integrated optic chip. The device could be used in fault-tolerance
computers, flight control systems, and ultra high-speed signal processors.
A structural and thermal test model of NASA's Galileo Probe is undergoing a
series of tests simulating every environment that the Hughes-built probe will
experience from launch through descent into the Jovian atmosphere in the late
1980s. The model recently passed a descent simulation with temperatures ranging
from -260°F through 240°F and pressures ranging from a vacuum through 235 pounds
per square inch — all in a span of 48 minutes. The Probe contains six instru-
ments that will measure atmosphere characteristics to a depth corresponding to
at least 10 times the pressure of air at sea level of Earth. This will be the
first sampling of the Jovian atmosphere in an attempt to learn its composition.
Pilots soon may get navigational information from a TV display instead of paper
maps. Hughes, under a U.S. Air Force contract, is developing a system that will
use a computer to electronically generate and display realistic pictures of ter-
rain and man-made features. The new map will be coupled to an aircraft's navi-
gation system to help the pilot fly fast and low despite bad weather, darkness,
and radar jamming. Ultimately, production models of the map could be tailored
to meet different mission requirements. One mission, for example, may require
roads and highways as navigational checkpoints, whereas another would require
navigation with reference to terrain features. The prototype will store 250,000
square miles and use more than 1,500 bits of data to encode each square mile.
Hughes needs graduates with degrees in EE, computer science, physics, ME, and
math. To find out how you can become involved in any one of 1,500 high-techno-
logy projects, ranging from submicron microelectronics to advanced large-scale

A 100-kilovolt hydrogen ion source will play a vital role in fusion energy
studies in the Tokamak Test Reactor at Princeton University. The source will
create a 65-ampere beam of deuterium ions that subsequently will be neutralized
by charge exchange to produce a beam of fast neutral particles. This neutral
beam can cross the intense magnetic field lines that contain the plasma in the
reactor. It will fuel and heat the plasma to the point where self-sustained fu-
sion can take place. The reactor, when completed, will use 12 such ion sources.

Robotics Comes of Age
by Neal Donaldson
Brian Windecker
According to some accounts we are on the verge of a new
industrial revolution. Perhaps. But without a doubt, the field
of robotics is a rapidly expanding field of technology whose
impact is only beginning to be felt. From its conception in
small, money losing ventures, it has evolved into an industry
of substantial growth potential by responding to the demands
to increase America's lagging productivity. It is, so to speak,
coming of age.
Robotics traces its roots back to the 1950s, when some of
the initial prototypes were being developed. Planet corpora-
tion introduced a robot called the Planobot in 1955 which was
designed for moving parts from a diecasting machine into a
quench tank, and then to a trim press. It would also do such
mundane tasks as opening a coke bottle and serving it to you,
or mixing a highball or like mixed drink for something more
substantial (a film depicting this was shown at an ASME
meeting in January). Only four or five were ever built as sales
never materialized, and production was discontinued. The
real start of robotics is usually marked by Unimations en-
trance in 1961, with their line of industrial robots.
The 1960s were marked by losses for robotics manufac-
turers. The field maintained a low profile on through the
decade, and interest from industry remained small. Sales of
robots were so difficult that according to one manufacturing
spokesman, "You couldn't give them away". This is an
obvious marked contrast to the present situation. There is
now a peaked interest in the industrial community fof infor-
mation on applications within various areas, and sales are
rapidly increasing.
With the sudden barrage of media attention focused on
robotics, the casual observer can easily get the idea that all
this popped out of nowhere. The question is, why the change
in fortunes? The reason is the controls, and the increased
flexibility and sophistication which have resulted from recent
advances that has most lead to the growth of robotics. It is
this aspect which is most rapidly changing, and which offers
the greatest room for continued expansion. A surprising fact
learned in researching this article is that while the electronics
are ever more rapidly being changed, the main mechanical
components of the robots for at least one company (Unjma-
tion) have remained virtually unchanged for the past twenty
years.
Robotic Terms and Classifications
Some basic robotic terminology is useful in describing, and
understanding robots. Industrial robots have for instance
three basic elements: the controller, the manipulator, and the
power supply. The controller is the unit which remembers the
task, and coordinates the movements. These range in com-
plexity from minicomputers to simple air-logic. The manipu-
lator (or arm) is the mechanical unit which does the work.
The axes of motion often described indicate the motions
available in the manipulator, wrist, and base. The power sup-
ply is what provides the strength. It is either hydraulic,
pneumatic, or electric. These are all supplied as part of the
robot. The hand for the arm (be it a welding gun, grasping
mechanism, etc.) is separate and designed for each specific
task. Sensory equipment can also be added as feedback
devices, as the robot cannot sense things on its own. Research
at some rdbotics institutes is geared towards development of
feedback devices such as those involving tactile and visual
sensing.
Robots are described as servo or non-servo, and point-to-
point or continuous path. A non-servo robot has directional
control valves which are either fully open or closed. This pro-
vides only a limited number of program steps. A servo robot
has valves which can be controlled, allowing variations in
speed and positioning and hence greater versatility. The dif-
ference between point-to-point and continuous path mainly
lies in the way the robots are taught. For point-to-point
robots, learning is done using a teach pendant (which is some-
thing like a remote control switch). They are taught one point
at a time by pressing buttons to make it go forward, back,
etc., and then by releasing, teaches the robot. Continuous
path robots are taught by physically moving the manipulator
through the desired path of motion.
It does take some practice to learn how to teach a robot.
This was demonstrated on visiting the Unimation office in
Farmington Hills. There an auto chassis was used as a demon-
stration and learning device. The authors wondered about the
dings and names scrawled across it, and were told by our
guide that the only catch for employees working on this is that
they had to initialize their mistakes. He then proudly showed
off his own personal dent by the back window done teaching
a point-to-point robot to glue in a rear window.
Some Robot Descriptions
In general, robots in industry are used for two basic pur-
poses: materials handling, and painting and welding. The ma-
terials handling robots come in many sizes. These sizes are
usually defined by end of arm load capacity (in lbs-force) and
reach (in inches). An example of a company which builds only
material handling robots is Copperweld Robotics. Of their
models, the AP 10 and AP 50 have an arm load capacity of 5
*o
Michigan Technic


and 18" respectively, and are pneumatically powered and con-
trolled by a microprocessor.
One of the largest robotics companies, Unimation, has two
lines of robots. The smaller line, the Puma series, has payload
capacities from 15 Ibs to 120 Ibs with reaches of 16" to 36". Of
Unimation's larger line of robots, their largest, the 4000B, has
a maximum lift of 450 Ibs and a reach of 68".
The Armak company (which was at its conception the robot
division of Planet) has a load capacity of 150 Ibs for their
main line of robots. A unique aspect of this line is that the
same end of arm and wrist components'are used, but for ver-
sitility, two standard base designs and/or two standard arm
designs can be interchanged by the manufacturer. A compo-
nent robot is the net result. While these robots all have the
same maximum load capacity, the reach is changed consider-
ably. With a low base and the simplest arm, the horizontal
reach is 31" to 51", and the vertical reach is 20" to 55". On the
more advanced vertical base with jointed arm model, the
values change with a horizontal reach of 24" to 78", and a
vertical reach of 26" to 127" (both of which can be increased
with options).
Since robots can be programed to do different operations,
it is only a matter of control to allow a manufacturer to place
a welding gun or a spray paint gun on the end of a robot arm.
For welding, there are two types of systems: single and multi-
weld. One of the authors viewed both Unimation and Cinnci-
nati Milacron welding robots in use in a Ford assembly plant.
These machines were being used to weld metal body pieces
(such as inner wheel wells and inner fenders, and pieces which
came together to form the cars back window), in one of the
first steps of assembly.
A multi-weld unit within the same Ford facility was used to
weld together large sheet metal body pieces. The process
involved the car body moving down the assembly line, at
which point it would be placed into a large clamping device at
the welding station. The multi-weld unit would then come
into place, and place over 300 welds to connect the sheet
metal pieces at one time.
Robots .then can be adapted as single welding units, or
coupled with a materials handling conveyor system and under
the control of a central unit processor controling many
welding guns, be used to produce a robot which can accom-
plish hundreds of welds simultaneously.
The painting robots viewed were similar to the welding
robots. However, due to the precise nature of the painting
job, a very steady type of control is needed (for a paint job
which will not run or have lines, etc.). Servo robots are more
suited for this type of application.
With their many possible uses, robots are currently being
used in many different manufacturing areas. As previously
mentioned, auto companies use a number of individual weld-
ing robots, multi-weld robots, and painting robots. Along
with their suppliers, they also use many of the material han-
dling type robots. It is for this reason mainly that there are
twice as many robotics firms in Michigan as any other state.
The auto industry is not alone in robot usage. Industries
such as appliances, food processing, Pharmaceuticals, elec-
tronics, and others use robots because of their consistency in
performing intricate and tedious jobs. As the applications of
robots increase, we should see more industries adapting their
manufacturing processes to the implementation of robots.
Changing Jobs
With the implementation of robots in industry, job changes
naturally result. The ideal situation would seem to be where
robots could perform work that is dangerous, or involves
poor working conditions such as heat, odor, dirt, or noise.
This could involve work with blast furnaces, chemicals, or
stamping operations as examples.
When used on the production line, robots are able to in-
crease production by working at speeds beyond which a
human can obtain or sustain. When placed on the slowest
operation, the whole production process is increased. While
desirable from a productivity viewpoint, when placed on an
existing line labor troubles are a real possibility as a speedup
without a methods change is a valid reason for striking.
Labor uncertainty exists as well over the issue of displace-
ment. A job may be dirty, hot, or dangerous, but it is more
desirable than unemployment.
The concern over displacement is real, and has existed since
the introduction of the first machine. Kurt Vonnegut ex-
pressed it 30 years ago in his novel "Player Piano". In it, the
engineers are the elite of society. They have become so effi-
cient at having machines do work that they have managed to
eliminate human work to the point that it begins to cease to
exist. They soon are eliminating their own jobs as well. In a
recent article entitled "The enemy might be those robots",
columnist Bob Greene states his reservations about robots. As
he puts forth in an oversimplified argument, "a robot does
not have good days or bad days; a robot only has perfect
days". Given this atmosphere, what is the actual situation,
and what is being done to address some of the concerns that
people have?
Robots displace workers in what are usually unskilled posi-
tions. That particular job is now eliminated. Does that mean
there are now less jobs, and the former operator is out of
work? Not necessarily. In most cases displaced workers are
moved to positions of higher skill and status (and hence
higher wages), such as maintenance of the robot itself, or
moved to another position of like skill in the production
process. In a number of cases, the addition of robots in pro-
duction resulted in an increase in the number of workers
required, albeit at a level of increased skill.
In regards to an undesirable job being more desirable than
no job at all, let us return to the subject of productivity. An
unproductive company is also unprofitable. In contrast to
Bob Greene, one view expressed is that the auto companies
aren't laying off people because of too many robots, but not
enough robots. While robots may eliminate some jobs, bank-
rupt companies eliminate more.
Michigan Technic


Much of the work of a robotics firm involves the engineer-
ing processes which are necessary before the robot is installed.
The process of implementation of a robot is begun when the
robotics company receives an inquiry from a company inter-
ested in purchasing a robot. At this point, the task becomes
one of identifying how the robots can meet the desired appli-
cations and what capabilities are required, in addition to it's
placement within the existing operation.
Since this may be the first robot application used by this
company for this, or any purpose, questions pertaining to
needs and uses of the robot usually arise. It is for this and
other reasons that the robotics firms will hold seminars to
help bring robots into a company's work force. These semi-
nars deal with implementation of the robot, training of em-
ployees in the use of the robot and its necessary maintenance,
and deals with the questions of workers reaction and accep-
tance. Unimation had established a seminar to specifically
address the questions and concerns of industrial management
consisting of discussions and demonstration material during
the mid seventies.
In all, the robot company does more than just produce the
machine. By assessing the needs of a company and the abil-
ities of their own robots to meet them, they can assist in a
smooth start up and running of the robot operations. By do-
ing this, they can help the company achieve the maximum ef-
fectiveness from their use of robots.
Outlook
Robotics is an area particularly suited to people with
majors in ECE, IOE, and to some extent, ME. The continued
expansion of robotics is dependent on the design of both
hardware and software, and the ability to match robot capa-
bilities to applications within industry by efficient methods
while successfully coordinating its integration into the exist-
ing structure.
Because of robotics dynamic nature, it is an area of tech-
nology well suited for innovative design. With the forecasted
expansion for the field, the opportunity exists to make signifi-
cant individual advancements. The Technic will feature in an
upcoming issue what is currently happening in the university
as work continues here, a discussion of the Industrial Tech-
nology Institute to be based here in Ann Arbor, and what
students can come to expect from them.

50 and 25 Years Ago
by Larry Dong
50 Years Ago
In February, 1932, an article appeared in the Technic en-
titled "Powerful Light Aids Air Maneuvers". It was a report
on a new technical innovation, a portable, but powerful
searchlight. Such an innovation may not appear worth men-
tioning, but at the time, this development had many implica-
tions. Up to this time, pilots flying at night had to rely on
experience and intuition to complete their missions. There
were not any inertial guidance systems or the like to guide
them. The only aid to night flying was moonlight, and even
that was intermittent. For example, German zepplins which
bombed London were never sure whether or not they were
over the British capitol.
Hence, a portable searchlight, mounted on an aircraft,
would revolutionize night warfare. To demonstrate this, a
searchlight, weighing fifty pounds, was mounted on a Curtis
bomber. This bomber flew over Pittsburg and aimed its light
at the top of a local hotel. The beam struck a photocell there,
which in turn ignited a flare, which confirmed a successful
test. Perhaps the flare was to signify a direct hit on a night
bombing mission, the target being the William Penn Hotel.
The success of the experiment meant that aircraft flying
night missions could now be more effective than in the past.
For the first time, it became possible to track nighttime troop
movements. It, like other innovations in the years to come,
would change the face of warfare profoundly.

"A car running on peanut oil seems impossible, but it may
happen within the next ten years." This was the heading of the
article "Free Piston Engines" in the February 1957 issue of
Michigan Technic. Free piston engines are comprised of a
central combusion chamber with two pistons mounted oppo-
site each other. The pistons move free, that is, they are not
attached to a crankshaft. Instead, the pistons are used to
pump air that drives a turbine. This turbine in turn drive the
driveshaft. This engine is similar to the gas turbine engine.
The major difference between the two is that in the free piston
engine, the gas and air mixture is compressed by the pistons
whereas in the gas turbine engine, a separate compressor does
the job.
This engine supposedly has many big advantages over the
traditional engines, one being that the engine will run on
almost any fuel. According to the article, the biggest disad-
vantage of the engine is "... how to get flashy acceleration
and quick starts out of such an engine." It seems that the free
piston engine is exactly what the driving public desires today,
a car that will run on almost any fuel, an engine which is de-
signed not for street racing, but more along the lines of a
commuter car.
According to the article, the free piston engine "... will
mark the first major advance in automobiles since.. .auto-
matic transmission." It also predicted that ".. .when it (free
piston engine) hits the market, an upheaval will be felt all the
way from the dealers show rooms to the gas and oil indus-
tries." We're still waiting, fellas.
The mural which describes the history of U of M engineers in space is explained by Aero engineer Frank Polakowski.

Every year the College of Engineering plays host to students from surrounding high schools in an event known as Tech Day.
On this day, displays are set up and tours are run to the engineering labs around campus. The purpose of Tech Day is to show
the students the benefits of continuing their education at the University of Michigan's College of Engineering.
Todd Grove points out the important features of a float
ing designed by the Naval Architecture department.

The silicon chip.
It's replacing the scalpel
• . *•
His doctors suspect a mass in the
right lung. Exploratory surgery is per-
formed—but without the surgery.
This is made possible because of a major ad-
vance in radiology called the CT Scan (short for
computed tomography).
The CT Scan provides
thousands of digitized X-ray
readings of a patient's body.
Then, using a com-
puter, it synthesizes the
data into a series of cross-
sectional or tomo-
graphic images—all
within seconds.
The detail is incred-
ible. Often a diagnosis can be arrived at immediately
—so the patient is spared the knife.
But it's the heart of the computer that's the real
miracle. The silicon chip.
The silicon chip is responsible for a new wave
in microelectronics and a remarkable revolution in
medical diagnostics.
It's created the digital ultrasound imager. That
helps doctors visualize the womb of a pregnant wom-
an with sound waves to monitor fetal development.
It's created digital fluorography. That
can detect a narrowing in the carotid artery—
without hospitalizing the patient for an angiogram.
General Electric is committed to finding new
ways to make the computer chip serve. In medicine.
And in other industries.
For instance, we're investing 100 million dollars
in our new GE Microelectronics Center.
We've acquired INTERSIL, one of the leading
designers of specialized computer chips. We've also
acquired CALMA, a company which is using CAD/
CAM technology to revitalize the American factor)'.
GE is even exploring new uses for microelectron-
ics in satellite communications, radar and robotics.
Microelectronics is where the future is. A future
that will need talent. Engineering talent.
