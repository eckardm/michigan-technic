THE SOCIAL SIGNIFICANCE OF AERONAUTICS
By DR. W. F. GERHARDT&lt;
HE attempt to discuss a phase of
human activity in general terms is
fraught with several dangers. The
most frequent and important of
these is that it may be so broad
as to have little depth; it may say
"nothing about everything." An-
other and not insignificant difficulty is that one may
be suspected of attempting to show a more
extensive general knowledge than is reasonably
allotted to the individual. And yet, despite these
difficulties, the desirability of attempting such a
general survey at certain intervals is so great that
it is well worth the risk, especially in the precincts
of the University, the very name of which invites
such a task. So we will try to set down a few
characteristics of the attitude which the student en-
tering aeronautics may reasonably take toward his
profession and in which the general public will be
interested as representing his probable aim.
*Dr. Gerhardt recently took up his duties at the Univer-
sity of Michigan as Associate Professor of Aeronautics.
He holds the distinction of being the first engineer to be
graduated from the aero department of this university.
From 1917 to 1919 he received his military training in the
army air service at Chanute Field, Illinois, and Fort
Worth, Texas. He then took up a position as Aero-
nautical Engineer at McCook Field, Dayton. Here he was
in charge of flight research and came into contact with the
very latest developments in army and commercial air-
craft. His interests and investigations in this work re-
sulted in the production of a man-driven multiplane which
he named the "Cycleplane." He received his doctors
degree from the university in the summer of 1924. Dr.
Gerhardt is recognized as an authority on flight testing
and is now preparing a manual on the subject for official
use in the U. S. air service. His personal contact with
the design, flying and testing of all types of planes, makes
him an enthusiastic follower of the game.
Technical Possibilities
Naturally, the first consideration to the engineer
is the material advantages that the new field offers.
It is doubtful if any other technical field is at pres-
ent so rich in possibilities as aeronautics. The
opportunities to invent new and important ap-
paratus, to design and produce many types of air-
craft, and to organize the operation of the same are
certainly without rival in engineering.
Historical
To realize the yet unsolved problems one has only
to consider the historical development of the whole
art and science which is in itself a fascinating study.
As everyone knows the idea to fly is as old as man.
The first references in literature are to mythological
attempts on the part of one Daedelus, a Greek archi-
tect, who sought to escape from the island of Crete
where he and his son Icarus were to be served as
dainties on the Minotour's bill of fare. Realizing
the hitherto unsuspected possibilities of aerial
travel, Daedelus constructed for himself and his son
a set of wax wings, "took off" from the scene of his
imprisonment and sailed for home. Naturally we
would expect the old gentleman to be a reasonably
conservative pilot and that his son might be quite
the reverse; so while Daedelus confined himself to
a few "loops" and "Immelmans," Icarus ventured to
break the altitude record. Flying too near the sun
his wings melted and he plunged earthward to his
death. Here undoubtedly we would find the origin
of the "heroic aviator" complex.
Whatever may have been the early conceptions

of aerial flight, the first to which we can give cre-
dence arc those of Leonard! da Vinci, 1500, that
versatile genius, who was not adverse to mixing art
and science, an emulsion which seems so difficult of
realization. Da Vinci sketched for us three of the
possible seven types of aircraft, namely, the orni-
thopter, the parachute and the helicopter. Even
though he did not go further this alone stamps him

as the "grandfather" of aviation. There are further
unconfirmed references in literature to gliding
flights by a Frenchman by the name of DeBacque-
ville and an Italian by the name of Dante, contem-
poraries of Da Vinci, but the first successful authen-
tic aerial voyage did not come until 1783 when
Lenormand, an Italian, jumped from a tower in a
parachute much like Da Vinci's design and de-
scended safely to earth.
But it was not to be the heavier than air vehicle
that should first accomplish an ascent. This feat
in such a vehicle depended on a power plant, then
still undeveloped. So the balloon, the flotation of
which is independent of propulsion, took the honor
of first ascending with a human passenger. What
had been predicted by Sir Roger Bacon, Black, Ca-
vallo and others was realized when the Mon-
gol fier Brothers successfully piloted their hot air
filled, paper covered bag before the awed royalty
and intelligencia of Paris. Although this flight was
a step in the right direction and a sporting propo-
sition, the undirected balloon has no commercial
value, and it was not until 1784, when the Roberts
Brothers elongated the gas bag, applied their rud-
ders and silken oars, and made short, slow, but
controlled progress through the air, that the first
real human flight can be said to have been made.
Naturally human power is entirely inadequate to
continued operation; we give therefore to Gifford,
who in 1852 designed and built a dirigible propelled
by a steam plant and propeller, the credit of making
the first useful controlled human voyage.
The evolution of the heavier than air machine
needs less comment than its sister craft, for events
have conspired to give the airplane more attention.
While the dirigible was having its early popularity,
devoted experimenters were persisting with designs,
models, gliders and complete machines. In the first
class the names of Cayley and Henson as inventors
of the majority of the airplane devices are most

worthy of mention; in the second, Penaud, String-
fellow and Langley; in the third, Lilienthal, Cha-
nute and the Wrights; and in the last, Phillips,
Ader, Maxim, Langley and the Wrights. How it
was given to these last mentioned to make the first
useful controlled flight in a heavier than air vehicle
in 1903 is too well known to need more than men-
tion. Since that time the airplane has essentially
remained the airplane; the addition of lateral
control, adequate power and proper dimensions
which the Wrights made, definitely established the
airplane as such.
Invention
Thus most of the main types of aircraft are al-
ready established but there are still a number of
important problems of inventive character as yet
unsolved, in connection with aeronautics. In avia-
tion there is still the question of the relative merits
of the internally braced tapered monoplane and the
externally braced multiplane. There is the problem
of the development of multiple geared engines, of
adjustable pitch propellers, special control systems
and other devices of patentrfblc nature.
Again the dirigible of the present day is in general
principle the same as this early prototype, yet a
number of detailed but important variations have
taken place, the relative values of which are not
yet determined. Here is a field for primary develop-
ment. The question of envelope construction and
bracing has split the airship builders into several
schools: (1) All metal, (2) Fabric cover, rigidly

fixed by metal frame, (3) Fabric cover, partially
fixed by metal frame, (4) Fabric cover, non-rigid.
The giant ZR-3, the latest successful development
which is now famous for its trans-Atlantic trip, is
an example of the third class, which has been so
persistently studied by Count Zeppelin and his co-
workers of whom Dr. Eckener is the most promi-
nent. Mr. Ralph Upson, our own celebrated bal-
loonist, is now working in Detroit on the first type
and believes that its future is highly promising.
For those who desire more fundamental inventive
problems there are the helicopter, the airplane heli-
copter and the ornithopter. There are good reasons
to suppose that the last may never find any serious
application, but the first two are certainly probable
future possibilities. It is of interest to note that
while Da Vinci included the helicopter in his 16th
century devices, Phillips Hew a model in 18%, while
Cornu and Breguet succeeded in lifting off in 1898.
While additional contributions have been made by
Karman, Pescara, Oehmichen, de Bothezat and
others, the complete useful controlled helicopter
flight is yet to be made.
Concerning the airplane helicopter the field has
been cultivated almost solely by Touissant and Ber-
liner. In the opinion of many the latest form of the
such apparatus is greater than its size would sug-
gest, for the safety, regularity and economy of oper-
ation of aircraft, which is essential to their commer-
cial application, are dependent almost entirely on
the navigation (or rather "aerogating") instru-
ments. In this field, into which it is impossible
to enter in detail here, there are still inventions of
prime importance to be made. The possibilities to
realize on inventive work are quite great because

These, then, are the main possibilities for radically
new departures involving patentable ideas.

Design and Manufacture
Naturally the majority of technical energy and
skill in connection with aerial development will be
in the details of construction and the processes of
production. As we have remarked, the airplane and
the dirigible are fundamentally invented and it is
possible to develop a commercial program upon
these approved basic ideas. The working out of
the details to produce machines which fulfill the
specific requirements of the duties which they are
to perform, is an important field and one which will
employ large numbers of engineers.
In this work there is the opportunity for the en-
gineer to show his versatility in structural design.

What may be a phase in the development of a successful
helicopter-airplane
For the big problem in aeronautics is not strength
alone but strength per unit weight, and all aero-
nautical structures are designed with that object in
view. Naturally, the development of new materials
and material processes are suggested by the new
conditions. There may be further important steps
to be taken in this direction. Prof. Pawlowski is
of the opinion that some new composition, combin-
ing the strength of metal and the workability of
plaster of Paris should be and can be developed;
he even suggests that it may be applied like bread
by moulding and baking.
There is also the possibility of a new application
of production processes for the engineer who is
interested in industrial engineering. This will come
later when production is justified by demand, un-
less the hopes and beliefs of all workers in aeronau-
tics, among them conservative engineers and busi-
ness men, are quite without foundation.
Operation
There will be fully as interesting possibilities in
the technique of aerial operations as in the other
forms of transportation on sea and land. Aerial
operations will be as much bigger than manufac-
ture of aircraft as railroading is greater than the
building of railroad equipment. This technique will
have ramifications similar to those of the railroad
business ; "piloting" will be only a detail; important,
but nevertheless only a detail. The best examples
of aerial operations on a small scale are the air mail
and the Army airwavs, both of which are now oper-
ating on a regular schedule day and night. This
field offers the possibilities for absorbing the largest
amount of personnel and the engineer who studies
the engineering problem of maintenance, repair,
housing, landing fields, etc., will be anticipating
a large activity.
It is in this connection that business as business
is concerned; there is no need to mention all the

considerations that are involved; they are self-evi-
dent. The insurance phase is worth mentioning for,
until the insuring of aircraft and their related ap-
paratus on a reasonable basis is accomplished,
neither the public confidence nor private enterprise
can permanently be enlisted. Indeed, it goes fur-
ther than a mere phase of the airplane "business";
it is the root of the psychological problem of the
future of aeronautics.
Airplane or Dirigible
The question as to the relative importance of va-
rious types of aircraft and equipment is one that
puzzles the layman. It should be apparent that
each will have its field and that there will be little
conflict; each will be used where the particular
properties which it possesses are in demand and
where its disadvantage, though definite, will have
less weight.
Mr. Steffanson, when among us, stressed the use
of the dirigible in Polar flights. Obviously the lack
of assurance of clear water for hydroplanes or
smooth snow fields for ski-equipped planes gives
any device which does not depend on the character
of the ground for landing and starting, a distinct

EAST PEORIA POWER STATION OF THE ILLINOIS ELECTRIC POWER COMPANY
POWER STATION BUILDINGS
By J. N. HATCH
Member of Western Society of Engineers
IN what I shall say in this paper of the design
and construction of electric power stations, I
will not attempt to follow out in detail the design
of the many parts that make up a power station,
but will endeavor to present to you some interest-
ing features of the planning of such structures in
their broader aspects. An electric power station as
at present understood is generally a central station,
where power is generated in large quantities and is
distributed to considerable distances. It is con-
cerning such structures that the following is
written:
The central station idea has grown up with the
development of the modern uses of electrical energy,
and the present central station has been developed
mostly within the past twelve or fifteen years. In
the early uses of electricity, before long distance
transmission of energy had been developed, the
amount of power required from any one power sta-
tion was small, and therefore the requirements in
the way of buildings for housing the generating
machinery were very simple. Almost any sort of a
frame building was considered good enough and
no special design was thought necessary. The coal
was unloaded and fired by hand, the ashes removed
with wheelbarrows; no condensing water was re-
quired, no traveling cranes were used, and any par-
ticular arrangements for the handling of electrical
energy at high potentials were unknown. But with
the centralization of power in large units the prob-
lem of working out a proper design for the build-
ings and foundations has become a very important
branch of engineering.
It is sometimes argued that anything in the way
of architectural adornment in a power station build-
ing is a waste of money. Thomas Carlyle, in his
Sartor Resartus, takes the position that a man is
judged, by his fellow men, according to the clothes
he wears. That it is the clothes, not the man, that
we see, and that therefore we of necessity must
judge him by the kind and quality of his clothes.
In a measure, this is true of any business enter-
prise; it is judged by the outside appearance it dis-
plays. And the stability and success of the enter-
prise and the character and ability of the men be-
hind it are judged, consciously or unconsciously,
by the appearance of its physical property. This is
true of power stations in a marked degree, and as
the building cost is only a very small percentage
of the investment in the entire station, the extra
amount required to add a few artistic touches to the
exterior and interior finish is so small as to be
almost insignificant. For instance, suppose the
entire station represents an investment of $2,000,-
000.00, the building portion would probably cost in
the neighborhood of $300,000.00. The difference in
cost between building this entirely plain and un-
adorned and building it with a neat, artistic appear-
ance would probably not involve over $10,000.00
or $15,000.00, which would only represent some-
thing like one-half of one per cent.
So I would always suggest giving a certain

amount of careful planning to the appearance of the
building and have it worked out in as good propor-
tions as possible, and built of gocd-looking, plain
material. Not in the attempt to make a power sta-
tion look like a Carnegie Library or a Memorial
building, on the one hand, nor contented with the
appearance of a coal shed or an ice house on the
other. A power station should look like what it is
and have a distinguishing type of its own.
Preliminary Studies
The layout of the machinery is the fundamental
determination in planning a power station. But if
the machinery layout is made arbitrarily, without
any especial reference to the building design, it
often becomes very difficult, if not impossible, to
design a neat and well-balanced building to enclose
the said machinery. For although the artist in
reality makes a picture of the clothes instead of the
person, he nevertheless strives to bring out the
beauty of his subject by the artistic lines and folds
of the garments and by a harmonious choice of
colors, blending as well as possible with the com-
plexion and expression of the paintee. But there
are human frames so ill-shapen and misshapen as
to defy the most artistic outline. So it is in plan-
ning a power station. In order to make a neat
appearing structure, it is necessary that the machin-
ery and apparatus be arranged with some thought
THE RIVER ROUGE POWER PLANT OF THE
FORD MOTOR COMPANY
of the building which is to enclose them, even
though this may not be quite the best arrangement
for the machinery itself.
So, for any power station design, it is very desir-
able that the mechanical, electrical and building
engineers work very close together, so that the
machinery and the electrical layout can be arranged
with some reference to the building features. In
order to accomplish this, it is generally necessary
to make a number of preliminary studies and then,
by a process of elimination and rectification, work
out a design that will best serve the ends of all.
As soon as a design is tentatively decided upon
which will determine the main features of the build-
ing, the work of the real design of the building can
be started. The first work is to draw up a skele-
ton of the building and work up two or three eleva-
tions. From the skeleton, a very good idea can be
gained as to where principal loads will be concen-
trated on the foundations and as to where the col-
umns will be located. The elevations will serve to
determine the location of windows, doors and other
openings. By the time three or four such skeleton
drawings have been worked out, some interferences
have probably developed that could not have been
foreseen and which will require some adjustment in
the mechanical or electrical layout. There may be
water pipes or steam pipes coming directly through
where a column is wanted, smoke flues interfering
with the lower chord of roof trusses; coal conveyors
coming in the way of doors or windows, or crane
girders intersecting outgoing lines. So when the
skeleton has been pretty well developed, a very
considerable change is often necessary to make the
clothes and the figure conform.
Foundation Work
One of the first things to be decided is the kind
of foundations that will be required. This is gener-
ally one of the most important things a building
engineer has to decide. A large power station is
generally located upon some large steam or body
of water, so that water for condensing will be read-
ily obtained. This of itself often makes the founda-
tion problem one requiring careful study and plan-
ning.
The site for a power station may be on the lake
shore, where the high waves and shifting sand
make a problem of one nature; or it may be on salt
water, where the corrosive conditions are very
severe; or it may be on the bank of a river, where
the rise and fall of the river between extreme high
and extreme low water is 60 or 70 feet; or it may
be along the Missouri River, where the quicksands
are extremely treacherous; or along the Mississippi
River, where the foundation will be on solid rock.
Very often the particular site is fixed by some cir-
cumstance outside of the province of engineering.
The engineer usually has to take things as he finds
them, and must design a foundation to meet the
requirements and comply with the conditions as
they are found to exist.
If the site of the proposed power station is in a
city or town, it is often possible to gain consider-
able knowledge from the investigation of struc-
tures that have been built in the vicinity and from
an inquiry of the nature and character of the under-
lying soil. But it often happens that a station is
built far away from any other buildings and the
engineer in charge must make all preliminary deter-


Page 11
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
initiations from his own investigations. In most
cases it is necessary to have a number of borings
made, and in addition to these borings, it is often
advisable to have a few test holes dug down as
deep as the earth can be conveniently excavated.
These test holes will afford a means of examining
the nature of the different strata of earth "in situa."
From this examination, a good idea can be obtained
of what loads the earth will safely bear per square
foot. The safe bearing power may prove to be some-
what different after the excavation is made, from
what it appeared to be from the preliminary
examination, but will seldom be different enough
to change the design of the building in general.
Whether the foundation is simply to rest upon the
earth or whether it must have piles or caissons is
a matter which must be decided by the building
engineer from his investigation of the soil and
the surroundings.
It is generally necessary to bring a large intake
and discharge tunnel into the center of the building.
This also complicates the foundation problem. Of
course, the tunnel must be below low water, which
may mean that the bottom of the tunnel excavation
will be fifty or sixty feet below the main level of
the station. All this must be carefully taken into
consideration when deciding on the style of the
building foundations to adopt. If the underlying
material is solid rock and the tunnel can be driven
through solid rock the problem is not likely to be a
complicated one, as the building can be safely built
over the tunnel without much danger of trouble.
But if, as is often the case on the bank of a river,
the underlying material is sand and gravel to an
indefinite depth the tunnel problem is much more
difficult and perplexing. .It is very difficult to drive
a tunnel through sand and gravel, and almost im-
possible to keep the surface earth from settling
more or less over the tunnel.
In spite of the Bible warning against building a
house "upon the sand," sand and gravel are about
the best materials next to solid rock that can be
found upon which to place a foundation for a heavy
building. But of course, these materials must be
confined and must not be undermined by deeper
foundations nearby. Clay is always a treacherous
material on which to place a heavy foundation, espe-
cially if it is subject to alternate saturation and ex-
treme dryness. It is very difficult to judge of the
load that clay will safely bear, as it seems that
almost any clay is subject to some compression,
which, although taking place very slowly, may
continue for many years and become a significant
amount in time.
If, upon examination of the site, the engineer is
convinced that the underlying materials do not
have sufficient bearing power to carry the building
safely, he must resort to some method of increasing
this bearing power sufficiently to make it safe. If
it is found that there is a hard underlying stratum
which can be reached by piles, it may be determined
to drive piles on which the loads may be carried.
If it is found that the materials do not become solid
until a depth of eighty or a hundred feet are
reached, so that piles cannot be driven to solid mate-
rials, it may be desirable to use so-called caissons,
made by digging wells five to eight feet in diameter,
down to a solid footing and filling these wells with
concrete and distributing all loads to these caissons.
TRENTON CHANNEL POWER STATION OF THE
DETROIT EDISON COMPANY
If a heavy building is to be placed on soil of a
quicksand nature where piles would not be practic-
able, some method other than any of those just men-
tioned must be resorted to. A method which has
been used to a considerable extent where ground
of this nature was encountered is the placing of the
entire structure on a reinforced concrete mat. This
mat is generally made five or six feet thick and
thoroughly reinforced in both directions, both top
and bottom, in the hope that if there is settlement
it will be so uniform over the entire building as not
to be noticeable. One serious difficulty with this
method is to know what is going to happen where
the tunnel joins this mat. If the entire mat does
settle any considerable amount, it is likely to break
away from the tunnel where the two join.
From what has been said, I think it is clear that
the determination of what style of foundation is
best adapted for any particular location is a prob-
lem of itself and must be solved for that particular
site and the particular building which is required.
As soon as the general arrangement of the ma-
chinery has been decided upon and a skeleton
plan and cross section of the building has been
worked out, and the elevation of the exterior has
been tentatively fixed, the detailed location of all
walls, piers and columns must be decided upon, so
that foundation walls and footing can be designed.
Since it is impossible to figure the size of the walls,
piers and columns until the loads upon them are
known, and furthermore, since it is impossible to

SMOKE ABATEMENT
H. E. KEELER, M. S. E.
Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering
THE problem of smoke abatement has been be-
fore the attention of engineers and the general
public for a great many years and a large amount
of time and money has been, and is being spent
annually by cities, towns and industrial organiza-
tions to eliminate or minimize the smoke nuisance
as much as possible. This article will attempt
to show what some of the major causes of smoke-
production are and what means may be employed
to abolish or reduce it.
From the standpoint of a municipality or a com-
munity the greatest objection to smoke is that it
of course makes a dirty condition of streets and
building exteriors, but above all it renders any
locality offensive in appearance and this latter is
the greatest single objection. Along with these of
course go pollution of the atmosphere; the corro-
sion of exposed metal-work; rain-water pollution;
unsjghtly condition of building exteriors and con-
sequent increased costs for washing, painting, etc.
Before proceeding it is well to note that "smoke,"
to the average person means anything visible
emerging from the top of a stack or chimney. The
engineer differentiates further and to him, "smoke,"
really means the flocculent carbon content emerg-
ing along with the fine solid particles and other
invisible gases which are the products of combus-
tion. The general phrase, "smoke-abatement," to
him means more than the mere removal of these
black carbon particles so that they are no longer
visible. "Smoke-abatement," to him means pre-
venting the release of these black, carbon particles;
the removal of all fine ash from the gaseous prod-
ucts of combustion before they leave the stack
and the disposal of the undesirable, invisible gases
at a point and height where they are inoffensive
to persons in the immediate vicinity.
Having now stated the problem in a general way
we will first investigate the causes of smoke pro-
duction.
Fundamentally the release of black carbon par-
ticles as a combustion product and their consequent
appearance in the stack ordinarily result from:
1. An insufficient amount of air during the com-
bustion process to reduce all the carbon of
the volatile hydrocarbons to invisible gas-
eous products such as CO and CO.
2. A proper amount of air for combustion of
the volatile hydrocarbons but an insufficient
interval of time allowed for the completion
of the process and the chilling of the incan-
descent carbon particles below the kindling
temperature.
3. An excess amount of cold air, for the combus-
tion of the volatile hydrocarbons, especially
if admitted at unfavorable locations in the
combustion zone.
4. A combination of any two or all three of the
above reasons.
In explanation of (1) above, suppose that we
had one pound of volatile hydrocarbons and that
enough air is available to burn only three-quarters
of this pound; the remainder must pass off as,
"smoke."
Referring to (2) above; assume again one pound
of volatile hydrocarbons and exactly the right
amount of air for complete combustion. It is easily
recognized that while the ordinary process of com-
bustion may be continuous, it is not instantaneous,
and this is shown by the long flames emerging from
burning coal. If these flames impinge on water-
cooled or other surfaces which are capable of cool-
ing the incandescent carbon particles below their
kindling temperature, flocculent carbon will result
and pass off as smoke.
Referring to (3) above; the admission of excess
cold air into the combustion zone has the same net
effect as allowing the luminous flame to impinge
on surfaces having a temperature less than the
kindling temperature of carbon, thus producing
smoke.
Then as noted in (4), all of the above causes may
be operating simultaneously.
Having discussed the ordinary causes of smoke
production the next question logically arising is;
"Knowing these causes of smoke-production why
are not furnaces of all classes designed to eliminate
these causes?" The reasons for this may be
summed up as follows:
1. It is absolutely impossible to design a fur-
nace which will operate smokelessly without
proper operation. It is a notorious fact that
the best designed furnaces in the hands of
unskilled operators may be the worst of-
fenders.
2. Under certain conditions it might not be de-
sirable to spend the capital necessary for


Page 13
THE MICHIGAN T E C H N I C
smokeless operation. Incidentally there are
some startling facts, either not generally
known or else improperly understood by the
general public.
The facts are these;
1. A furnace may be operating with a badly
smoking stack and yet be operating much
more efficiently than a similar furnace oper-
ating with a practically clear stack.
2. Even with the maximum amount of smoke
that a furnace will produce the actual heat-
loss based on heating value of the fuel fired.
will rarely exceed 2 per cent.
Therefore the furnace which is smoking badly
may be losing ll/2 to 2 per cent, of the heating-
value of the coal supplied as visible smoke whereas
the furnace operating with the practically clear
stack may be operating with a loss of 20 per cent,
or even more, due to excess air. And in passing,
it is this fact that makes smoke-prevention work
difficult in some classes of furnaces; the fact that
in many cases no great economy will result by mak-
ing necessary furnace changes to insure improved
operation with respect to smoke emission.
It must be recognized at the outset that rigid
classifications of types of furnaces; conditions of
operation and so forth are impossible and that every
particular city, community or industry has prob-
lems peculiarly its own. These problems must all
be studied on that basis and recommendations made
accordingly. It would be impossible to apply ex-
actly the same kind of preventive measures and
legislation to a great steel district like 1'ittsburgh,
as would be applied to a great thickly congested,
financial, commercial and mercantile district like
New York City or to a largely residential city like
Ann Arbor.
The main sources of smoke-produc-
tion fall into three reasonably well
defined classes which are:
1. Central stations, industrial
power stations, etc.
2. Small power plants, large com-
mercial heating plants in office
buildings, apartment houses,
public schools, etc.
3. Residences.
As a rule the large central stations
ar.e not apt to produce much smoke.
The reasons are that the furnaces are practically
always of the best design and are operated in the
most efficient manner and hence, a practically
smokeless operation follows. The locations of these
plants are usually away from the residential and
business districts of cities where smoke is most
offensive. Considered as a class they are not usual-
ly a difficult phase of the smoke-abatement prob-
lem. Large industrial power plants in general may
be classified with central stations.
In the case of small power-plants, large com-
mercial heating plants in office buildings, apart-
ment-houses, public schools, etc., the problem of
smoke abatement is a difficult one. In most of
these plants the firing is done by a janitor or
attendant who has other duties to perform and
whose method of firing is to fire as much coal as
possible and as infrequently as possible with the
consequent heavy production of smoke. Along
with this go many other things such as poor types
of furnaces, poor installations, improper chimney
heights, poor regulation of drafts and the much
more general use of bituminous coals than formerly.
The smoke-emission from residences is not apt to
be extensive enough to represent a serious phase
of the problem.
Having briefly reviewed the causes of smoke-
production and some of the principal classes of
service in which fuel is burned, the question is,
"What can be done to reduce the smoke-nuisance?"
A representative small city of about 30,000 in-
habitants will be assumed in which no ordinances
previously existed relative to the smoke problem
and that the necessary ordinances are to be passed
and the proper provision made for their enforce-
ment.
The first thing to do is to make a careful study
of the ordinances applying to cities of a size and
type similar to the one in question together with
as careful a study as possible of local conditions.
A study is also made of smoke-regulations of large
cities which have had many special conditions to
meet and see what features may be applicable
locally. Having thus determined upon a set of reg-
ulations for smoke-abatement and having them
officially passed as an ordinance, the first step in
the problem has been taken.
No- '• No. 2. No. a No. 4.
The Ringelmann Smoke Chart (Greatly Reduced)
The next and most difficult thing is to apply these
regulations, and the methods of doing this will next
be discussed.
Before any set of regulations can be enforced
there must be some standard established. Or,
stated another way, there must be a reasonable
amount of smoke-emission allowed before smoke-
regulations will have been violated and the owner
of the offending stack held responsible for the same.
The method most commonly used employs the


November, 1924
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Ringelmann Smoke Chart. This chart to a greatly
reduced scale is shown on page 13.
The four charts shown are printed on a folder
12 inches by 26 inches over all and are published
by the U. S. Geological Survey. Each individual
chart consists of 294 squares; 14 squares wide and
21 squares in length, the widths of the lines and
spacings varying as indicated. When this chart
is mounted at the standard distance of 50 feet from
the observer the lines become invisible and the in-
dividual charts appear as different shades of gray
which range from a very light gray to almost black.
The Ringelmann Scale for grading smoke density
is as follows:
No. 0— 0 per cent.—Perfectly clear.
No. 1— 20 per cent.—Light gray.
No. 2— 40 per cent.—Medium gray.
No. 3— 60 per cent.—Dense gray.
No. 4— 80 per cent—Medium black.
No. 5—100 per cent.—Dense black.
To make an inspection of a stack the inspector
sets up this chart 50 feet from the base of the stack
and records over a sufficient period of time at regu-
lar and frequent intervals the number designating
the smoke-density corresponding to the Ringel-
mann scale. A good inspector, after much experi-
ence, will estimate to the nearest one-half of a rat-
ing number, or the nearest 10 per cent. Having
obtained sufficient data on any stack, the next thing
to do is to work it up into its final form and from
it determine whether the stack operation is or is
not complying with the smoke regulations.
A "smoke-unit," is the equivalent of No. 1 smoke
emitted for one minute; or, if a stack emits No. 5
smoke for 2 minutes, 2 times 5, or 10, smoke-units
are charged against it.
The average smoke density is computed on some
specified time basis, usually an hour, and most
ordinances specify that the average density over
an hour shall not exceed a certain percentage to-
gether with the provision that the stack shall not
emit dense black smoke for a greater period than,
say, five minutes in any one hour.
When starting out to apply smoke regulations
it is necessary to choose a particular class of plants
which produce smoke and it is usually desirable
to choose the largest plants first because for a given
amount of effort spent the most beneficial results
can be produced. After having determined the
class of stacks it is necessary to make a smoke
survey by means of the Ringelmann smoke chart
method and work up the exact results of the tests.
Incidentally, smoke surveys are best made at the
times when the smoke conditions are most acute
for any given type of plant.
Having worked up the results of the smoke-sur-
vey, the owners or operators should be provided
with the test data pertaining to the operation of
their respective stacks and the results discussed
in detail and any reasonable assistance offered to
assist them to come within the regulations. The
whole problem of smoke-abatement and enforce-
ment of the smoke ordinances usually comes under
the jurisdiction of the City Engineering Depart-
ment.
It is a fairly easy matter to determine what stacks
do or do not comply with the ordinances but to
bring them into compliance is another problem of
an exceedingly complicated nature and it is almost
impossible to lay down any general rules covering
all cases.
In general, the best manner of procedure is to
inspect the particular stack and equipment and see
if the smoke-nuisance is not a result of things such
as cracked furnace settings, dirty flues, insufficient
draft, restriction of air supply, and above all the
employment of improper firing methods. These
are things which can be corrected by the plant
owner or operator and frequently will greatly re-
duce his smoke-emission. The idea behind all of
this is to give every stack owner an opportunity to
comply with the regulations without any or at least
only a small expenditure of money. If these reme-
dies fail to produce the desired results then it be-
comes a question of installing additional or new
equipment which will operate within the limits of
the ordinance.
It is worthy of note that a great deal of the smoke
nuisance for any particular condition may be elimi-
nated by a study of the furnace and operating con-
ditions and a selection of a proper type of coal or
by resorting to oil-firing.
When it becomes necessary for furnace recon-
struction or the installation of new equipment to
meet existing ordinances, it is clearly not the func-
tion of a municipality to do engineering for the
individual or to make specific recommendations on
equipment in individual cases. Moreover, as has
been previously stated, there is always the possi-
bility that the best designed installation may be
made the worst smoke offender as a result of unin-
telligent operation and the human element is not
always capable of control.
Having finished with one class of stacks the same
course is pursued with other classes until resi-
dences are up for consideration. Residences are the
least offensive class and ordinarily are not classed
as offenders although provision may be made in
regulations whereby a serious offender might be
called upon to improve his operation.
Looking at the problem of smoke-abatement in
its broader aspects it must be recognized that work-
able ordinances must be enacted; that they must
be enforced in a reasonable and fair manner by

ENLARGING AN HISTORIC WATERWAY
By JACK McCLANE
AS Summit Bridge is approached through the
beautiful farming country of New Castle coun-
try, a long series of mounds built up apparently of
enormous pebbles piled here by some glacial pro-
cess—in reality the clay cuttings from the hidden
dredges working in the Deep Cut, worn smooth by
passage through the long pipe line they are pumped
through—comes suddenly into view as the first
indication of the nearby presence of the Chesa-
peake and Delaware Canal.
When the old canal was dug by hand labor a
hundred years ago, its construction employed at
one time between two and three
thousand men. Today, on the en-
largement project, which will
change it from a lock canal ten
feet deep at mean low water and
having a bottom width of ninety
feet, there are probably not more
than a few hundred men working
along the whole canal on the
dredging and steam shovel crews.
Nevertheless, the job of pushing
forward through the high water-
shed at Summit Bridge is one of
truly gigantic proportions; and
the dredges as they undercut the
bank were exposed to a great deal
of danger before explosives were
resorted to as a means of feeding
the ground down gradually into
the canal. The extent of the proj-
ect can be judged by the fact that
fourteen million cubic yards of
material will have been removed
when it is completed.
Lying midway between Phila-
delphia and Baltimore, the 15
mile canal shortens immensely
the water trip between these two
cities, for without it the trip would necessitate circ-
ling the entire peninsula. Passenger boats leaving
Philadelphia at five p. m., arrive in Baltimore at six
o'clock the next morning.
When the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal was
being dug in 1854 immense slides occurred in the
Summit Bridge section, half way between the ex-
tremities of the canal as marked by the cities for
which it was named. In one case 375,000 cubic
yards of material piled nearby slipped back into the
water. It was this sort of construction difficulty,
so hard to overcome before the davs of mechanical

timore and Philadelphia nearly 425
miles.
equipment, which made the canal cost $2,250,000
at a time when labor was relatively cheap and the
dollar had a far higher value than now.
The widening and deepening of the canal in the
two miles westward from Summit Bridge towards
Chesapeake City is the backbone of the enlargement
project. Here, in the Deep Cut where seven mil-
lion cubic yards are being taken out, is being oper-
ated one of the largest hydraulic dredges - in the
world, containing an eighteen hundred H. P. cen-
trifugal pump which forces the heavy clay cuttings
through a twenty-six inch line that climbs the high
north bank and empties into the
disposal area on the far side.
Blasting the bank has made it
safe for the dredges to approach
without risk of being buried in,
or swamped by a slide—such, as
the one, which, when the canal
was first being built, precipitated
350,000 cu. yds. into the canal
almost at this very place—and
has also enormously decreased
the cost of dredging. Those in
charge of the land operations
have found it necessary to vary
the method of throwing down the
bank continually as the work
progresses because of rapid and
unexpected changes in the surface
formation. For where in some
parts the strata of sand and gravel
extending downwards practically
to the water's edge allowed the
shots to crumble the bank effect-
ively, in others, where the under-
lying white and red clay rose
above the canal level, it was more
difficult for the powder to make
headway against this elastic re-
sistance, which required more powder.
When time allowed, the drill holes were sunk
with a churn drill down to the canal level. After
being sprung, they were then loaded w7ith 200 to
500 Ibs. of R. R. P., 10 per cent strength, according
to the size of the -burden to be broken, and fired
electrically one at a time. Where water was en-
countered a casing was sometimes lowered, but in
order to keep pace with the dredge this was not
generally possible. For many of the holes a hand-
drill is now being used, and thirty foot holes in-
stead of fifty are loaded with 150 Ibs. of powder.


November, 1924
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
The holes are sprung once with three sticks of 20
per cent dynamite. Five by ten inch cartridges are
used for the shots, set off with a blasting machine.
The frequent presence in the Deep Cut region of
underground springs and ledges of hard bog iron
ore has hindered the blasting crew from using holes
of any standard depth. At points also where clay
was touched it was impracticable to go deeper. On
an average the holes have been drilled about 15
feet back from the edge of the bank, and spaced 40
feet. Before each shot the dredge would be sig-
nalled so that it could
move over to the far
shore of the canal and
there be out of danger.
While in some instances
an immediate large slide
followed the blast, in the
majority of cases the
ground fed down grad-
ually into the dredge for
several hours afterwards.
Sticks placed on the sur-
face cracks are watched
so that the dredge can
be warned whenever
these crevices have be-
come dangerously wide.
The big dredge Clare-
mont which is equipped
with an 1,800 H. P.
pump is probably estab-
lishing a record by lift-
ing the material nearly
90 feet high through its
26 inch pipe line.
The lever room, which
corresponds to the pilot
house on ship, is the
point from which all the
operations are con-
trolled. There the oper-
ator has vacuum and
pressure gauges which
tell him the proportion
of water to mud being
pumped, and he knows by the sound
how it is working.
The six-ton cutter, which is located in the bow,
projects forward beneath the surface of the water,
and is directed by swinging the bow of the dredge
from side to side with one or the other of the
"spuds" as a pivot point. This swinging is accom-
plished by drums that wind in and let out cables
fastened to tree stumps along the banks. The
dredge "walks" ahead by lifting and dropping the
"spuds" alternately as it swings. In the illustration
THE CLAREMONT IN ACTION
This hydraulic dredge, one of the largest in the world, is
equipped with an 1800 H. P. marine engine which
operates the centrifugal pump.
&gt;f the cutter
it is seen working on the spud next to the pontoon
line. The operator also regulates the depth at
which the cutter works by means of the cables from
which the cutter hangs and he signals the engine
room when to start and stop the pump.
The hydraulic dredges, of which there arc six
working in the canal, operate on three eight-hour
shifts. Where the Claremont is now dredging it
moves ahead about fifteen feet a day, excavating
perhaps six hundred cubic yards to the linear foot.
The rate of progress, however, in distance covered,
naturally depends upon
the height and width of
the bank being undercut.
In cubic yards removed,
the record thus far is
272,000 a month. When
a single dredge handles
two hundred thousand
cubic yards a month it
is doing good work.
Throughout the Sum-
mit Bridge area resounds
the clanking and panting
of the dredges in the
canal. The great cutters
which are biting into the
north bank thirty-five
feet under water, are
only idle over shut-
downs for repairs or
when the pipe line con-
nections to the disposal
area are being changed
as the dredge moves for-
ward. A new section of
pump line is always laid
up the bank several feet
ahead of the one through
which the dredge is
pumping, so that the
pontoon line can be
promptly switched to
this when time for mov-
ing arrives. Dredging
must also stop temporar-
ily when the pipe line becomes blocked by the heavy
and compact clay cuttings, many of which weigh
over two hundred pounds. A gage in the lever
room tells the operator when this happens, warn-
ing him to signal the engine room for the pump to
be stopped before the steam pressure climbs too
high; while geyser-like leaks of mud and water
springing high into the air from the pump line con-
nections, or perhaps the sudden blowing apart of
two pontoons, informs the shore workers of the
trouble in a more spectacular manner.

A STYLE OF CUTTER
The wear and tear on the blades is so great that each con-
tractor has to design these to suit the particular kind
of undercutting work he has to do. The depth
is regulated by the cables pictured.
Although there is a spillway at Guthrie's Run
over which the water pumped out with the cuttings
by the hydraulic dredges can run back into the
canal, a part of it is naturally dissipated throughout
the disposal area and does not return. A centrif-
ugal pumping unit, oil operated, to deliver fifty-
million gallons of make-up water daily to the sum-
mit level of the canal, was therefore added to the
steam equipment.
The enlargement project will probably be finished
—with the old locks taken out and three new high-
way bridges built over the widened and deepened
canal—in 1926. The estimated cost of the improve-
ment is about nine and a half million dollars.
The old canal was bought by the United States
in August of 1919 for about two and one-half mil-
lion dollars from the company then operating it. It
has been open to navigation ever since it was taken
over by the Government; except during eleven days
when the dredging plant was being admitted to the
summit level. In order to allow boats to pass, the
dredges have only to slack off on the shore cables
which obstruct the channel, allowing them to sink-
to the bottom of the canal. The usual draft of

nine feet; the freight carried being principally acids,
coal, fertilizers, grain, lumber, mine props, pulp
wood, tomatoes, sugar, metals, and general mer-
chandise. There are bulkheads on both sides of the
canal at Delaware City, St. Georges and Chesapeake
City, where freight stations are also located. The
improvement work lies in the Wilmington, Dela-
ware, government district, which includes the trib-
utaries of the Delaware River and Bay and the
streams, bays, and inlets along the Atlantic from
Toms River, New- Jersey, to Metompkin Inlet, Vir-
ginia. A future project will probably be the deepen-
ing of the new tidal canal from twelve feet to
twenty-five feet, so that larger sea-going vessels
can also make use of it.

DEEPEST OCEAN SOUNDING
The deepest place in any ocean so far discovered
is located about 50 miles from the coast of Japan
in the Pacific Ocean, according to information
given out today by the Department of the Interior
through the Geological Survey.
The Japanese man-of-war, the Manchu, found
the spot recently while on a chart-making expedi-
tion for the Japanese Navy Department. Its depth
was so great that it could not be measured for the
reason that the sounding wire carried by the ves-
sel reached only 32,644 feet or nearly 6J4 miles.
How much deeper than the length of the sound-
ing wire used the ocean may be at this place can-
not even be guessed. The greatest ocean depth
previously known was discovered by a German
surveying ship in 1912, at a place off the coast of
Mindanao, Philippine Islands, where bottom was
reached at a depth of 32,113 feet. These great
depths have lately become interesting in connec-
tion with the study of earthquakes that appear to
be produced by the slipping of strata along planes
deep in the crust of the earth.
The deepest place in the Atlantic Ocean thus far
found lies just east of the Island of Haiti, where
the depth is 27,922 feet. This great "deep" also is
in an area that is shaken by earthquakes.
The new sonic sounding apparatus, an American
invention that measures depths by recording the
time required for sound waves to travel to the
ocean's bottom and return, will facilitate the meas-
urement of great depths of water. This apparatus
gives a new significance to the word "sounding."'

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
THE HEART OF ELECTRICAL APPARATUS
By H. B. BASSETT
Western Sales Manager, Acme Wire Company
A LENGTH of wire coiled around an iron core
can do wonders when properly applied to an
electrical circuit. Coils are the vital parts of prac-
tically all electrical equipment. Is it any wonder,
then, that the manufacture of coils and all materials
going into them has kept pace with the giant strides
of development in electrical apparatus?
Insulated copper magnet wire seems like a "dead"
subject and the assumption is often made that it is
just what it was fifteen or twenty years ago. How-
ever, the manufacture, especially of the fine sizes of
magnet wire, has developed into a high art.
The principal changes have, of course, come in
the sizes finer than approximately No. IS B &amp; S
gauge. Equipment using the finer sizes of wire is
now usually produced in large quantities and the
best production methods of machine winding pre-
vail. In machine winding, costs mount rapidly un-
less magnet wire of the highest uniform quality is
used.
Then too, the finer sizes are used in equipment
where the saving of space is of increasing import-
ance. The demand of the electrical engineer is for
smaller and smaller windings with a definite num-
ber of turns and size of wire, that the coils may
wind more easily, be more compact, and thus more
efficient.
The first requirement of magnet wire is that the
gauge be accurate. In these days of big produc-
tion and improved design of electrical apparatus,
the size of copper must be correct to make possible
the duplication of characteristics in the finished
product.
Round wire is drawn to a desired diameter by
being pulled through a series of diamond dies.
Usually one die is used for each reduction in B &amp;
S gauge. A soap solution is used as a lubricant.
Until ten or twelve years ago cotton and silk
were the principal materials used in insulating mag-
net wire. Since that time enameled wire has
reached a high state of perfection. Because of its
unusual dielectric strength (a minimum of 600 volts
per mil thickness of enamel film) and its small in-
crease in diameter over the bare copper, enameled
wire has today become the most important type of
insulated magnet wire.
All processes such as drawing or insulating must
be continuous because of the nature of the product.
Copper wire is enameled by a series of dips and
bakes. The wire runs from a spool through a bath
of enameling varnish, up through a tall oven, back
through the varnish and oven again, and so on until
the coating is completed when the insulated wire
is taken up on a spool. This process and the
inspection of the wire has of necessity been devel-
oped to a high point in order to insure uniformity
in the quality and the amount of film on the wire.
A seemingly insignificant variation would render
the product unfit for use. . .,
In the last three or four years the rapidly grow-
ing radio industry has put the stress of develop-
ment upon the very fine sizes of enameled wire.
It was only a short time ago that No. 36 B &amp; S
gauge (.005" diameter of the bare copper) was the
smallest size obtainable in large quantities and No.
38 B &amp; S gauge was not to be found except in a
laboratory. This wire was used largely in ignition
and in meter coils.
To meet the demand for more compact and more
efficient coils the processes of enameling and wind-
ing wires have been developed so that today, while
most of the demand is for No. 40 B &amp; S gauge, a
decided commercial success has been made of No.
44 B &amp; S gauge. (.002" diameter.) Practically all
of the wire of these fine sizes is used in certain of
the radio iron core transformers, headsets, and loud
speakers. When it is understood that one pound
of No. 44 B &amp; S gauge consists of 80,000 feet of
wire (over fifteen miles) and that it is only .002"
in diameter, the great care and skill necessary in
its production and use will be appreciated.
Occasionally an application calls for still smaller
enameled copper wire. The finest that has been
enameled in any quantity is .0015" in diameter.
This wire is about half the size of a human hair
and runs to the amazing length of twenty-eight
miles to a pound.
A relatively new application for enameled wire
which cannot be overlooked is its use as a radio
aerial. This is usually made up of seven strands
of No. 22 B &amp; S gauge, enameled wire. The enamel
prevents corrosion, gives a greater effective surface
area for the passage of the high frequency currents
and helps to maintain reception at a maximum.
Enameled wire is not indestructible. In struc-
ture the film of enamel is very much like glass. It
must be handled most carefully in winding and
should not be allowed to rub over anything. All
guides to the wire should rotate. In winding at
high speeds the impact on the wire as it goes into
the coil will injure the enamel unless uniform ten-
sions are maintained.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Plain enameled wire is ideal for man}- applica-
tions when it is properly protected or cushioned.
In layer windings, such as ignition coils, small
transformer coils, and certain of the automobile
starting and lighting equipment field coils, this
cushion is established by placing thin paper between
the layers. In motor armature coils or others in
which paper between the layers is not practicable,
Cottonite or Silkenite is used. This is enameled
wire which has been covered with one or two layers
of cotton or silk respectively. Because of its cost,
silk is never used in place of cotton as a cushion
except in the very small fractional horsepower
motors or in similar applications where the saving
of space is most important.
A layer of cotton on a wire will increase its
diameter more than twice as much as a layer of
silk.
In the design of any type of coil using Cottonite
or Silkenite it is not necessary to depend upon the
cotton or silk for insulation. It can be looked upon
as serving merely as a cushion to protect the enamel
film which, in itself, has sufficient dielectric
strength for any ordinary application.
In the early days of electrical equipment cotton
was about the only insulation in use. Today double
cotton covered wire is still used to a large extent
in machines wound with approximately No. 12 B
&amp; S gauge, and larger. Substantial improvements
have been made in the insulating process by cutting
down the outside diameter of the wire over the
insulation without reducing its insulating quality.
RADIO AERIAL WIRE
7/22 Enameled Copper Wire.
Thus, a more compact wire has been produced. It
should be borne in mind that the cotton is merely
a separator.
Engineers are realizing, however, that a very
definite improvement can be made even with the
coarse sizes by the use of enameled wire. A layer
of cotton on the wire is ordinarily necessary for pro-
tection to the enamel. This insulation has about
three or four times the dielectric strength of that
of a double cotton covering on the same size of wire.
Aside from this increased dielectric strength, the
outside diameter of the single cotton covered enam-
eled wire is substantially less than that of double
cotton covered of the same size. Greater ease in
winding is obtained and less pounding of the coils
is necessary, with the result that rejections are
reduced. Fewer rejections mean lower costs.
In sizes larger than No. 15 B &amp; S gauge, the
original cost of the single cotton covered enameled
wire is slightly higher than that of double cotton
covered. In sizes smaller than No. 15 B &amp; S gauge,
the single cotton covered enameled wire is cheaper,
and this saving increases rapidly with the decrease
in size. The original cost of the wire, however, is
far from being the real consideration.
In some cases where unusual protection is
desired enameled wire having two, and sometimes
three layers of cotton is used.
An enamel wire wound coil is the most compact
type produced. This means that in a cross section
of the coil, the copper is more dense; consequently
the heat is more easily carried out.
The winding of small fractional horsepower mo-
tors such as those used in vacuum cleaners, drink
mixers, etc., is in a class by itself. For these,
Silkenite (single silk covered enameled wire) or
double silk covered is used in the armatures, and
Cottonite (single cotton covered enameled wire),
or Single Cotton covered is used in the motor fields.
Silk is used in the armatures in place of cotton so
as to keep them as small as possible. The size of
the armature determines the size of the motor to a
very large extent.
These motor coils are wound in large quantities
at high speed. The wire must be most uniform
and the insulation must be as compact as possible.
A very substantial saving in cost is to be made
through the use of Silkenite in the armatures in
place of double silk covered wire. The only diffi-
culty lies in removing the enamel from the wire for
the soldering of connections. This can be done by
a system of revolving wire brushes or other means.
Silkenite gives a greatly increased dielectric
strength over that of double silk covered wire.
Naturally, it also winds easier. Silkenite should
be used in these applications wherever possible.
There is a most substantial and increasing
demand for small coils wound with the finer sizes
of plain enameled wire. These coils are used
largely in meters, ignition units, bell ringing and
toy transformers, and in audio frequency radio
transformers. Coils of this general type should
always be wound with paper between the layers
to serve as a cushion.
The production of these coils is a highly special-
ized branch of the manufacture of electrical equip-
ment. Ordinarily the manufacturer cannot afford
to develop and install the necessary accurate and
automatic equipment, and so he goes to the coil
specialist.
Coils of this general type are wound on mandrels,
many being wound on each mandrel at the same

time. At least one wrap of paper is inserted be-
tween each layer, the thickness depending upon the
amount of cushion and insulation necessary, f.las-
sine paper running .0005" is the thinnest obtain-
able. In ignition windings thin varnished paper
is often used to provide greater insulation between
the layers. After completion of the winding the
"stick" of coils is sawed up, and the final operations
arc performed. This gives a type of coil which is
most compact and is self-supporting. It can then
be assembled with the core by the electrical manu-
facturer. This paper section coil has each layer
of wire insulated from the adjoining layers. For
most applications it has entirely superseded the
"haphazard" coil which was wound directly on the
bobbin without any insulation between the layers.
After the coil is wound it is necessary to impreg-
nate or seal it so as to keep out moisture, oil, and
dirt. The ideal coil, when completed, is a "brick-
bat." It should be so protected as to make it as
safe as possible from mechanical and other injuries.
The old method of treating cotton or silk cov-
ered wire coils is well known. They are merely
heated to drive out the moisture, thoroughly
soaked in insulating varnish, and given a long bake.
The treatment of coils wound with enameled
wire, however, is quite a different problem. Al-
though the enamel will not absorb moisture, it can
collect a film of moisture on its surface the same
as glass. This moisture must be driven out, pre-
ferably by both heat and vacuum. After this it is
only necessary to thoroughly seal the coil.
In the case of enamel wire coils of fairly large
cross section, such as those used in controllers and
in motor fields, the old method of drying, soaking
for a long period in thin varnish, and baking, is
usually disastrous. Contrary to the usual impres-
sion, a coil which is so treated does not become
thoroughly dry. A skin of varnish forms on the
outside and the imprisoned solvent is unable to
escape. In time this solvent softens the enamel.
This occurs because of the fact that the solvents
used in all enamels are closely related to those
used in insulating varnishes. It is not to be ex-
pected that enameled wire will indefinitely with-
stand the action of these solvents. Gasoline, or
gasoline and turpentine, are usually unavoidable
as solvents in insulating varnishes. Special care
should be exercised to avoid the use of varnishes
containing solvent naphtha. This has an especially
serious effect upon enameled wire.
Special varnishes can be supplied which will give
no difficulty when properly used.
From long experience it has been found that the
best manner of treating large enameled wire coils
is to perfectly seal the outside layers. The coil
should first be thoroughly dried, preferably in a
vacuum at not to exceed 200 degrees F. A coil
often contains a considerable amount of moisture.
From large coils, such as those in rotors in turbo-
generators, as much as a cup or more of water is
often removed by this process.
After drying, the coil should be immersed in a
heavy varnish for only sufficient time to allow the
varnish to enter a few of the outer layers, drained,
and then baked in a ventilated oven at about 200
degrees F. until dry. A heavy varnish is desirable
because, as a general thing, the thinner the varnish
the more solvent it contains.
In certain more or less open windings wound with
enameled wire, such as armature coils, it is neces-
sary to completely fill the coils with varnish. A
heavy varnish is to be preferred. The main cau-
tion to be observed is that the coils must be baked
slowly. It is best to keep them at a relatively low
temperature (180 degrees F.) for a considerable
period to allow the solvents to escape, and then to
thoroughly complete the process at not to exceed
220 degrees F.
When properly treated the solvent effect of the
varnish upon the coil is negligible. Correct pro-
cesses stand for long life.
Certain types of coils are wrapped with varnished
cambric tape. Varnished cambric is also used in
motors as slot insulation and in other applications.
It should be pointed out that, ordinarily, black var-
nished cambric is preferable to the yellow cambric.
The black cambric is slightly more flexible, has
longer life, is more highly resistant to the action of
oil and has a higher dielectric strength. It is also
slightly less expensive in original cost. The yel-
low varnished cambric is largely a "hang over"
from the days when nothing except a clear varnish
was available.
The materials which go into the construction of
the vital parts of electrical apparatus are usually
unseen and unheard but, when properly produced
and used, are doing their bit one hundred per cent
of the time.

MATERIALISM vs. ART
By CARLETON ANGELL*
/COMMERCIALISM in architecture means the
V&gt;&lt; subordination of matter of design to mere ex-
pediency of dollars and cents. This may not be a
sacrifice of art, although it frequently is such, but
more frequently it means a sacrifice of the artist's
peculiar desires. We all feel at times that we could
do a little better, could be a little more successful
in our work if we were not obliged to consider cost,
or if our client would only step aside and let us
go as we liked. It is doubtful, however, if such
freedom would conduce to the best kind of growth.
Development does not come along the paths
with which we are most familiar, and which we
are conscious of having mastered, but rather suc-
cess comes from our failures from our attacking
and attempting the problems which are new to us,
from reconciling hostile elements and bringing con-
flicting interests into harmony and appropriate-
ness.
In the solution of modern architectural problems,
science and industry have occupied a very large
and important place, but while these two forces
are active in their efforts to reconcile architec-
tural problems to modern needs, there are evidences
to the effect that science and industry are reducing
architecture to terms of mere materialism. Sci-
ence in fulfilling its mission brings satisfaction and
rest to the intellect, but disregards that subtle,
undefinable something we call the soul.
Therefore, may I project this thought: cannot
science and art be so happily blended as to render
satisfaction to the intellect and administer joy to
the soul?
The lives of the vast majority of humanity are
cast upon a background of sameness and routine.
This is necessarily so; the world's work has to be
done. Therefore the greater is the need for open-
ing up, for making readily accessible and for culti-
vating those pastures where beauty and inspiration
may be gathered by all.
Rich and poor alike, we need to give our soul an
airing once in a while. We need to exercise the
muscles of our inner selves just as we exercise the
muscles in our bodies.
Wre must have outlets for our emotions. Im-
pulses of the right kind when given due scope en-
hance the zest and happiness of our lives; when
thwarted, stunned or denied, they turn to poison
within us. Some of the ruthlessness of the day,
some of the seeking after sensations, some of the
manifestations of subversive tendencies, arise in no
small part, I believe, from an impulse of reaction
against the humdrum and lack of inspirational
opportunity of everyday life.
Much can be done by art and beauty in archi-
tecture to give satisfaction to that natural and legit-
imate impulse and to lead it into fruitful channels
instead of allowing it to run a misguided or even
destructive course.
From my observations, and these have been fre-
quent and varied, I have discovered that the aver-
age person's response to art and beauty is spon-
taneous and enthusiastic. Also I have discovered
that the majority of people are to be trusted, even
in art. It does not mean that people, by and large,
whatever their station, are born with good taste.
On the contrary, the vast majority are born with a
natural tendency to respond rather to the garish
and vivid, than to the restrained and artistic. It
does mean that the masses of common people are
susceptible to the message of true art, that they are
responsive to education and example in art.
Simplified art is appreciated and understood by
all, and that, as it should be, is the greatest form
of art.
To the materialist, art is something which stands
for truth as he knows it, whether it is pleasant or
unpleasant. He will not be interested in the feel-
ing of a thing that is optimistic. He will condemn
such a work because it is perhaps false in logic or
too sweet in sentiment—sometimes both.
But this is just as narrow and intolerant as the
person who insists that good art is all sentiment
and optimism. Art to some people is a matter of
rules and can be defined, at least to their under-
standing and thus they make of it a preachment
which it is not.
Tt should not be necessary that a thing of beauty
need to be explained to be understood and enjoyed.
If it does need added interpretation, by someone
other than its creator, then it is doubtful if it has
fulfilled its purpose.
Rules to the creative artist are sometimes a help
in playing safe, by avoiding all things which are
generally thought to be wrong and can turn out
something which many people will call good, but it
will not be very original nor will it have any great
effect on the emotions.
Art to the average person is not a study; to them
it is love of beauty which gives joy and entertain-
ment. It is a matter of feeling.

advantage. Again, since much time would naturally.
be spent drifting around taking observations, etc.,
any craft which does not take power and gas to
hover has the advantage. Wherever in commercial
operation these conditions prevail the dirigible will
find use.
On the other hand it is inconceivable that the
average man will have money, space and skill
enough to buy, house and operate a dirigible for
his personal use; certainly the air "flivvers" will be
airplanes. We can even conceive conditions which
absolutely demand the helicopter, although they
will be rarer than those which demand the other
two forms.
General Possibilities
But the technician in a new field who fails to see
farther than the possibilities which it provides for
his own little specialty is not only lacking in culture
but in the ability to realize all of its possibilities for
himself. So we might profitably consider the more
general significance of aeronautics, its economic and
political import.
Economic Phases
The first and most obvious result of aeronautics
as at present conceived is the extension of the
useful world map—the opening up to human activ-
ity of heretofore practically untouched tropical and
arctic regions. Such development may not neces-
sarily mean habitation although this may follow,
for when quick ingress and egress is possible and
change to temperate climates for short periods avail-
able, then individuals accustomed to temperate
/ones may be able to live in the extreme climates.
Then, of course, some of the dangers which are now
present such as malaria in the tropics, will be elim-
inated by aerial methods. Even now in South
America, mosquito infested areas are being cleaned
up by application of preparations sprayed from air-
planes.
But most important, these regions will be open
for exploitation of natural wealth, mineral and for-
est. As is well known, the coal supply of our now
accessible mines though they may not be exhausted
in the near future, will be reduced to the point
where the price of coal will reach prohibitive values.
In the Arctic and in the tropics are supplies which
will alleviate this condition until the problem of
tapping the permanent supplies of the sun or the
atom has been solved. Again the temporary solu-
tion of the problem of failing wood supply can prob-
ably be found in the tropics. Xot that the method
of transporting the supply itself should be done by
;iir; it is doubtful if naval methods will ever be
supplanted here but the transportation of personnel,
food and other things that require speed for safety
and economv will be done bv air. As Steffanson
so well expressed it in a lecture delivered some time
ago, Magellan made the earth a "cylinder"; WYight
made it a "sphere." But the most important eco-
nomic result will be the "incremental freedom of
action" of all human relations in the earth zones
already inhabited. The airplane and dirigible will
supplement the existing types of transportation and
satisfy a need not already met by them in certain
problems of food supply and personal communica-
tion which demand a much speedier transporta-
tion than now available.
\Ve must remember, however, that not all prob-
lems require such speedy transportation. It is con-
ceivable, as Dr. Lindblad suggests, that as it may
even be inconvenient to get too quickly from one
place to another. Suppose we have two towns sep-
arated by a distance of 500 miles and that certain
business men desire to make frequent one-day trips
between them. To go by railroad in twelve hours
is a convenient night's ride on a I'ullman; to go by
air in five hours is either to break up the day or
double the problem of night accommodations. In
other words, the means of transportation used de-
pends on the local conditions.
We must not forget the value of an air "flivver"'
in individual transportation. Although of less im-
portance than the above mentioned phases, it is
none the less interesting. There is, at least for the
normal person, a distinct thrill in piloting or riding
in an aircraft, as many times greater than that ex-
perienced in an automobile as there are increased
degrees of freedom. The airplane will certainly take
a place in our civilization similar to that held by
the automobile.
Political Phases
Among the probable results of a much speedier
and nearly universal method of transportation is the
alteration of political issues it will bring. If aerial
transportation comes to anywhere near the scope
which we have assumed, then the whole world will
be so shrunken in relative size that the most inti-
mate national and racial contact will be established.
Xot only will small groups be able to circulate
representatives freely in all points of the world,
but also great numbers of private individuals, more
than ever before, will be enabled to obtain a
world experience.
In this situation one group or community will no
more be able to live apart, even if economically self-
supporting, which few groups are, than the mole-
cules of a pool of water, what effects any one group
will affect all. The thought of an intelligent indi-
vidual who faces the future can no more stop short
of world "state" than a ripple started by a stone
dropped in the pool of water can stop short of the
shore. To insure world peace it is certainly vital
and necessary that there be some sort of world
state organization to execute the world state of


Page 23
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
mind, but the former can never function properly
in the absence of the latter. To have conceptual
universality there must be universality of the -im-
pressions upon which the conceptions are based.
Aviation will be one of the most important means
of unhindered "universalizing" because it means
complete communication. Radio, while vastly im-
portant, is subject to prejudiced control due to the
sending limitations.
This brings us to reiterate the regret common
to all intelligent workers in aeronautics, that this
new science should be turned, even temporarily.
from some of these primary problems. Nothing
could be more indicative of the infancy of collective
humanity than that the realization of man's age
long dream to fly should be applied immediately as
an instrument of destruction. This is inevitable
because the problem of living peaceably is a
broader one than that of Hying and the latter takes
its color from the character of the former.
It is a sad thing to realize that the necessity for
military aeronautics which arose in 1914 may re-
occur. The modern nation can be said to be in a
position similar to that of a city built upon the
banks of a river in a territory frequented by cloud-
bursts. Such a city, subject to damage by floods
can resort to either of two solutions to the problem.
The first would be to build a set of upstream dams
to prevent inundation but the second and more per-
manent solution would be to fend off and direct the
atmospheric moisture before it precipitates. Like-
wise the modern nation, threatened by war, can
either prepare to defend itself or make ironclad
agreements with other nations to remain out of war.
This later expedient has not thus far been realized
any more than the permanent solution to the flood
endangered city, so we can be pardoned for becom-
ing engaged in preparation for national defense,
provided a reasonably proportional part of our time
is spent in creative work.
If then, for the present and only in the absence
of mutual agreement, disagreement must be pro-
vided for, the question becomes one of selecting the
technical means which will absorb the least energy
per unit effective defense. Notwithstanding, this
means must be easily convertible to the arts of
peace and also be practical! v as well as theoretically
a defense measure. I think the military aero-
nautics most nearly fulfills these first two require-
ments of any means we have. Whether or not it
fulfills the last is a matter too broad for discussion
here.
The Larger Engineering
These then are the ultimate objects of this new
field for which its personnel, either consciously or
unconsciously, are striving. Wood and steel, fabric
and wire are necessarv but incidental media. What
do these objects imply for the engineer entering
aeronautics?
\Ve read recently a rather interesting statement
by a gentleman prominent in the field of aesthetics
that "The natural sciences are well in their places,
but discoveries such as aviation (aviation is not, by
the way, a discovery) are infinitely less important
to the race than the smallest addition to the phil-
osophy of the spirit." In other words, the ratio of
importance is an infinitesimal of the second order.
Certainly this exaggeration is of value in drawing
the attention of the technical man to the fact that
there is a broader field than his own particular spe-
cialty and that, unless he obtains an enlarged vision,
he will lose out in the most important leadership of
his generation.
For one thing, although the natural scientist
now holds the popular interest and attention on
account of recent spectacular achievements, he will
be hard pressed by the psychologist, sociologist and
educator. Indeed, the element of truth in the above
quoted statement and the thought which has been
so much stressed by modern thinkers is that, for
the moment, we could exist without any further
material improvements but are in great need of
development of the human sciences and the arts.
The least the engineer can do is be prepared to
appreciate and help utilize the developments of the
rival field.
But still more important is the fact that the
engineer should prepare to aid in the application
of all these theoretical fields in government and
education; to contribute not only the particular
technical elements which he has evolved but also
the attitude of mind which he has developed in the
process. This means the participation in public
affairs by engineers which our own Dean has so
frequently advocated and to which he is now giv-
ing his best efforts. Not all of us will have the
capacity for such direct usefulness but the least we
can do is to support the efforts of those who have.
Since these problems in .public life are the most
general problems which face men, and since the
intimacy of contact of races and nations of which
we have spoken is going to make these problems of
world scope, action will certainly be along the
lines suggested by the world's broadest thinkers.
Today the names of Newton, Einstein, Watts, Mar-
coni, Wright, Pasteur, Freude, and others who have
produced great advances in our knowledge of man
and his world, are on men's tongues; tomorrow, if
the intellectual generalization keeps up its present
pace, they will be Jesus, Budda, Bacon, Wells, Rob-
inson and Korzybski, and others who have man-
aged to see the forest in spite of the trees. It is un-
thinkable that the aeronautical engineer, who will
be responsible for one of the important aids to this


November, 1924
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
intellectual progress, should fail to understand and
participate in its application.
In the meantime the local problem is as fasci-
nating as it is important. Its opportunities to do
difficult engineering feats, to organize a new and
romantic branch of travel, to prepare to secure
the monetary rewards of a future production are
increasing ever)' day. Pioneering, it is true, at
times involves big risk of reputation, money and
even life, yet its rewards of accomplishment are
usually a sufficient compensation.

persons skilled in the details of the smoke problem;
that no ordinances of this class can be made opera-
tive in a short interval of time as one of the prin-
cipal parts of the whole problem is the education
of the public as to exactly what is to be accom-
plished and the best procedure to this accomplish-
ment. The successful operation of the whole
scheme depends upon eternal vigilance and effort
tipon the part of competent smoke-inspectors and
a disposition on the part of the inhabitants to aid
in the success of the work. Legal entanglements
and the engendering of ill-feeling are things to be
avoided wherever possible.
It will be interesting to digress slightly and show
what problems in dust-abatement have to be met in
some of the very large central-stations of today.
It may be safely said that the emission of black
carbon particles from the stacks can be reduced
to an entirely negligible and inoffensive amount
due to superior design and construction of fur-
naces and extremely high grade operation. How-
ever along with this class of operation go very high
combustion rates and the consumption of many
thousands of tons of coal per 24 hours. Along with
these high combustion rates goes a high rate of ash
production, and this coupled with the high gas
velocities in furnaces results in much fine ash being
carried through the stacks and deposited on the sur-
rounding buildings and territory. This in many
cases has become such a nuisance that it is neces-
sary to remove this ash from the stack-gases before
allowing them to emerge from the stack. There
are two methods in commercial use on a large scale
for dust and ash removal. One is by means of a
specially designed fan handling the stack-gases
wherein the ash particles are thrown outward by
centrifugal force to the tips of the fan blades, pass-
ing from them to a collecting ring which discharges
into an ash-collecting hopper from which they are
removed for disposal. This type of fan is known
as the "Cindervane," and is manufactured by the
B. F. Sturtevant Co. The other method is by the
use of the "Cottrell Electrical Precipitator"; manu-
factured by The Research Corporation. The prin-
ciple of operation of this apparatus is as follows:
Flue-gas containing dust and ash particles is
passed in close proximity to discharge electrodes
which are energized from electrical equipment cap-
able of producing a pulsating, unidirectional cur-
rent, which is used with apparatus of this class. As
the flue-gas having the dust and ash particles in
suspension passes between the discharge electrodes,
the particles become ionized by the discharge from
the electrodes and are precipitated against the sides
of the collecting plates from which they arc
removed by rapping or shaking. This apparatus
has many other similar fields of application.
POWER STATION BUILDINGS
(Continued from page 11)
know the loads coming upon them before you know
their sizes, it would seem that we had suddenly
come to a stopping place at the very beginning.
And it is just here that it is necessary to lay aside
hair-splitting engineering exactness and use a little
good judgment backed up with the experience you
have at your command. Furthercome, in the design
of a modern power station, it is generally impos-
sible to get anything like exact weights of the ma-
chinery which is to be installed at the time
the building is being designed. So the engineer
in charge, in order to keep things moving and keep
a dozen or so men busy pushing the drawings,
should be able to decide a large number of these
questions off-hand from his past experience on sim-
ilar structures, or his good judgment of about what
will be required. A fairly close estimate can be
made of thicknesses of walls and sizes of piers and
outside dimensions of columns just from a study
of the skeleton of the building; and a fairly close
approximation can be made at what the weights of
machinery will be, from the weights of similar
machinery used elsewhere. The engineer in charge
can therefore soon get someone busy figuring the
loads from the roof downward that will be trans-
ferred to the walls and columns and piers. A care-
ful schedule should be made of these loads, showing
at what elevation they come on and what each load
is from. These should be put on an outline plan of
the building and on a cross section, so that they can
be readily checked over and so that if, after more
data is received, there are changes required, it will
be easily seen how the original assumptions will be
affected. This loading schedule will be referred to
until the building is completed and should be care-
fully made and checked.
With the loading schedule completed, the design
of the foundations can be undertaken. Founda-
tion walls and footings for buildings and machinery
are at present made almost universally of concrete.
It often happens that the basement floor will be
several feet below the water level at times of high


Page 25

water. In such cases the walls and basement floors
must he carefully built and joined, so that they will
not leak under the water pressure occasioned by
llood water conditions.
Smoke Stacks
In the modern large stations the smoke stack
is frequently carried on a steel structure over the
boilers. This has a number of advantages. It per-
mits a saving in land and in the size of the build-
ing, and permits of one uninterrupted row of boilers.
Of course, the argument against this arrangement
is its extra cost. There is shown in one of the illus-
trations the stack of the new Conner's Creek Power
Station of the Detroit Edison Company. This stack
is three hundred and twenty-five feet above the
boiler room floor. The shaft of the stack is about
two hundred and forty feet high, and is eighteen
feet in diameter. The shell is of steel plates and
is lined to the top with brick. The weight of the
stack and lining is about 1,300,000 pounds. The
lining is carried on the steel shell on shelf angles
spaced about fifteen feet apart. This stack struc-
ture was connected rigidly to the building structure,
and the stack shaft is carried on heavy lattice gir-
ders at the roof line of the building. The stack
structure itself is about 110 feet above the concrete
footings on which it rests.
In figuring a stack for stability, it is first consid-
ered unlined, with a wind pressure against the pro-
jected diameter of 50 pounds per square foot, re-
duced to 25 pounds on the smooth circular steel
.shell. This gives the maximum tension on the
windward side of the structure. It is, of course,
also figured again with the lining in, and the max-
imum stresses under either of these conditions are
used in each member. A 250 foot stack without the
lining will weave six or eight inches at the top
under a heavy wind and will weave three or four
inches at the top after it is lined.
Stacks and chimneys which rest directly on the
earth do not involve any special features that need
lie dwelt upon. Of course, it is necessary to remem-
ber that under the maximum wind conditions the
earth pressure at the toe of the foundation on the
leeward side of the chimney may become as much
as twice the average earth pressure over the entire
base with no wind blowing. This must be taken
into account when deciding to what pressure the
underlying earth will be subjected.
Coal Handling Equipment
Adequate provisions for unloading and distribut-
ing the coal is a very important matter for a large
power station. In fact, the choosing of a site for a
power station and the whole layout of the plant will
be governed to a large extent by the way the coal is
to be handled.
An adequate railway track layout should be
planned so that the amount of coal that will be used
in the ultimate station can be readily handled. Good
switching facilities should be planned, with ample
room for storing a reserve supply of coal and ade-
quate trackage for storing a large number of cars
to be held a few days at a time. With a station
using 3,000 to 4,000 tons of coal per day, it will be
realized that this is a very important problem. For
even when the station is using directly from the
cars, it will be seen that in order to hold three or
four days' supply on hand, it will require the stor-
age of 300 or 400 cars and the returning of 100
empty cars and 8 or 10 cars of ashes each day.
When the switch yard has been decided upon,
then the method of unloading and distributing the
coal to the boiler and of collecting the ashes and
loading them back into the cars all must be worked
in as a part of the building design. The coal must
be unloaded and put through a crusher and then
taken by conveyors to the bunkers over the boiler.
There is a great variety of ways in which this can
be accomplished, and the particular method best
adapted to any given station will depend largely on
the conditions that exist there. A large amount of
coal is still shipped in ordinary gondola cars with-
out hopper bottoms, so that it is necessary in any-
large plant to provide means for unloading these
cars. This is generally best done by means of a
grab bucket operated from some form of crane.
With the hopper bottom cars, it is necessary to
have a pit in which to unload beneath the track.
There must then be designed a conveyor system
for delivering coal to the bunkers. As will be plain,
it is necessary to have the coal handling scheme
pretty definitely worked out before the building de-
sign can be completed, as a large part of the loads
on the walls and steel frame come from the coal
and the coal handling machinery.
The coal bunkers in the Conner's Creek plant
of the Detroit Edison Company carry about 500
tons of coal each. These bunkers are made of steel
plates and are lined with a thin tile laid in bitu-
mastic cement. A number of eastern power stations
have concrete bunkers with steel beam ribs. The
main objection to concrete bunkers are their great
weight, which makes the steel supporting structure
very expensive. Also the concrete becomes pitted
and rough, so that the coal does not slide well, and
it is difficult to keep them from leaking where wet
coal is used.
Intake Crib and Tunnel
One of the most difficult pieces of construction
in connection with a power station is the building of
the water intake and tunnel to convey the water
for condensing purposes from the river or other
body of water, to the interior of the turbine room.
It is probably not generally realized what a large
amount of water is required for condensing pur-
poses for a modern station. For instance, a sta-

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
tion of 100,000 K. W. capacity will require about
200,000,000 gallons of water per day. To design
adequate facilities for the admission and discharge
of this amount of water is a very important mat-
ter. Especially since the loss of condensing water
for any reason is a very serious matter in the opera-
tion of a large station. Here is an opportunity for
the exercise of a great deal of ingenuity to design
an intake and tunnel that will be absolutely reliable
and yet make a design that will not be inordinately
expensive to install.
Since the intake is generally out in the stream,
a tight cofferdam must be built, inside which the
intake can be constructed and from which the tun-
nel can be started. This construction is generally
a fight with water from beginning to end, especially
in sand and gravel soil. In my experience the open
cut method of building a tunnel for the intake and
discharged water has proved the most satisfactory,
even when the excavation is 50 feet or more deep,
except, of course, where solid rock is encountered.
In clay soil, the open cut method is not generally
a difficult one, if sufficient care is taken in timber-
ing. The pressure from clay banks is sometimes
very deceptive and the pressure exerted by these
banks, if they once start to move, is sometimes
enormous. But if the timbering is carefully done,
a very deep excavation can generally be made with-
out any difficulty. In gravel and sand, the open
cut method is, in many cases, about the only one
that can be used, as it is in many cases next to
impossible to drive a tunnel through this sort of
material. Compressed air is likely to be of very
little use in coarse sand and gravel, for the air will
go right through the gravel to the surface and will
not hold the water back.
In some cases where the tunnel is in sand and
gravel it is often necessary to use steel piling for
the full depth of the cut. By doing the excavating
with a clam shell bucket, without attempting to
keep the water out, except enough to permit the
placing of the timbering, the cut can be made even
with ten or twelve feet of water in the bottom of
the excavation. It is generally possible to put the
bottom layer of concrete in under water and then
to. get the water pumped out, so that the remaining
concrete can be put in without great difficulty.
While it is not necessary that the tunnel be abso-
lutely watertight, it should be substantially so, for
if there is much of a leak of water, either out of
or into the tunnel, there is. danger of drawing the
sand away-from under the tunnel and having a set-
tlement that will break the tunnel.
Architectural Features
The design of a power station-is an engineering
problem, and the architectural features are what
the becoming clothes arc to the human being. The
clothes can be made to help adorn and improve
the appearance of the wearer, but they should not
hamper the wearer or conflict with his usefulness.
In the same way, the purely architectural features
of a power station should be given careful study
and the whole design of the station should be made
with the architectural scheme in view, but the use-
fulness or economy of the station should not be
hampered to any appreciable extent for the pur-
pose of carrying through some preconceived archi-
tectural scheme. In fact, this is not necessary, for
a very good appearing building can be worked out
in harmony with almost any well-planned machin-
ery layout, especially if the two are planned out
together.
Although I have only tripped lightly over the
subject, touching only a few of the high spots, I
hope I have shown enough to help you understand
something of what the problem of constructing a
power station really is and have proven that an
engineer may design and carry through a large
building enterprise in a successful manner even
before he has been granted a license empowering
him with ability to do so by the benign legislature.

The Change In Editorship
We wish to call attention to the fact that Rein-

Free-hand Drafting by A. E. Zipprich, Review
by Col. H. W. Miller
This is an admirably executed text on the sub-
ject of free-hand drawing, presenting the essential
principles almost entirely through the medium of
free-hand drawings themselves rather than
through text descriptions. Every phase of free-
hand drawing has been so thoroughly and compre-
hensively treated that the text should be of mate-
rial assistance to grade school and college pupils
alike. The illustrations used in explaining methods
of obtaining orthographic projections of an object
are particularly clear and to the point. The author
has rendered a real service to the teachers and stu-
dents of free-hand drawing through this admirable
presentation.

THE COLLEGE CHRONICLE
Items of Interest to Michigan Engineers
Changes in the Teaching Staff
We are pleased to welcome the return of I'rof.
J. C. Brier who is resuming his work in the Chem-
ical Engineering Department. Prof. Brier grad-
uated from the University in 1912, where, as holder
of the Acme White Lead Fellowship he obtained
his M. S. degree in 1913.
I'rof. Brier has held some exacting positions in
the Chemical Engineering profession, lie was first
connected with the Detroit Organic Chemical
Works and then went to the Holland Aniline Works
at Holland, Michigan, where his position as Gen-
eral Superintendent placed him in charge of the
inter-department work.
During the war, Prof. Brier returned to the Uni-
versity to fill a vacancy on the Staff, and in 1920
returned to the Holland Aniline Works where he
remained until 1923. From there he went to the
(Hidden Paint and Varnish Company.
His work there was upon paints and varnishes
for the automobile industry, a subject which has
had a rapid development in recent times. An in-
troduction of Prof. Brier to the freshman class
would be superfluous since he has been chosen as
their head mentor.
It is of the greatest interest to note that Eliel
Saarenin, the celebrated Finnish architect, has re-
turned to continue his instruction in graduate
design. His work here last year attracted very
much interest and he is enthusiastically welcomed
back to- the university.
Prof. N. H. Williams returned to the Physics
Department this fall after a year's leave of absence.
He has been working in the General Electric labo-
ratories in connection with the development of
amplifying tubes for radio communication. o •
Captain L. M. Bricker of the R. O. T. C. staff,
is a graduate of Ohio State University, class of 1917,
having received his B. S. degree in Metallurgy at
that institution. He is also a graduate of the
Ordnance School of Technology. During the
world war he saw service abroad in China and the
Philippines, being dt-tailed with the Coast Artil-
lery. Captain Bricker comes here from the Aber-
deen Proving Grounds and is teaching ordnance,
lie is a member of the Scabbard and Blade.
o •
Mr. George B. Watkins has been engaged as-a
half-time instructor in the Chemical Engineering
Department while pursuing studies in the grad-
uate school for a doctor's degree. Mr. Watkins
graduated from the University of Michigan in 1921.
He has since been acting as an instructor in the
Kansas Agricultural College where he received his
M. S. degree in 1924.
Lieutenant R. T. Schlosberg, who recently took
charge of the R. O. T. C. Signal Corps unit is a
graduate of Bowdoin College, class of 1918; a
graduate of the Infantry School, Fort Benning.
Georgia; and a graduate of the Army Signal School,
Camp Alfred Vail, New Jersey. Lieutenant Schlos-
berg saw service overseas with the Fourth Division,
Tenth Machine Gunners Battalion.
Mr. \Y. L. Everitt is a new instructor in the
Electrical Engineering Department. He graduated
from Cornell in 1920 after which he taught two
years at that school. He was then connected with
the Xorthern Electric Company, manufacturers of
telephones, for two years. Mr. Everitt is a member
of Tau Beta Pi and Phi Kappa Phi fraternities.
—o—
N. L. Holland is now instructing in Electrical
Engineering. He graduated from the university
in 1923, after which he took a year of graduate
work. He is a member of the Sigma Xi fraternitv.
The latest addition to the personnel of the Archi-
tectural faculty is Knud Lomberg-Holm. Mr. Lom-
berg-Holm was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, on
January 15, 1895, and received his B. A. degree in
the University of that city. He then studied archi-
tecture at the Academy for several vears after

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
which he served in the army for about two years.
After the war he practiced architecture, first in
Denmark for two years and later in Gcrnrany for
a year. While in Denmark, Mr. Lomberg-Holm
was connected with the building project of a large
shipyard.
He says that continental architects are very
greatly interested in the work of Frank Lloyd
Wright and Louis Sullivan, in fact, more so than
in any other American architects. He claims that
this is due to the modern tendencies of the two
men, which the continental architects recognize as
a step in their own direction.
His work here will be assisting in design and
drawing.
In Mr. Harold R. Lloyd, the Mechanical Engi-
neering Department has secured the services of a
man of wide experience and practice. He arrived
here from England at the beginning of the semes-
ter to take up duties as an instructor of machine
movements, which position was left vacant by Mr.
Begeman. Mr. Lloyd was graduated with honors
from Gonville and Caius College at Cambridge,
England, in 1903. In 1905 he took up a
position with Hans Reynold Ltd., where he was
engaged in internal organization, supervision of
testing materials and assisting in general manage-
ment. This position he held until he came to the
University of Michigan where he instructed in the
Mechanical Department from 1912 to 1915. At this
time the war situation in England called him back
to Hans Reynold Ltd., at Manchester, where he
was a factor in the manufacture of munitions. Here
he came into contact with the war manufacturing
program, selection of employes, wage scales and
agreements, trade unions, industrial legislation, and
educational work. A man of such broad insight
should be of some inspirational value to the stu-
dents with whom he comes in contact.
Mr. Begeman, who instructed in the Mechanical
Department for the last several years, has been
granted leave of absence for a year. He spent the
summer working for Mr. Essylstyne, an engineer
in Detroit, where he designed machines to be used
by the Mississippi Wire Glass Company. His
work met with such success that he was asked to
follow through with the installation and erection
of the machines he designed.
Student Branch of the A. S. C. E.
Activities of the student branch of the A. S. C. E.
for the college year began with a meeting held at
the Michigan Union on October ninth. Plans for
the future were discussed and the following offi-
cers were elected:
F. A. Kimmich, President
L. A. Cannon, Vice President
R. Van Vliet, Secretary.
H. S. Young, Treasurer.
The membership of this organization is restricted
to Junior and Senior civil engineers whose scho-
lastic eligibility is determined by a minimum grade
average. This year they will meet on the second
Wednesday of each month. The meetings consist
of a dinner with a talk by an alumnus, a member
of the faculty or some prominent civil engineer.
In addition there is a student address on some topic
of popular interest on the profession. This group
meets once a year with the Detroit section of the
American Society of Civil Engineers.
Engineering Society
The success of the Engineering Society smoker
held at the LTnion on September 25 was highly
indicative of a booming year for that body.
A feeling of cameraderie prevailed during the
evening, this being expressed when the group led by
several Camp Davis minstrels rehearsed the songs
that have made the engineering college famous.
Willard Spanagel and rendered
several songs and an orchestra contributed to the
entertainment.
The assembly, one of the largest ever held by
the society, was addressed by Dean Cooley and Rear
Admiral Wm. A. Moffett. In his talk the Dean
stressed the fact that public service is the highest
calling to which man could aspire and he also
pointed out the need in the federal governing body,
of engineers to decide upon questions involving his
profession just as the lawyer is the one to make
the decision upon legal matters. Dean Cooley in-
voked the admiration of all present when he stated
that to set a precedent of public service for the
engineer would be a gratifying result of his efforts
in this year's campaign.
Admiral Moffett, Chief of the Bureau of Aero-
nautics of the U. S. Navy, explained how the fight-
ing plane had become an inseparable auxiliary to
the battleships of the Navy. The scouting plane
housed on board ship, by increasing the observa-
tion range would make possible maneuvering for
attack or defense long before the adversary ship
came into view, he said. The Admiral also pointed
out that the limited cruising range of the plane
was its big disadvantage and that the limited range
of observation of a ship was its big setback. The
combination of the two, eliminates both these disad-
vantages and makes an unbeatable team for both
aggressive and defensive work. Admiral Moffett
who has had much to do with the recent test flights
of the Shenandoah, recounted some of his experi-
ences while on trips in the big ship and expressed

great faith in the future of this type of air travel,
saving that in luxury and pleasure it far surpassed
the conventional mode of traveling by rail. One
of the greatest opportunities for the engineer in the
development of aviation lies in the design of a more
dependable motor for the plane.
The schedule of events for the Engineering
Society for this semester includes the following:
Wednesday, October 29, a movie showing the oper-
ation of compressed air plants throughout the
United States. Wednesday, November 26, there
will be an Engineer's Dance at Granger's. It is
hoped that this event will be an "all engineers
event." There is every reason why every engineer
should share and help to promote the spirit that
has long been a characteristic of the engineering
college. Let us take active part in the activities
of this, our organization and when the time arrives
for the dance there will be no need for ticket dis-
tribution to other than members of our own col-
lege.
The Student Branch of the A. I. C. E.
The first meeting of the student branch of the
American Institute of Chemical Engineering was
held September 30, in the society club rooms in
the East Engineering Laboratories building. Mr.
Parmalee, Editor of the Chemical and Metallurgical
Magazine, was the speaker of the evening. He dis-
cussed the place of the graduate engineer in the
industry and presented the opportunities that await
the men in new fields of industrial production.
The attendance at the meeting was symbolic of
the growth of this body whose members total near-
ly a hundred. Plans were discussed to furnish the
rooms of the society with suitable furniture. Meet-
ings of the society will be held once each month
at which prominent men in the field of Chemical
Engineering will speak. The officers for the col-
lege year are: Mark Huck, president; Hall Coates,
vice president; and Herbert Poland, secretary and
treasurer.
exhibitions, and refreshments rounded out the en-
tertainment of the evening.
Through the courtesy of the Western Electric
Company a number of engineering student groups
under the auspices of the University Branch of the
A. I. E. E. have inspected the new equipment of
the Ann Arbor Exchange of the Michigan Bell
Telephone Company.
Information concerning the activities and require-
ments for membership in the local branch of the
A. I. E. E. may be obtained from any of the officers:
Fred J. Goellner, Chairman; James B. Johnson,
Vice-Chairman; Morris H. Lloyd, Secretary; Henry
F. Donner, Treasurer.
The Student Branch of the A. I. E. E.
A smoker held in the Michigan Union, October
1, and attended by over seventy-five engineers,
opened this year's activities of the University
Branch of the American Institute of Electrical
Engineers. Professor B. F. Bailey, head of the
Electrical Department of the College of Engineer-
ing, outlined the development of electrical engineer-
ing in the past fifty years and spoke of the respon-
sibilities of the engineer today.. 'Dean Patterson
of the Engineering College stressed the point that
engineers' education should not be restricted to the
technicalities of their profession. Singing, fencing
The Aeronautical Society
At a meeting of the Aeronautical Society held
May 27th of last semester, H. F. Swick, 25E, was
elected president 'of the organization for 24-25.
Unfortunately, Mr. Swick was unable to return to
school this fall, and Ralph Graichen, 25E, the vice-
president, has now been entrusted with the task
of heading the club.
The work that we were able to do last year as
an open organization in the manner of promoting
interest in the aeronautical field only suggested to
our members the possibilities of a more closely
organized society, and the idea was so well rep-
resented to the members by the officers of last year
that a resolution was passed providing for the com-
plete revision of the constitution in order to carry
out this idea. At present, Mr. Graichen, aided by
F. A. Reed, Jr., 26E, Secretary, and F. J. Hooven,
26E, Treasurer, is now busy drafting a new consti-
tution to be placed before the members of the
club at a meeting to be held in the near future.
In this constitution, there are clauses providing for
a complete change of status and calling for a new
name to better convey the idea of the new society.
As soon as this has been accepted, it will be pos-
sible to submit to the campus a more definite idea
of the new organization.
The Architectural Society
At the last election the following officers were
elected to head the society:
Douglas D. Loree, President
Raymond Weber, Vice President
Reinhold Oester, Secretary
Gilbert T. Ritchie, Treasurer
John H. Barry, Custodian
Representatives of the various classes have also
been elected to the society and they with the offi-
cers, form the governing body. Among the events
which appear on the program for the coming year
are two smokers, several social functions and the
Annual Architects May Party.


November, 1924
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Members of the society recently went to Detroit
on an inspection trip to the new Book-Cadillac
Hotel. The trip was headed by Prof. Lorch and
the members of the entire party were the guests
of the Chamber of Commerce.
The Smoker
The annual fall smoker of the Architectural
.Society was held in the Union on October twenty-
third. A well balanced program was presented and
the entertainment was a complete success. •
Eliel Saarenin, noted Finnish architect and visit-
ing professor on the architectural staff, spoke on the
subject, "The Architect." He emphasized the ver-
satility of a good architect, declaring that he must
be an engineer and a scientist as well as have an
appreciation of art, poetry and philosophy.
The entertainment consisted of a clever vaude-
ville skit by Gene Green, who was on the current
bill at the Majestic, a fencing match by Kellar and
Grauff and music by an all architect orchestra under
the direction of Livingstone Elder. Doughnuts
and cider constituting the refreshments, served to
complete the satisfied feeling that marks the suc-
cess of the event and the committee that made it
possible.
The Quarterdeck
The Quarterdeck is essentially an organization
of Junior and Senior Marine students who are
interested in the current progress of Marine and
Naval Architecture. At the regular meetings mem-
bers of this group present papers which they have
written dealing with some one of the many phases
of shipbuilding. The Log of the Quarterdeck will
record the programs of such meetings throughout
the year as S(x&gt;n as the cargoes of facts can be
assembled and loaded, and the ship of statements
gains more headway.
The officers for the year are:
John Miner, Commodore
Edwin F. Ritchie, Vice-Commodore
R. Edwyrie Fisher, Purser
Walter H. Kent, Steward.
Subjects that will be up for discussion at meet-
ings in the near future will include foreign travel
and foreign trade. Attention is here called to the
fact that the demand for graduates from the depart-
ment of Marine and Naval Architecture was con-
siderably in excess of the supply last year.
Neic Courses
A new five-year course leading to the degree of
B. S. in Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, is
being offered for the first time this semester. The
course will in no way interfere with the present
four-year course in Mechanical Engineering. It
is designed to give the students interested in Indus-
trial Engineering the proper basic training in this
field.
The course arises out of a long felt need of the
Industries, for men to fill positions requiring engi-
neering judgment and analytical viewpoint along
with economical and managerial insight. In such a
position neither the ordinary accountant nor the
average engineer seems to command the necessary
scope.
In arranging this course, Dean Day of the School
of Business Administration, Prof. Anderson head
of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Dean
Bursley, Prof. Gordy and the leaders of several
industries called into conference, all realized at the
start that the work of the student could not be prop-
erly done in four years, if the men turned out were
to be more than a smattering of either and little
of neither. Similar courses under various names
have recently been adopted by several of the eastern
colleges.
The scope of the new course takes in the essential
elements of the present M. E. course and a thorough
grounding in economics and other phases of man-
agement. The designers of the new course have
great faith that pursuit of this group of studies will
develop a judgment that could result from no other
combination of professional subjects. One hundred
and seventy-six hours will be required for gradua-
tion, of which thirty-three hours are taken in the
school of business administration.
Already favorable comments are being received
from the industry and educators, saying it is the
type of course that they have long anticipated.
There are at present six men enrolled in the new
course.
Flight Tenting
An important course covering the theory and
practice of both commercial and research flight
testing, is being given here for the first time by
Dr. Gerhardt who is taking the place formerly held
by Prof. Pawlowski, in the Aeronautics department.
The theme of the course takes in the subject mat-
ter of the flight testing manual which Dr. Gerhardt
is formulating on the basis of investigations here
and at McCook field.
The completion of the air tunnel would permit
some valuable experimentation in this connection.
However, Dr. Gerhardt says that it often requires
a year's work to determine the characteristics of
such a tunnel before it is of real value in testing
and research. This work will probably be carried
out during the coming year by Dr. Gerhardt and
Mr. Stalker who is also a teacher in the depart-
ment.

Camp Davis
Camp Davis, the civil engineers' summer camp, is
changing every year. Each camp under the direc-
tion of Prof. C. T. Johnston does its share in im-
proving the site. The club house which was built
by the two camps of 1923 was in full use last sum-
mer. A piano was rented and a large radio set
was installed. This increased the popularity of the
club and made it possible to give some good parties.
For some unknown reason the University of Mich-
igan Biological Station, which has its camp located
about a half of a mile along the shore of Douglas
Lake from Camp Davis, was on friendly terms with
the engineers. In fact, the two camps gave sev-
eral parties together.
There were quite a few important things accom-
plished by the engineers last summer. They built
a new workshop with new work benches and a
power saw. The new well which was started in
the summer of 1923 was completed and the total
power equipment of the camp was centered in the
pump house. In connection with the well, the water
system was simplified so that only one tank is now
needed at the top of the hill. The entire sidewalk
system of the camp is now complete including a
sidewalk back to the club house.
A new and substantial keeper's house was built.
This is a two-story affair with a hot air furnace in
the basement and three rooms on the first floor. In
constructing the house the steel sheathing was put
on both sides of the studding and the space between
the two sheets filled with sawdust. This ought
to securely insulate the interior from the cold dur-
ing the winter.
The underbrush about the camp was trimmed
and twenty-five sweet cherry trees were planted.
These trees were the gift of Librarian W. W. Bishop
of the University library. These improvements
in the beauty, convenience and recreational
resources of the camp will be for the use of future
civils but those men will never be able to appre-
ciate the wealth of effort that has been spent to
make it so.

Columbia Chan gen Courses
Those interested in the improvement of engineer-
ing education will regret to hear that the faculty of
Columbia University has abolished the six-year
courses in civil, mechanical, mining and chemical
engineering, which were instituted several years
ago, for the four-year undergraduate course with
bachelor's degree and an additional year for the
engineer's degree for such as care to pursue the
course.
Many engineers interested in the advancement of
the engineering profession feel that this is a step
backward as .six-year men are better trained and
worth more to the industrv.
Progress Report of the De-
partment of Engineering
Research
The Department of Engineering Research is en-
tering upon its fifth year. It looks forward with
much optimism to a continuance of the success of
the year just passed. The industries within and
without the state are learning of the existence of
the Department. They are beginning to appre-
ciate the nature and character of the service the
Department is best fitted to render. They are giv-
ing thought to the utilization of the facilities for
research at the University. This means growth,
progress and the creation of a co-operative frame
of mind toward the University by the industries
and technical interests in the State.
During the year ending June 30, 1924, work was
done on 115 projects. Three of these were fellow-
ships. The rest ranged in magnitude from work
involving but little time to extensive research pro-
grams which will extend over a period of years.
The scope of the investigations covered are:
1. The determination of the physical, electrical,
metallurgical or chemical properties of ma-
terials.
2. The testing and checking of materials, ma-
chines, and equipment when under various
conditions.
3. The development of testing machines, instru-
ments and commercial equipment.
4. Analysis of manufacturing and civic prob-
lems.
Eighty-five (85) persons were employed on these
projects. Four (4) of these were engaged in the
administration of the Department, though the
director and the stenographer were the only ones
devoting full time to this work. The balance were
directly employed on investigational work. A
division of those employed shows that twelve (12)
were full professors, one (1) an associate professor,
seven (7) instructors and the balance assistants,
mechanics, stenographers or persons with no uni-
versity designation. There were ten (10) of these
latter who devoted their full time to the projects
on which they were engaged.
The amount expended for research by outside
interests through the channels of the Department
during this past year amounted to approximately
$57,000. This is over three times the amount thus
expended in 1922-1923 and over sixteen times the
amount expended in 1921-1922. The low amounts
for these years and also for the initial year, for
which no statement is made, may be laid to the
effects of the business depression through which
this country passed in 1920, 1921 and even into
1922, as well as to the fact that the department

was new and necessarily had to find itself before it
was in a position to function. It is pointed out that
the amounts suggested or stated above do not in-
clude the $10,000 appropriated annually by the
Board of Regents for the administrative mainte-
nance of the department.
A few of the outstanding problems on which the
Department has worked during the past year fol-
low. All of the outstanding problems are not in-
cluded in this list as the problems have been
selected primarily for the purpose of indicating
types.
Under the direction of Professor H. H. Higbie, a
comprehensive study of the factors which affect
natural illumination is in progress. The results
of this work should ultimately prove of great bene-
fit and value. In the field of artificial illumination
over $50,000 is being spent. Those directing this
expenditure and those firms that are providing the
funds feel that civilization will greatly benefit
through better illumination. What is true with
respect to artificial illumination is true with equal,
if not with greater force, with respect to natural
illumination. We expect that the work of Pro-
fessor Higbie and his assistants will prove a real
boon to mankind.
Professor B. F. Bailey and his assistants are
engaged in a study of the laws governing the oper-
ation of single phase motors. Those informed with
regard to electric motor designs appreciate that to
date single phase motors are, for the most part,
impracticable. These same persons realize there is
a field for the single phase motor if it can be made
practicable. This investigation is studying this
matter from a wide variety of angles and the results
of the studying should prove of real benefit and
service.
Under the direction of Professor O. W. Boston
and his assistants the Department is engaged in
an investigation of The Art of Cutting Metals. We
all know metals can be cut. We know some can
be cut much more easily than others. The cutting
of metals is one of the oldest of the arts. It is like-
wise one of the most extensive of the arts. Strange
as it may seem, we know practically nothing about
the laws of metal cutting. This investigation is
initially interested in the laws of straight line
motion. A special dynamometer has been built and
preliminary tests have been made. We look for-
ward to results of much value this coming year.
This work is co-operatively supported by a number
of the leading industries in the State. It has at-
tracted a great deal of nation-wide attention, espe-
cially from the machine tool interests and those
concerns and individuals which co-operate closely
with the American Society for Mechanical Engi-
neers.
A comprehensive studv of the trade wastes in
the City of Flint has been made by Professors Hoad
and Decker and their assistants. Funds for this
work have been provided by the Manufacturers
Association of Tlint. A very thorough study has
been made. The results have been reported to the
Association. The report has indicated the nature
and extent of stream pollution. The statement has
been made that one plant alone, if it puts into effect
the procedure recommended, will save more in the
first year than the entire cost of the investigation.
This study should prove valuable not only to the
industries for whom the investigation was made
because of the savings they will be able to effect,
but likewise to the City of Flint as a whole because
of the fact that by the prevention of stream pollu-
tion it will permit the filter plant to operate effi-
ciently and effectively and therefore give to the
residents of Flint the type of water which they
should receive.
Through funds provided by the Detroit Foundry-
men's Association, a study has been made of core
oils. This work is not as yet complete. The results
indicate that many oils have a critical drying tem-
perature. Results also indicate that linseed oil
is in a general way more usually satisfactory than
any of the other core oils examined. The investi-
gation should be continued, and should be carried
not only into the fields of core oils, but also into
the broader field of core binders.
Professor J. E. Emswiler and his assistants are
engaged in a study of the Laws of Natural Venti-
lation. Considerable attention has been paid to
artificial ventilation but to date we know of no com-
prehensive study which has been made of natural
ventilation. In an industrial state, such as is the
case in Michigan, knowledge of the laws of natural
ventilation is most essential. This condition is par-
ticularly true in the erection and design of factory
buildings. Foundries, forge shops, chemical plants,
and many others require adequate natural venti-
lation. As a result of the studies Professor Ems-
wiler has shown much benefit can result through
a proper appreciation and utilization of the laws of
natural ventilation.
Under the direction of Professor D. L. Rich, the
Department is engaged in the development of a
machine for measuring gear noise. Funds for this
work have been provided by the Timken Roller
Bearing Company. Excellent progress has been
made. A most satisfactory machine has been devel-
oped. It is now being tested under a variety of
service conditions. The principles underlying this
machine should be adaptable to the automobile in-
dustry for a large variety of purposes. As far as
we know, it is the first machine which has yet
been developed which is able to accurately measure
noise. Since few studies have been made for the
purpose of checking the accuracy of these prelimi-

nary conclusions, we are not prepared, at this writ-
ing, to speak of this matter at further length.
To those unacquainted with research work, it is
pointed out that no departments or organizations
engaged in research have shown greater progress
during similar periods in their development. That
the Department was able to make this excellent
showing is due to the co-operation it has received
from the industries and technical interests in the
State; to the splendid co-operation given it by the
various members of the faculty in the University;
to the splendid facilities which have been placed
at the disposal of the industrial and technical inter-
ests in the State by the President and Regents of
the University; and to the hearty endorsement by
the Michigan Manufacturers Association, which
this department has at all times enjoyed.

Air Service Summer Camp
Aeronautical students of the University who are
members of either unit of the Reserve Officers
Training Corps, and who pass the physical exami-
nation for flying may attend an advanced R. O.
T. C. camp in lieu of the camp of the unit in which
enrolled. Upon completion of the Aeronautical
course and the R. O. T. C. course they are commis-
sioned as second lieutenants in the Air Service
Reserve. For this purpose the writer attended the
Air Service Camp at Chanute Field, Illinois, during
the past summer.
The purpose of the R. O. T. C. Air Service Camp
is to train the student in the fundamental qualities
of flying and observation. The scope of this camp
does not cover enough ground to issue a pilot's
license to the student, but takes in the construction
of airplanes and motors with all their various
accessories, formation flying, types of offensive and
defensive airplane attack, and familiarizes the stu-
dent with the work of the Junior Air Service Offi-
cer.
Flying clothes, goggles and uniforms were issued
immediately upon arrival at camp and flying com-
menced on the second morning. Five mornings a
week were thereafter devoted to flying, endeavor-
ing to put every man in the air every morning. The
army J. N. 4 training planes were used, equipped
with dual control and facilities especially for the
use of reserve officers.
Terrain sketching and map making were first
taken up, followed by navigating or setting the
course of the airplane. Bombing raids were worked
out in theory and practice. Airplane attack was
demonstrated in the air, as was the observation of
artillery fire and enemy troops. Little piloting was
done as the student usually was too busy solving
his problem to have time for piloting the plane.
In the classroom, lectures were given on the en-
tire plane, much time being spent on the motor.
Ignition systems were analyzed, cooling systems
were covered both in theory and on the planes.
Wing section and fuselage construction were ex-
plained. The rigging or assembling the plane was
gone over as was the maintenance of planes on
active flying duty.
Other work directly concerned with aircraft was
also given. Each man was instructed in machine
gun and pistol firing. The three types of aircraft
machine guns were torn down, assembled, and
fired. The construction of bombs and bomb sights
was an interesting phase of this work. One of the
most popular things assigned to the students was
trapshooting which covered nearly a week.
Aerial photography and mosaic work were ex-
plained. The student was given a roll of films and
a camera and told to "shoot" anything he cared to.
He then developed and printed the picture. The
method of handling army wireless sets in aircraft
was part of the work which everyone liked.
This schedule may appear as "all work and no
play" but ample facilities were provided for recrea-
tion. Tennis courts, swimming pool and baseball
diamond vied in popularity. The regular officers
gave a dance for R. O. T. C. men which was a
pleasant affair. Movies played the same part in
camp life that they do in Ann Arbor. All of the
thirty-two men at Chanute Field thoroughly en-
joyed the experience and expressed the wish to
come back.
The Fort Monroe Camp
It is difficult to describe the varied emotions
attendant upon arrival at camp. To some it was a
new experience and therefore a new adventure with
many thrilling prospects. To others it was a return
to familiar scenes and, in all probability, pleasant
memories. To another group, while lacking in any
particular thrill, it was one way of spending a sum-
mer vacation without cost and at the same time
not unpleasantly.
Such were some of the emotions of the various
students from the eleven colleges and universities
who arrived at Fort Monroe between the 16th and
19th of June, 1924. They arrived on foot, by rail,
by boat, or by way of some of the various forms
of motor transportation such as may be seen at any
inter-collegiate football game, ranging from motor-
cycles to father's sedan.
The first week was occupied with physical ex-
aminations and the issuing of clothing and other
equipment. When a student had been pronounced
physically fit and had received his full equipment
he was free to do as he pleased and a great many
spent their time becoming familiar with the va-
rious points of interest in and around Fort Monroe


November, 1924
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
where some of the battles of the Revolutionary and
Civil wars were fought. The Officers' Club in the
casemate of the old fortress was open to the stu-
dents and many spent a great deal of time there
wandering through the galleries and inspecting the
trophies and relics of previous wars or sat on the
cool veranda over the moat, sipping a lemonade as
they watched the ships pass in and out of the har-
bor. By the end of the week everyone felt com-
fortably at home and was thoroughly enjoying the
peaceful atmosphere, so much so in fact, that it is
the writer's belief that some were entertaining a
sneaking suspicion that they were peculiarly fitted
for an army career.
The following Monday a new order of events
was in vogue, for work started in earnest and from
then on the camp was the scene of constant activ-
ity from revelie to retreat. The day was divided
into five periods. The first was from 7:00 to 7:45,
the second from 8:00 to 10:30, the third from 10:45
to 11:45, the fourth from 1:00 to 3 :00 and the fifth
from 3:30 to the end of the exercise. Revelie was
at 6:00, breakfast at 6:25, dinner at 12:00, retreat
at 6:00 followed immediately by supper. On the
whole the day was pretty well taken care of. The
first pericd was the infantry drill period, the second
and fourth periods the artillery drill periods, the
third period was the battery commander's period
when lectures or talks were given by the regular
officers on administration, courtesy, customs of the
service, gunnery, orientation, hygiene and other
subjects of interest. The fifth period was the period
of athletics or special formations, such as guard
mount and parade, which usually occurred on Fri-
days. The athletics for the fifth period were com-
pulsory but the student was at liberty to select any
form of athletics not classed as an "indoor sport."
There was one exception to this. The student must
first pass a swimming test which consisted of swim-
ming 50 yards. If he could not pass this test he
was required to join the class in swimming instruc-
tion which was given during the fifth period and
remain in that class until he could pass the test.
By the end of camp all students had learned to
swim. Tattoo sounded at 9:30, at which time lights
had to be put out but if a student wished to stay
up he could go to the service club where the lights
remained on until 11:00 and after that all must be
in bed.
Battery "B," which consisted of students from
the University of Michigan, University of Cincin-
nati, Kansas State Agricultural College, and the
Citadel, a southern military college, was typical of
the other companies so this chronicle will only deal
with that battery.
During the first two weeks this battery drilled
on the 155 mm G. P. F., and the 75 mm guns,
actually firing 60 rounds of 75 mm and 12 rounds of
155 mm ammunition, with excellent results.
The third week was occupied on the rifle and
pistol ranges where each student was given an
opportunity to qualify with each weapon for a
medal, either as marksman, sharp-shooter or expert.
During this week each student was also given two
periods of riding instruction which encouraged
some to eat their meals standing up for, they argued,
a horse does not sit down to eat. The fourth week
consisted of drill and instruction on the anti-air-
craft guns and the 12-inch .seacoast mortars. For
the fifth week the entire camp moved to Fort
Eustis where Battery "B" emplaced and manned a
12-inch railway mortar and fired a most success-
ful problem of four rounds after which the gun was
again placed in the traveling position in record
time.
Amusements consisted of baseball, swimming
and tennis meets, fishing, horseback riding, movies,
weekly dances and trips to points of special inter-
est, such as the Navy Yard at Portsmouth, Langley
Field (Aviation), the Coast Artillery School, York-
town and Williamsbury, the two latter of tremen-
dous historical interest. A visit was also made to
Jamestown, where the ruins of an ancient church
tower, built by the early settlers, could be seen.
During the last week there were efficiency tests
as prescribed by the War Department for all camps.
Equipment was returned and pay checks given out.
The student received five cents per mile for travel
to and from his university and seventy cents per
day in addition to his board while at camp.
The healthful outdoor life, the broadening influ-
ence of contact with students from other schools,
the visits to places intimately connected with the
early history of our country and the various duties
performed proved of immeasurable value to the
campers. The pleasant life was over all too soon
and the men cast lingering glances of regret as
they left the scene of a happy and profitable sum-
mer's work.
In muscular and nervous activities, "hand and
speech are physiologically connected." Nothing so
stimulates thought and constructive imagination as
the habit of writing; it aids accuracy, stimulates the
association of ideas, and develops expression. But
few of us make an effort to think and think our
best, and until we do, the best of us is dormant,
because as Hamilton says, "The larger part of our
mental riches are hidden away in the obscure re-
cesses of the mind."
Doctor: "Yours is a peculiar case. I'm not sure
what I'd better prescribe."
Patient (hopefully): "Oh, I'm not a bit particu-
lar anymore, Doc."

ALUMNI NEWS
Echoes from the Graduate ft
HOLMES WHITE
IX this, the third of a scries of biographical
sketches of well known Michigan Alumni, we
are presenting the story of a man who is widely
known in engineering and military circles and who
has been one of the greatest single factors in the
building up of the Chemical Engineering Depart-
ment of the University of Michigan.
Alfred Holmes White was born in Peoria, Illinois,
on the 29th day of April, 1873. He spent his youth
in that city and graduated from
Peoria High School. When he
was ready to enter college, his
parents decided to send him to
McGill University in Montreal
for there he could live with an
aunt. Professor White says
that his mother was afraid to
send him away to school alone.
He found life in an English
University, for McGill is es-
sentially an English institu-
tion, much different from life
in an American University.
One of the ironclad formalities
observed was that the cap and
gown must always be worn
when going up to interview the
Dean of the School. Professor
White tells of an amusing ex-
perience he had at that time
when, at the end of the school
year, he went into the Dean's
office to get his grades. He had not donned his
cap and gown inasmuch as he was just about to go
home and had packed them up. Upon asking that
august gentleman, the Dean, for his grades he
received this answer.
"Young man, don't you know better than to ad-
dress the Dean without the proper attire?"
He then borrowed a cap and gown from one of
the boys he met in the hall and reappeared before
the Dean. "Sir, may I have my grades?" To his
surprise, and in spite of all the efforts he had made
PROF. A. H. WHITE
to comply with regulations, the Dean replied, "NO."
Although Professor White was always primarily
interested in Chemistry there was no institution
in the States or in Canada where he could take a
regular course in Chemical Engineering. At Mc-
Gill he pursued the classical course. The following
year he entered the University of Michigan, study-
ing Latin and Greek and making his electives in
Chemistry. He received his A. B. in 1893. For
three years after graduation
he was Assistant in Chemis-
try at the University of Illi-
nois. Feeling the need for a
more specialized training in
chemistry, however, he finally
decided to study a year at the
Polytechnicum at Zunich,
Switzerland, specializing in
Chemical Technology. At this
time there was still but one
institution in the United States
giving a regular course in
Chemical Engineering, the
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology at Boston.
In 1898 Professor E. D.
Campbell organized the De-
partment of Chemical Engi-
neering at the University of
Michigan and asked Professor
White to teach the course in
Chemical Technology. The
University of Michigan, therefore, was the second
institution in the country to organize such a depart-
ment and Professor White has been with it since
its inception. While teaching, he continued his
studies in chemistry and was granted his B. S. in
Chemical Engineering in 1904. He rose rapidly
in his profession, being appointed Assistant Pro-
fessor in 1904, and Professor in 1907. In 1914 he
was made head of the Department of Chemical
Engineering at Michigan, which position he has
held ever since and in which capacity many of the


November, 1924
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
students on the campus today have made his
acquaintance.
Professor White has an enviable war record.
Enviable, not because of physical dangers encoun-
tered and deeds of heroism performed, but because
of the great responsibility he shouldered and the
momentous importance of the work in which he
was engaged. He was commissioned Captain of
the Ordnance Department, United States Reserves,
in May, 1917, and was immediately called to Wash-
ington to help organize the Inspection Division of
the Ordnance Department. He was the first Pro-
fessor to leave the campus for war service. The
Nitrate Division was organized in July of the same
year and he was transferred to this work and ranked
next to the Chief of the Division. It was his duty
"to recommend processes, to pass on all new pro-
cesses offered, to conduct research work and to keep
in touch with the work of foreign governments on
this subject." Inasmuch as the United States soon
started to build large nitrate plants at Toledo, Cin-
cinnati, Sheffield, Alabama and Muscle Shoals, Pro-
fessor White held a position of considerable im-
portance in our war organization. He gradually
advanced in his work up to the time he was honor-
ably discharged in July, 1919. He was then Lieu-
tenant Colonel of Ordnance, Chief of the Research
Section and Associate Chief of the Nitrate Division.
His services as Consulting Chemical Engineer were
retained by the War Department.
Professor White is Vice President of the Ameri-
can Institute of Chemical Engineers and a member
of the American Chemical Society, the American
Society for Testing Materials, the American Gas
Association, and the American Legion. He is
also a member of the Chemists Club (New York)
Cosmos Club (Washington), and the Rotary and
Barton Hills Country Clubs of Ann Arbor. He is
the author of a book, "Technical Gas and Fuel
Analysis," and about fifty research articles in jour-
nals and magazines, dealing mainly with the man-
ufacturing and testing of illuminating gas, the man-
ufacture and properties of Portland Cement and
the fixation of nitrogen.
In 1903 Professor White married Rebecca Mason
Downey of Pueblo, Colorado. They have two chil-
dren, a son, A. M. White, senior in Chemical Engi-
neering and a daughter, Mary, a freshman in the
Literary College.
Professor White exemplifies the old saying that
"actions speak louder than words." He is quiet
and unassuming. You do not find him striving for
publicity by participating in great verbal demon-
strations and promises. You will find him in his
office or in the laboratory working at his profession
or in some definite civic duty that demands action
and concrete results. He has been for the past few
years a director of the Community Fund Associa-
tion and a member of the common council of Ann
Arbor. He is an active Unitarian. In his career
he has qualified as a "Man of Michigan."

HELEN A. SMITH, '20E
Pioneer work in the field of residence lighting is
being done by Helen A. Smith, class of 1920, elec-
trical engineering. Miss Smith became interested
in this field as an undergraduate at the suggestion
of Professor Higbie who is in charge of the work
in photometry and illumination in the College of
Engineering. Her employment by the Lighting
Service Department of the Edison Lamp Works
of the General Electric Company immediately after
her graduation marked the recognition of home
lighting as a field peculiarly appropriate for women
with proper technical training. While so employed.
Miss Smith, with Mr. A. L. Powell, prepared a


November, 1924
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
thirty-six page booklet on "Residence Lighting"
which was the first comprehensive production of
its kind. Later she entered the service of the
Rochester Gas and Electric Corporation as Illumi-
nating Engineer, where her efforts, methods and
results have already proven noteworthy. She is
one of the pioneers, if not the first woman, to enter
this field and by those most competent to judge,
is considered to be an authority on home lighting.
HELIUM
A Research Narrative
HELIUM is in the air in the proportion of one
part in 185,000 by volume; neon, one part in
60,000; argon, one part in 104; krypton, one part in
19 million, and xenon, one part in 190 million. These
gases are all inert, do not react with other elements,
and for this reason probably more than for any
other, they have excited great interest among chem-
ists. Next to hydrogen, helium is the lightest gas
known, having twice the density of hydrogen.
Helium has been liquefied by Professor Onnes
in Leyden. The liquid boils at -268.75° C, which
is very close to absolute zero, that is -273° C. Onnes
is the only one who has liquefied helium, and he
used the small amount of liquid obtained to deter-
mine some of the properties of matter at this ex-
tremely low temperature. What has been done is
significant enough to make it very desirable to have
liquid helium in quantity so that further experi-
mental work along this line may be'carried out.
Helium is found in the gases of many mineral
springs. It is also found in natural gas in a large
number of localities in the United States, particu-
larly in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and Ohio. About
four hundred million cubic feet of helium is going
to waste each year from this source alone.
Since helium is not inflammable and has 92 per
cent, of the lifting power of hydrogen, during the
war, it became of great military value. The plan
was to substitute helium for hydrogen in balloons
and dirigibles, and thus make it impossible to bring
these vessels to earth by means of incendiary bul-
lets. Such a change would make tremendous prog-
ress in aeronautics, for both commercial and war
purposes.
With this object in view, the U. S. Government
has experimented on the extraction of helium from
natural gas in Texas, and during the war three ex-
perimental plants were built and operated. At
present one of these experimental plants is still
being operated and a large production plant has
been constructed at Fort Worth. It is hoped that
the Government will support these plants on ac-
count of the fact that the United States is the only
country in the world at the present time which has
sufficient helium in its natural gas for war and com-
mercial purposes.
The origin of helium in natural gas is uncertain.
During radioactive changes, helium is thrown off
in the form of the alpha particle, which is a helium
atom with two positive charges. However, we are
not acquainted with sufficient supplies of uranium
or thorium ores to account for the large volumes
of helium present in natural gas in this country.
If the helium does not come from radioactive
changes, it might have come from the sun, if the
earth was really thrown off from the sun. The
chromosphere, or surrounding envelope of the sun,
consists of incandescent hydrogen and helium. It
is possible that the viscous mass of the earth in pass-
ing through the sun's atmosphere picked up suf-
ficient gas to account for the helium now found
below the earth's crust.
The price of helium before the war was approxi-
mately $2,000 a cubic foot. It is believed that in
the new plant at Fort Worth helium may be pro-
duced for a little less than 6 cents a cubic foot.
Janssen, during a solar eclipse in 1868, detected
new lines in the spectrum of the sun's atmosphere,
but did not assign them to a new element. Sir J.
Norman Lockyer also observed these lines the same
year and suggested the name "Helium" (sun ele-
ment). Sir William Ramsay, in 1895, first identi-
fied helium on the earth as the principal constit-
uent of the gaseous mixture given off on heating
cleveite, a mineral found in Norway. Helium was
found later in several other minerals and in the
earth's atmosphere. It has so far resisted all at-
tempts to cause it to combine with other elements.
Helium is one of the products formed in radio-
active changes. Onnes liquefied helium in 1908 and
found it, next to liquid hydrogen, the lightest liquid
known, specific gravity 0.122, at approximately 4
degrees absolute, or 269 degrees below zero Centi-
grade.

On the third and fourth of October, Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute celebrated the hundredth
anniversary of its foundation. Since it influenced
materially the development of educational facilities
for women; since it was the first college of agricul-
ture; since it was the first institution to offer a
degree in arts on the completion of a course of
study in the natural, mental, and social sciences;
since it was the first to provide graduate instruc-
tion of professional grade; and, especially, since it
is the oldest school of science and engineering in
any English-speaking country, a pioneer in field
work and laboratory practice, as well as the leader
of the Industrial Revolution in the United States,
we deem this a most important celebration.

LOW-HEAD HYDROELECTRIC DEVELOPMENTS
By C. R. STRANDBERCJ*
Stone &amp; Webster, Inc.
THE carl\' recognition of the presence of water
power in her streams has played an important
part in the industrial supremacy that \cw England
has enjoyed.
At first the most conveniently located waterfalls
were put to work grinding the grain of the settlers
Mid even today one finds most of the older towns
located at, or near, a water power site where the
grist mill was located.
Gradually the water that ground the grain was
turned to other uses so that today the streams of
the New England States are more fully developed
for the production of power than those of any other
part of the United States.
The first water power developments were re-
stricted to. heads from about 8 to 15 ft. because of
limitations in engineering knowledge and in the
mechanical devices used. Higher and higher heads
were utilized as the engineering art developed al-
though most of the water power sites in New Eng-
land fall in the class usually designated as low
heads, that is, under 150 ft.
In the early plants the water wheels were con-
nected by shafting, gears and belts directly to the
machines to utilize the power. The overall effi-
ciency was therefore very low. Later, electric gen-
erators were introduced and these very cumbersome
drives were gradually eliminated until the much
more efficient method of direct connection between
water wheel and generator shafts was introduced.
•Paper read before the Springfield Section of the American
Institute of Electrical Engineers at their meeting Dec. 15, 1924.
Many of the early water wheel units were of the
vertical type with beveled gears to connect the ver-
tical shaft with a horizontal shaft generator. The
first units had single wheels connected in this man-
ner to the generators. Later installations connected
double wheels to a single generator and still later
installations had several wheels connected in this
manner to one generator. The first water wheels
directly connected to generators usually had hori-
zontal shafts as the combined weight of the two
was too great, even in the small size units then
used, to be carried on the usual step bearing which
was a lignum vitae block.
Since the advent of the modern type oil thrust
bearing, such as the Kingsbury or General Electric
designs, the swing has been continually toward ver-
tical units until today very few horizontal units are
installed except in extensions to old plants. The
main reason for this change has been the increased
efficiency that can be obtained in the vertical units
due to the improved design of the runners and the
draft tubes and the better possible arrangement of
apparatus, thus using less space and reducing the
station cost.
A number of improvements are beginning to
make power sites attractive which had previously
been rejected as uneconomical. They also fre-
quently are making it well worth while to remodel
some of the older plants which are becoming obso-
lete.
Among these improvements are:
(1) The large increase in efficiencv in runners


January, 192)
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
which in many old units was not over 70 or 75 per
cent and which today is nearly always close to 90
per cent and in main cases from 1 to 3 per cent over
90 per cent.
(2) The development of the higher speed run-
ners such as the propeller type. This type of run-
ner has made possible speeds almost double the
speeds that were formerly used for Francis type
runners. The higher speed reduces the cost of the
generators and the change in type reduces operat-
ing expenses as the runners are much more rugged.
They usually have from four to six blades and have
such large water passages that much of the trash
that had to be kept out of the older type runners
to keep them from clogging can be allowed to pass
on through. This permits large trash rack spacing
and reduces the expense of trash handling.
The recent improvement in draft tube design has
increased the efficiency of the units although many
of these tubes call for added building cost and hence
larger fixed charges.
The introduction of more and more automatic
equipment has also made it possible to reduce the
number of station operators, thus cutting down
operating expenses. Protective devices are installed
to shut down the unit in case of an overheated bear-
ing, short circuit or continuous overload of the ma-
chine, overspeed, overvoltage, overheated transfor-
mer, failure of exciter voltage or excessive drop in
oil pressure for governor.
Regulators to limit the gate opening of the water
wheels are also included in some automatic plants.
This regulation is usually obtained by means of
floats connected to the oil pressure governors and
so designed that the pond cannot be drawn below
a predetermined level.
The stations used in this comparison have been
designed and built entirely by Stone &amp; Webster,
Inc., with the exception of the Keokuk station,
where Hugh L. Cooper designed and built the dam
and substructure of the building, and also the Iron
Mountain station, where Mead &amp; Seastone designed
the dam and the building substructure. In the lat-
ter case, Stone &amp; Webster constructed the entire
development.
Keokuk, Iowa
At Keokuk, Iowa, a dam 4649 ft., or 88/100 of a
mile, long was constructed across the Mississippi
River and a power house built adjacent to it. As
at Keokuk many of the large, low-head develop-
ments present very difficult problems during the
construction period especially in the handling of
the river. A large, low-head development must be
built on a stream having a large flow of water which
must be diverted during the construction period. If
winter construction is involved it is also at times
necessary to pass large ice floes. The cofferdams
must be designed to safely pass or withstand these
large floods and the heavy ice jams somewhat as
at Keokuk.
The Keokuk station contains fifteen 10,000 h.p.
hydro-electric units. The water wheels for these
units were the first large power, low-head, single
runner water wheels built.
The weight of the revolving unit is carried on a
thrust bearing located between the water wheel
and the generator, the reason for this location being
that the generator manufacturers were not ready to
assume the responsibility for the design of such a
bearing when supported on top of the generator,
although in the next similar plant built, Cedar
Rapids, they accepted full responsibility and the
thrust bearing was located on top of the generator.
The draft tube in this plant is the so-called elbow
or curved type that was standard practice until the
last few years when it has been largely replaced
by more efficient types.
American Powder Mills, Maynard, Mass.
The next station considered is a 225 h. p. station,
built for the American Powder Mills at Maynard.
Mass.. It is a full automatic station and is typical
of what might well be built on many of the small
streams of New England at points where a station
requiring regular shifts of operators would be pro-
hibitive. The station is so small that the equip-
ment had to be taken in through one of the win-
dows, yet there is ample room to get around and
work on all of the equipment.
Roanoke Rapids Power Company, Roanoke
Rapids, N. C.
A somewhat larger development designed and
built for the Roanoke Rapids Power Company at
Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina, indicates the pos-
sible increase in power in some old plants due to the
higher efficiencies obtainable.
GENERATOR ROOM OF THE KEOKUK HYDRO-
ELECTRIC STATION
This station is located on the Mississippi River at Keo-
kuk, Iowa. The water wheels for the fifteen, 10,000 HP.
units were the first large power, low head, single runner
wheels built. The dam here \a 4,649 feet in length.


Page 7
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
This station contains a single propeller type unit
designed to develop 3200 h. p. under a net head of
30 ft. There is an old station taking water out of
the same canal just upstream from the new plant
where three units give a total output of about 2800
h. p. These old units have an efficiency of between
60 and 70 per cent. The new unit has an efficiency
close to 90 per cent and for the same amount of
water will give nearly 50 per cent more power than
the older units.
The new station is designed for full automatic
control with provision for starting the new unit by
closing an oil circuit breaker in the old station up-
stream.
In the preliminary runs on this unit, it took 40
seconds from the time the circuit breaker was closed
until the machine was on the line carrying about
half load. In this time the unit started up, came
to 90 per cent speed, the line switch closed, the gen-
erator then operated as an induction motor until
about 95 per cent speed was obtained when the field
contactor closed and the machine went on the line
without any other synchronizing. It was all done
so quietly that several men standing around the
machine to watch the start did not know it was yet
&lt;&gt;n the line.
Garvin's Falls and Kelley's Falls, N. H.
Two redevelopments being made at Garvin's
Falls and Kelley's Falls in New Hampshire for the
Manchester Traction, Light &amp; Power Company
illustrate the more economical use of space in mod-
ern plants.
The new Garvin's Falls station has one 4,000 and
one 3,000 kva. vertical shaft unit. Each unit has a
high speed propeller type water wheel, directly con-
nected to the generator. These two units took the
place of four old horizontal shaft 1,000 kva. units,
each of which had three runners on the one shaft.
The new station occupies approximately two-thirds
the space the four old units required.
The new Kelley's Falls unit has 1,250 kva. capac-
ity and replaced an old 450 kw. unit which had two
water wheels connected to one generator by a
series of beveled gears, shafting and belting. The
new unit is automatically operated and the new
&gt;tation required less than one-fourth the space used
for the old station. In this redevelopment the old
steel penstock was partially used although the
water velocities through this section are high. In
order to reduce the disturbance at the unit, the
velocity is retarded by properly enlarging the con-
crete section joining the steel penstock to the con-
crete scroll case.
The water wheel is of the high speed propeller
type and the unit has a plate steel Hydraucone draft
tube. This type of draft tube is used to reduce the
amount of expensive form work in the substructure.
Green Island, N. Y.
The station built for Henry Ford &amp; Son, Inc., on
the Hudson River at Green Island, X. Y., has a
number of features of recent development.
This station was notable for the size of its run-
ners which were the largest, low-head, high specific
speed wheels built at the time they were installed.
IRON MOUNTAIN HYDRO-ELECTRIC STATION OF
THE FORD MOTOR COMPANY
This station develops power from a thirty foot head.
Francis type runners are used on units which develop
3200 HP. each at a maximum efficiency of 91 percent.
Each wheel uses about 1,600 sec. ft. of water at
full gate. They are each 13 ft. in diameter and
each wheel develops 2,000 h.p. at 13 ft. head.
As the head at this plant varies widely from a
maximum of about 17 ft. at times of low tide and
low flow, to an extreme minimum of only a few
inches under the maximum flood on record, the
high speed wheels had a distinct advantage over
the Francis type wheels, since the former can oper-
ate at good efficiency for a wider range of heads
than the latter.
Each wheel has only four blades which are bolted
to a hub somewhat as in the case of a built-up ship's
propeller. The openings through these runners are
so large that with a ladder hung down between the
two blades one must reach well out to touch the
blade on either side. The center line of the water
wheel is very nearly the same elevation as the
normal headwater and the water is raised in a
siphcnic scroll case by ejecting the air from above
the water, thus reducing the pressure on the water
surface.
The draft tubes for these units are of the patented
White Hydraucone type. The concrete bell is 39
ft. across and the draft tube chamber is 48 ft. wide.
The generators are combined a.c. and d.c. units,
having two rotors mounted on the same shaft, one
above the other. As both d.c. and a.c. current was
to be used in the manufacturing plant alongside
the station, the first idea was to have a single cur-
rent generator and to provide a motor generator

THE TRANSMISSION OF PHOTOGRAPHS BY RADIO
By C. FRANCIS JENKINS
President, Jenkins Laboratories, Washington, D. ('.
EARLY efforts to serve the eye electrically over
a wire, i.e., "television," were coincident with
the first efforts to serve the ear, but the "telephone"
got the start and attracted to its development most
of the electrical talent of the time. About the only
remaining activities were devoted to the transmis-
sion of pictures by wire, and these have continued
to this verv day, the latest newcomer being the
American Telephone and Telegraph Company, with
old apparatus refined and assembled by a corps of
their engineers. f
With a single exception, the subject of this paper,
every scheme which has attained any considerable
degree of success has depended upon the synchron-
necessary to find a missing part to tie them to-
gether.
Attention was given to the discovery of this miss-
ing link, the something which would remove exist-
ing [imitations. This resulted in the invention of
the Prismatic Ring, a new optical shape in glass,
acceptable examples of which have been attained
only since the perfection of automatic machinery
for its making.
In rotation these rings give to a beam of light
passing through them a fixed axis on one side of the
prism and an oscillating axis on the other side.
These prismatic rings in rotation are comparable to
a solid glass prism which changes the angle between

ous rotation of tw:o cylinders, one at the sending
station with the picture which is to be sent; and
the other at the receiving station where the picture
is to be received. The machines look not unlike the
old wax cylinder phonographs. Perhaps the very
age of this scheme and because there are no patents
to prevent anyone from using it, explains the reason
it has been employed so often by so many.
Obviously, it is not with dot-and-dash cylinder
schemes that electrical vision will ever be obtained,
for if the distant animated scene is to be looked at
and followed in its ever-changing features, it must
be reproduced on a flat screen. But no practical,
workable scheme seemed possible with a combina-
tion made up of parts selected from apparatus al-
ready employed in science and industry; it was
its sides, and have a like action on a beam of light
passing through them.
The light beam passing through these rotating
peripheral rings always oscillates in the diameter
of the ring. Therefore, light passing through two
rings overlapping with diameters at right angles,
will have neither a horizontal nor a vertical, but
instead, a resultant oscillation. If one ring rotates
many times oftener than the other there will be
many slightly diagonal, adjacent, parallel lines cov-
ering a given surface on which the oscillating point
of light impinges. As the ring-like prism is ground
into one face of a plate glass disc, they are referred
to in the laboratory as "prismatic plates."
At school one learned that moving a point makes
a line, and moving a line laterally develops a sur-


Page 9
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
face. It is no trouble to move the point to make
a line, but in practice moving the line laterally is
not so simple. It is easy enough, however, to make
a succession of parallel lines to cover the surface,
and this surface may be the picture surface. That
was the starting point.
The apparatus for sending a photograph by radio
consists of a magic lantern projecting the picture,
either a transparent or an opaque picture, say, four
inches square. Immediately in front of the object-
ive are two (or two pair) of prismatic plates, one of
which makes four hundred revolutions for each sin-
gle revolution of the other. At some distance in
front of the lantern a light-sensitive cell is located.
The repeated rotation of one of the plates, the "fast"
plate, causes the projected picture to sweep across
the light cell four hundred times while the "slow"
plate rotates once, equivalent to a hundred lines to
each inch of the picture.
Thus every part of the image eventually falls
on the light-sensitive cell. As the electrical resist-
pencil a pencil of light is used and instead of white
paper a photographic negative is employed.
The rotation of the prismatic plates draws the
lines by causing the image of a point of light, an
incandescent filament for example, to traverse the
negative until it is covered, the incoming radio sig-
nals causing a fluctuation of the instensity of the
point of light which varies the density of exposure
of different parts of each line. The spot of light
looks very much like a tiny twinkling star as it
travels over the photographic plate, building up the
areas of different densities. This plate, when de-
veloped, becomes a negative of the picture, object
or scene at the sending station, and from which
paper prints can be made as in ordinary photog-
raphy
The radio camera takes the usual plate holder,
loaded with glass or film, and it is upon this the
radio-fluctuated incandescent filament is imaged,
through the rotating prismatic plates. To conserve
the radio energy the "hook-up" for a filament lamp

ance of the cell varies in proportion to the intensity
of the light which falls upon it, the high lights, half-
tones and shades which make up the picture are
converted into a correspondingly modulated electric-
current, which is then put on a radio wave and
broadcast.
Now to receive pictures by radio it is only neces-
sary to cover a photographic plate in parallel adja-
cent lines, and to vary the density of the lines in
proper order to build up the shadows, the halftones,
and the high lights of the picture.
My mother entertained me a long time ago by
putting a penny under a paper, and by drawing
straight lines over it with a dull pencil made the
Indian appear. That is very much the way in which
radio photographs are made, but instead of a lead
consists of a battery to bring the filament to a red
glow. The incoming radio signals are put through
the battery and lamp to variably increase the glow
of the lamp to photographic values, corresponding
to the light values of the different parts of the pho-
tograph at the sending station.
Of course, other sources of light might be em-
ployed or a steady light, a light-valve, instead
of the radio-modulated light source, but the prin-
ciple is the same, and the latter is much simpler.
Any good modulating radio set with two or three
stages of amplification is sufficient, the tiny lamp of
the camera being attached to the set where one
would attach a loud speaker.
It is immaterial whether the modulation is taken
from a flat photograph, from a solid object, or from

mitter at the sending station is pointed, or sketches,
drawings, hand or typewritten letters, and on cut
sheets, or on photographic strips many feet long.
The Chinese Minister, Alfred Sze, last year sent the
first radio message in native characters ever sent by
one Chinese to another. Later the Japanese Charge
d'Affairs, Isaburo Yoshida, similarly sent a radio
message in Japanese characters.
Incidentally the prismatic plate apparatus has
been employed to send photos over wire and again
by directed radio along a railroad rail. On October
4, 1922, photographs were sent through a telephone
in the office to the Navy Radio Station, NOF, where
it was broadcast, and picked up some twenty miles
away.
In this demonstration the picture characteristics
this radio-carried current may be translated into
sound by "headphones," or into pictures by a radio
camera.
The whole apparatus is, therefore, comparable
to a long camera with a lens in Washington and its
photographic plate in Boston, with this difference,
that the one lens in Washington may put its pic-
ture on ten, one hundred, or one thousand photo-
graphic plates in as many different cities at the
same time, and at distances limited only by the
radio power of the broadcasting station.
There are the same plates and plateholders, the
same lens, but there are miles instead of inches be-
tween lens and plates. And because there are inter-
vening obstructions, radio instead of light is em-
ployed to carry the image from lens to plate.
This simplicity and flexibility readily lends itself

through two central telephone exchanges; then into
radio current, and broadcast; and finally back again

recorded on a photographic plate with remarkable
fidelity to the original photograph at the sending
machine.
In March, 1923, photographs were again sent by
radio from the Naval Radio Station, at Washington,
to the "Evening Bulletin" in Philadelphia, the send-
ing machine being operated entirely by Navy per-
sonnel.
These experiments were not so strange if one
remembers that the sending set simply changes
picture values into electrical values, just as a car-
bon transmitter changes speech characteristics into
electrical modulation; and that at the receiving set

tion of telegraphic text in the daily paper. But it
is more probable that the transmission of radio
photo news copy will be the most useful service, for
this method overcomes time, distance, isolation,
storms and breakdowns of the usual means of com-
munication; and serves a thousand daily papers at
no more expense than service to a single patron.
Nor does radio interference and "static" prevent
the reception of perfectly readable copy. A hundred
words a minute from typewritten copy is an every
day attainment already, and one thousand words
per minute soon is confidently predicted.

the country already have radio broadcasting sta-
tions, attaching these simple-prism-ring radio-photo
sending-and-receiving instruments would insure the

RESEARCH IN THE ART OF CUTTING METALS
By 0. W. BOSTON, M. S.
Acting Director of Engineering Shops at University of Michigan
NOTE: This is the first of a series of articles which
will constitute a new feature of the TECHNIC to be known
as The Research Section. These articles will summarize
and give results of up-to-date research problems being car-
ried out at the University of Michigan and elsewhere. The
growing importance of Research to the industries opens up
a new field for graduates who have an investigating turn
of mind.
EYEX today, there are no fundamental rules
which can be applied to metal cutting tools.
There are so many variables, which in past experi-
ments have been overlooked or not recorded that a
considerable amount of the information which is
available, is useless in deducing general laws. A
large percentage of the results obtained by different
investigators for private ^enterprise or for their gen-
eral scientific value has been left unpublished, either
because the results were to "lick" a particular job
or because the final objective was never reached.
Before presenting the research work in the art
of cutting metals which is being undertaken here
at the University, it may be of interest to review,
in a general way, some of the more important re-
searches which have been made along this line.
In 1906 Mr. Frederick W. Taylor presented to the
American Society of Mechanical Engineers his
paper on the "Art of Cutting Metals". His work
had been started in the fall of 188(1. twenty-six
years earlier when as a newly appointed foreman
of a shop, he found that his efforts to increase the
output of his men were blocked because his knowl-
edge of the work was too limited.
Mr. Taylor set about to answer three questions
which had to be answered every day by each ma-
chinist. These questions were, (a) What tool to
use, (b) What cutting speed to use, and (c) What
feed to use, in each particular case. It was ex-
pected that answers could be found to these ques-
tions within a few months. It was, however, only
after fourteen years of research work that a suit-
able basis was found upon which the performance
of tools could be judged. It was then agreed that
the best measure for the value of a tool lay in the
exact cutting speed for a given feed and depth of
cut at which it was completely ruined at the end
of twenty minutes.
A few of his important results will be noted. In
1881 the discovery was made that a round nosed
tool would turn out much more work than the old-
fashioned diamond pointed tool. In 1881 it was
demonstrated that coarse feeds with small cutting
speeds would accomplish more work than fine feeds
with accompanying high speeds.
In 1883 the discovery was made that water
poured directly on the chip would permit a forty
per cent increase in speed in cutting steel forgings.
In 1894 the discovery was made that water thrown
upon a shaving of wrought iron or steel produced
a gain in cutting speeds of self-hardening tools of
about thirty-three per cent. In 1900 announcement
was made of the invention of high speed steel.
In 1901, after cutting more than 800,000 pounds
of metal into chips, a slide rule was made to inter-
pret the mathematical equations for cutting speeds
which were developed in that year. This permitted
the adoption of standard tools with written instruc-
tions as to their use. Many of the principles laid
down by Taylor and his associates are still accepted
as final by the metal cutting industries.
Taylor's work had demonstrated to the world the
value of scientific research. It was not long after
the announcement of the development of high speed
steel in 1900 that organizations in other countries
began investigations with cutting steels of their
own making.
In 1901, the Verein Deutscher Ingenieure, to-
gether with a number of large engineering works
in Berlin, made several interesting experiments on
metal cutting.
In 1902 a series of experiments were undertaken
at the Manchester Municipal School of Technology
(now Manchester University), under the direction
of Dr. J. T. Nicholson.
This work was sponsored by a number of promi-
nent English manufacturing companies, and the
Manchester Association of Engineers. The Berlin
and Manchester experiments were both for the pur-
pose of determining the relation between speed and
area of cut for given metals. Taylor criticized both
experiments as being unscientific, in that there were
several variables involved at one time. Later tests
by Dr. Nicholson to determine the pressure on the
tool of a chip while being' cut added materially to
the information on cutting metals, as well as fur-
nishing a real basis for machine tool design.
In 1919-22 further tests were made at the Univer-
sity of Manchester by Professor Dempster Smith, a
former associate of Nicholson, for the lathe tool
research committee of the Manchester Association
of Engineers and the cutting tool research commit-
tee of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.
Funds were advanced by the British government
for this work. These tests have been devoted to
the development of the best methods for heat treat-

ing the tools based on cutting tool performance. In
March, 1924, a further report was made explaining
the behavior of tools when taking extremely fine
cuts over a wide range of speeds and also the qual-
ity and treatment of the tool best suited for these
conditions.
Recently Dr. G. Schlcsinger at the Machine Tool
Testing Laboratory of the Technical Institute in
Berlin has contributed valuable results on the cut-
ing of metal by turning. The University of Illi-
the principles of metal cutting. There is, however,
no certain method of designating the cut-ability of a
metal or the cutting-ability of a tool. Neither is
there a settled definition for the hardness of a metal.
There are many hardness testing machines, all of
which give certain indications of the physical prop-
erties of a metal, yet no two of these give the same
indication for all material. This subject is receiving
a great deal of consideration by the technical socie-
ties of all countries and many special committees

nois has published some results on the cutting of
metals by drilling and in 1920 research work was
completed at the University of Michigan on the art
of milling. All of these lead to a more definite
understanding of the cutting of metals, but do not
yet solve the basic problem.
Professor E. G. Coker of the University College
of London has been conducting tests in his labora-
tory under the auspices of the Cutting Tool
Research Committee of the Institution of Mechan-
ical Engineers. He has investigated the cutting of
transparent material (nitro-cellulose) by means of
a photoelastic method.
Polarized light is projected through the strained
material onto a screen giving rise to many colors.
Fig. 1 gives an illustration of the results obtained.
Tt was found that these colors are proportional to
the strain set up by the force exerted by the cutting
tool. From this the stress at any point in the ma-
terial can be determined. This principle has been
applied to straight line cutting, milling and turning,
as well as other general problems of strain in mate-
rials.
Great progress has been made in the metallurgy
of metals which assists us in better understanding
are working on the development of standard prac-
tice in this field.
The X-Ray as a means of analyzing chip forma-
tion, the thermo-couple method of measuring* the
temperature at the cutting edge of a tool and mag-
netic and electrolytic tests for determining compar-
ative properties of steel, are other means now be-
ing used with some success to study the fundamen-
tals underlying the cutting of metals.
During the last two years there has been created
in the American Society of Mechanical Engineers
a special research committee on "The Cutting and
Forming of Metals." The object of this committee-
is not to criticize in any way the valuable research
work which has been done, but rather to correlate
the most reliable data and to review the research
that has been made by manufacturing firms or at
the universities and colleges and to make note of
those factors upon which no research has been at-
tempted or upon which reliable data are not avail-
able.
At the present time, many of the machine tool
builders and users and perhaps all of the steel man-
ufacturers are carrying on research to some extent.
While these researches are intended primarily to


Page 13

develop the commercial interests of the firms in
question, the committee believes that much can be
done to avoid duplication of work and its attendant
delay and economic loss. By complete co-operation
between the committees and those undertaking re-
search work, projects will be undertaken by those
best able to handle them and the results will be
made available to all for the general good.
A start has been made toward compiling a bib-
liography on the art of cutting metals. A question-
FIGURE 3.—CUTTING FORCE VS TOOL SHARPNESS

aire now being prepared will soon be sent to the
larger industries and schools for the purpose of
determining where research work is being done
and its nature. The committee has prepared the
following list of subjects which it believes should
receive consideration:
(a) The development of a standard method
for testing tool material and material to
be cut.
(b) The development of a standard heat treat-
ing method.
(c) The development of standard tools.
(d) The development of methods for testing
tool performance.
(e) The development of a method for testing
cutting fluids.'* (lubricants and coolants).
(f) The formation of a definite basis for spec-
ifications of work material, tool material
and cutting fluids.
(g) Experimental research to establish grad-
ually the general and fundamental laws
governing the relation between tool per-
formance, (in its several aspects), on the
one hand and the numerous independent
variables on the other, such as the various
factors of tool design and adjustment,
(form and rigidity of tool, side rake, front
rake, clearance angle, etc.), speed of work,
depth of cut, feed, nature of material con-
cerned, (the tool, work and fluid), tem-
perature and method of lubrication and
cooling.
About eighteen months ago a generous allow-
ance per year for three years was made available
by the Michigan Manufacturers Association through
its Manufacturing Methods Committee, for research
work of a fundamental nature to be conducted at
the University of Michigan. At the suggestion of
Professor A. E. White of the Engineering Research
FIGURE 4.—TOOLS USED IN SHARPNESS TESTS
Department, the work is being done in the Engi-
neering Shops under the writer's direction. Mr.
C. J. Swigert, Research Assistant and Mr. D. L. Per-
kins, Instructor in Shop Practice, are carrying out
the tests, and classifying the data.
An advisory committee was appointed and a
definite program arranged as follows:
(1) To attempt to develop a mathematical rela-
tion between the force on a tool or the power re-
quired to remove a given volume of metal and the
many variables concerned.
2. To confine the cutting to straight line motion,
hoping that the resultant mathematical equation
could later be modified to express a similar relation
for turning, etc.
(3) That the W7ork should be done on a planer.
(4) That a special dynamometer for this pur-
pose should be built.
(5) That the tools should be made of carbon
steel and high speed steel, the geometric forms,
chemical and physical properties, etc., to be deter-
mined and recorded.
(6) That the speed should be constant for the
first series of experiments at twenty feet per minute.
(7) That for the present the material to be cut
should be a low carbon steel, fully annealed, its
chemical and physical properties to be determined
and recorded. Cast iron and a medium carbon or
a low carbon tool steel to be used in subsequent
tests.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
(8) That the specific problems as a starting
basis were to be as follows:
(a) The determination of a standard prac-
tical degree of tool sharpness.
(b) To determine the effect of the clearance
angle of the tool on the force or energy
required to remove a given volume of
metal.
(c) To determine the effect of front rake on
the force or energy required to remove
a given volume of metal.
(d) To determine the effect of side rake
(skew) on the force or energy required
to remove a given volume of metal.
(e) To determine the relation between the
force or energy required to remove chips
of a given cross-sectional area as a func-
tion of the width and depth.
It is not expected that results of a commercial
nature will be obtained at this time. It is hoped,
however, that fundamentals of metal cutting can
be established which lead to a better understanding
of the subject.
A dynamometer has been designed and con-
structed. This is mounted on a new planer pur-
chased especially for this work. The low carbon
material to be cut is mounted on the dynamometer,
Grooves have been milled lengthwise on the upper
surface so as to leave the three lands each ^ inches
wide. As these lands are cut, the initial width of
the chip removed is controlled. The cutting tool
is shown mounted in the planer head just above
the test specimen. As the tool removes a chip, the
force is indicated on the test gage shown in the
foreground.
The results of the practical degree of tool sharp-
ness, problem (a), are shown in Fig. 3. The three
tools shown in Fig. 4 were prepared having front
rakes of 10, 20 and 30 degrees but with a common
clearness angle of 4 degrees. The cutting speed
was 20 feet per minute in all cases. The tools were
first carefully ground and then the cutting edge
honed so that under a microscope the edge ap-
peared to be more even than the average razor
blade. With this cutting edge a series of cuts were
made the results of which are plotted as ordinates
over the condition of the cutting edge as abscissae.
The curves Fig. 3 show that each tool requires a
different force per .001 sq. in. of cross-sectional
area of chip but that this force is practically con-
stant for each tool until the tool is considerably
dulled. The force then increases with the degree
of bluntness. It is also seen that the unit force
curve for a tool varies with the thickness of the
chip being cut indicating that thick chips are re-
moved more efficiently than thin ones. The value
of this set of curves is that for this material it is
reasonably sure that no correction factor will have
to be introduced as long as the cutting edge is pre-
pared with an ordinary abrasive wheel.
Fig. 5 has been prepared to show certain features
of chip formation. It was observed that for a given
depth of cut, the number of cross lines on the land
after a chip had been removed, varied with the
degrees of tool sharpness. With the keen cutting
edge there are more slips per inch than with the
dulled edge. The highest curve shows that for
the 30 degree front rake tool taking a depth of cut
FIGURE 5.—CHIP SLIPPAGE VS TOOL SHARPNESS
CURVE
of .006 inch there are 40 slips per inch which is
reduced to 26 slips per inch for the dullest edge.
There is little difference in slippage for the first
three conditions of tool sharpness; also the slippage
variation is reduced for the heavier cuts as shown
by the dashed lines.
The results of the tests conducted to determine
the effect of the clearance angle of a tool on the
force or energy required to remove a given volume
of metal (problem b) are typically illustrated in
Fig. 6. The tool has a 20 degree front rake angle.
The width of cuts and speed were constant while
a series of tests were run with depths of cut of .006.
.012 and .024 inch with the clearance angle of the
tool as the variable.
All curves plotted are nearly horizontal straight
lines. It has been concluded, therefore, that for
the low carbon steel in an annealed condition, there
is no appreciable effect on the cutting force of the
clearance angle. Results with a zero degree clear-
ance angle were erratic so that it was not included
in these tests. Abrasion on the clearance face of the
tool would probably prove excessive for low clear-
ance angles and yet the less the clearance angle, the
more the cutting edge is supported. These tests
have not shown that the wear of the tool is greater
with lower values of clearance. A four degree clear-
ance angle has been selected for future tests in

LIGHTNING
By F. W. PEEK, JR., A. B.. M. E. E.*
A STUDY of lightning is of scientific importance
because there is manifest in the flash the dyna-
mic effects of the electrons and ions, the elemental
bricks of which, it is believed, all matter is made:
it is of engineering importance because an exact
knowledge of the characteristics of lightning will
make it possible to protect life, buildings, powder
magazines, oil tanks and transmission lines against
it. The ideal method of making such a study is by
observations of natural lightning in the field and
researches with artificial lightning in the labora-
tory. This lecture is a report on such a combined
study.
The artificial lightning was obtained by means
of the author's lightning generator which supplies
2,000.000 volts at an energy of 2,000 watt seconds.
The power may be several million kilowatts or
horsepower. The character of the discharges is
similar to that of natural lightning. The destruc-
tive effects are also similar; fires may be set, metal
conductors disappear, wood may be blown apart,
discharges in water or oil produce explosive results,
etc.
The experiments with natural lightning were
made in the mountains of Colorado and elsewhere.
The conclusions from this studv are as follows:
The Voltage, Energy and Character of Lightning
A thunder cloud discharges to earth when the
voltage along the discharge path is about 100,01)0
volts per foot. The effect of the thunder cloud is
not local, but the atmosphere becomes electrified
for a considerable distance. 32,000 volts for each
foot above ground may occur at a quarter of a mile
from the flash; 12.0TX) volts at a half mile and 3.000
volts at a mile.
When the flash occurs current flows from the
cloud to ground and the potential of the cloud be-
comes zero in a few micro-seconds (millionths of a
second). The cloud may become charged in the
opposite direction at a lesser voltage a few micro-
seconds later and so on. This is called an oscilla-
tory discharge. Most discharges seem to bo non-
oscillatory or impulsive. The electrical energy is
changed into heat, light, sound and chemical energy.
The chemical changes take place in the path of the
discharge. The oxygen molecule is split up and
partly recombines as ozone. Nitrous oxides are

imental laboratory at the I'ittsfleld Works of The General Elec-
tric Company, and the above article by him. is a .summary and

Centenary.
also formed as well as nitric acid in the presence
of moisture. Along the discharge path are untold
numbers of electrons and ions movinp at enormous
velocities. It is a matter of speculatu n whether
this intensive ionic bombardment of the oxygen
and nitrogen atoms transmutes some of them into
helium or hydrogen.
The voltage of lightning is of the order of 100,-
000,000. This is about one million times the volt-
age of the ordinary lighting circuit or one thousand
times the voltage of very high voltage transmission
lines. The current may be 80,000 amperes and the
energy 13,500 Kw seconds or 3.8 kw hours. The
energy is sufficient to operate an automobile about
five miles or an electric toaster for a day. Since
this energy is dissipated in a very short time the
power may be several thousand million kilowatts or
horse power. The effect is thus explosive and
destructive.
THE TWO MILLION VOLT LIGHTNING GENERATOR
Power from low voltage lines at a frequency of 60 cycles
(as ordinarily used for commercial and household lighting)
is stepped up, by a transformer, to very high voltages,
stored in the artificial clouds or condensers of the lightning
generator and then discharged in a small fraction of a
millionth of a second, as lightning. Photograph shows the
two million volt lightning generator in operation (double
exposure made with figures within enclosure to show scale).

The voltage was arrived at by researches with
artificial lightning on models of clouds, etc., built
to scale. This voltage measurement was described
in a lecture before the Institute last year and caused
considerable interest. It has since been further
confirmed. It may be of interest to point cut that
the voltage of the lightning generator is about 2
per cent and the power about two hundredths per

distance from the rod as shown in the photographs. Imme-
diately surrounding the rod fiere is thus an area immune
from a direct stroke of lightning.
cent of natural lightning. This practically corre-
sponds to the lightning energy that appears on
transmission lines.
Voltage Disturbances on Transmission Lines
A lightning Hash in the vicinity of a transmis-
sion line may cause dangerous voltage on the line.
The line is very seldom directly struck but the effect
is generally by induction. The line, as well as the
atmosphere around it, becomes electrified by the
cloud. The charge on the line is released when
the cloud discharges to ground. The voltage on the
line reaches its maximum at about the time the
cloud voltage reaches zero. The line voltage be-
comes equal to the voltage of the atmosphere above
ground at that position in space just previous to
the discharge but of opposite sign.
The maximum voltage induced on the line is one
or two per cent of the cloud voltage. The energy
is of the order of 1350 watt seconds. The character
of the discharge is generally impulsive and reaches
its maximum in a few micro-seconds. In fact, it
corresponds closely with the discharge from the
lightning generator in voltage, energy and duration.
The maximum possible voltage on any line can be
found by multiplying the height of the line in feet
by 100,000. Thus by "wireless" action 1 to 2 per
cent of the voltage and two hundredths per cent
of the energy of a lightning flash can appear on
transmission lines several thousand feet from the
cloud. These maximum conditions rarely occur on
transmission lines.
A lightning disturbance travels over the line at
the velocity of light and is dissipated to a consider-
able extent by losses; it may double in value when
it strikes the end of the line where it starts back.
If the voltage is high enough it may break down in-
sulators or discharge over an arrester. If no break
occurs it is eventually dissipated by losses.
A grounded wire placed near the line conductors
reduces lightning voltages on transmission lines to
less than half. Several ground wires reduce the
lightning voltage still more. The ground wire is
also a good protector against direct strokes.
The strength of the insulation of lines operating
at various voltages was determined by measure-
ments with artificial lightning. By con.paring' the
insulation strength with the maximum lightning
voltage the ability to withstand lightning was deter-
mined.
The insulation of transmission lines is increased
with the operating voltage. The higher the operat-
ing voltage the better able the insulation is to with-
stand lightning voltage. The exact voltage where
danger from lightning disappears varies with condi-
tions but in general there will probably be little
trouble on 220 kv lines. Special precautions must
be taken, however, to cause the lightning voltages
to divide evenly over the apparatus.
Where Lightning Strikes and Chance of Being
Struck
Researches in the laboratory show that lightning
from a cloud overhead does not always strike the
highest object or rod unless the height of that ob-
ject is over 2.5 per cent of the cloud height. The
Lightning is electrical "dynamite", for in its
stroke energy is liberated very rapidly. Arti-
ficial lightning has all the characteristics of
natural lightning. A lightning discharge
through the center of a solid post of wood
leaves a hole through the wood less than a
thirty-second of an inch in diameter. The
post is violently torn apart but is not burned,
the wood having the odor of gases of frac-
tional distillation. It is probably the pressure
of these rapidly forming gases that blows the
wood apart. When a cracked piece of wood is
struck the gases escape more readily and ignite
upon contact with the air, in turn igniting the
wood. In this way fires may be started by
lightning.
division of hits is about equal between cloud and
ground when the rod is 1.1 per cent of the cloud
height. The chance of being hit is less when the
cloud is not directly overhead. Lightning either
strikes the rod or some distance away. There is a
protected area around the rod with a radius equal
to four times the height of the rod where no ground
hits occur.

of fundamentals and theory in determining the present
status and future growth of power producing systems. It
suggests the reason why Heat Engines and particularly
the chapter on Thermodynamics is a required step to be

IN THIS AGE of progress when the designers
of central stations of all types and kinds are
vying with each other in the use of higher pressures
and temperatures as well as multiplying the com-
plication of the steam generator, prime mover, and
auxiliaries, it is expedient to go back to the begin-
nings of the central station and by a review of the
line of development get a broad perspective of the
field of power generation which will enable us to
apply, to the newer developments, those basic prin-
ciples of commercial economy and efficiency neces-
sary to a proper solution of the problem.
The earlier use of steam when its expansive force
had not been discovered, is best shown by the Xew-
comen pumping installations, in which the steam
was used at atmospheric pressure. Watt discov-
ered the expansive force of steam and so improved
the boiler, engine, and steam piping that 15 Ib. gage
could be used economically. From his time until
about 1900 rising pressure kept pace with improve-
ments in materials and in the design and construc-
tion of steam generators and piping, with occasional
excursions into the realms of higher pressure and
temperature. Practice at this date (1900) may
best be illustrated by the work of the Wild wood
engine. Since 1900 improvements in steam gener-
ators, piping, and prime movers have been made
with increasing rapidity, and many modern plants
are running on 250 Ib. and 200 deg. of superheat,
using standard piping and valves with the newer
designs of boilers, superheaters, and turbines. Table
1 shows the pressures and economies theoretically
possible and attained in a central station, with all
the results reduced to British thermal units in the
coal per kilowatt-hour of useful work.

This paper was presented before the New York Meeting of
the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. «nd published in
their .'ournal.
Our engineers are now using better and more
uniform materials than ever before. Our metal-
lurgical and manufacturing methods have been
greatly improved. Copper, wrought iron, and cast
iron have been discarded for boiler purposes. Steel
and even alloy steel are in common use and their
uniformity leaves little to be desired. Certain of
the non-ferrous alloys are in common use and play
their part in aiding the common security which
characterizes modern installations. Copper boilers
and 212 deg. maximum temperature gave place to
wrought-iron boilers and 30 to 40 Ib. pressure with
a maximum temperature of 300 deg. The use of
steel as a boiler material raised the pressure to 200
Ib. and the temperature to 400 deg., while our
modern steels allow pressures up to 400 Ib. with a
maximum temperature of 750 deg. In certain dis-
tillation plants temperatures as high as 1100 deg.
have been obtained, but the life of the material is
short.
Now it is well known that steel when heated to
comparatively low temperatures, say, 900 or 1,000
deg., loses its strength and becomes unfit to sustain
loads, and the heat strains from even moderate
heating of 300 or 400 deg. may cause certain defor-
mations of a highly unsatisfactory character. Cast-
steel valves have deformed at 750 deg. to such an
extent as to render them useless, and the "growth"
of ordinary cast iron at temperatures above 450
deg. is known to be destructive; but notwithstand-
ing this the later constructions at 250-300 Ib. pres-
sure and 700 deg. maximum temperature are com-
mercial. The first cost is not excessive, repairs are
moderate, and the life of the installation is all that
can be desired.
Commercial Limits of Pressure and Superheat in
the Central Station
What, then, are the commercial limits of pressure
and superheat in the central station? In Fig. 1 we
have calculated and plotted the theoretical thermal
efficiency of the Carnot cycle, the Rankine cycle,
and a regenerative cycle, using both saturated and
superheat values for ranges up to 1200 Ib. and super-
heats of 750 deg. and above. It will be seen that
the chosen regenerative cycle for saturation fol-
lows very closely the efficiency of the Carnot cycle,
while the Rankine cycle falls below the Carnot
cycle increasingly with rise of pressures. The
superheat lines for both cycles are nearly parallel
and maintain this characteristic over a wide range.

The gain from regeneration increases with pressure
and is constant for equal superheat. For any final
temperature the gain from pressure increments
decreases, but the gain from regeneration increases
with pressure increments. Thus at 750 cleg, final
temperature the Rankine efficiency increases from
33.5 per cent to 40.5 per cent with pressure rise
from 200 to 1200 lb., while the regenerative effi-
ciency increases from 37 per cent to 48.5 per cent
with the same pressure increase.
Fig. 1, dealing with theoretical efficiencies only,
does not show the station losses which aggregate
around 45 per cent. Grouping the losses, we may
say that the generator efficiency is 97 per cent, tur-
bine efficiency 78 per cent, boiler efficiency 80 per
cent, leaving for auxiliaries, piping, and radiation
91 per cent, all of which multiplied together give 55
per cent efficiency.

Table 2 shows how these figures work out for
the above suppositions. The saving by regenera-
tion when using 200 lb. pressure (Case 1—Case 3) is
1700 B.t.u., and when using 1200 lb. pressure (Case
2-Case 4) is 2500 Bt.u. Considering the trend of
the curves in Fig. 1, on this page, comparatively
little is gained by further superheating, but there
has been no attempt to go above 800 deg. and the
flattening out is much more marked as the tem-
perature increases.
Water has its crit-
ical temperature at
704 deg. and the crit-
ical pressure is about
3200 lb. Pressures up
to this limit may
therefore be consid-
ered, and since oil-still
temperatures up to
1100 deg. have been
used, we may consider
superheat tempera-
tures up to that point.
We know that the
first allotropic change
in steel occurs at
about 1300 deg., and
1100 deg. is well be-
low this point. Here,
however, we must
look into the physical
properties of the
•iteels used in power-
plant construction.
THE CHESTER STATION OF THE DELAWARE COUNTY
ELECTRIC COMPANY
This steam generating plant has an ultimate capacity of 120,000
K.W., and contains 70 miles of boiler tubes, 22 miles of econo-
mizer tubes, boiler heating surface of 6.3 acres and evaporates
73 tons of water per hour.
When steel is heated the first sign of change—a
dull red just visible in the dark—appears at about
750 deg. Visibility in daylight begins at about 850
to 900 deg. and a full dark red is attained at about
1100 deg. The full cherry red is attained at the first
allotropic change of 1300 deg. Good boiler steels
increase in tensile strength up to about 600 to 700
deg. and lose much in ductility, but above 800 deg.
the tensile strength rapidly falls off and the duc-
tility largely increases. Cast steels of proper car-
bon content and suitable for fittings, valves, and
turbine construction show the same properties
within rather narrow limits. Pipe steels have near-
ly the same characteristics, but the temperature at
which the tensile strength starts to fall is around
550 to 600 deg. This lack of ductility or increase
of brittleness at the maximum temperature of use
must be compensated for by a larger factor of safety
(i.e., increased thickness and weight with higher
cost) and a more careful selection of material. But
with increased thickness it must not be forgotten
that the safe stresses must be correspondingly low-
ered. The variation of strength of materials with
temperature is covered in an appendix to the com-
plete paper.
Variation of Strength of Materials With
Temperature
This subject may be considered from five points
of view, depending on the conditions under which
the materials are to be used.
(a) Boiler Material. Here we know that the
maximum temperature cannot exceed 704 deg., the
critical temperature of water, and that the fire side
of the tube or drum can only be a few degrees hot-
ter. If 1200 to 1800 lb. per sq. in. be the chosen
pressure, the water
temperature is 625
deg. at maximum and
the fire side will not
exceed 725 deg. nor-
mally. This tempera-
ture is well within the
max imum - strength
zone, and only care is
needed to secure suf-
ficient ductility.
(b) Superheater
Material. The maxi-
mum temperature of
the inner surface of
the tubes may be a lit-
tle higher than the
maximum superheat.
The outer tempera-
ture depends on the
position in the boiler.
Radiant-heat super-
heaters are now com-
mercial where the

LBS. AND SUPERHEATS OF 750 DEC. F. AND ABOVE.
pressure parts are protected with a heat-
absorbing and conducting covering of cast
iron. The fire surfaces may be 1400 deg. to
1600 deg. while the inner-wall temperature is as low
as 700 deg., but 1100 deg. is comparably easy of
attainment. Bare-tube superheaters would have a
maximum outside temperature of around 1200 deg.,
but the life at this temperature is unknown. The
maximum safe point may be taken as 800 deg.
superheat temperature and 950 deg. outside tem-
perature.
Neither the tube manufacturers nor superheater
manufacturers are afraid of these conditions, and I
believe they are prepared to guarantee their prod-
uct under such conditions.
(c) Piping Material. Under this category the
condition is markedly different. The steam side of
the pipe is below the maximum temperature of the
steam. The outer surface is much lower and the
thickness of the material can be increased to com-
pensate for the lower elastic limit of the material.
The ductility is improving with temperature in-
crease. Pipe joints are the only serious trouble,
and the modified Van Stone joint with the pipe
edges welded for tightness is the apparent solution.
Experience with this joint has been satisfactory.
(d) Valves and Fittings. Valves and fittings
must necessarily be made of castings, and the low-
carbon, open-hearth steel used, while falling off in
strength sooner than the worked material used in
boiler and piping, has still a respectable elastic
limit at 1100 deg. As in the last category, the in-
side-wall temperature is lower than the steam tem-
perature, with still lower temperatures at the outer
wall. But the shape of the casting is all-import-
ant. Globe valves of the double-beat or Wanick
type can be made with practically no flat surfaces
and with two axes of symmetry. Internal pres-
sures do not seriously deform this design, but ex-
ternal strains may cause minor troubles. Throttle
valves and marine stop valves are usually of this
type and can be kept tight at 750 deg. It is prob-
able that a temperature of 1100 deg. could be safely
undertaken with these valves if special precautions
were used in the design of the seat, disk, and stem.
Flexible-disk, double-beat valves are used in Europe
at temperatures in excess of 750 deg.
Gate valves have only one axis of symmetry and
flat surfaces of considerable size. Here seat and
disk troubles are encountered at temperatures above
700 deg., and it may be some time before the manu-
facturers can guarantee a tight job at the higher
temperatures. This type of valve is peculiarly
sensitive to outside strains tending to deform the
seats and disk.
(e) Turbine High-Pressure Ends. Pressures can
make little difference here as the high-pressure
parts are comparatively small and without doubt
the pressure will be reduced 50 per cent in the first
nozzle. There need be no high-pressure stuffing
box, so that the highest pressure to be packed
against will be about half the maximum. The tem-
perature strains will be the only thing that need be
considered, and the expansion will reduce the super-
heat in the first-stage nozzle to a workable value,
which is 750-850 deg. It is to be noted that steam-
chest or nozzle-box troubles have been the only
prominent troubles where 400 Ib. and 750 deg.
superheat have been tried out, and it thus appears
that a proper design will obviate most of the trou-
ble. Cast or forged steel must be the material used.
In general, the turbine designers say that 1200-

1500 Ib. pressure has no terrors for them and can
be used when desired. They can supply the ap-
paratus. Temperatures are more troublesome and
no one apparently cares to go much above 700-750
deg. at the present time. Superheater and valve
materials at present seem to be the deciding factor
in the use of high pressures and temperatures, and
there is apparent!v very little which careful design
and the selection of proper materials will not over-
come.
Only a portion of the central-station installation
is affected by high pressures and temperatures,
especially where electric auxiliaries are used. The
boiler and piping system and prime mover cover
the entire list, and in the usual central station this
has represented about 40 per cent of the entire in-
stallation cost. Latterly, with the larger station
the percentage is around 30, and may be taken at
25 per cent for the newer and larger stations of
which Hell Gate and Calumet are types. If the
&gt;tati(&gt;n cost be taken at $100.00 per kw. as an aver-
age figure this portion of the installation has cost
$25.00, and at 15 per cent the fixed charges are $3.75
per year or on 5000 hours' use 0.07 cent per kw-hr.
What, then, will be the extra cost of this apparatus
when designed for higher pressures and tempera-
tures? Standard boilers today can be bought up
to 275 Ib. pressure; 300 Ib. necessitates thicker
plates and tubes, and prices advance accordingly.
400-lb. boilers have been purchased recently and
500-lb. boilers have been built. Flash boilers of the
Serpollet and De Laval types using pressures in
excess of 1200 Ib. and coil boilers of the Herreshoff
type using equally high pressures have been built
as experiments or in toy sizes as for automobile
work or for high-speed launches. Schmidt's water-
tube boiler working at 900 Ib. has been run 14,000
hours with marked success. Boilers for 400 Ib.
pressure have been offered at about 50 per cent in-
crease in price and 1200-lb. boilers have been fig-
ured at a 100 per cent increase in price.
Turbine designers are at work on designs ar-
ranged to utilize higher pressures, but higher tem-
peratures seem more troublesome to them. I have
no estimate, but we can safely apply the same per-
centage increases of price to the turbine that obtain
with the boiler. Steam piping decreases in size
with increasing pressure, so much so that it is
doubtful if a 1200-lb. steam line would cost more
than a 200-lb. line of the same capacity. The vol-
ume of high-pressure steam at 1100 deg. maximum
temperature is quite uncertain, but the chances are
that our figures are not more than 10 per cent from
the truth.
Summary
We may then summarize as follows:
a Pressures up to 1200-1500 Ib. at least are com-
mercial and may be attained without serious dif-
ficulty.
b Temperatures for the present are commercial
up to 700-750 deg., which should not be exceeded
until our materials for valves and superheaters are
improved. More extended experience is necessary
before the range of 800 deg. and over is attempted
in a commercial installation.
c With the completion of the Steam Table
Research it will be possible to calculate accurately
just where the possible limits of economy in pres-
sure and temperatures may be located. At the
present time the uncertainty of all values above
200 Ib. pressure and 4000 deg. fahr. temperature
render most of our calculations of only academit-
value.
d There still appears to be more economy in a
closer study of operation and construction losses
resulting in improving the efficiency of central sta-
tions installed in accordance with the present ac-
cepted canons of design—than in the attempt to
widely increase the temperature range of our heat
cycles. While we may save 400 B.t.u. per kw-hr.
by using a regenerative cycle and increasing pres-
sure and temperature, it should be possible to save
nearly as much by a reduction to the lowest limits
of the heat losses which we know exist in our pres-
ent installations.
Savings of Regenerative Cycle
In Table 3 we have given for 700 and 1000 deg.
maximum temperature and for four pressures the
theoretical efficiency of the three cycles used, the
practical efficiency of the Rankine and regenerative
cycles, and the savings per kilowatt-hour for all
conditions over the Rankine cycle at 200 Ib. and
700 deg. maximum temperature in B.t.u. and Ib. of
coal of 13,800 B.t.u. content.
In Fig. 2 these savings are plotted in cents per
kilowatt-hour on the basis of $6.00 coal, together

SHOEING A CAR WITH Low PRESSURE AIR
By J. E. HALE
Manager of Development, Firestone Tire $ Rubber Co.
THE automobile industry is now in its third
great development in pneumatic tire construc-
tion.
The first tires were constructed with small, stiff
carcasses which naturally called for high air pres-
sures. Their shortcomings are still remembered
to say nothing of the multitude of sizes and the
struggle for ascendency between the clincher type
and those with stiff beads, called straight sides.
The employment of cord fabric in carcass con-
struction was the second step in pneumatic tire
structure. By virtue of this change, together with
the realization of the importance of more ample
sections, tire mileages were greatly increased, writh
a corresponding reduction in cost. There was not
only a mileage increase, but the tires were much
more reliable and not subject to such exasperating
failures.
With practically the consummation of improve-
ments that have been under development for sev-
eral years, the third step is entered upon. In this
move we take advantage of the cord construction
which has proved its durability and reliability, com-
bine this with a much larger section and thinner
wall and make it possible to ride on low pressure
air for the protection of the car and greater com-
fort of the passengers, and this without sacrificing
in economy.
How the Idea Started
Someone has facetiously said that Goldberg, the
cartoonist, in portraying doughnuts for wheels in
his pictures was the originator of the idea. He
depicted large section tires truly enough, but the
large section is not necessarily the whole story.
On the other hand, many an automobile owner of
his own volition, has allowed his tires to be run
under-inflated for his own personal comfort, ex-
plaining in a casual way that he did not intend to
be shaken to pieces by the air pressures which the
tire companies recommended, and that he was will-
ing to sacrifice tire economy if necessary to secure
this greater comfort, that is, he wanted to ride on
low pressure air. Also a few cases are known
where six-inch or seven-inch thick walled pneumatic
truck tires and truck rims have been applied to
passenger cars and run at low pressure, notably
by tire experimenters; presumably more in the
nature of a stunt, since it does not appear that thev
had any serious thought of pushing the idea for
actual commercial application to passenger cars.
The newest development, the balloon tire, is the
result of the public demand to make riding on low
pressure air possible, and it was the natural conse-
quence of a strong conviction on the writer's part
that there ought to be a way to accomplish it that
led the Firestone Company to be the first to take
the bold step in going to an extreme and providing
carcass flexibility, and a section size sufficient to
give a larger area of contact.
Simple Fundamentals
The fundamentals of the balloon tire are com-
paratively simple. If we are to have greater cush-
ioning for comfort and protection against vibra-
tions of the car, the combination of low air pressure
and large area of contact must be provided, and by
employing such tire constructions that the tire dura-
bility may not be impaired. The goal aimed at was
to increase the area of contact sufficiently so that
air pressures ranging from 20 to 35 pounds could
be employed in actual practice.
In a general way the contact area of the tread
with the road expressed in square inches multiplied
by the internal air pressure will give a figure which
approximates the load resting on the tire. This is
as it should be. It is evident that if a 1,000-pound
load is to be imposed on the tire, and due to the
limitation in the amount of vertical deflection not
more than 20 square inches of contact can be
obtained, it will require 50 pounds of air to carry
the load. If, however, we can devise some way of
increasing the area and still not exceed the proper
degree of deflection, for instance if we can increase
the area to 50 square inches, it will require very
much less pressure, and in this case only 20 pounds
to carry the same l»ad.
One of the fundamental conditions of conserva-
tive tire use which we recognize is the limitation of
the actual vertical deflection of the tire expressed
in a percentage relation of the sectional diameter.
It has been found that if this percentage of deflec-
tion is exceeded, the tires are likely to fail prema-
turely from two causes: First, tread separation
and ply separation are likely to be excessive;
second, the flexing localizes half way up the side-
wall and may cause fabric failure on the inside
plies. It can be readily appreciated that in the case
of a thick walled tire, the destructive effect of this
flexing will be much more pronounced than in the
case of a thin walled tire. But if we use low pres-
sure air, the bursting stresses on the carcass are


January, 1925
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
low enough so that only a few plies are necessary,
and this in turn makes it possible to increase the
deflection percentage.
What Balloon Tires Do for the Car
It is almost impossible to choose descriptive
phraseology to drive home the wonderful effect that
balloon tires have on the riding of the car. The
first reaction to the occupants is the greater degree
rough road can usually be taken at the same speed
as the pavement. Another important factor is that
on rough roads, particularly in the country, the
balloon tires smooth out the road so that a sub-
stantially higher average speed is practical.
Saves Chassis Mechanism
Of equal importance to improving the degree of
comfort is the effect on the mechanism and bodv
BALLOON TIRES IN SEhVICE
The angle of flexture of the walls in these tires is not
as great for a given deflection of the tread as in the case
of the carcass of smaller section. The thinner walls induce
less internal shear and friction for a given degree of flex-
ture.
of comfort. Road surface irregularities are toned
down and in most cases are obliterated. Of course,
the ups and downs in the road are still there and
the car goes up and down with them, but every-
thing is cushioned so that there are no sharp shocks
or jolts, and one does not have to watch the road
to put his body in a tense condition to get over the
rough places, nor be worried about being tossed
up from the seat, and furthermore the driver does
not have to pick out all the good places in a rough
road because it makes little or no difference whether
he takes them in or not.
Of extreme convenience is the fact that in subur-
ban driving, where it is necessary to go off the
pavement, one does not have to take any special
precaution to slacken speed, because the average
of the car itself. So far no way has presented itself
of making exact comparisons of the effect of low
pressure air in preserving the car from developing
rattles, creaks and mechanical depreciation, but
there is no question about its being a tremendous
factor, and all because of the fact that everything
is cushioned. Compared with high pressure pneu-
matics, the sharpness of the shrxrks is very efffect-
ively softened. By way of example, one of Fire-
stone's new test cars has been running on 6.20 in.
balloon tires with about 20 to 25 pounds of air; for
the purpose of comparison, four-inch regular pneu-
matic tires with the proper inflation of 50 pounds
of air were substituted. As a result of this, rattles
appeared which the test car driver had never
observed before; in fact with balloon equipment


Page 23
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
he said there were no rattles which made a notice-
able contrast considering the same car on regular
high pressure pneumatics.
Effects on the Operation of the Car
There seems to be a definite list of questions
which arise in the minds of both the car designers
and the public regarding the application of balloon
tires and their effects on car operation. Naturally
we have taken all these questions very seriously
because it would manifestly be unwise to proceed
with any development work on a line of tires which
have no prospect of being commercially applicable.
We are able to state that we have reasonable
answers for all of the practical operating aspects
which come up.
Of questions on the various phrases of practical
car operation, probably the most frequent is fuel
consumption. In general, balloon tires consume
no more nor no less fuel than the high pressure
pneumatics. On actual fuel consumption, a number
of private owners have found that by keeping track
of the fuel used they noticed a slightly greater
mileage per gallon with low pressure tires. Our
most authoritative information, however, is our
observations on six taxi cabs running a total of
20,000 miles during a month on 7.30 inch balloon
tires averaging 13.5 miles per gallon. This com-
pared with 12.6 miles per gallon for a larger num-
ber of similar cabs covering many times that mile-
age on 33x45/2 inch six-ply tires with 70 pounds of
air.
From the point of view of fuel economy, as far
as tire technique is concerned, it appears that in the
case of the regular pneumatic tires with a smaller
tread contact, it is the internal carcass friction
rather than the tread rolling resistance which ab-
sorbs energy. On the other hand, in the case of
balloon tires, the carcass being so thin as to have
practically negligible carcass friction, the large area
of contact occasions a much greater degree of road
friction than in the case of the regular pneumatic
tires, and it is probably that these effects in the
two classes of tires would just about balance each
other.
With low pressure tires, many tests show that a
car coasts 'just as freely and accelerates practically
the same as with high pressure pneumatic tires.
As to Speed and Steering
The question has been raised as to whether with
balloon tires the top speed will be cut down; that
is, speeds from 60 miles per hour and up. While
evidence is not positive, indications are that there
may be a very slight difference. Very likely any
appreciable slackening of these higher speeds can
be attributed to windage resistance of the tire. Un-
questionably tires with such large section covered
\vith non-skid projections would make this a notable
factor.
The next question frequently raised is how the
steering is affected. This is perfectly natural, be-
cause most drivers have discovered that when their
front tires are soft, there is a slightly increased
resistance in steering. From laboratory tests we
have found the area of contact of balloon tires with
the road surface to be about twice that of the high
pressure pneumatics, and under these conditions
one can detect a slight difference in turning the
wheel. In ordinary driving, this effect is of such
minor consequence that it cannot be considered a
serious handicap. We do find, however, that when
the car is in close quarters parked by a curb, it is
somewhat more difficult to pull the wheels around
when the car has little or no headway. In some
cases the larger tires actually favor the steering.
For instance, on streets with trolley lines, the front
wheels are not deflected at all in making a cross-
'over from one side of the street to the other, even
though the angle at which the car makes the cross-
ing over the rails be the next thing to parallel driv-
ing.
Another favorable feature is when dropping into
chuck holes or off the edge of the pavement, the
reaction tending to deflect the car is much less pro-
nounced. In fact, in the latter case the control is
infinitely better in regaining the pavement. Recog-
nizing the demand for balloon tires, car manufac-
turers have now designed reduction gears in the
steering apparatus, affecting proper clearance.
Traction and Braking
The traction and braking control of the car in
driving is probably of equal importance with fuel
consumption and ease of steering. We have not
yet found any way to make comparative measure-
ments of this effect,-but can report the writer's ex-
perience which checks with every other user of the
properly designed balloon tires. On wet pavements
(with the brakes properly equalized) we have tried
every way that we could think of to make the car
skid, but so far the only thing which happens is
that the car stops. By this we mean to convey the
idea that in the most ticklish traffic, we have no
fear about what we can do in an emergency. The
large area of contact combined with the greatly in-
creased lineal total of non-skids edges which gives
a squeegee effect is undoubtedly the combination
which gives such excellent non-skid results.
In contrast to wood block or asphalt are cases
of uneven pavement surfaces where the actual area
and button edge contact is cut down by the road
surface irregularities. In the case of low pressure
tires, the area is so large and the carcass so flexible
that it folds and rolls over the dips and hollows
in the road surface so as to maintain a uniformly
large area of contact at all times. This is not so
in the case of high pressure tires which are inflated


January, 192f
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
so hard that they lose a good deal of their contact,
with the result that balloon tires hold much better
on rough pavements.
On snow and ice the control of the car with low
pressure tires is noticeably better than with high
pressure pneumatics. This particularly is true in
eliminating the tendency to skid sidewise in apply-
ing the brakes and making corners. In applying
the brakes for a quick stop, one has to be very cau-
tious lest the wheels become locked and should this
happen, the result is much the same as with the reg-
ular pneumatic tires.
As to Blowouts
Occasionally there is a question as to the danger
of a blowout running at speed with such light con-
struction tires. This has been answered on several
occasions by staging deliberate blowouts with what
we call the shot-gun test. This is carried out by
shooting a 34-inch hole into the carcass on either
one of the two front tires when going at 45 to 50
miles an hour. In every case where this was tried,
the driver suffered no embarrassment by the sud-
den loss of air in the carcass. In addition to this
experimental evidence, we can state that if there
were danger from this cause, we would have had
a reaction from users before this. This is not the
case, however, so that there is no question in our
minds as to the safety of this tire.
Control in Driving
Another feature of control in driving is the new
attitude on the part of the driver to the roadway
ahead of him, particularly if he drives much after
dark. He soon finds that where formerly as a mat-
ter of course he slowed down or steered for the
smoothest places in the street, this is not necessary
with low pressure tires. Of course, the very worst
chuck holes might be avoided, but the driver soon
learns that he need not slow up for rough spots, as
he can take them without slackening speed.
While it is apparent that the car may be driven
much faster over the average of the highways as
we find them with the almost complete elimination
of vibration, we wonder whether this higher aver-
age speed may not lead to more or less serious con-
sequences from another source. Tests totaling
8,000,000 tire miles indicate the extra speed will not
have any abnormal results on the car's power plant
or transmission particularly in making direct com-
parisons with tires on the old equipment, and it is
our opinion that the increased speed will amount
to somewhere between 10 and 30 per cent.
At the present time it appears that the amount
of gather or toe-in on the front wheels will have
to be very nicely adjusted to prevent the excessive
wear which appears with improper alignment. Our
observations point clearly to the fact that balloon
tires are more sensitive to improper alignment than
the high pressure pneumatics.
Durability and Cost of Tires
All our development work on balloon tires has
been carried out under actual road test conditions.
To date we have run a total of nearly 8,000,000 tire
miles under test observations, and evidence points
to average mileages at least as high as those en-
joyed with regular pneumatic tires.
To show the phenomenal endurance built into
balloon tires, it is interesting to know that during
the past eleven months, only one Firestone balloon
tire out of every 5,000 built has been returned for
adjustment due to defects. No case of tread or ply-
separation has been received during the entire year
—this is a common cause of high pressure tire fail-
ures. Not a single case of bead failure has occurred
during the entire year. Freedom from failures due
to these causes is a remarkable step in tire con-
struction, and means much to the motorist in satis-
faction and economy.
Ninety-nine per cent of the number of balloon
tires which car owners have brought into our
branches during the past year for inspection or
adjustment claim, have been injured due to under-
inflation—either bruise-breaks (caused by top of
tire being crushed down against the rim), or un-
even front tread wear. On bruise-breaks, we usually
repair them for the car owner at cost. On tread
wear, even though it frequently presents a poor ap-
pearance, the tread has many miles of service still
in it, and this uneven wear, due to under-inflation,
generally arouses the car owner and he pays more
attention to his air pressures when he knows the
penalty of carelessness.
The ruggedness of the carcass to stand punish-
ment, rough going and all that sort of thing, while
questioned almost universally at the introduction of
the balloon tire, is not so much of an educational
problem at the present time. However, there is a
certain portion of the public which will insist the
tires are too frail to stand up and be thoroughly
reliable. We have some very interesting figures
bearing on this subject drawn from our taxicab ex-
perience in Chicago. Comparing balloon tire
equipped cabs with high pressure equipped cabs in
the same service, we find that the cabs with balloon
tires had only about half as many flat tires as those
equipped with high pressure tires. This wsa taken
on a strictly pro rata basis.
Here is another convincing argument. We have
pointed out that one of the fundamental ideas of
balloon tires was to employ only four piles so that
we could more completely realize the perfect cush-
ioning quality of the air and have no interference
from the stiffness of a heavier carcass. Bear in
mind that where four-ply balloon tires are used, 35
pounds is the maximum pressure recommended.
Yet these four-ply carcasses are strong enough tc
hold 230 pounds in the larger sizes and up to 350


Page 25
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
pounds in the smaller sizes. Xow since the air
carries the load and the tire serves merely as a con-
tainer for this air. it surely is not necessary to put
any more plies in the carcass, because it would take
eight or ten times as much pressure to hurst it is
is ordinarily used.
EFFECT OF UNDER INFLATION OF BALLOON TIRES
These tires run 6569 miles on front wheels of a test car.
Tire "A" run at 5 pounds under-inflation and show badly
scuffed and worn condition. Tire "B" run at full pressure
(30 pounds) and shows a treand that is very slightly but
evenly worn.
Regarding the puncture hazard, \ve suppose it is
only second nature for a car owner to raise this
question regarding any new type of pneumatic tire
which comes to his attention. We have had no dif-
ficulty in handling this for the simple reason that
we have come to the conclusion from our very ex-
tended experience that the puncture hazard does not
compare unfavorably with the high pressure tires.
We will admit that on a few occasions we have
heard some very loud complaints from certain indi-
viduals relating their experience with punctures in
balloon tires. A check into each of these cases
resolved itself into the question of luck; everybody
knows that with high pressure tires a car owner will
occasionally have a run of rotten luck and punc-
tures. There is no question in my mind but that
the same thing pertains to balloon tires, and we
want to report that, having sold approximately
1,000,000 balloon tires to date, the puncture com-
plaints coming back to us are positively no greater
than with the high pressure tires.
Importance of Correct Inflation
From the foregoing you can see that we predict
a rosy future for the balloon tire. However, this
optimism is tempered by the question of inflation
pressure. We have pointed out that it is the air
that carries the load in the tire. Now, if the air
isn't there, cither because it disappeared by slow
leak or because of neglect of the car owner to innate,
the tire cannot have a fair chance to give service
any more than a motor could be expected to give
satisfactory service without oil or gasoline.
We would like to have it definitely understood
that while we arc dwelling on air pressure problems
for balloon tires, we really are just as much con-
cerned over all kinds of pneumatic tires. It hap-
pens, that in the case of the balloon equipment
many car owners have the idea that because they
are designed to run soft and because the pressure
is low, the tires will not lose air to the degree they
would with the pressure high. So consequently
they do not check them up often. Now as a mat-
ter of fact, we find that where there is a slow leak,
the loss of air is substantially as rapid as it is with
the high pressure tire. This is not easy to explain,
so in order to take every precaution, we admonish
everybody to be sure that the valve insides are in
perfect condition, and to screw the valve cap on
tight as an additional seal against any possible leak
from this source. Remember that a loss of two or
three pounds at the balloon tire pressure represents
a loss of 10 per cent which is a considerable factor.
That the type of balloon tire as reflected in the
Firestone full-size gum-dipped casing is come to
.stay is seen in the fact that nearly 1,000,000 have
already been purchased by car owners while nearly
40 automobile manufacturers make them standard
equipment. They are now optional equipment on
practically all makes of automobiles.
HIGH PRESSURE AND SUPERHEAT
(Continued from Page 20)
the figure are two curves showing the percentage
increase in cost of boiler and turbine and the
decrease in size of pipe required for a given quan-
tity of steam. It will be seen that the extra fixed
charges are always greater than the coal saving
for the Rankine cycle (ordinary operation) at 700
deg. maximum temperature, and that the additional
gain for the 1000 deg. maximum temperature barely
exceeds the additional fixed charges. We cannot
then expect much from increasing pressures and
the ordinary methods of using steam. Increasing
temperatures help to some extent, but not enough
to be attractive, since the saving is nearly all used
up by the additional fixed charges.
With the regenerative cycle the results are much
better and useful savings are indicated, increasing
considerably with pressure and slightly with tem-
perature. It is evident that some such regenerative
cycle must be used, but the rewards from increas-
ing temperature are not commensurate with the
costs. Many regenerative cycles are possible, but
the one used shows nearly the maximum economy.
Such cycles need many heat interchanges and a
number of separate feed pumps for the close ap-
proach to theoretical figures. Indeed, Thurston
and Stanwood in 1899 pointed out that with an
infinity of heaters and pumps the Carnot efficiency
might be equaled. So far, however, four or five
stages have been the ultimate practical application,
and not more than three have stood the commer-
ied on page 28)

to give the other current. After careful study it
was found that a combination unit could be built
that would give either or both currents and these
special generators were installed. Each generator
will develop 1000 kw. d.c. and 800 kva. a.c.
Flat Rock, Michigan
A very low-head plant is illustrated in the devel-
opment made for Ford Motor Companv on the
Huron River at Flat Reck, Michigan.
This station replaced an old, low-head mill devel-
opment. The station has propeller type water
wheels, similar to those at Green Island. Each
wheel is designed to generate 500 h.p. under 7l/2 ft.
head and will generate power at normal speed when
operating under a head as low as 4 ft.
The siphonic scroll case was used here also.
The use of this type permits the location of the
floor of the generator room well above flood level
without making the substructure too expensive.
The trash rack spacing for this station is 8 inches
center to center of the bars instead of 1J4 or \l/2
inches that would have to be used with the typical
reaction type of runner.
The draft tube is a White Hydraucone, similar
to the one at Green Island.
The control of the turbine and generators is
designed to be completely automatic, the units oper-
ating to utilize the flow of the river to the best
advantage. Each unit is controlled by its individual
float located in the headwater and which may be
independently adjusted to the most suitable ranges
of head.
The sequence of operation on each unit is as fol-
lows:
When the forebay level rises to the predeter-
mined level the governor oil pump motor is started
by a float switch. When the operating pressure
has been built up in the oil pressure tank, an elec-
tric solenoid puts the governor into operation, open-
ing up the gates and the wheel comes up to speed.
An automatic voltage regulator adjusts the machine
voltage by means of a motor operated field rheostat
and relays operate to close the circuit breakers when
the generator develops the proper voltage and polar-
ity. A variable resistance operated by the head-
water float adjusts the generator load in proportion
to the available head. Should the headwater drop
down to the predetermined level the unit is auto-
matically shut down.
Each unit has protective devices to shut down
the unit in case dangerous abnormal conditions
develop. Overspeed devices, reverse current relays,
or bearing thermostats, automatically shut down the
unit and lock it out until the relays have been reset
by an operator. The machine voltage is automatic-
ally reduced during overloads of short duration but
under severe continued overload the unit is shut
down until normal conditions are restored.
Iron Mountain, Michigan
A station using the same type of wheel as the
Keokuk wheels but with a more recent type of draft
tube is shown by the Iron Mountain station built
for the Ford Motor Company.
The station differs from Green Island and Flat
Rock in that the dam and power station are car-
ried on piles driven in a gravel, clay and sand bot-
tom instead of on a rock foundation. The draft
tube is of plate steel of a straight flaring type in-
stead of the elbow type used at Keokuk. The head
at this plant is 30 ft. and each wheel is designed
to develop 3200 h.p. at point of best efficiency.
The Francis type runner was chosen as one or
more of the units will operate at part gate a large
proportion of the time and this type of unit gives
a higher efficiency at part gate than can be obtained
from the propeller type unit. One of the units
was tested for efficiency of the water wheel and
91.0 per cent was obtained at the best point. The
efficiency at all gates was well above the guaran-
tee of the manufacturer.
Twin Cities, Minnesota
A station in which an existing substructure deter-
mined the type of setting is shown by the Twin
Cities station, designed and built for Ford Motor
Company, on the Mississippi River between St.
Paul and Minneapolis.
This station was built on a substructure pro-
vided by the United States in connection with the
navigation structures built in the Mississippi River
to make the river navigable up to Minneapolis.
When this foundation was built in 1917, it was
designed to suit either vertical or horizontal units
of the double-runner type. Today most installa-
tions are of the single runner type, and to fit the
foundations to an installation of the largest pos-
sible economical unit it was necessary to cut out
about 3000 cu. yds. of concrete from the old sub-
structure. The draft tube is of the elbow type and
it was found to be uneconomical to replace this by
a more modern type although some of the hydraulic
equipment manufacturers asked for such a change
in their proposals. The wheels are of the Francis
type, similar to those at Iron Mountain. An ef-
ficiency test on one of the units showed a maxi-
mum water wheel efficiency of 90.7 per cent even
with the older type curved draft tube.
Examination of the features of these various low-
head plants, as well as other recent developments,
shows that many of the improvements are still in
the unperfected stage but that they are all tending
toward higher efficiencies of units, more simple
and more compact types of construction and addi-
tion of automatic devices to reduce the operation
expense.

of The Michigan Technic. The theme is the North

LIGHTNING
(Continued from 1'age 16)
These researches show that a man standing di-
rectly under the storm center would be hit fifteen
times out of a hundred strokes, while a man flat on
the ground would be struck about once in one hun-
dred strokes. A 25 foot building would be struck
every time. The chance of a thunder cloud of suf-
ficient voltage to cause a discharge being over any
particular object is small. The chance of any par-
ticular object being struck is thus generally very
small indeed.
The lightning rod seems to be of real value for
the protection of buildings. Except for buildings
in exposed positions or in special cases, as maga-
zines, the cost of a rod unless it is quite low, is
not warranted from the standpoint of the cost of
insurance.
Under certain conditions lightning may cause
sparks within metal tanks.

papers aganst interruption of news surface by the
breakdown of present telegraph lines, if indeed they
did not find it a better and faster means of exchang-
ing news with each other; as well as service to
papers which have no broadcast station but install
a radio-photo-news-receiving camera.
Transmitting messages by reducing the words to
letters and each letter to dots-and-dashes, and at
the receiving end decoding these dots-and-dashes
into letters and words, right enough in 1840, seems
terribly antiquated today. Photography is the most
rapid means of copying anything, and radio the
swiftest in travel. The two have been combined
to give a better means of communication.
Radio messages in facsimile of handwriting, sig-
nature and explanatory sketch not only can be sent
in speed competition with the dot-and-dash tele-
graph, but they have unusual tactical value to the
Navy and Army, for this is the only method of radio
communication which may carry its own authenti-
fication by the addition of the autographic signature
of the sender.
In all schemes for sending photos by wire with
cylinder machines, the picture is traversed in a
spiral line until the whole surface is covered. But
from a line picture a good half-tone plate for use
in a newspaper cannot be made with the regular
half-tone equipment. Efforts have, therefore, been
directed toward a radio-photograph in which no
lines would appear. By the use of the prismatic
ring, success has been attained. Not only can good
half-tone plates be made from these photographs,
but art work can be done upon them to make the
photo more contrasty in parts, if so needed for news-
paper illustration.
A stationary picture surface is employed with the
prismatic plates and the pictures are made by mov-
ing a pencil of light over the picture very much
like the artist does when he tacks a paper to an
easel, and works with his crayon. With the cylin-
der scheme the pencil is held stationary, the pic-
ture surface moving under it. It is in this way that
the light values of a "still" photograph are converted
into electrical values at the broadcasting station;
and at the receiving station changed back again into
picture characteristics, a faithful copy of the original
distant photograph. As animated pictures differ
from "still" pictures only in the speed of presenta-
tion, it is obvious that having attained a high quality
in photographs by radio, then, to get radio vision,
speed is the only remaining problem to be solved.
The solution of the speed problem was attained
by substituting for the "fast" plates of the prismatic-
photo machines, a rotating disc, carrying a plurality
of like lenses, to draw the lines.
The lens disc is located in front of the same
"slow" plates used in the radio-photo machines, and
is properly geared to these prismatic plates to give
the required number of lines per inch of picture sur-
face. The mechanism is then speeded up until the
• pictures are reproduced, on a ground glass screen in
the receiving machine at a rate of ten pictures per
second.
It has been found that ten pictures per second
in a radio vision machine, which has no light-inter-
rupting shutter, gives as smooth continuity as the
usual sixteen pictures per second of the theatre mo-
tion picture projector where a 50-50 shutter cuts off
the light half the time. This is because persistence
of vision is not the result of frequency of retinal im-
pression alone, but of frequency and light intensity
combined. If you doubt it, glance just once at the
noon-day sun.
The telescope enables us to see to great distances,
but (mly along straight lines; and as straight lines
only lead away off into space, the telescope is lim-
ited to a study of the stars. However radio vision
enables one to see along curved lines. Therefore,
one may see around obstructions, over mountains,
perhaps ultimately around the earth. Radio vision

is right now a matter of daily laboratory demon-
strations.
From the very nature of the invention it would
seem that in the homes radio vision would ultimate-
ly find its greatest usefulness, for not only would
pictures for news and for entertainment be received,
but music as well. An entire opera might thus be
enjoyed through both ear and eye, as all the family,
old and young, listens in and looks on amid the com-
forts of the home fireside.
The latter feature is a new achievement which
permits sending two or more messages from the
same broadcast station on a single wave length, the
picture at radio frequencies, and the music at audio
frequencies; to be received on the same receiving
set tuned to this single radio frequency, the attach-
ment for both vision and music costing less than the
radio set; all to the entertainment and delight of a
million boys and girls on the farms of America, un-
hindered by muddy roads or snow blockades.

SLAUGHTER MAKES ALL
AMERICAN
\Vhile this is no longer a piece of news we do
not hesitate to say that without some recognition
of this tribute paid to one of our fellow engineers,
this issue of the Technic would not be complete.
So in behalf of the students of the colleges of en-
gineering and architecture, we wish to express our
congratulations and gratitude to "Butch". These
honors are not attained without some degree of
sacrifice and hard work for which he has our sin-
cere respect.
The qualities that make him the man and player
he is are well expressed by Walter Camp, that
famous critic of the favorite college game.
"Slaughter of Michigan is a veteran guard who has
always towered up in any line of forwards. A big
man but extremely active, and with an experience
invaluable in this position, he provides the pivotal
spot upon which a line-plunger attack may rest and
he is never shoved back upon his runner. More-
over, on defense he is never guilty of "knifing
through"—a tendency which seems to make many
another otherwise star guard a risky bulwark.
Slaughter has unlimited endurance."
WORDS OF WISDOM
1 confess that in my experience with young
men, the capacity that I have found least often
is the capacity to be accurate.
I have set greater store by the discovery
that I could absolutely depend upon what a
man said than I have ever set by anything that
his friends may say, who are not in close con-
tact with him and in a position to observe his
daily work.

speakers in turn. Charles Hulswit greeted the new
men and Fred Goellner acknowledged the welcome.
From among the theses written by the initiates,
that of Robert Minard was adjudged best and hence
was read before the group. Prof. H. H. Higbic
gave the address of the evening.

American Society of Mechanical Engineers
The student branch of the A. S. M. E. has as
its greatest function the organization of the mechan-
icals in a professional way and allying its members
with the larger society.
On December third a get-going meeting was
held. This was enthusiastically supported by a
large majority of the membership which now totals
forty-five. Prof. Fessenden, the Honorary Chair-
man of the group, related the possibilities that an
active organization might accomplish and explained
the connection to the parent society. Faculty mem-
bers expressed their interest and urged the men to
present original papers on current topics.
The society sponsored the showing of the film,
"Oxy-Welding and Cutting" with which Mr. H. H.
Griffith 12E, gave an interesting lecture that was
attended by sixty men.
The officers for the year are:
O. W. Reed President
L. F. Beach Vice President
F. L. Evert Secretary and Treasurer
Don Whitesell is charged with the membership
duties and Ralph Super prepares the programs.
Meetings of the A. S. M. E. are held every two
weeks alternating between those of technical and
social nature. Papers prepared by members will
be read before the society and discussions on va-
rious topics of interest are planned. Non-members
are urged to consider the benefits to be derived
from participation.
The Detroit section of the A. S. M. E. have
planned the following:
On January 29th, 1925, a meeting will be held
at the Detroit Board of Commerce at 8 P. M. At
this meeting Mr. Major Stout will present a paper
"Making Money With the Aeroplane" and Dr. Gcr-
hardt will give a paper on the technical side of
Aviation.
Sometime in March there will probably be a
meeting at which the Traffic Manager of the United
States Air Mail Service will exhibit a five reel mov-
ing picture showing the operation of the aeroplanes
used bv them.
The Student Branch of the A IE E
Mr. F. A. Fishback, Vice President and Secretary
of the Electric Controller &amp; Manufacturing Com-
pany of Cleveland, Ohio, gave an illustrated lec-
ture on "Controlling Electric Motors" in the East
Engineering Building, November 19, under the
auspices of the Student Branch of the American
Institute of Electrical Engineers. Slides shown
illustrated the methods of connecting automatic
starters in motor lines, and showed the great variety
of industrial applications to which these starters are
put.
On December 3 the Student Branch through the
courtesy of the Chicago, North Shore &amp; Milwaukee
Railroad showed a two-reel film which graphically
portrayed the operation of this electric railroad.
Two hundred fifty persons attended the showing
in the Natural Science Auditorium. A short busi-
ness meeting was held after the picture and plans
for future meetings were made.
Branch Chairman Goellncr has announced the
appointment of Norman C. Kolb as chairman of
the Research Committee, which will present a re-
port to the Branch upon "Engineering Education."
Other committee chairmen announced are: Mem-
bership, Stanley Strunk; Meetings and Programs,
Morris H. Lloyd; Publicity, James B. Johnson.
The Sullivan Exhibition
Of more than passing interest to the Architec-
tural College was the recent exhibition of the work
of Louis Henry Sullivan. It was an exhibit which
consisted of his decorative designs and which he
fondly terms his "Philosophy of Life."
Louis Sullivan was an advocate and disciple of
the theory of functional growth, and in these draw-
ings, which were masterpieces of the draftsman's
skill, he showed and expressed himself beautifully.
He starts with the seed as the basis of all design
and from it he develops his intricate and bewilder-
ing patterns and designs. These drawings treat the
geometric and the natural forms and develop them
from the simplest forms upward to the most com-
plex.
To say that these drawings arc intelligent or in-
structive would be farcial for there are only a
limited few who can even attempt to decipher them
and render them intelligent in words, and even
when Sullivan himself has explained them it is
difficult to follow his thought for his thought and
ideas and dreams are so far in advance of anything


Page 31
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
that has been shown to the world that we are sim-
ply unable to grasp them. Perhaps in time we shall
be able to appreciate them and to realize that here
was a dreamer who saw years in advance and who
lived and practiced his doctrines even though no
one agreed or sympathized with him.
As it is, we can not only look at the drawings
and be struck by their sheer beauty and admit that
as yet our intelligence is absolutely incapable of
comprehending that which is placed before us to
appreciate.
A. I. Ch. E. Convention
The University of Michigan was well represented
at the recent meeting of the A. I. Ch. E. held in
1'ittsburg December 3-6. Those who attended were
Prof. A. H. White. Prof. W. L. Badger, Prof. G. G.
Brown, Mark rluck, president of the local student
branch, and H, R. Poland, secretary and treasurer
of the local organization. It goes without saying
that everyone considered the trip well worth while.
The members were entertained by the Mellon In-
stitute of Industrial Research, who accomplished
their task exceedingly well. The meeting started
Wednesday morning with registration of members,
and reading of papers. In the afternoon there were
optional trips through Mellon Institute, University
of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Institute of Technology,
and the Bureau of Mines. Wednesday night a very
entertaining play was presented by the dramatic
class of Carnegie Tech, which was followed by a
dance. Thursday morning was occupied by the
first business meeting, and the reading of additional
papers. In the afternoon the members had the
privilege of going through any one of the following
plants, Westinghouse Co., American Window Glass
Co., Carnegie Steel Co., Harbison-Walker Refrac-
tories Co., J. II. Heinz Co., and the Westinghouse
storage battery assembly plant. Thursday night
C. L. Reese, president of the institute, gave a talk
on his twenty-five years experience in the explo-
sives industry, and Dr. Mees, of the Eastman Kodak
Co., delivered a very interesting lecture on amateur
cinematography. On Friday an all day trip was
scheduled through the coke plant of the Carnegie
Steel Co., the American Steel and Wire Co., and a
sulphuric acid plant. On Saturday, the final day
of the convention, the second business session of
the convention was held, and the final papers were
read.
In recalling the convention, the pleasantries
eome first to mind but the real value of the meet-
ing was the association with and hearing some of
the leading men of the Chemical Engineering world
of activities. The inspection trips proved of great
value in view of the pains and effort made to satis-
fy every question raised in the minds of the mem-
bers.
Morrison Joins Division of Highway
Engineering
Roger L. Morrison was appointed Associate Pro-
fessor of Highway Engineering at the June meet-
ing of the Board of Regents and has recently been
appointed Director of the State Highway Labora-
tory which is located in the East Engineering Build-
ing, by State Highway Commissioner Frank F.
Rogers.
Professor Morrison received the degrees of A. B.,
B. S. and C. E. from the University of Illinois and
the Master's degree under Professor Blanchard
when he was in charge of the Graduate Courses in
Highway Engineering at Columbia University.
For four years, Professor Morrison was con-
nected with the Engineering and Construction De-
partments of the Southern Pacific Railway and the
Western Pacific Railway.
In the field of highway engineering, he has been
connected with the Illinois State Highway Depart-
ment, United Gas Improvement Company of Phil-
adelphia as Road Superintendent and Sales En-
gineer; with Brazos County, Texas, as Consulting
Highway Engineer; and with the Pittsburg Test-
ing Laboratory as Engineer of Tests in charge of
cement inspection in southern mills, tests of high-
way materials, and pavement construction in the
southern states.
Professor Morrison's teaching experience con-
sists of serving as Instructor in Civil Engineering
at the University of Tennessee for one year and as
Professor of Highway Engineering at the A. and M.
College of Texas for five years.
From 1921 until his appointment to the faculty
of the University of Michigan, he was treasurer and
general manager of the Concrete Products Com-
pany of Birmingham, Alabama.
Professor Morrison is a full member of the Amer-
ican Society of Civil Engineers and a member of the
Concrete Institute and the Permanent International
Association of Road Congresses.
Prof. Blanchard Re-elected Head of Highway
Traffic Body
Prof. A. H. Blanchard was re-elected president
of the National Highway Traffic Association at its
annual meeting in New York City on December 2,
1924. In retaining Prof. Blanchard they have as
their leader who is one of the foremost in his field
and one who has built up our Highway Engineer-
ing Department to such a degree that it is second
to none in the country.
The convention was divided up into two sessions,
afternoon and evening. Among the addresses given
in the afternoon were: "Pedestrian Subways Un-
der State Highways", by G. C. Dillman, Deputy
Commissioner Chief Engineer of Michigan State


January, 792)
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Highway Department and "State Fees for Com-
mercial Motor Vehicle Private and Common Car-
riers", by Prof. Blanchard. In the evening there
was a discussion headed by Prof. Morrison of our
Highway Department, on the subject of "Solutions
of the Parking Problems in Congested Municipali-
ties".
Meeting of American Physical Society
The University of Michigan was honored in
November by the presence of many eminent and
active physicists from all parts of the United States.
A special feature of the meeting was the inspection
of the New Physics Building, which is conceded to
be one &lt;&gt;f the best in the country and which was
fully described in the January, 1924, issue of The
Michigan Technic.
It is to these men that the science of Engineer-
ing is most indebted and on that account that we
owe our respect and attention to their valuable
•efforts.
The subjects of the papers read before this gath-
ering varied in nature from, "The Variation of
Young's Modulus with Temperature" and "X-Ray
Analysis of Certain Alloys" to "Half Quanta and
the Stability of Relativistic Orbits". We shudder
at the mere mention of the latter but who can tell
"how soon a means may be seen to find an applica-
tion for this in engineering.
Of special interest is the work of Dr. N. H.
Williams of the Physics Department, who, with Dr.
Hull of the General Electric Company has accom-
plished much in the past year in the study and meas-
urement of characteristics of the electron. They
have succeeded by an independent method to meas-
ure the electric charge of one of these infinitesimal
divisions of matter, and check their results closely
with those of Dr. Millikan of Chicago, whose work
In this connection won for him the Nobel Prize.
American Institute of Architects Convenes Here
An outstanding event of the past month in our
colleges was the regional conference of the Ameri-
can Institute of Architects which was held at Ann
Arbor and Detroit. The directors of the Institute
also met in Ann Arbor at about the same time. The
latter were guests of the Architectural Faculty at a
luncheon at the Barton Hills Country Club, while
the University was host to both delegates and direc-
tors. The delegates visited the buildings of the
University and saw something.of the current work
of the school. Unfortunately the London exhibit.
which contains the best works of the Architectural
students of the past two years, was not returned
'in time to display for this group.
A Better Physics Text
To those who have floundered about in the mix-
ture of text matter that has recently been used in
the teaching of engineering physics, the announce-
ment of a better text for the second semester wrork
will be of great consolation. Dr. Williams and sev-
eral others of the department have been bending
every effort to write a text that will appear in a
form similar to that of "Mechanics of Solids and
Fluids". Special emphasis on the fundamentals of
engineering value will be a welcome characteristic
of the new text.
Dean Patterson Granted Lsare of Absence
Dean Patterson's many friends will be interested
in knowing that he is leaving the Engineering Col-
lege for an extended trip abroad. He will visit the
principal countries in Europe and probably go to
Africa to take a journey down the Nile River valley
in Egypt. The Dean will spend seme time in
Greece, studying the classical architecture of some
of the older cities of that country. If time permits,
he will travel north into Norway- which country
has some of the finest technical schools in the coun-
try. The Dean's place will be filled by Secretary
Hopkins.

New Equipment for Mechanical Laboratory The
Jennings Hytor Vacuum Heating Pump
With the recent acquisition of a Jennings Hyton
Vacuum Heating Pump the research and testing
possibilities of the Mechanical Engineering labo-
ratory have been greatly enlarged. The equipment
consists of a size E. Jennings Hytor Pump mounted
on a cast iron bed plate with a General Electric 5
H.P. 230 volt, direct-connected, direct current, var-
iable speed motor, fitted with a starting and speed
controlling rheostat giving a speed range of 1100 to
2200 R.P.M. This motor is cradled in large, anti-
friction ball bearings and is provided with torque-
arm, thus creating an electric cradle-dynanometcr
constructed for this specific purpose. This is the
most accurate rapid and readily controllable method
of measuring the power input of any power driven
piece of equipment.
The vacuum system of heating is now being ex-
tensively used, especially in very large installations.
The conditions necessary for the operation of this
system are, to maintain a vacuum on the return
lines, continually remove the air and condensate and
continually return the condensate to the boilers.
All these are accomplished by the Jennings Hytor
Pump. The pump received by the university is
capable of handling a fifteen story office building; it
has a radiation surface capacity of approximately
65,000 square feet, an air capacity of 42 cubic feet
per minute, and a water capacity of 90 gallons per

minute at 180 degrees F. discharged against a pres-
sure of 10 pounds per square inch.
This Jennings Hytor Pump was obtained for
the engineering department chiefly through the
combined efforts of Mr. P. E. Brender, Mr. A. E.
Fisher and Mr. A. B. Singleton who were all instru-
mental in convincing the Nash Engineering Com-
pany of the desirability of such an installation and
the Mechanical Engineering Department is greatly
indebted both to these gentlemen and to the Xash
Engineering Company for the gift.
New Equipment In Automotive Laboratory
With the completion of an original testing stand
in the Automotive Laboratories, it is now possible
to duplicate road conditions and subject the entire
car or truck to same without the inconvenience of
having to use portable instruments for the observa-
tions. The device consists of an elevated stand on
which the car is driven and a moving road surface
in the form of a large wood-faced wheel. By vary-
ing the surface of the wheel the effects of asphalt,
brick, etc., can be obtained in the laboratory. Such
a device closely approaches road conditions inas-
much as it takes into consideration the power loss
between the crankshaft of the motor and the result-
ant kick exerted against the road. As is evident,
this takes in transmission loss and even slippage
loss of tire on road. The department is indebted
to the Timken Axle Company for its aid in the pro-
curing essential parts of the apparatus.
Other pieces of equipment which have been in-
stalled include a Chevrolet motor, to be replaced by
the makers on the appearance of each newer model
and a Jordan motor sectioned to make it valuable
for demonstrational purposes.
Work of the Heat Transfer Committee of the
National Research Council
Believing that the subject of heat transfer in its
various forms is one of vital interest to many
branches of engineering and yet one about which
we know comparatively little, the National Research
Council appointed a committee in the division of
uiginnering to consider this whole subject. That
the subject is a very broad one is indicated by the
interests of the engineers who were present at the
first meeting. This field is of interest to the
mechanical engineer, who not only wishes to trans-
fer heat from flue gases to the water in his boilers
or from steam into the water in his condensers,
but who is also interested in such forms of heat
transfer as feed water heaters, economizers, etc.
The refrigeration engineer is interested in the flow
of heat from brine to the primary gas in his refrig-
eration cycle, and then to the brine from the object
to be cooled. Another engineer very closely allied
to both of these is the maker of insulating materials,
whose interest ranges from coverings to be used in
cold rooms at temperatures below zero to insula-
tions used on furnaces at temperatures of several
thousand degrees Fahrenheit. The chemical en-
gineer is interested in heat transfer from the stand-
point of evaporating, heating, cooling, and a very
large number of processes, much of the time hand-
ling materials whose properties are not often
thought of in connection with heat transfer. The
electrical engineer is interested in the heat trans-
mission of the insulating materials which cover the
windings of his generators and transformers. The
architectural engineer is interested in the flow of
heat through building construction and in the flow
of heat from radiators or other heating devices to
the air of the room. Consequently, besides all the
persons above mentioned there were present manu-
facturers of power equipment, chemical engineer-
ing equipment, refrigeration machinery, lumber,
building tile, brick, (both common and refractory),
and many others.
A main committee has been formed which con-
sists of about fifty members representing practically
all of the above subjects. The actual business of
the committee is carried on bv a small executive
committee whose members are as follows: F. Paul
Anderson, director of the heating and ventilating
engineers' research laboratory operated in connec-
tion with the United States Bureau of Mines. \V.
L. Badger, Professor of Chemical Engineering, and
Director of Research for the Swenson Evaporator
Company of Harvey, Illinois; W. H. Carrier, presi-
dent of the Carrier Engineering Corporation, man-
ufacturers of dryers, air conditioning equipment,
etc.; Harvey N. Davis, Professor of Physics at Har-
vard and joint author with Professor Marks of the
well known Steam Tables; H. C. Dickinson, chief
of the heat division of the Bureau of Standards; H.
Harrison, with the Brunswick-Kroeschell Company,
makers of insulating materials; F. E. Matthews, a
consulting engineer specializing in refrigeration
problems; (icorge A. Orrok, chief engineer of the
New York Edison Company, primarily interested in
boiler and surface conditions design; \Vm. Sprara-
gen, executive secretary of the engineering division
of the National Research Council; T. S. Taylor,
chief physicist with the Westinghouse Electric and
Manufacturing Company; and A. J. Wood, Pro-
fessor of Mechanical Engineering at Pennsylvania
State College.
At present all the committee is trying to do is
to find out what we do know about heat transfer
and what fields should first be investigated. Four
sub-committees have been appointed; one on meth-
ods of temperature measurement, one on nomen-
clature, and two more important ones; one consid-

ering those cases where we wish to hinder the flow
of heat, such as the use of insulating materials of
all sorts, material used in building construction,
materials used for electrical insulation, etc.; and the
other considering those cases where we wish to in-
crease the flow of heat, which covers too wide a field
to detail. These two committees have been asked
to present summaries of the knowledge in their
respective fields, recommendations as to the prob-
lems needing immediate attention, estimates on the
cost of such research work and advice as to how
such work can be financed. The National Research
Council has no funds of its own for research work,
and in undertaking a program of this sort has to
raise the money from outside sources. It is ex-
pected that by the end of next year all of the pre-
liminary studies will be complete.
PROF. w. L. BAIH;KR.
Professors Help Select Detroit Engineers
Professors H. C. Anderson of the Mechanical En-
gineering Department, H. W. Miller of the Depart-
ment of Drawing and Mechanism, and H. E. Riggs
of the Civil Engineering Department, were appoint-
ed by the City of Detroit to prepare a list of qualifi-
cations and questions for the Department of Water
Supply. These lists are for civil and mechanical
engineers and draftsmen to enable the city to get
the best possible working force from applicants
for the work on the extension of its water svstem.
New X-ray Diffraction Equipment
New X-ray diffraction equipment in physics dept
The University of Michigan is one of the eight
colleges and universities in this country and Can-
ada to install X-ray diffraction equipments in their
physics laboratories.
This equipment will be furnished by the General
Electric Company, in whose research laboratory
this method of studying crystal structure was devel-
oped.
By means of the apparatus, characteristic X-ray
diffraction patterns of 15 powdered crystals can be
recorded photographically at once. The results
obtained have an immediate field of usefulness in
the theory of metallurgy and in certain branches
of physical chemistry, as well as in chemistry and
geology. The apparatus is suited not only to gen-
eral crystal research, but to most forms of routine
•commercial laboratory work.
The other colleges which have, or are installing
similar sets arc: Cornell, Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
McGill University, Pennsylvania State College,
University of Wisconsin, and the California Insti-
tute of Technology.
The Signal Corps At Camp Custer
Theoretical instruction in Signal Corps apparatus
and tactics has little value in itself if it is not sup-
plemented by practice in the field. In view of this
fact, all advanced Signal Corps R. O. T. C. men
are required to attend a six weeks' active training
period in a military camp, as a pre-requisite to
graduation from the University and before being
commissioned as Reserve Officers.
Thirteen men from the University of Michigan
Signal Corps Unit attended the training course at
Camp Custer, Michigan, during the period June
17 to July 28, inclusive. They were as follows:
Joe Barkovich '25; James O. Coates '24; Henry F.
Donner "25; Fred J. Goellner '25; D. C. Green '25;
Morris K. Jessup '24; Arthur H. Lince '25; E.
Claude Louy '25; John Malnight '25; James Mula-
vey '25; Robert Shaw '26; Edward H. Strohm '25;
and Robert C. Wuerfel '25. There were about 65
men in the Signal Company of Camp Custer, repre-
senting the Universities of Illinois, Michigan, Wis-
consin and Minnesota.
Besides the instruction received in the use and
care of apparatus and in tactics, one of the greatest
benefits derived by the men was the opportunity to
associate with those from the other conference
schools. Several inter-college baseball games were
played; competition in pistol firing was very keen
and the spirit of friendly rivalry penetrated even
to the dance floor in the Hostess House where,
needless to say, several of the Michigan Sheiks
paid full homage to the Shebas from Battle Creek.
Company officers were selected in rotation every
three days from the rosters of the various schools
and the men thus given an opportunity to develop
command and leadership.
Three Michigan Signal Company men worked
on the staff of the "Torch," the R. O. T. C. Camp
magazine. Goellner was editor for Company D,
Lince was Assistant Editor, and Malnight, Photo
Editor. James Coates '24, received his commission
as Second Lieutenant, S. C. at the close of the camp.
All the men who attended the camp are agreed that
they now have a clearer conception of the work of
the Army Signal Corps and they are more enthus-
iastic supporters than ever of R. O. T. C. work at
Michigan.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
THE NEBRASKA STATE CAPITOL
By LESLIE VAN DOREN, 26A
TO see a project executed in which there is no
prejudice of architectural tradition is, to say the
least, one of the rare sights of the age. In the
Nebraska State Capitol we have a work of this kind
coming from the hand of Bertram Grosvenor Good-
hue.
This project was won in competition with some
of the leading firms of the country, and while it is
a radical departure from the usual design of state
houses it cannot help but please the most conserva-
tive and fastidious. To do a work of this kind it
was necessary for the artist to be not only an artist
but also a genius. Goodhue showed that he was a
master of his art in daring to produce the most
beautiful of all state houses.
The building itself is, of course, monumental. It
expresses dignity and stateliness in its every line.
It has a beautifully inspiring mass which builds up
in every angle and detail. In the case of most other
state houses the perspective is destroyed in some
angle but the composition in this case is perfect.
The building without any ornament whatsoever
would be just as monumental and dignified due to-
its mass.
It is being built around the present Capitol, and
as the various departments are torn down and
moved to the new section the old building will be
torn down. On this spot will be erected the tall
tower which is the principal feature of the building.
Instead of the usual classical dome, there will rise
a mass of masonry which gradually tapers to a
beautiful crowning motive on the top. Long ver-
tical lines of windows in this mass help to accent
the vertical movement and in this way tend to pro-
duce a contrast with the base which has a horizontal
movement.
The base which forms a terrace from which the
noble and stately tower rises to the sky is in plan
a square. This means that in perspective one eleva-
tion will be practically as important as the other.
It is not until one analyzes the ornament which is
used on the building that one elevation predomi-
nates. This is often the case in the modern archi-
tecture used with a square plan.
The ornament is highly symbolical and greatly
helps the sense of beauty. It is like the building,
executed in Indiana buff limestone. It has been
lavishly used and at the same time has been dis-
posed of with excellent taste so that the building
does not become an idle show place for sculpture.
The figures are all from the hand of Lee Lawrie, and
his work on the building is a memorial in stone
which will live.
The most interesting piece of work is perhaps the
north portal. This portal which is shown on the
cover of this issue is flanked on both sides by herm
like figures rising from the structure. Symbolical,
perhaps a bit austere, they are truly a dignified
frame for the portal, which is the principal entrance
to the building. The joy of these figures is the fact
that they were not executed, as is so often the case,
by a man who can think only in terms of the sculp-
tor, but by a man who can think and act in terms
which are architectural. In this way the figures
instead of becoming an accent which might detract
from the building really form a part of the structure
and blend with it.
Then high above the level of the street at the
very top of the tower, over the long vertical rows,
of windows there are more of these forms which
are representative of the various occupations which
come within the jurisdiction of the state. These fig-
ures are, like the rest, conventionalized to such an
extent that instead of being individual, they are a
type.
Leading up to the north portal there is a large
and imposing flight of steps which are retained by
heavy cheek blocks whose only ornament is a bison
carved on their front face. These bison are con-
ventionalized and present a rather square and
blocky appearance which harmonizes very well with
the general tendency of the building. There are no
soft curves or finely modeled details, but rather a
mass which shows brute strength, symbolic of the
beast and of the purpose it serves in this case. Back
of the bison are hills of Indian corn as a slight re-
lief to the brutalness of the form.
The terrace formed by the roof provides a monu-
mental base and promenade. Here to the west of
the north entrance portal are panels of relief which
symbolize justice through the ages. Here are
shown, such figures as Deborah and other great law
givers of the past ages, and also the progress of the
law from the dawn of man to the present day. On
the south side are panels also executed in relief
portraying seven famous law givers.
It is unnecessary to continue describing the build-
ing for the task is a hopeless one. Only when one
has seen either the building in its present state or
even the drawings can one really appreciate the
sheer beauty which is confined within the walls of
the new Capitol.
It was Bertram Goodhue's last great work. The
strain of the project, the great interest and the lov-
ing care he lavished on it finally proved too much
for him, and the building will stand as his memorial
—his greatest work.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
EXPERIENCE IN THE MAKING OF
AN ENGINEER
I remember a story told by Mark Twain (if his
own cub days on the Mississippi. The huge Moat-
ing palace on which Mark was a pilot's apprentice
was about to make a "cross-over" when Mr. Bixby,
the pilot, developed a sudden and unconquerable
appetite for pie.
"Boy", he demanded, "How much water in that
crossing?"
"Couldn't touch bottom with a church steeple,"
replied young Twain.
"All right", said Bixby, "you take her over, I am
going below for a piece of pie."
Proud to be left alone with such responsibility
upon his voung shoulders, Mark spun over the
wheel and brought the steamer's nose to bear upon
a distant point diagonally across the river. All went
well for a few minutes until the captain (whom Mr.
Bixby had "met" on his way below) stepped out in
view of the boy and cast an anxious look around.
That was the entering wedge of doubt. Young
Mark began to wonder if there was not a rock or
something under the placid surface of the water
that his education had failed to encompass; he be-
gan to see manifestations of hidden shallows; over
there was a faint wrinkle which his training told
him indicated a bluff reef; just beyond, a ripple
denoted the presence of a dangerous snag; he could
almost see the yellow sandy bottom shining through
the water. The cold perspiration induced by fear
commenced to ooze out of his pores and in a weak
halting1 voice that was the very antithesis of the
crisp commanding tone he would have used a few
moments before, he ordered out the leads.
Alas! The leadsmen had also been "seen" by
Mr. Bixby and their first lugubrious reports con-
tinned the young pilot's worst fears. He didn't
know—he only thought he knew. The bottom the
leadsmen reported could not only have been touched
with a church steeple, but a yard stick would al-
most suffice.
Mark clawed the spokes of the wheel wildly one
\\ay and then another to keep off the shoals that
were reported first to starboard and now to port,
until he was on the verge of collapse. His last
despairing act was to bawl down the speaking tube
with what was left of his voice to "Ben", the engi-
neer, to "back her! If you love me, Ben, back the
immortal soul out of her."
At that moment, Mr. Bixby, bearing a large
chunk of pie in his fingers, stepped quietly into the
pilot house. Instantly the shoal and dangerous
channel became bottomless and safe. Confidently
the embryo pilot rang the engines ahead. Serenely
the big craft again pointed her nose to the almost-
as-far-distant point and went swimmingly on her
course.
The details of the lesson which Mr. Bixby
pounded into young Mark's cranium cover several
pages of the later Mark's book, but the gist of the
matter is that the young man had been steering the
steamboat by second-hand knowledge. The super-
structure of his education was there, but it was not
founded on the masonry of experience. Many of
our would-be engineers would consider themselves
indeed fortunate if their Alma Mater could step out
from behind a smokestack at a critical moment.
It is not my intention to deprecate the engineer-
by-education, but to point out that the mere
acquirement of knowledge from books or from the
experience of others the ability to pass an examina-
tion and to exhibit a diploma—does not constitute
an engineer.
To be sure, a college or school of accredited
repute does not grant diplomas without reason, but
it does of necessity grant them to men who are
without real practical experience; men who may
know, but who are not yet certain that they know,
and who, upon encountering a chain of adverse cir-
cumstances, may find themselves in the same plight
as was the young pilot when the leadsmen lied to
him.
UP-TO-DATE POWER LABORATORY

heat and power laboratory, the first unit of a group
of buildings for the College of Mechanics at the
.University of California, Berkeley, Calif. The
building will be a one-story reinforced concrete
structure, 40x100 sq. ft. in floor area.
The equipment chosen is such as to make the
laboratory one of the most modern in the country.
There will be a 150-hp., 350-lb. experimental steam
boiler, fired with either oil or powdered coal and
equipped with complete control apparatus and
auxiliaries; a 50-hp. marine compound engine with
integral condenser; a 25-hp. turbo-generator with
condenser; a 75-hp. unaflow engine with condenser;
a 15-hp. gas-fired boiler and engine; a semi-Diesel
engine; a Westinghouse gas engine; a Frick Corliss
engine; a refrigerating plant and an air-compressor
plant; four different types of gasoline engines, and
the usual auxiliary equipment for fundamental ex-
periments in steam engineering, including four
10,(KXVlb. automatic water-weighing machines.
Said the friend to the proud father of a college
graduate who had just been awarded an A. M.

"I suppose Robert will be looking for a Ph. D.
next?"
"No, he will be looking for a J. O. B."

Echoes from the Graduates
BENJAMIN FRANKLIN BAILEY
1\~ our fourth biography we wish to present Dr.
B. F. Bailey, Head of the Department of Elec-
trical Engineering of the University of Michigan.
His professional achievements have been felt wher-
ever electrical energy is used and it would be super-
fluous to enumerate them all here—it is our pur-
pose only to review these
phases of his life and to em-
phasize the more human as-
pects so that the reader will
feel he has met the man in per-
son.
Benjamin Franklin Bailey
was born almost fifty years ago
in Sheridan, Michigan. His
ancestors were all English and
American for several genera-
tions back. His early youth
was spent in Detroit where he
received both his public school
and high school education. Al-
though his father and brother
and several of his relatives
were practicing physicians,
Benjamin did not follow the
established precedent. He was
interested in electricity. In
fact he says today, he cannot
remember the time when he
was not interested in electric-
ity. He began building elec-
tric motors when he was only
ten years old and evidently has been engaged in
electrical work ever since.
As a young man in high school, he enjoyed bi-
cycle racing which was one of the most populai
sports in Detroit in the early '90's and participated
in several races on the five mile track around Belle
Isle. He entered the University of Michigan in
1894 and received his B.S. degree four years later.
While in the university, Bailey ran on the track
team; specializing in the mile and half mile. Evi-
dently bicycle racing was not recognized as a major
sport by the athletic department.
PROF. B. F. BAILEY
Doctor Bailey's professional activities really date
from the time of his graduation from the Univer
sity. After a year with the General Electric Com-
pany in their testing department, he returned to
the university as instructor in electro-therapeutics
and electrical engineering. At the same time he
studied for his Master of Arts
degree which was awarded him
in 1900. Six years later he be-
came Assistant Professor of
Electrical Engineering and the
following year received the de-
gree of Doctor of Philosophy.
With the exception of about
a year's interval during 1908
and 1909 when he was with the
Fairbanks - Morse Electrical
Manufacturing Company in In-
dianapolis, Doctor Bailey has
been continuously connected
with the University of Michi-
gan. In 1922 he was appointed
head of the Department of
Electrical Engineering in
which capacity most elec-
trical students have made his
acquaintance. He developed
Course 1 (Elementary Elec-
trical Design), Course 14
(Mechanism of Electrical Ma-
chines) and Courses 5 and 6
(Electrical Design). He also
developed E. E. 4 (Electrical Apparatus) and E. E.
10 which is an introduction to the Mathematical
Theory of Electrical Circuits. In connection espe-
cially with the courses in design, he has tried to
develop the work with the object of making stu-
dents think along engineering lines, rather than
with the object of turning out designers. Most
of the emphasis, therefore, has been upon the fun-
damentals rather than on methods of design.
As an inventor of electrical apparatus and as a
consulting engineer, Dr. Bailey's efforts have been
especially prolific. W'hile he was chief engineer for


Page -39
THE MICHIGAN TECHN1C
the Fairbanks-Morse Electrical Manufacturing
Company in 1908 and 1909 he redesigned their
entire line of induction motors and alternating and
direct current generators. He also invented, devel-
oped and patented the internal resistance induction
motor for heavy starting duty. He continued to act
as consulting engineer for this company for a num-
ber of years after his return to the University. He
has had considerable to do with the development
of electric' starting, lighting and ignition systems
for automobiles and has taken out several patents
on this class of apparatus. Doctor Bailey is at
present consulting engineer and a member of the
Board of Directors of one of the more prominent
manufacturers of electric motors and has acted as
an expert witness in a number of patent cases.
Doctor Bailev has written several books and
papers, the most prominent of which are his "Induc-
tion Motors", published in 1911 and "The Principles
of Dynamo Electric Machinery", 1915. Several
articles of his have appeared in the Electrical
World, The Horseless Age, Automotive Engineer-
ing, Proceedings of the Society of Automotive En-
gineers and Transactions of the American Institute
of Electrical Engineers.
Although interested primarily in the teaching of
electrical engineering, Doctor Bailey does not con-
fine his activities to the technical phases of his
work only. He is a member of Sigma Xi and Tau
Beta Pi. He belongs to the Palestine Masonic
Lodge, the Exchange Club and the Barton Hills
Country Club. He is a Fellow of the American
Institute of Electrical Engineers, a member of the
Society for the Promotion of Engineering Educa-
tion and the Electric Power Club. He is acting
on various committees in several of these organiza-
tions. Doctor Bailey has sponsored many of the
"Round Table" meetings of the Detroit-Ann Arbor
Section of the A. I. E. E.
Doctor Bailey's favorite recreation is boating.
Several years ago he designed and built a complete
motor launch and won a race with it in Lake Orion.
In Ann Arbor he confines himself more to automo-
biling and "some" golf which latter sport is in-
dulged in occasionally by the electrical faculty as a
whole when they can manage to get away for a
half holiday. He married Elsie Marian Eggeman
in Detroit in 1902.
His varied experience in the electrical industry
and in the field of invention, qualifies Doctor Bailey
especially well as a teacher. Among the designers
of induction motors, he ranks with the foremost
in the country. By showing the application of fun-
damental principles to actual cases with which he
has dealt, he is able to make his courses of real in-
terest and value. His contact with the legal aspect
of engineering should be of particular value to those
men who are interested in the broader phases of
engineering. Since his incumbency as head of the
Electrical Engineering Department, Doctor Bailey
has consistently urged a more liberal training for
engineers and has succeeded in putting into prac-
tice many of his ideas on this subject. The results
have been very commendable.
In recognition of his work in the engineering and
teaching profession, Professor Bailev is accorded a
place among Michigan's prominent sons.

A guest in a downtown hotel was shot and killed.
The Negro porter heard the shots, and was a wit-
ness at the trial.
"How many shots did you hear?" asked the at-
torney.
"Ah heard two," answered the Negro.
"And how far apart were they?"
"About lak dis," he replied, clapping his hands

T TERE the new architecture expresses itself in great vigorous masses which
climb upward into the sky with a pyramidal profile—gigantic, irregular,

prophetic of an architecture of the future which is vividly stimulating to the
imagination.
Certainly modern invention—modern engineering skill and organization,

ENGINEERS As CITY MANAGERS
By PHOF. T. H. REED, AB., LLB.
Professor of Political Science and Director of the Bureau of Uovernmenl
TH E new profession of city manager is one which
has special appeal for the engineer. There ar-.?
now 369 cities, in the United States and Canada
which arc governed under
the city manager plan. The
essentials of this new form
of city government are a
council elected by the peo-
ple, which constitutes the
governing body of the city,
and a manager appointed
by the council, who, sub-
ject to his responsibility to
it, carries on the city gov-
ernment. The relationship
between the manager and
the council is substantially
the same as that which ex-
ists between the manager
of a private corporation
and its board of directors.
So long as he retains their
confidence his authority is
very large. He not only
executes but recommends
policies. Of course the
actual relationship in any
particular case will be de-
termined by the character
and personality of the manager and the attitude of
the council. In some cities the council is prone to
interfere too much with the manager, in others the
manager assumes an attitude altogether too dic-
tatorial. In general, however, the standard relation
of manager and board of directors is maintained.
PROF. T. H. REED
At their last annual convention at Montreal the
City Manager crystallized their conception of this
relation in the following sections of a "Code of
Ethics," sections of which
are as follows:
"Sec. 5. Loyalty to his
employment r e c o g n i zes
that it is the council, the
elected representatives of
the people, who primarily
determinte the municipal
policies and are entitled to
the credit for their fulfill-
ment.
"6. Although he is a
hired employee of the
council, he is hired for a
purpose—to exercise his
own judgment as an exec-
utive in accomplishing the
policies formulated by the
council, and to attain suc-
cess in his employment he-
must decline to submit to
dictation in matters for
which the responsibility is
solely his.
"7. Power justifies re-
sponsibility and responsibility demands power, and
a city manager who becomes impotent to inspire
support should resign."
"10. A city manager should deal frankly with
the council as a unit and not secretly with its
individual members, and similarly should foster a


March, 192)

&gt;pirit of cooperation between all employees of tlv:
city's organization."
"12. Xo city manager should take an active1
part in politics."
So far the city manager plan has been most fre-
quently adopted by small cities but its growth since
1908 when the plan was inaugurated in Staunton.
Ya.. has been phenomenal. For the past live years
from 30 to 50 cities a year have been adopting it.
Cleveland, Ohio, is the largest city which has yet
joined the city manager ranks, and its most recent
important recruit was Cincinnati, Ohio, where the
people adopted the plan by a two to one vote at
the general election last November. The city man-
ager movement has been peculiarly active in .Mich-
igan, thirty-seven cities and villages having adopt-
ed it, among them Grand Rapids, Jackson, Kala-
inazoo, Muskegon, I'ontiac, Sault Ste. Marie and
Escanaba. The plan is at the present time under
consideration in Newark, N. J., Minneapolis. Minn..
Kansas City, Mo., and Seattle, Wash.
The salaries of city managers vary from $1,200.00
a year in some of the smaller cities to $25,000.(X)
in Cleveland, Ohio. Two cities, Norfolk, Ya., and
Stockton, Calif., pay $20.000.00 each. The general
situation is perhaps best indicated by the following
table:
Salaries of City Managers in Various Classes of
Cities
Cities Salary Salary Salary

500.000 1 $25.000
100,000-500.(XX) 3 20.000 $8.4U) $9.00'J

5,000 108 7.500 1.200 2.400
Security of tenure and opportunity for promotion
are even more important considerations than is that
of salary in the selection of a profession. From
this point of view it must be admitted that th •
manager plan has not been in operation long
enough to secure ideal results. In their selection
of managers the city councils have had until re-
centlv no considerable group of managers of ap-
proved qualifications to choose from. The earlv
city managers obviously had to be ch&lt; sen from
other walks of life. Man}' ol them were engineers,
but there was no way of testing their ability :is
managers except by actual experience. The result
was in the early years a good deal of shifting about.
Less than three hundred cities listed in the 1924
Year Book of the City Manager Association had
up to that time employed six hundred fifty man-
agers. In other words for every two persons who
have taken up the calling one has more or less
willingly abandoned it. On the other hand thirtv-
three of the existing manager* had reached their
position by promotion from one city, while nine
were serving a second time in their original city.
The first city manager, Charles F.. Ashburner, has
with one brief interval been an active member of
the profession since 1908, and is now serving his
fourth city (Stockton, Calif.). Another of the early
managers is now serving his fifth city. The cit\
manager profession is year by year becoming more
stable. In 1920 but 17.3% of the managers then
in service had served more than three years, in
1924 44.39^ had served more than three years.
The city managers maintain an international or-
ganization, the City Manager's Association, with a
permanent paid secretary. They publish a year
book and an excellent monthly magazine. Their
annual conventions are well attended and interest-
ing. They have adopted a "Code of Ethics," and
in fact have taken on many of the aspects of a
profession.
Something more than half of the city managers
to date have been engineers. In the early period
engineers were almost always selected, partly be-
cause of the direct value of their engineering train-
ing in connection with the supervision of public
works, and partly because the engineer was a pro-
fessional man who could accept an assignment as
manager, and if the results were not satisfactory,
step back into the engineering profession without
material loss. In small cities the city manager
must almost inevitably be an engineer because of
the impossibility of employing both a highly paid
manager and a highly paid engineer. In the larger
cities where the work of manager is purely of an
executive nature, an engineer has no other advant-
age than that which comes from engineering edu-
cation and experience as a preparation for execu-
tive duty. The thoroughness and accuracy so
characteristic of the technical graduate, and his
experience in the handling of men and materials
makes the engineer a formidable competitor for
any executive post. Where engineers have failed
as city managers, and they sometimes have, it has
most often been due to an arbitrary habit of mind
and impatience of the slow working mechanism of
popular government. This has usually been ac-
companied by a lack of knowledge of the processes
and objectives of municipal government.
The matter of college training directly for the
manager profession is now receiving considerable
attention. In this field the University of Michigan
was a pioneer. A course of study in Municipal
Administration was established some years ago.
open to graduates of both engineering and literary
colleges. The purpose of the course is to give the
literary graduates some knowledge of the engineer-
ing problems of a city and to give the engineers

DRIVING THE MOF FAT TUNNEL
By CLIFFORD A. BETTS
Office Engineer, M offal Tunnel ('omniixsion
THE WESTERN SLOPE OF THE CONTINENTAL DIVIDE
The Western end of the tunnel pierces the precipitous sides
of the Rocky Mountain Range, one-half mile west of the sawmill
settlement in the foreground.
THE longest railway tunnel in America is
driven through the Continental Divide, 50 miles
west of Denver, at an elevation of 9,1(10', by a por
tion of the State of Colorado known as the Mofl'at
Tunnel Improvement District. As authorized by
the state legislature, the district itself is made re-
sponsible for the administration of the completed
tunnel and its leasing to railroads, as well as for
its construction. The method of financing the long
needed transportation tunnel by selling $6,720.0fK)
• if bonds guaranteed by the district bencfitted is
as novel as some of the construction features of
the 6.19 mile bore.
When in use the tunnel will eliminate the ?0
miles of 4% grade on the Denver &amp; Salt Lake
Railroad over Corona Pass (elevation 11,660') which
consumes 40% of the operating cost of that road
in snow fighting and fuel consumption; and it will
keep the ruling grade down to 2% and reduce ton-
mile costs greatly. With the construction of the
40 mile Dotsero Cut-off, linking the Denver &amp; Salt
Lake Railroad and the Denver &amp; Rio Grande West-
tern Railroad at the Colorado River, the distance
between Denver and Salt Lake City will be reduced
173 miles; and Denver will be placed on a trans-
continental transportation line for the first time.
LTp to October 1, a year after the contract was
signed, the water tunnel had been driven 5432'
from the east end and 4633' from the west, or w:»s
31 % finished. Twenty-eight per cent of the main
heading, 7&gt;7% of the crosscuts and 7c/c of the rail-
road tunnel had been completed on that date.
Parallel to the 16' x 24' standard, single-track
railroad tunnel and 75' to the south is an 8'x8' water
tunnel, the grade of which is 8' above that of the
main bore. To deliver water through this tunnel
from the Western Slope where the elevation of the
west portal is 9,092' to the portal (9,205') over tin-
tunnel apex (9,249') will necessitate the sinking
of a shaft at the western inlet end, having suffi-
cient head to force the water through the bore.

crosscuts about every 1,500' from the water tunnel

up more points of attack and to facilitate transpor-
tation, increases the magnitude of the work. By
driving the water tunnel ahead and running cross-
cuts from it, more headings can he driven in both
directions, and a correspondingly large number of
crews worked. At the present time, in the soft
ground at the west portal, seven separate crews,
four in the headings and three for enlarging oper-
ation, are at work during each of the three eight
hour shifts, making a total of 360 men employed

treacherous ground results, the menace of which is
increased by exposure to the air and the presence
of underground water. Thus, different methods
are used at the two ends, with these methods
changed according to local rock conditions.
At the east portal a bonus crew of four driller-;
four helpers, three muckers, and two trainmen, al-
ternates between the water tunnel heading and the
main heading of the railroad bore, thereby com
plcting two rounds and clean-ups each shift. Since
the average break is 8' in trie 7l/2 x 9' bore, the
THE MECHANICAL MUCKER
Broken rock in the east portal end of the railroad tunnel, is loaded into dump cars by this Osgood air shovel. The
air cylinder hoist in the rear eliminates switching by lifting the cars from one track to the other. The granite
gneiss out of which this portion of the tunnel is being blasted, requires little timbering.
Conditions encountered at the east and west
portals are so extremely different—both under-
ground and on the surface—that the ends appear
as different tunnels. The well-watered, gradual
slopes at the west portal are protected by heavy
stands of pine and spruce; the precipitous rocky
country at the east is windy and open. At the east
end a hard, grey granite gneiss has been encount-
ered from the beginning where the portal enters the
outcrop ledge, which is difficult to drill and blast
and breaks erratically. The biotite gneiss and
schist at the west portal is broken in every direc-
total average daily progress for three shifts is 24'
in each heading. A round of 22 holes loaded with
160 Ibs. of 60% gelatin, fired by electric exploders
in 3 delays, blasts out approximately 28 cu. yds.,
of which about 9 cu. yds. are overbreak. The total
powder used, therefore, is about 8 Ibs. per yard
of pay section or 5 Ibs. per yard of broken rock.
Only 3J-2 Ibs. of gelatin a yard are required for
enlarging the tunnel to its size of 16' x 24'. The
bonus is based upon an average daily advance of
17' in each of the headings or an aggregate of 510'

drillers receive 15c up to 600', 20c for the next 75'
and 30c thereafter. The scale for muckers is lOc,
12c, and 18c, and for trolleymen 5c, 7c, and lOc.
Individual bonuses as large as $48.00 in a 15-day
period have been paid, with the result that work
has been speeded up considerably.
A 24" gauge drill-carriage, mounting four drills,
with all pipe and hose connections, permits set-ups
in 8 to 15 minutes and facilitates the moving of
drills between headings. Fifty HP Conweigh
mucking machines, likewise a device in reducing
mucking costs, have no difficulty in loading 2 yard
cars in two minutes each, or clearing up a heading
in three hours. The cars (4 yd. Koppel design) are
hauled on to the portals by General Electric stor-
age battery locomotives, and thence to the dump
or railroad approach fill and out of the main head-
ing by 8 ton, 470 HP trolley locomotives.
The drilling and excavation of the railroad tun-
nel enlargement presents problems influenced by
the nonuniformity of the granite. Twenty-seven
holes, 4y2' to 10' deep, spaced to equalize the
burden on each, are drilled in rings 4' apart
far ahead of the last cut. It has proved imprac-
tical to shoot full rings, because of the covering of
the bench by muck, and because of the "swell."
Consequently, the lower half is first shot, followed
at the west portal, the top-widening of the main
heading is followed by the excavation of a sub-
bench with temporary batter posts supporting the
wall plates. The rest of the tunnel is then exca-
vated, and vertical 12" x 12" posts are erected where
required. The heavy pressures encountered have

SAVING NIAGARA FALLS BY MEANS
OF REMEDIAL WORKS
By MORRIS H. LLOYD, '25E
IT is a coincidence that the public holds more
false notions about Niagara Falls than it does
concerning any other scenic wonder in America.
The rapid wearing away of the rim of Horseshoe
Fall, the dependence of the nation's industries upon
the products of Niagara's electric power, and the
extent to which false rumors have been spread make
an examination of the true state of affairs at Ni-
agara Falls well worth while.
Popular Fallacies
In many newspapers outside of New York and
Ontario, one often reads of damage done to the
scenery of the Falls due to di-
version of water around the
Falls to run hydro-electric
power houses. Hundreds of
tourists go there every summer
expecting to see the cataract re-
duced to a mere trickle or com-
pletely dry. Associations have
been formed with the avowed
purpose of restricting or entire-
ly prohibiting the use of Niag-
ara's waters for the production
of electrical energy. They
ascribe the extreme thinness of
water on the heels of the Horse-
shoe to the diversion of water
into powerhouses when in real-
ity it is due to the ever-increas-
ing concentration of water at the center of that Fall
as erosion proceeds.
Many seemingly well-meaning people have
spread false reports to the effect that so much
water has been withdrawn by the power companies
that one can almost walk across the American
channel just above the Falls without getting his
ankles wet. It is true that on some days the
American channel is nearly dry, but this is not due
to diversion. The actual water level varies from
day to day, depending upon the direction of the
wind on Lake Erie. A strong wind blowing up
the lake toward Detroit will often reduce the Amer-
ican Fall to a mere trickle. If the wind is toward
Buffalo it will pile water up at the lower end of the
lake and raise the level of water on the Falls con-
siderably above its normal level. Since the Ameri-
can channel is shallower than the main Interna-
tional channel, and since the American Fall is high-
er than the Horseshoe, it is natural that the former

ence as official guide at

Fall should be affected to a more noticeable degree
by fluctuations in the river flow.
Another familiar cry is that unless more strin-
gent rules are placed upon the power companies,
the Falls will he completely diverted into power
house turbines as the demand for electricity grows.
As a matter of fact, at least forty per cent of the
river must always flow over the cataracts in order
t&lt;&gt; carry off the tons of ice which come down the
river during the winter and spring. Furthermore,
none of the power companies have development
plans which would call for a total diversion of more
than half of the total river flow.
People who oppose the indus-
trial use of Niagara River water
often overlook the fact that
when a ton of coal is burned to
produce electrical energy it is
gone forever, but when a ton of
water is used for the same pur-
pose it flows through the tur-
bines, out to the river, and
finally reaches the ocean. There
it is evaporated to the atmos-
phere, is blown over the land,
and is then precipitated as rain,
in an ever-recurring cycle. As
long as coal is left in the mine
it is saved for use at some fu-
ture time, whereas when water
is allowed to flow over a fall without doing any
useful work, it is wasted.
It is particularly significant that one of the or-
ganizations which is loudest in its protest against
the use of Niagara River for power purposes has
its headquarters at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, tlv;
center of the coal mining industry.
Progress of Erosion
The flow of the Niagara River averages 210,000
cubic feet per second. This flow is practically con-
stant. Of this amount, 56,000 c.f.s. is reserved for
power purposes and the remainder, or 154,000 c.f.s
is allowed to flow over the cataract. The Ameri-
can fall carries five per cent of this volume anil
the Horseshoe carries ninety-five per cent.
Inasmuch as the American Fall has a nearly
straight rim and carries such a small amount of
the water, the effects of erosion have been scarce!v
noticeable over a long period of time. Such is not
the case, however, with the Horseshoe. The earliest

known survey of this Fall shows the length of its
brink to have been 1,800 feet. In 1916 the reces-
sion of the toe of the fall had lengthened this to
3,020 feet. As this erosion progresses, more and
more of the water concentrates at the toe, with a
resulting diminution of water over the heels, ft
is well within the memory of the present older
generation of people who have visited Niagara Falls
in their youth that the heels of the Horseshoe
were carrying a considerable portion of the water,
whereas now the heels are nearly dry. At present,
the center of the Horseshoe is moving upstream
at the rate of six feet a year. As time goes on,
the heels will become completely dry and the toe
of the fall will carry the rushing torrents with a
rapid acceleration in the rate of recession. Hence
it is apparent that the Horseshoe Fall is rapidly de-
stroying itself as a scenic wonder. The map graph-
ically illustrates this point.
The Diversion of Water
Niagara began to serve the needs of men as far
back as 1725, when French pioneers constructed a
small canal along the upper rapids on the American
side. By means of this canal they obtained power
to drive a sawmill. Hardly a trace of this or any
other early development now remains.
The present power" industry was started in 1852.
In'that year construction was started on the Hy-
draulic Canal. It was not until 1872 that any use
was made of thfc canal and several men had sunk
fortunes in the project only to lose them. In 1877
Jacob Schoellkopf of Buffalo bought the canal at
public auction and organized the Niagara Falls
Hydraulic Power and Manufacturing Company,
later known as the Hydraulic Power Company of
Niagara Falls, and finally consolidated with the
Niagara Falls Power Company. In 1879 the pro-
duction of electrical energy began with the lighting
of twenty arc lamps in Prospect Park by a Brush
arc dynamo. This was such a wonder that rail-
roads ran excursions to see the new marvel.
From this time on the development of electric
power increased rapidly. Today seven generating
stations, of which four are owned by the Niagara
Falls Power Company and three by the Hydro-
Electric Power Commission of Ontario, make up
the world's largest hydro-electric generating system.
Transmission lines radiate in all directions from
Niagara Falls, reaching north to Toronto, Ont, east
to Syracuse, N. Y., south to Bradford, Pa., and
west to Windsor, Ont. Three million people are
served directly with light and power and sixty per
cent of the industries of Canada and the United
States depend upon some product made in factories
using Niagara power.
Due to the construction of several of the large
power houses in the first decade of this century,
citizens became alarmed lest the Falls become di-
minished by diversion of water. Accordingly the
International Waterways Commission investigated
conditions and a treaty was signed by the two na-
tions which gave the United States the right to
divert 20,000 c.f.s. and to Canada 36,000 c.f.s.
Contrary to what one might believe, the use of
this amount of water for power purposes has not
perceptibly lessened the scenic beauty of the cata-
racts. According to an investigation made by

engineers of the.War Department, the level of the
Amerkan.'.KfJJr*%&lt;l&lt;Jwered an average of five-eighths
of an inch and the Horseshoe Fall an average of six
inches. Due to the even distribution of water on
the crest of the American Fall which is about six
inches deep, the small amount removed does not
show any appreciable difference. On the Horse-
shoe, however, the six inch average drop in level
does cause a slightly noticeable differencd-owing to
the fact that the water is very unevenly distributed.
Since very little water goes over the sides, little
effect is registered there by diversion. To compen-
sate for this, more than six inches difference in
levels occurs at the center where the water is over
twelve feet deep.
The effect of erosion has been pointed out al-
ready. Were all diversion stopped, more water
would be thrown .over the Falls and the erosion
would be accelerated.'
Proposed Remedy
Everyone who has visited Niagara Falls knows
that the American Fall, carrying five per cent of
the water evenly distributed along the rim is fully
as beautiful a spectacle as the Horseshoe Fall carry-
ing ninety-five per cent, most of which is concen-
trated at the toe. One might naturally think, then,
that if the water of the Horseshoe could be spread
evenly over the entire crest, the beauty of that Fall
could not only be greatly increased but less water

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
CHARACTERISTICS THAT CHEMICAL ANALYSIS
FAILS To DISCLOSE IN PIG IRONS AND CASTINGS
Ky W. E. JOMINY
THERE has been some disagreement among
foundry men as to whether or not cast irons of
the same elemental chemical composition have tho
same or different characteristics when produced
under varying blast furnace and cupola conditions.
The controversy is particularly rife when the dis-
cussion of these variations leads to the subject of
coke irons as compared to charcoal irons. It does
not confine itself to these two types of irons. Many
contend that different coke irons will have dissimi-
lar characteristics even though the carbon, silicon,
manganese, phosphorus, and sulphur contents ma\
be the same.
The greatest differences of opinion, however, ap-
pear when coke and charcoal
irons are considered. The con-
siderable variations in the meth-
ods bv which coke and charcoal
irons are produced would cer-
tainly make the differences in
characteristics much more pro-
nounced between these two
types of irons than would be
expected between two different
coke irons or two different char-
coal irons of the same chemical
composition.
Coke Furnace Conditions Differ-
ent from Charcoal Furnace
Conditions
It is customary to run coke
furnaces with higher blast temperatures and pres-
sures than are used with charcoal furnaces. The
sulphur content in the coke requires a slag rela-
tively higher in lime. The higher melting point of
this limy slag makes it necessary to maintain a
higher hearth temperature in the coke furnace than
in the charcoal furnace. The latter can operate
with more acid and consequently more fluid slag
because of the freedom of the charcoal from sul-
phur.
The coke furnaces, which produced the irons dis-
cussed in this paper, operated with an average blast
temperature of 1300 degrees Fahr., and a blast pres-
sure of 14 pounds per square inch; whereas, the
charcoal furnace operated with an average blast
temperature of 1050 degrees Fahr., and a pressure
of 4y&gt; pounds per square inch. The temperature
of the iron coming from the charcoal furnace aver-
aged about 300 degrees lower than similar iron
from the coke furnaces.
THE results set forth in
this paper were obtained
by Mr. W. E. Jominy, Asso-
ciate Investigator of the De-
partment of Engineering Re-
search at the University of
Michigan. His work is an ap-
proach to a solution of the age-
old controversy as to the com-
parative properties of charcoal
and coke irons having the
same chemical analysis.
—Editor.
There is considerable evidence of a practical na-
ture which would tend to make one believe that
there is a decided difference in the properties of
the two irons. Many foundrymen have found that
it is less difficult to obtain good castings when
using pig iron from a charcoal blast furnace than
when using pig iron from the usual coke furnace.
There is need for more scientific verification of these
practical observations.
Knowledge of Pig Iron Characteristics Limited
There are so many variables which enter into the
making of good castings and poor castings that it
has been difficult in the foundry to show conclu-
sively the superiority of one iron over another.
When trouble is experienced in
making good castings it is very
difficult to determine definitely
whether the pig iron is the cause
of this trouble or whether it is
any one of the host of other
variables which must be dealt
with in the foundry. Our knowl-
edge of the properties of pig iron
is limited to interpretaton of the
chemical analysis, which as will
be seen from the results of the
researches herein reported, cer-
tainly offers little information
concerning the strength and
hardness of the iron. A consid-
erable amount of written dis-
cussion has been published on the subject. The
majority of this has been based on rather meager
data.
J. F.. Johnson, Jr.,1 has probably written more to
the point on thi* subject than any other investigator.
He has reached some very definite conclusions with
respect to the reasons why charcoal iron is superior
to coke iron. He attributes the superiority to the
presence of oxygen in the former. His conclu-
sions, however, have only been supported by data
from tests which he made on eight different pieces
of iron.
The author has examined approximately one
hundred samples of pig iron in the investigation
recorded in this paper, which has been submitted
to contribute sufficient reliable data to show that
there are large differences in irons having the same
chemical analysis and that these persist through

the remelting. The results support most of John-
son's contentions regarding the superiority of char-
coal irons. In addition, they show the variations
of irons in strength, composition, and metallogra-
phic structure when produced in blast furnaces
under known widely variant conditions.
No attempt was made to verify the relation of
the oxygen content of the irons to their strengths
as suggested by Johnson. Johnson used the Lede-
bur method for the determination of the oxygen
and according to the findings of Cain and Petti-
john,1 the Ledebur method for this determination
is not strictly accurate. Since Johnson was dealing
with such very small quantities of oxygen, a slight
inaccuracy in the method might lead to errors of
considerable magnitude. For this reason and the
fact that no foundry laboratory is equipped to make
these determinations, it has been endeavored to
find some other characteristics or combination of
characteristics by which the suitability of a pig iron
can be determined.
How Samples Were Obtained
The samples of pig irons used in the tests were
taken from time to time over a period of four
months from five different blast furnaces. On
many of the heats from which samples were taken.
the writer noted the blast furnace conditions such
as temperature and pressure of blast, and analysis
of the slag run from the furnace just previous to
the time of pouring. This was done in an effort to
correlate the properties of the irons with some of
these conditions at the blast furnace but no rela-
tion was discovered.
It was endeavored to have the irons poured un-
der as nearly the same conditions as was possible.
For this purpose, arbitration test bar molds, made
practically in accordance with the specifications of
the American Society of Testing Materials, were
used. They differed slightly in that the gate was
made wider than that required in the specification.-..
This was done because it was desired to have suffi-
cient material for remelting without having to use
the test pieces proper. The pouring was accomp-
lished by tapping off the iron as it flowed from the
blast furnace into a ladle placed about 50 feet from
the blast furnace and pouring from this ladle into
the arbitration molds. The test bars thus produced
were 1{4 inches in diameter by 15 inches long, and
were shipped from the blast furnaces attached to
the gates. There were two bars on each gate and
hence of the same composition. The test bars were
numbered a^ received in such a manner as to iclen-
tifv them with the heat numbers at the various
furnaces from which they came. They are referred
to in this report according to this number.
The only other variations from the specified pro-
cedure were that these test pieces were poured into
iTeoh. paper 11S. Hureau of Standards (1919).
undried molds at the coke furnaces. Dried molds
were used at the charcoal furnace. Of necessity,
the chemical compositions of the samples varied
with different heats.
Tests Made
The test bars, as received, were broken from the
gate and subjected to a transverse test. Tensile
test specimens were then made from the lower half
of each of the transverse specimens and the stan-
dard tensile test for cast iron was made on each.
Both Brinell and Rockwell hardness tests were
made on the transverse specimens near the fracture.
Many of the samples were likewise subjected to
a metallographic examination at and near the frac-
ture. An attempt was made to correlate the varia-
tions in physical properties with the chemical prop-
erties. It was impossible to observe any correla-
tion whatever. Of course, the results of those test
pieces which showed blow holes or slag or carbon
inclusions in the fracture were discarded.
Some Interpretations of Data
The results of these observations on charcoal
irons were put in Table 1 and those on the coke
irons in Table 2. There are data on 40 irons con-
tained in these two tables. The results on the
other samples were discarded either because of blow
holes or slag or carbon inclusions in the fractures
of the test pieces or because of a silicon content of
less than 1.25 per cent. When less than this amount
of silicon is present there is danger of a chilling
effect, particularly when the irons are remeltcd.
The data were separated into the two tables and
tabulated according to the silicon content for con-
venience of examination. All the data given for
physical properties represent the average of two
determinations for each iron. It will be noted that
the average results for the charcoal irons are higher
than those for the coke irons, even though there is
no outstanding difference in the chemical composi-
tions except perhaps the carbons and with these
the difference is such as would normally be ex-
pected to favor the coke irons. The Brinell read-
ings for the coke, irons range from 121 to 159, where
as for the charcoal irons the limits were 134 and
171. The range of transverse strengths in pounds
were for the coke irons, 1,700 to 2.900 and for the
charcoal irons 2,100 to 3,050. The tensile tests
showed results varying from 12,400 to 22.800 pounds
per square inch for the coke irons and from 17,400
to 26,500 pounds per square inch for the charcoal
irons. When it is remembered that the molds at
the coke furnaces were of green sand and not dried,
whereas, the molds at the charcoal furnace were
dried, these results have added significance. It
must be remembered that the iron from the coke
furnaces was poured at a relatively higher temper-
ature, about 300 degrees Fahr., in those observed
bv the author, than that from charcoal furnace".

THE MICHIGAN T E C H N I C
It is generally accepted that it is extremely diffi-
cult, if not impossible, to obtain satisfactory cast-
ings by pouring directly from the blast furnace into
the molds. The results are in accord with this idea,
only the averages being of any consquence.
How Iron Was Remelted
Therefore, in order to prepare the samples in a
manner which would more satisfactorily permit of
comparing results, the gates and unused portions
of the samples were remelted in a Booth ladle typo
muffled arc furnace. The ladle was lined with a
mixture of ganister and Thermolith cement. The
than a minute elapse between the time of taking the
temperature reading and the pouring of the iron.
This furnace made possible a fairly accurate con-
trol of the pouring temperature. That the melting
conditions were very satisfactory can be seen from
Table 5 by noting the small variations in chemical
compositions between remelts. Likewise, it was
possible to clean the ladle after each heating, and
thus eliminate the possibility of contamination of
succeeding samples. Considerable care was taken
to see that this contamination did not occur.
The same procedure was followed for testing the

The molds for these bars were not dried in accordance with the A. S. T
pig iron samples were cut up, placed in this ladle.
covered with charcoal and heated to the required
temperature for pouring. It was endeavored to
keep this temperature approximately 2,(&gt;00 degrees
l-'ahr. In general, with the furnace hot, from 30
to 40 minutes were required t&lt;&gt; bring the charge up
to the required temperature. The temperature of
the iron in the ladle was noted by means of an op-
tical pyrometer. As soon as a satisfactory temper-
ature was obtained, the ladle was removed from the
furnace and the iron poured into an arbitration mold
made strictly in accordance with the specification
of the American Society for Testing Materials. Us-
ually about one-half minute was required for the
pouring of the iron, and on no occasion did mor?
samples thus obtained as was used in the case of the
original samples received from the blast furnaces.
The samples obtained by remelting were stamped
with the same reference number and a prefix X
to show that they were remelts.
Data Obtained on Remelting
The results of the remelts of the samples record-
ed in Tables 1 and 2 are recorded in Tables 3 and 4.
Because of mishaps and lack of sufficient time, only
thirty-two of the forty irons shown in the former
two tables are included in the latter two. The re-
melted irons are tabulated in the order of their
silicon content. This order is not exactly the same
because the silicon losses on remelting varied. The
variations are not great, however, averaging only

.05 per cent loss of silicon and .02 per cent loss of
manganese in the remelting. Only a few values
for phosphorus and sulphur were determined and
as these checked within the limits of chemical error
with those for the original samples, it was deemed
unnecessary to make further analyses for these ele-
ments. It is evident from the chemical analysis
that the melting conditions were slightly oxidizing.
Differences in Strength Greater on Remelting
From the data recorded in these tables, it will
he seen that the differences in strength are even
greater between the charcoal and coke irons than
was the case before the remelting. A comparison
of the tables will show that coke irons did not in-
crease materially in strength on remelting. In gen-
eral, the charcoal irons showed a decided increase
in physical properties on remelting. This is prob-
ably due to the less favorable pouring- conditions
of the original samples already mentioned.
The Brinell readings on the coke irons given in
Table 4 range from 116 to 166, while those for
charcoal irons given in Table 3 range from 158 to
195. A comparison of tensile strengths for the two
shows that the coke irons range from 17,100 to
25.6CO pounds, while the charcoal samples range be-

THE MICHIGAN TECHN1C
PULVERIZED FUEL
By C. H. FESSENDEN, M. E.
Professor of Mechanical Engineering
THE term pulverized fuel as used in power plant
work means fuel that has been properly dried,
crushed, and ground to a powder so that it may be
efficiently burned in suspension in the boiler
furnace.
Although the burning of coal in the pulverized
form in boiler furnaces is a comparatively recent
development, it has assumed such importance that
it is now given careful consideration when any coal
burning central station is designed. During the
year 1924, thirty-two large boiler plants were put in-
to service, or were under construction, with a total
boiler heating surface of 2,691,685 sq. ft. and aver-
aging 16,860 sq. ft. per boiler. Five of these plants,
namely,
Cahokia Station, E. St. Louis, 111.
Lake Shore No. 2, Cleveland, Ohio.
Lakeside Station Extension, St. Francis, Wis.
Trenton Channel Station, Trenton Channel,
Mich.
Valmont Station, Valmont, Colo,
representing 27.4% of the total heating surface,
were designed for pulverized fuel. At the begin-
ning of the year 1925, there were in the United
States over 2,700,000 sq. ft. of boiler heating sur-
face in operation or contracted for, fired with pul-
verized coal. Using 100 to represent this amount
of heating surface, the rapid growth of this method
of burning fuel is indicated by the following table:

Although some seven or eight pulverized fuel
installations had been put into successful operation
during the years 1916-17-18, the first commercial
installation of any considerable size was at the
Oneida Street Plant of the Milwaukee Electric
Railway &amp; Light Company, where 5-468 hp. Edge
Moor boilers were equipped in 1918. After con-
siderable experimental data had been secured from
the Oneida Street Plant the company decided to
install 8-1306 hp. Edge Moor boilers in their Lake
side Station, to use powdered coal exclusively. This
plant, built in 1920, was the first large central sta-
tion designed for pulverized fuel.
The principal advantages of burning fuel in the
'pulverized form are:
(1) A smaller amount of excess air may be
used to give complete combustion, be-
cause of its better mixture with the fuel
and the possibilities of better control.
This reduces the stack loss and in-
creases the furnace temperature and re-
sults in higher efficiency.
(2) Flexibility of operation, permitting quick
adjustment to changing load, and elimi-
nation of stand-by losses.
(3) Ability to burn coals of almost any grade.
(4) Other fuels such as natural gas and fuel
oil can be successfully burned in the pul-
verized fuel furnace. If the furnace is
equipped to burn these fuels the plant
may be operated on whichever one the
condition of the market makes most eco-
nomical. A change from one to the
other can be made in only a few minutes,
and if desired they can be burned to-
gether.

FIG. 1.—DIAGRAM SHOWING A TYPICAL ARRANGEMENT
OF A COMPLETE PULVERIZED FUEL SYSTEM FOR HAND-
LING THE COAL FROM UNLOADING TO BURNING.
There are two classes of pulverized coal systems,
designated respectively as the unit system and tru:
central system. In the unit system one machine
prepares and delivers the coal to the furnace with
the proper amount of air for combustion; this sys-
tem has no storage facilities and its application is
restricted to the smaller sized boiler units. A
characteristic unit of this type, made by the Aero
Pulverizer Co. in capacities up to 5 tons per hour.

THE MICHIGAN T E C H N I C
consists of a heavy shaft running axially through topics: (1) the preparation of pulverized fuel, (2)
the shell and upon which are mounted the pulver- conveying and storing, (3) feeding and burning.
izing wheels and the exhaust fan. Coal is fed into
a small hopper at one end, and is discharged from
the bottom of the hopper by an adjustable feed
mechanism into the pulverizing elements of the
machine, which consist
of a series of paddle
wheels increasing in
diameter toward the
discharge end. These
wheels are steel discs
mounted upon the
main shaft, with hard-
ened steel blocks fast-
ened to them at the
peripheries. The coal
is pulverized by impact
and rubbing contact.
The particles reduced
to a certain size in one
compartment are car-
ried on by a current of
air to the next com-
partment for finer pul-
verizing. On the shaft
near the discharge end
of the machine is
mounted the fan, which
serves to draw the coal
and air through the
pulverizing elements
and to exhaust the mix-
ture into the furnace
ready for burning. Air
is admitted at the feed
mechanism to carry the
coal through the pul-
verizer and also in
front of the fan to sup-
ply the amount needed
for combustion. The
simplicity, c o m p a c t-
ness and lower first
cost of this type of machine makes it suitable for
use in the smaller plants where the coal consump-
tion does not justify the expenditure required for a
more elaborate system. It is open to several objec-
tions, chief of which are noise, wear, interrupted
service and limited capacity.
In the central system each operation is performed
by a separate piece of equipment designed to per-
form that function on a rather large scale and to
some extent independent of the rate of delivery of
the other pieces of equipment in the system.
In discussing the principal features of the cen-
tral system, it is convenient to use the following
FIG. 2.—SECTION THROUGH BOILER PLANT EQUIPPED
WITH PULVERIZED FUEL SYSTEM.
The Preparation of Pulverized Fuel
Figure 1 is a diagrammatical arrangement of a
typical central pulverizing system. The coal as
received from the car is crushed at least fine enough
to pass through a 1J-4
inch ring and frequent-
ly much finer, and is
then conveyed to a
storage bin. Coal as
received contains a
considerable amount of
tramj) iron in the form
of bolts, pick points,
railroad spikes, mule
shoes, etc., and these
must be removed be-
fore the coal is passed
to the pulverizers or
they will damage the
equipment. Tramp iron
is removed by a mag-
netic separator which
may be either of the
stationary lifting type
or of the pulley type.
The pulley type mag-
netic separator consists
of a pulley revolving
about a magnet. The
pulley .serves as the
head wheel of a belt
conveyor and when the
material passes over
this pulley the iron is
held against the belt
until it leaves the mag-
netic zone at some
point beyond the un-
derside of the pulley.
The tram]) iron drops
from the belt after it
leaves the pulley and i*
discharged through a chute to a suitable collecting
l&gt;ox, while the coal continues on its course.
It has been found that the power required t&lt;&gt;
pulverize coal increases with the surface moisture
of the coal, and also that moisture tends to cause
it to pack and arch in storage bins and clog in
screw conveyors and pipes carrying it to the burn-
ers. It has been frequently stated that coal must
be dried until it contains only about 1 or 2 per
cent of surface moisture. Tests have shown, how-
ever, that it is not necessary to dry coal to this
extent in order to get good boiler efficiency, and
some plants using coal containing less than 5?f
moisture pulverize the coal without any drying.


Page 19
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Two general types of driers are used, namely (1)
the rotary drier and (2) the vertical gravity drier.
The rotary drier is an adaptation from the cement
industry and consists of a steel cylinder arranged
to be rotated about its inclined longitudinal axis.
Hot gases from the drier furnace pass first around
the outside of the cylinder and then after they have
been cooled enough so that they may come into
direct contact with the coal without danger of ig-
niting it the}' are passed axially through the cylin-
der. Longitudinal shelves on the inside of the
drier cause the coal to be lifted and dropped through
the current of hot gases and the coal slowly works
its way to the discharge outlet.
The vertical gravity drier is built in the form of
a stationary sectional chute, through which the
coal flows on its way from the storage bin to the
pulverizer. In some installations the coal is dried
by waste flue gases from the boiler, which are
moved by a fan through the interstices of the coal
and carry off moisture. Only about one-quarter
of the boiler flue gases are used for drying purposes.
In others, the coal passages are made of steam
heated grids and a small quantity of air is drawn
through the coal to carry the moisture away. From
two to four per cent moisture is extracted by the
drier and the coal is pre-heated so that it loses
moisture readily in the pulverizer. At the Cahokia
Station the gases enter the driers at about 300 to
400 degrees F. and leave at 150 to 200 degrees,
heating the coal to about 175 degrees F. If the
coal becomes clogged and is held in the drier for
a considerable length of time, the temperature may
rise until the coal begins to give off some of its
volatile matter and it may slowly oxidize until it
has generated enough heat to cause its ignition.
Such conditions can. of course, be obviated by
proper supervision.
After the coal is dried it is conveyed to the pul-
verizers where it is reduced to an impalpable pow-
der. Some difference of opinion exists about the-
degree of fineness required for best operation; form-
erly it was believed that about 95% should pass
through a 100 mesh screen and 85 to 80 per cent
through a 200 mesh screen, but now the majority
seem to agree that 70% should pass through a 200
mesh screen, 90% through 100 mesh, 98% through
80 mesh and 100% through 50 mesh. It has been
found possible to operate some furnaces with coars-
er coal but the rapidity of burning increases when
the coal is more finely ground. The power required
to drive the pulverizing mill increases with tin-
hardness of the coal, the fineness to which it i^
being pulverized, and the surface moisture present.
The details of construction of the various pulver-
izing mills will not be discussed. There are three
well known makes, the Fuller-Lehigh, the Raymond
and the Bonnot. which utilize the centrifugal fore.1
of heavy revolving masses in the form of balls or
rollers to crush the coal. These masses have con-
siderable freedom of movement and the mill is not
easily clogged or broken. Pulverizers may be di-
vided into two classes, depending on the method of
separating the finer from the coarser material. In
the screen separation type the fine powder is drawn
through a screen or sieve and the coarser particles
fall back for additional grinding. In the air sepa-
ration type a stream of air at constant velocity pick's

up the fine material and carries it away. If the
velocity of the stream of air is increased it will
be able to support heavier particles and a coarser
product will result, but if the velocity of the air
is decreased and especially if the direction of the
stream is suddenly changed, the heavier particles
will not be supported and only the fine powder will
be discharged. Thus the degree of fineness can be
regulated. The mills now used in central stations
have capacities of from 5 to 9 tons per hour, but
some are being installed with capacities up to 18
tons per hour and there is a strong demand for
mills of very much higher capacity. The output of
a mill depends to a large extent on the quality of
the coal.
Conveying and Storing
The powdered coal is not ordinarily used at once,
because the demands of the boiler do not always
coincide with the rate of pulverizing and also be-
cause some provision against shut-downs of the
pulverizing plant for incidental repairs is desired.


March, 1925
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Storage bins having a capacity sufficient for about
eight to twelve hours' boiler operation are provided.
There are two main systems of distributing pow-
dered coal to the different boilers. In the direct
system the coal is blown directly to the furnaces
from the pulverizing room in a current of low pres-
sure air. In the indirect system, illustrated in Fig.
2, the coal is distributed by screw conveyors or by
compressed air to bins situated convenient to the
furnaces and is then fed to the furnaces as needed.
Feeding and Burning
To feed coal from a bin at a definite rate is not
as simple as it might appear. Even under constant
head powdered coal will flow at rates which vary
with the dryness, fineness and aeration.
The feeder for supplying the powdered fuel to
the burner consists of a cast iron screw revolving
in an enclosed casing at the bottom of a hopper.
Coal is fed to the screw by gravity. When the
coal reaches the end of the screw it meets and is
thoroughly mixed with a stream of air which acts
as the carrying medium from the feeder. Only
about 10% of the air required for combustion is
introduced in this way and it produces a heavy
mechanical gas which passes to the burner. The
remainder of the air for combustion enters through
the air ports in the burner and through the auxiliary
air openings in the furnace. Group feeders consist-
ing of a number of screws placed side by side are
used with large boiler units.
The purpose of the burner, one type of which
is shown in Fig. 3, is to mix the fuel with addi-
tional air and to inject this mixture into the furnace
in such a manner as to secure complete combustion
and without injury to the furnace or the boiler.
At the present the best method seems to be to
direct the fuel downward into the furnace and then
allow the flame to be bent upward toward the
heating surface by the draft. With the furnace
as now built and operated, tests have shown that
the maximum temperature (say about 2700° F.)
occurs near the bend of the flame. Up to this point
in its path the flame has been receiving more heat
by combustion than it has been dissipating to the
surroundings. The flame as it leaves the zone of
maximum temperature cools slowly and isother-
mals of 2400° F. will include a large proportion of
the furnace volume.
Furnaces for pulverized fuel are generally
thought of as being quite large; they are large,
but the comparison is frequently made with the
furnaces as constructed a number of years ago and
for moderate capacities. They are not very much
larger than some of the more recent stoker-fired
furnaces (plus their ash pits) designed for high
capacities. The furnaces for pulverized fuel are
made large in order to provide a flame path suffi-
ciently long to enable the small particles of fuel to
burn in suspension. This requires from one to two
seconds. Impingement of the flame against the
furnace walls is detrimental to the life of the
furnace.
Having set forth the general features of this
method of preparing and burning coal, attention
will now be directed to some of the results secured.
Tests of one of the pulverized-coal-burning 3060 hp.
Stirling Duplex boilers in the Lake Shore Station
of the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company
made May-July, 1924, showed that the efficiency,
in terms of heat absorbed by boiler and superheater
in per cent of heat supplied in the coal as fired,
increased from 82.4% at 50% of rating to 85.2%
at 100% of rating and then dropped off to 81.3%
at 270% of rating. With the economizer included,
the corresponding efficiencies were 88.6%, 91.2%
and 89.8%.
The flame temperature was 2440° at 100% of rat-
ing with 15.2% CO2 and increased to 25(50° at
270% of rating while the CO2 content dropped off
to 14.2%.
At 50% of rating the energv required by the
conveyors, mills and exhausters, feeders, primary
air fans and induced-draft fans, was 29 kw.-hr. per
ton, at 100% of rating 27 kw.-hr. per ton, and at
270% of rating 32 kw.-hr. per ton.
In general, the tests made at the various plants
using pulverized coal show that with reasonable-
care an over-all boiler efficiency of 80 to 85 per
cent can be maintained over a wide range of loads.
The successful application of powdered coal to
steam boiler practice has not been without its diffi-
culties. High efficiency is obtainable because the
coal can be burned almost completely with very lit-
tle excess air; but low excess air causes high fur-
nace temperature which in turn causes the ash to
fuse. Most of the trouble experienced in connec-
tion with pulverized fuel has been caused by ash.
When ash is subjected to increasing temperatures
it changes gradually from the solid to the liquid
state, first becoming soft and sticky and then pass-
ing through various stages of viscosity until it be-
comes fluid and resembles molten iron. As long
as the ash is viscous and moves slowly over the
furnace lining it adheres to the surface but does not
damage the brick. However, when it becomes
fluid and the surface of the brick is at the temper-
ature of the running slag it penetrates the brick,
washes it away, and thus destroys the furnace lin-
ing by erosion. Of course the furnace temperature
could be kept below the.fusion point of the ash
by increasing the amount of excess air, but this
would sacrifice one of the principal advantages in
the use of pulverized fuel, namely, high efficiency.
One way to lower the temperature of the brick-work
and reduce the erosion of the furnace lining is by

PROFS. ZIWET AND WAIT RESIGN
By FRED GOELLNEB, '25 E
AT a recent meeting of the Board of Regents, the
resignations of two of the oldest members of
the Engineering College faculty were accepted. It
is with considerable regret that we see the passing
of Professor Alexander Ziwet, head of the Depart-
ment of Mathematics, and of Professor William H.
Wait, of the Department of Modern Language,
because we realize how great has been their inllu-
PROF. ALEXANDER ZIWET
ence in building up the Michigan of to-day. The
Technic takes pleasure in presenting the following
short sketches of the lives and work of these two
men.
Alexander Ziwet was born in Breslau, Germany,
seventy-two years ago. He graduated from the
Gymnasium of Glogau and later entered the Karl-
srhue Polytechnic Hochschule where he studied
under Professor Wilhelm Schell. He received the
degree, Civil Engineer, in 1880.
Having heard so much of the engineering oppor-
tunities in America and having become acquainted
with several Americans while in Karlsruhe, he
came to the United States in the fall of 1880. He
first found employment with the United States Lake
Survey in Detroit and later with the United States
Coast and Geodetic Survey in the computing divi-
sion at Washington, D. C. His connection with the
University of Michigan dates from 1888, when he
came to Ann Arbor as instructor in the Mathe-
matical Department. He was promoted to Assist-
ant Professor in 1891 and then to Professor in 1904.
He has been head of the Department of Mathe-
matics in the Engineering College since 1897.
PROF. WILLIAM HENRY WAIT
As a mathematician, Professor Ziwet is known
throughout the United States and his book on
Theoretical Mechanics is conceded to be the best
on that subject in the country. His books, like his
lectures, are accurate and concise and contain many
points of view not usually found in college text-
books. Besides his "Theoretical Mechanics," he
has written with Professor Field, "Analytical Me-
chanics," and with Professor Hopkins, "College
Algebra and Analytical Geometry." In his teach-
ing he excells as a lecturer; his presentations are
models of clarity and form. His favorite work has
been in mechanics and mathematical physics, in
which subjects he is, without doubt, one of the most
widely read and best informed men. Professor Zi-
wet was Vice-President of the American Mathe-


March, 1925
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
inatical Society in 1902-03 and served on the Edi-
torial Board of the Society's Bulletin for many
years. He is a member of the Mathematical Asso-
ciation of America and of the French and German
Mathematical Societies. In Ann Arbor, he is a
Past-President of the Research Club and has served
as a member of the Executive Board of the Gradu-
ate School.
To know Professor Ziwet well, it is necessary to
have had long acquaintanceship with him. Very
quiet and reserved, he is a man of wide reading and
profound thought. He amassed a large private li-
brary, the major portion of which he has given to
the University. Among the books contributed,
there are many of great value, covering almost
every field of human thought. He reads, writes,
and speaks Russian, Italian, French, German and
Knglish, and is well versed in Greek and Latin. He
is familiar with the masters in painting and music,
and has a discriminatng taste for the best in art.
Although always considerate of others, he does
not mince words to speak the truth, even though it
may hurt. A conservative by reputation, Profes-
sor Ziwet, nevertheless, always holds progressive
views. He stands for "the highest ideals and stand-
.irds in engineering education and is a xealous ad-
vocate of a' more liberal and cultural training for
engineers.
William Henry Wait, the son of Nelson and
Catherine Root Wait, was born December 30, 1854,
in McConnell, Illinois. He received his prepara-
tory-eductaion in the public schools of Freeport.
Illinois, and in the Preparatory School for North-
western University at Evanston from which Uni-
versity he graduated with the degree of A. B. in
1879. As a young man in college, Wait was a
very active member of his class. He sang in the
Northwestern Male Quartet and in the Mixed Quar-
tet. The newspapers of that day testify to the fact
that he had "the richest and deepest voice in the
vicinity of Chicago." He also was one of the class
orators at the University graduation exercises.
Before coming to the University of Michigan, in
1895. Professor Wait had already gained a wide
experience in teaching. For three years after gradu-
ation he taught in the High School of Peoria, Illi-
nois, and continued his graduate work at North-
western, receiving his M. A. in 1882. From 1883
to 1890 he was Professor of Latin and Modern
Languages in Illinois Wesleyan University at
Bloomington, Illinois. It was during this period
that he was called upon to act as President of that
institution (1887-1888) and, for the next two years,
as Dean, lie was honored with the degree of Doc-
tor of Philosophy (on thesis) by Allegheny College.
Meadvillc, Pennsylvania, in 1888. The five years
following were divided between work as Classical
Instructor in Latin and Greek in the Peoria High
School and in graduate work in Latin and Greek
at the University of Berlin and the University of
Bonn, Germany. One summer was spent in inde-
pendent study in Paris.
Professor Wait's connection with the University
of Michigan dates from 1895 when he came here
as instructor in Greek and Sanscrit in the Literary-
College. On account of the decrease in the num-
ber of students taking Greek resulting from the
elimination of that subject as a requirement for tlv
degree of A. B., he was transferred to the Depart
ment of German. From 1904 to 1912, he was in
charge of the Modern Language Department of the
Engineering College and since then, has been As-
sociate Professor and Professor of Modern Lan-
guages.
One of the outstanding features about Professor
Wait is his grasp and knowledge of languages and
his ability to impart this knowledge to others. No
doubt his success as a teacher is due to his great
devotion to his profession. lie has always been
an ardent lover of good music. He began its study
in early youth and pursued it constantly until his
graduation from the University, numbering among
his instructors in that subject, Sternberg, a former
German opera singer. Professor Wait is very fond
of, flowers, the composition and harmony of his
gardens evoking much favorable comment bv his
friends.
Although he is not a prolific writer. Professor
Wait has written and delivered several lectures on
German literary writers and on Greek and Latin
topics. He published two books, "The Orations
of Lysias" (Greek) in 1898 and a "German Science
Reader for Scientific and Technical Students," in
1907. Of these books, there have been several
editions and they are still in use as textbooks. He
is a member of the American Philological Associa-
tion, the Modern Language Association of America,
Beta Theta Pi, Phi Beta Kappa, the American Red
Cross, and the Ann Arbor Federation of Art. He
has been an active worker with the student Y. M.
C. A. of Ann Arbor, holding at one time the posi-
tions of Secretary and Member of the Board. He
married Clara Widenham Hadley of Peoria Illi-
nois, in 1888.
Both men have been teaching in the University
for many years. Professor Ziwet having come here
thirty-six years ago and Professor Wait having
taught continuously for almost thirtv years. Al-
though we are sorry to see them retire from active
service, we hope that, by their presence in Ann
Arbor, they may, for many years to come, continue
to exert a powerful influence toward the mainten-
ance of high standards and ideals in the College
of Engineering and in the Universitv.

THE DISCOVERY OF MANGANESE STEEL
Its Metallurgical Paradoxes
HADFIELD'S discovery of manganese steel as
a result of research practically started the
study of alloy steels. Before him, Mushet had,
indeed, worked out empirically a self-hardening
steel for metal-cutting tools, but it gave no such
impetus to research in the field of useful metals.
As a young man Hadfield started experimenting in
his father's steel foundry to see if he could find a
hard steel suitable for tramcar wheels. He melted
his mixtures in crucibles and tested his products by
the means then at hand,—the file, chisel, forge,
magnet, and hardening and tempering. These were
enough to enable him when he first made an alloy
coming within the definition of manganese steel to
realize that he was dealing with a new metal.
Before his time, everyone
who had tried the effect of in-
creasing manganese in steel had
found that the steel was made
harder and less ductile with
each increase, so that if 2.5 per
cent were present the product
was too hard and brittle to be
of any use. The highest pro-
portion ever added had been 3.5
per cent, which made the steel
even more brittle. Naturally it
was believed that more man-
ganese would merely result in
still greater weakness.
Hadfield,however, took noth-
ing for granted but tried every-
thing and as a result found the
new alloy which, when it contained about 13 per
cent of manganese, and was properly heat-treated,
had maximum combined properties of strength and
toughness. He told his father, Robert Hadfield.
and his superintendent, Mr. Mallaband, about his
discovery. They were naturally skeptical and told
him that he would better repeat his experiments.
He did so with the same result and then they began
to take notice.
Here was a high-carbon steel which in several
ways was the opposite of what would be expected
by anyone familiar with iron. A magnet would
riot attract it, and when heated to a bright orange
heat and cooled quickly, as by immersion in cold
water, it was given extraordinary ductility. There
were other less notable features but these were
enough to excite astonishment.
Naturally, the first attempts to adapt the new
hard metal were for cutting purposes, particularly
IT has been said that the ex-
istence of our present civili-
zation would be impossible
without the many valuable
uses of steel and its alloys. Of
this group of alloys, none satis-
fy such a complex combination
of properties as manganese
steel, a product of systematic
research. Hard, strong, duc-
tile, non-magnetic, resistant to
abrasion — all these desirable
properties are possessed by this
wonder metal.
for metals, but experiments in that direction came
to naught. The great field for this steel, resistance
to abrasion, particularly by earthy materials such
as rocks and ores, was not fairly recognized until
ten years after the steel was first made.
The discovery, as the result of systematic re-
search, of a metal having such unique properties
as manganese steel, started other steel-makers to
see whether additional useful alloys could be found.
As a result of these activities, which eventually ex-
tended throughout the civilized world, many alloy
steels have been developed of exceeding import-
ance, which have advanced materially the useful
arts and particularly the conquest of distance on
land, in the air and under the sea.
This discovery also argues
strongly for research even with-
out a definite object. Hadfield
was searching for a hard steel
for another purpose. He had
no idea of finding a non-mag-
netic or water toughening steel.
So anyone has a chance of find-
ing something new and useful
in any systematic investigation
or research which explores any
unknown field of knowledge.
As usual the inventors re-
ward was in this case an ex-
tremely small part of the bene-
fit of manganese steel to the
world. Years passed before the
various uses for the steel were
found. Everyone disbelieved when told of it.
Trials for the various purposes had to be made
to show its fitness. The development of the busi-
ness side called for the liberal expenditure of time,
effort and money. The life of the patent, fourteen
years, is too short a time to enable the inventor of
anything of such extreme novelty to be suitably
recompensed in a business way, though he may, as
Sir Robert has, find satisfaction in having for-
warded the welfare of the world in so gre.it a de-
gree.

TECHNICAL ABSTRACTS
On Government Ownership of Railroad
Not long ago Hon. James C. Davis, Director
General of Railroads, now engaged in winding up
the affairs of the United States Railroad Admin-
istration, said in a public address:
"If the railroad ownership and operation is
thrown into the maelstrom of politics, competition,
especially in the way of good service, ceases; the
incentive in the way of personal endeavor to suc-
ceed is gone; promotion in service would depend
upon political pull, rather than faithful performance
of duties and controlling ability; wages and hours
of service would be determined by resolutions in
conventions, political or otherwise; extensions and
capital investments would depend upon Congress-
ional action rather than commercial necessity, and
the greatest and most efficient transportation sys-
tem in the world would be deprived of that irre-
sistible and invincible desire to succeed, born of
personal ambition, which is always present in pri-
vate enterprise, and wholly wanting in the ordinary
routine of Government service.
"No greater mistake, in my judgment, could be
made, nor a more expensive experiment be under-
taken than to have the Government permanently
take over and operate the great railroad systems of
this country."
The man just quoted has had actual experience
and responsible connection with Government opera-
tion. It seems that this considered judgment con-
cerning this very important subject should have
greater weight than the conclusions of any man.
be he ever so able, but who has no personal and
practical knowledge of the matter.
Fuels for Diesel Engines
In discussing the future of the fuel supply for
Diesel engines, it may be observed that the fuel-
oil production in the United States in 1923
amounted to about 725,700,000 bbls., representing a
30 per cent, increase over 1922. It is more than
twice the output of 1918. It is approximately 40
million barrels more than the total world's produc-
tion in 1920. In 1923 about 82 million barrels of
crude petroleum was imported, while the export
of crudes was only 17 million barrels. The stock-
increased more than 79 million barrels. At the end
of the year the total stocks amounted to 333 mil-
lion barrels, sufficient at the December rate of con-
sumption for 163 days.
In this connection it may also be mentioned that
the Department of the Interior reports annual con-
sumption of fuel oil for production of electricity of
about 13,200,000 bbls. for 1922. It is estimated
that of this about 12,000,000 bbls. were burned under
steam boilers in electric-generating stations. As-
suming a price of $1.50 per barrel and a fuel con-
sumption ratio of 1 to 2 (0.6 Ib. against 1.2 Ib. per
kw-hr.) the saving that could be effected by burn-
ing this oil in Diesel engines instead of under steam
boilers would amount to $9,030,000 per annum.
One of the chief advantages of the Diesel engine
is that it can work with oils of a high flash point.
The number of fuels suitable for Diesel engines is
consequently very great.
Location of Ships by Sound and Radio
Waves
In co-operation with the Coast and Geodetic
survey a method has been developed for locating
iccurately the position of a surveying ship when
the visibility is so poor that the coast cannot be
seen. The method employed involves the combined
use of acoustic and radio signals. A small bomb
is exploded near the ship, the instant of the explo-
sion being recorded on a chronograph on board.
The sound wave produced by the bomb is picked up
by under-water microphones located at two or more
known positions along the shore. When the sound
signal reaches the microphone it is automatically
sent back to the ship by radio, where the instant of
its arrival is recorded on the chronograph. The
time required for the signal to travel from the ship
to each shore station can then be found by muti-
plying the time by the speed of sound in sea water.
With this information the position of the ship can
be quickly determined. The method is now in
daily use by the Coast and Geodetic Survey in con-
nection with sounding operations off the Pacific
coast. Formerly surveying operations were often
limited to five or six days in each month, due to
the visibility being so poor that the shore stations
could not be seen.

Diexel Engines for Shipping Board Vessel*

The expenditure of $25.000,000 on the Dieseliza-
tion of Shipping Board vessels has been assured by
the passage of legislation to that effect by the
Senate. The bill previously had been approved by
the House. The President's signature is certain to
be forthcoming. The equipping of these ships with
internal-combustion engines is expected to make
them readily salable, or at least to make them
attractive to operators on a leasing basis.

building the furnace walls with wide air spaces,
through which a large proportion of the air for
combustion passes on its way to the furnace. The
purpose is to take heat away from the furnace lin-
ing where it is not wanted and deliver it to the com-
bustion chamber where it is wanted. Recent ex-
perience seems to show that a better way to prevent
erosion of the furnace lining is to keep the furnace
temperature slightly below that of the running slag
by exposing a large amount of boiler heating surface
to radiation from the furnace. At present the trend
of development is toward almost complete water
cooling by means of water screens placed near the
bottom of the furnace and in front of the brick
work of the furnace walls. These water screens are
connected with the water in the boiler and provide
additional heating surface exposed to radiant heat.
In this way the furnace is almost surrounded by
water heating surface. These screens shield the
walls of the furnace from the high temperatures
which have been responsible for a large proportion

instruction in municipal government, public finance,
accounting, and so forth. The course is given with
the assistance of the staff of the Detroit Bureau of
Governmental Research, and before the degree of
Master of Arts, or Master of Science is conferred,
the candidate must have had at least three months
of actual service in a municipal position, or a bureau
of municipal research. Several important manager-
ships, among them Clarksburg, W. Va., Ashtabula,
Ohio, and Pontiac, Mich., are now held by gradu-
ates of our course in Municipal Administration.
Similar courses are given by the Institute of Public
Administration in New York and the School of
Citizenship, Syracuse University.
The ideal toward which the city manager plan
is moving, is, of course, the professionalization of
municipal service. The time has already come when
a limited number of young men may be confidently
offered a career of this kind. The time will come
when city engineering, public health administration,
municipal corporation law will be definite profes-
sional specialties for which students will prepare.
Crowning all these professions will be the city
managership. There are great attractions in pub-
lic service. The salaries are smaller than those
which can be earned in private employment, but the
opportunities for service and the variety and the
intrest of the human contracts are great. With
a large percentage of young men these considera-
tions have always and will always outweigh those
of purely mercenary value.

The average tensile strength for coke iron, 20,866
pounds per square inch, is below the lowest value
found for charcoal iron, and the average tensile
strength for charcoal iron, 27,322 pounds per square
inch, is above the highest value for coke iron. This
same relation is evident for the transverse strengths.
The coke irons vary between 2,030 and 2,900 with
an average of 2,532 pounds; whereas, the charcoal

samples give minimum and maximum values re-
spectively of 2,500 and 3,700, with an average value
of 3,188 pounds.
Fig. 1 showing the transverse strengths and Fig.
3 giving the tensile strengths, will perhaps present
the picture more forcibly than it may be obtained
from a comparison of the tabulated data. The
data is plotted on silicon content as the abscissa.
These figures which represent the average of
many tests prove that there is good agreement be-
tween the strengths of the irons and the methods
used to produce them. There can be little doubt
that the coke irons tend to be weaker than the char-
coal irons. Furthermore, the difference appears to
be a chemical one because it persists through the
remclting of the iron. Examination of Table 5
shows this difference to persist through a second
remelt and removes any question of its effect.
Silicon Effect Does Not Show Well Defined
Relationship
Strangely enough there is no well defined rela-
tion existing between the silicon content of the
irons and their physical properties or between any
of the commonly determined chemical elements
and these physical properties. It must be borne
in mind, however, that the effect of the silicon is
minimized by the use of dried molds and the 1J4
inch section.
These statements do not mean that the physical
properties would not be influenced by the addition
of material quantities of these elements. They
merely mean that within the limits in which the
elements are present in the irons listed, they do

not appear to account for the marked variations in
properties which are noted.
Second Remelt Made
In order to show that the results obtained on the
first remelt were peculiar to the iron, rather than
the melting conditions, some of the irons were re-
melted a second time. Similar physical and chem-
ical tests were made on the sample resulting from
the second melting as in the first two cases. These
samples were given the same number as the sam-
ples of previous melts, and the prefix XX was used
to denote the second remelt.
The data resulting from this set of tests is tabu-
lated in Table 5 together with the data on the pre-
vious heats for the same irons. It will be observed
that the characteristics of the irons were changed
but very little by the second remelting, proving that
the results obtained on the first remelt were reli-
able and not the result of any irregularities in the
melting conditions.

and second remelts. The maximum difference is
12 per cent, while the average is approximately 5
per cent.
Fig. 2 gives the comparative strengths of coke
and charcoal irons of practically the same chemical
composition. It is practically impossible to get
different samples from the furnaces and remelt
them to give exactly the same metalloid content.

enough alike in this respect to show conclusively

that there is a decided difference in the character-

in chemical composition as commonly determined.
Comparison of Test Results
Irons Nos. X60 and X64, having a silicon con-
tent of 1.90 and 1.91, can be compared with iron
No. X37 with a silicon content of 1.99 per cent.
The manganese, sulphur and phosphorus contents
are very nearly the same, and yet No. X60 has a
tensile strength of 29,800 pounds per square inch;
Xo. X64, 29,900 pounds per square inch, while the
tensile strength of No. X37 is only Zl.oOO pounds
per square inch. Again, the transverse strength of
No. X60 is 3,700 pounds; No. X(&gt;4 is 3.450 pounds,
while the transverse strength of No. X37 is only
2,450 pounds. Remelting and retesting these three
irons gives a transverse strength for No. XX60
of 3,500 pounds; No. XX64 of 3,300 pounds, and

X60 and X64. having about the same strength,
average 38 per cent stronger in tensile strength
and 46 per cent stronger in transverse strength
than No. X37. Remelting and retesting these three
irons showed them all to be practically the same
strength as before and so still showed irons Nos.
X60 and X64 to be 46 per cent stronger than No.
X37. These irons have practically the same chem-
ical constituents, the only known difference between
them is that Nos. X60 and X64 were made by the
charcoal process, while No. X37 was made by the
coke process.
The same comparisons can be made between
No. X74, a charcoal iron, which averages 28 per
cent stronger than No. X38, a coke iron; No. X75, a
charcoal iron which averages 40 per cent stronger

than No. X4, a coke iron; and between No. X76,
which averages 41 per cent stronger than No. X3,
a coke iron. The outstanding difference which cor-
responds to difference in strength between these
irons is the process of manufacture.
Microstructure Shows Differences in Graphite
Formation
An important differential between these strong
and weak irons has been noted. This is in the
microstructure. As was stated at the beginning
of this paper over one hundred irons have been
examined in collecting these data. One of the
most pronounced differences in all the specimens
examined was the formation of the graphite flakes.
These flakes in the weak irons are long and cut
the matrix of ferrite at many angles. In the stronger
irons, the graphite flakes are much smaller, and the
ferrite has better continuity. Examination of the
photomicrographs in this paper will show this dif-
ference better than it can be described. Four irons
are shown, two coke irons and two charcoal irons,
each as pig iron, first remelt and secend remelt.
All of the microsections were made from the \]/\

by the transverse test. All of the photomicro-
graphs are in the unetched condition and magnified
100 times. As will be observed, there is a general
tendency for the graphite flakes to remain the same
through the remeltings, although in both charcoal
irons the graphite flakes seem to be refined in the
first remelt. It may be that the poor casting con-

dition as previously described caused the flakes to
be rather coarse in the pig iron. There appears to
be little tendency for the graphite in the coke iron
to be refined in remelting.
The writer does not claim that all coke irons
look like Nos. 37 and 2, nor that all charcoal irons
look like Nos. 60 and 76. The stronger coke irons
have smaller flakes than the weak coke irons arid
the weak charcoal irons have larger flakes than the
strong ones. However, there is a distinct tendency
for the coke irons to have large flakes and for tbr
charcoal irons to have small flakes.
While this difference in microstructure has been
observed, no reason for its cause can be given. It
is logical enough that the strength of the metal
should vary with the size of the graphite flakes but

what causes the variation of the graphite flakes?
The author hopes that further work may be done
on this problem and that some relation will be found
between blast furnace conditions and the produc-
tion of high grade iron, so that the variation in
characteristics of pig irons of the same chemical
analysis may be controlled, and poor pig irons
eliminated.

would be needed and the erosion, moreover, would
be distributed more evenly along the rim instead of
being concentrated as it now is in one spot.
With this idea in mind, the Niagara Falls Power
Company constructed a model of the Falls which
is shown under various conditions of operation, in
Figures 1, 2 ,and J. As a reproduction the model
is as nearly exact as human skill can make it. It
is one one-hundredth of the actual size of the real
Falls. A pump supplies a quantity of water exactly
proportional to that which flows in the river nearby.
In any one of the photographs shown, two wires
will be seen stretched across the gorge just below
the Horseshoe Fall. The first wire indicates the
position of the crest line of the Horseshoe in 1764
and the second represents its location in 1842. Small
models of the power houses are placed in their
proper positions and under each is an intake which
withdraws a quantity of water exactly proportional
to that drawn by the actual plant. Means are pro-
vided for cutting off the diverted water, for with-
drawing the present diversion, and for withdrawing
a quantity proportional to 100,000 c.f.s. in the actual
river. Different iorms of-remedial works are-pro-
vided in pieces and these can be placed in positions
for securing the desired effects.
Mention has been made of the effect of diversion
in lessening erosion. It is logical, then, that in-
creasing the diversion should further decrease the
rate of recession of the Horseshoe toe. It would,
however, so lessen the amount of water going over

Items of Interest to Michigan Engineers
'25 Engineers Present Class Memorial
The class memorial being presented to the Uni-
versity by the present Senior Class is in the form
of two bronze ornamental lamps, each mounted
beside a central door at the entrance to the new
East Engineering building. They are about forty
inches high and express what might be termed
characteristics of the Italian Renaissance. The
gift was very appropriate and the lamps lend a
desirable color to the entrance they adorn. One
thing sure, the Freshmen will not have to pass
between them under the embarrassing circum-
stances that are so commonly associated with the
Senior Benches, the gifts of former classes, neither
will they be tempted to sit on these gifts against
the rules of tradition.
Tau Beta Pi Activities
On Tuesday, January 20, three men were elected
to membership in Tau Beta Pi, National Honorary
Engineering Fraternity, and banqueted. The new
members are Mr. Alex. Dow, President of the
Detroit Edison Company, who was elected as an
honorary member; R. Likert, '26E, and C. H. Will,
'26E. At the banquet \V. H. Cooper, '25E, offi-
ciated as toastmaster, and the address of welcome
was given by W. W. Spanagel, '25E. Addresses
were given by Professor V. II. Lane, of the Law
School, and Mr. Dow.
The Executive Council, or governing body of the
national organization of Tau Beta Pi, is now lo-
cated at the Michigan Chapter, the members of this
Council being:
Prof. A. D. Moore, President.
Prof. H. H. Higbie, Vice-President.
Prof. C. T. Johnston, Councillor.
Quarterdeck
The log of Quarterdeck, the honorary Marine
Engineering Society, records considerable achieve-
ment for the past semester. The organization is
made up of Junior and Senior students in Marine
Engineering, and its purpose is to direct and em-
ploy the interest these students have in the phases
of marine work that lie outside their regular cur-
riculum. Technical reports are prepared by the
members and are presented at the meetings of the
society. The reading of a report is followed by
a general discussion of the subject.
Four reports have been presented since the be-
ginning of the college year. They are:
"A Method of Comparing Profits as Applied to
Freighters on the Great Lakes," by R. E. Fisher.
"The Automatic Steering of Ships," by J. A.
Miner.
"Fire Prevention on Shipboard," by F. A.
Leisen.
"The Most Profitable 8,800 Ton Cargo Ship to
Run Between Philadelphia and Buenos Aires,"
by R. E. Fisher.
These reports are an illustration of the sort of
work undertaken by the members of Quarterdeck.
The officers for this semester are:
•R. Edwyne Fisher Commodore
Frederic A. Leisen Vice-Commodore
Mark L. Ireland, Jr., Purser
Christopher E. Blaydon Steward
New Courses In Naval Architecture
Since the war, transportation costs have risen
to a point where any relief is welcome. The United
States possesses wonderful natural waterways and
waterway systems which, with the exception of the
Great Lakes, have had little or no development.
As the cost of water transportation is in general
only one-fifth that of rail transportation, there has
recently been a tendency to use this method where
possible. A good deal yet remains to be done in
connecting up the various systems of transporta-
tion, but without doubt one of the next big develop-
ments in this country will be that of water trans-
portation.
With this in mind, the Department of Naval
Architecture of the University of Michigan has
recently added to its curriculum a group of studies
called "Water Transportation." In general the
fundamental work in engineering will remain the
same, but for the purely design courses there will
be substituted Economics, Transportation, Finance
and other options in Business Administration. The
purpose of the course is to fit men more for the
operation of ships than for their design.

What Ho! Conspicuous Juniors!
While spring and its attendant robin red breasts
have been holding out on us, the Junior Engineers
have taken optimism into their own hands and
have blossomed forth in jackets of a brilliant ruby
hue. Just a word of warning to you of the so-
called "jolly" class. As a man likes short pay, so
does a certain popular domestic animal love the
ray of light with the shortest wave-length that
might be reflected from your "Jacob's Coat." If
you wish to cultivate both the respect of that oft
mentioned popular animal and the natives at home,
you had better leave your jacket within the bounds
of the city where individualism is free to play.
Scabbard and Blade Initiates
Scabbard and Blade, National Honorary Military
Fraternity, held its initiation November 11, at
which time the following cadet officers in the R. O.
T. C. unit were received into the organization:
Capt. F. J. Goellner, 25E
Capt. C. F. Anderson, 24
Lieut. P. E. Marion, 24
Lieut. R. N. Cross, 26
Lieut. G. A. McBride, 27E
Lieut. J. W. Hickman, 26E
Lieut. D. C. Green, '25E.
Lieut. P. S. Hirt, 25
Lieut. F. W. Cron, 27E.
Lieut. R. T. Schlossberg, United States Army,
was initiated as an honorary member at the same
time.
At the initiation banquet following, M. M. Mad-
din, '25L, Captain of the local company, or chapter,
welcomed the initiates, who responded individu-
ally. Maj. W. T. Carpenter, United States Army.
Professor of Military Science and Tactics, gave
the principal address of the evening.
The Aeronautical Society
In the past few weeks some of the most promin-
ent men in the aeronautical field have addressed
the Aeronautical Society. Among these have been
Lieut. Harris of the Army Air Service and Mr.
Starr Truscott, WE.
Lieut. Harris, who is Chief of the Flying Sec-
tion, Engineering Division, Army Air Service,
brought the official World's Flight Pictures, as well
as two reels of film entitled "The Birth of Avia-
tion," and one reel upon insect dusting operations.
He gave a short talk before the moving pictures
were shown and supplemented the pictures with
explanatory remarks while they were being run.
Another speaker was Mr. Starr Truscott, '09E,
who has acquired international fame as the Design-
er of the "Shenandoah." Lantern slides were shown
in connection with his talk, which was about
lighter-than-air-craft. Mr. Truscott donated to the
Aeronautical Department a section of a triangular
truss identical to those used in the construction
of the "Shenandoah."
Professor Pawlowski, of the Aeronautical De-
partment, gave a talk before the Society Thursday,
February 12, upon recent developments in avia-
tion in Europe. Prof. Pawlowski has returned
from leave of absence, having visited the aviation
centers of the Continent during his leave.
Mr. W. B. Stout, President of the Stout Air-
plane Company, of Dearborn, Michigan, will ad-
dress the Society in the near future. o
The Michigan Shield
For the first time in the history of the local unit,
the R. O. T. C. is to have a publication truly its
own. "The Shield," which will appear May 25th,
will contain articles upon every activity in which
the R. O. T. C. engages. Some of the features will
be: Photographs of all the companies, the R. O.
T. C. Band, the members of the unit who will re-
ceive their commissions in the Officers' Reserve
Corps, the Rifle Team, and Scabbard and Blade.
There will be a snap-shot section, as well as a sec-
tion devoted to the Summer Camps.
A staff has been selected and an office assigned
to the new publication in the Old Engineering
Shops building. The staff of "The Shield" is as
follows:
A. H. Lince, '25E, Managing Editor.
J. D. Malnight, '25E, Advertising Manager.
F. W. Cron, '27E, Art Editor.
I. T. Masserman, '28, Circulation Manager.
"Genius is that infinite1 capacity for taking
pains, and the reason there are so few geniuses
is that very few take sufficient pains; they
lack thoroughness and persistency. An artist
once said that a certain picture took him three
weeks to paint, but he added, 'It took me
thirty years to learn how to paint it in three
weeks.' Tennyson wrote, 'Come Into the
Garden Maude' in five minutes, hut spent two
months improving it."

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
ENROLLMENT IN THE COLLEGE OF
ENGINEERING and ARCHITECTURE
While our idea of a good thing always infers
growth, we find on study of the records for enrol-
ment in our colleges, a marked decline since the
year 1920-21, the drop this year being greater than
those of the three preceding years. However there
is no cause for alarm since the same variations
are being experienced at other engineering institu-
of other colleges seem to indicate that the attend-
ance in engineering not only is not increasing but
on the contrary is decreasing. And this notwith-
standng the fact that the demand for engineer grad-
uates is keeping up if not actually increasing.
During the past year the National Industrial Con-
ference Board has conducted an investigation of the
relationships between the engineering schools and
industry, the results of which are contained in a
CHART 2
tions throughout the country. But we are prone to
ask, "What is the cause of such a state; has the pro-
fession lost some of its charm and attraction to
young men?" These and other interesting ques-
tions are raised and answered in the following ac-
count which is an extraction from Dean Coolcy's
Report of the President.
The attendance, including the Graduate School
and Summer Session, was 2096. This is a marked
falling off from the corresponding figures of last
year, which were 2499. In part the explanation is
simple enough. The extra load which came upon
us following the war reached its peak last year and
we are now back to what might have been the
normal had there been no war—possibly below what
might have been predicted. While the graduating
classes have been the largest in our historv the
entering classes have been growing smaller. The
junior college, it was thought, would produce pre-
cisely that result.
The junior college movement is so recent that
it cannot be said with certainty what its ultimate
effect will be. Hut the indications art.- that smaller
entering classes will not be compensated for by
larger upper classes; consequently the total attend-
ance will be smaller. Presumably many will gc
direct from the junior college to their life work
instead of the university. Another probable factor
is the growing tendency towards an education for
business in which the lure is greater earning power.
Whatever the cause, our own experience and that
1
special report (No. 25) in our library. Mr. Magnus
W. Alexander, Managing Director, in a recent letter
says:
"Our investigation has developed the fact that indus-
try may need about 400,000 more men for positions of
responsibility by 1930 than were employed in 1920, not
counting replacements. To meet this demand of approxi-
mately 40,000 annually, the Engineering Colleges are only
graduating men at the rate of 9,000 per year, a large per-
centage of whom will at first or eventually select work
other than in industry. Obviously, the problem of the
proper selection, education, and training of a sufficient
supply of young men capable of filling positions of tech-
nical and administrative responsibility is a great one, re-
quiring the attention of every progressive educator and
industrialist."
Mr. W. E. Wickenden, Assistant Vice President,
American Telephone and Telegraph Company, in a
recent address entitled "The Engineer as a Leader
in Business" says, with respect to form of educa-
tional preparation best adapted to the supervision
of operations which have a technological founda-
tion:
"*** the engineering graduate comes into competition
with the non-engineering graduate in a considerable area.
*** In such work technical training does not enable a
second-rate man to win out over an abler man with good
general education. Since there is no surplus of first-class
engineering graduates available, the present tendency is
to reserve these for positions which put a considerable
premium on technical education."
On the general aspects of the subject Mr. Wick-
enden says:
"*** there seems to be little difference of opinion on
the place of the engineer as a leader of industry. The
place is his by rights and he can fail to hold it only by
neglect of the broader aspects of his calling. The place
of the engineer as a leader of business does not seem
equally assured. Modern business is many-sided. It over-
laps the productive processes of industry and include--.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
them when the term is used in its broadest sense. The
term business also includes the problem of finance, of
marketing, of risk-bearing, of personnel, and of legal
relations."
From Mr. Wickenden's excellent paper I think
it may be fairly deduced that decreased attendance
in engineering may be due to a closer differentia-
tion by our young men of the fields of engineering,
industry, and business respectively. If this be true
its effect on the engineering curriculum will be im-
portant. In any event we need all the light obtain-
able. To that end I was very glad to avail myself
of the offer of one of our former students, Mr. Ray
B. Prescott of the class of 1913. to make a special
study of the attendance in several engineering col-
leges and of our own in particular.
"Chart 2 shows the trend since 1900 of four representa-
tive engineering schools compared with Michigan. These
trends seem to be similar in many respects and I believe
that what is common to these schools is probably com-
mon to most others.
"All these schools seem to have had quite a rapid en-
rollment increase to 1905 but have had little or no in-
crease since then; some of them even show a decline until
1917-18 when the war caused a sudden falling off. Two
of them declined for the two war years while the other
three dropped off for only one. All have had a sudden
increase since the war. This increase lasted until 1920-21
when they all showed a falling off in enrollments."
Decreased attendance in engineering is not in
itself to be deplored. Colleges have for years been
too crowded for good work. Facilities and staff
have been so fully occupied with undergraduate
work that there has been but little opportunity for
necessary development and for research. This has
given the appearance of standing still or even of go-
ing backward. Engineering education is certainly
at the crossing of the roads.
Wind Tunnel Nearing Completion
The wind tunnel in the East Engineering build-
ing will soon be completed. The machinery is now-
being installed and it is hoped that the Laboratory
will be ready for use by this Spring. This tunnel
will be the largest in the United States and will
make Michigan's Aeronautical Laboratory the most
complete in the country.
Prof. Pawlowski has just returned from a trip
to Europe where he visited all the principal Aero-
nautical laboratories. The information he obtained
will be of great value in the installation of Michi-
gan's wind tunnel.
Effect of Temperature Upon the Properties
of Metals
(A Review by Prof. C. Upthcgrove)
The pamphlet is a reprint of four papers from
the Proceedings of the American Society for Test
ing Materials, and the discussions presented at a
Symposium on the subject held at a joint meeting
of the American Society for Testing Materials and
the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, in
Cleveland, May 29, 1924.
The subject covered by the papers is one of great
importance. The use in central stations and power
plant installations, in oil refineries and elsewhere
of considerably higher temperatures and pressures
than were prevalent a few years ago has empha-
sized very forcibly, the necessity for an accurate
knowledge of the properties and hehavior of metals
under stress at elevated temperatures.
Four phases or diversions of the subject are con-
sidered. The first paper deals with industrial ap-
plications and the second with the methods of
testing at high temperatures and the last two papers
deal with available data on the physical properties
of irons, steels, and the non-ferrous metals.
Methods of testing have been reviewed with their
limitations and advantages. Representative data
on tensile, torsion, hardness, impact, crushing and
flow tests is presented for ferrous and non-ferrous
metals. In the ferrous field results are presented
for cast and malleable irons, cast steel, wrought
iron, carbon and alloy steels, "heat resisting" steels,
and in the non-ferrous field for copper, brasses,
bronzes, cupro nickel, nickel and nickel alloys,
aluminum and aluminum alloys and bearing
metals. A very essential and very valuable part
of the pamphlet is the bibliography containing 216
references arranged in chronological order.
The papers and discussions presented in the
pamphlet offer a very comprehensive review of the
present knowledge of the subject and should be of
decided value to anyone interested in the use of
metals at higher temperatures.
The pamphlet may be obtained from headquart-
ers of either of the societies.

Echoes from the Graduates
GARDNER STEWART WILLIAMS
Gardner S. Williams is at present a consulting
civil engineer residing in Ann Arbor, of nationally
wide activity and repute.
Gardner Williams was born in Saginaw, Michi-
gan, in 1866, and brought up on a ten-acre farm
nearby. His father was engaged in the lumber
business what, at that time,
was booming in northern
Michigan, and he allowed
Gardner constant access to the
mill, yard, and railroad. Thus
he came to an early under-
standing of the principles of
mechanics and machinery, and
with the free use of an unlim-
ited variety of tools, he suc-
ceeded in building a staunch
sailboat at the age of fifteen.
As a boy Williams was a
good rider and an excellent
shot. Strangely enough he
could shoot more accurately at
a moving target than at a sta-
tionary one. He read very ex-
tensively and whenever pos-
sible on the subject of Ameri-
can History. He made an ex-
haustive study of all underly-
ing and immediate causes, ef-
fects and reactions of the Civil
\\ ar, and he has always been
strongly attached to many vol-
umes which preserve the history of our nation. He
was graduated from the Saginaw High School in
1884, and was entered on the roll of the University
of Michigan the following fall.
Gardner Williams' boyhood activities and envi-
rons tasted of engineering, and members of both
sides of his family were engaged in that profession.
His father's cousin, Gardner F. Williams, as the
rght-hand man of Cecil Rhodes, had established
the first diamond mine in South Africa, and for
many years contributed to the development of the
Transvaal. The younger Gardner was at first un-
decided as to whether he would follow law or en-
GARDNER S.
gineering, since his grandfather, for whom he had
great respect, had been in Congress during the Mex-
ican War and had practised law in the East before
coming to Michigan. The question was settled by
his father one day, saying of the average lawyer
and the average engineer, that the latter seemed
to him the more honorable.
While in college he was better
than the average student and
an all around fellow. In order
to insure himself of exercise,
he purposely chose to room at
some distance from the campus
and for another reason, ate
only two meals a day. The
latter habit he has apparently
abandoned. His marks were
always good, he was popular
and he was active, and he was
noted for the thoroughness of
his work and the heighth of his
ideals. He was more than par-
tially responsible for the or-
ganization of the Engineering
Society; he was on the staff of
the TECHNIC and he had
more to do with the naming of
it than anvone else. From the
University of Michigan he
took the degrees of B.S. in 1889
WILLIAMS and C.E. in 1899.
Mr. Williams' first po-
sition was Assistant Engineer on Water
Works Construction at Bismarck, North Dakota,
in 1887. The following years he filled the
position of Resident Engineer on Water Works
Construction at Greenville, Michigan. In 1889 he
was Constructing Engineer for Water \Vorks at
Owosso, Mich. The next three years he was En-
gineer for the Russel Wheel and Foundry Com-
pany of Detroit, and the president of that corpora-
tion wrote of Williams, "Every problem on engi-
neering that came up seemed a pleasure to him.
and regardless of any work involved, he mastered
it."


March. 1925
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
From 1892 to 1898 Williams was Civil Engineer
for the Detroit Water Commission, and in this
capacity he discovered the source of the 1892 De-
troit typhoid epidemic to have been in the river
at Port Huron.
In 1898 he was Professor of Experimental Hy-
draulics at Cornell University and in 1904 he en-
tered the faculty of this university as Head Pro-
fessor of Civil, Hydraulic, and Sanitary Engineer-
ing, succeeding Professor Charles A. Green. Be-
fore he came as a professor, he had shown his in-
terest in the university by assisting in the design
of the hydraulic laboratory. From 1903 to 1905
he was a member of the International Waterways
Commission. In 1911 he resigned from the faculty
of the University of Michigan.
In 1906 he went to Joliet, Illinois, as a member
of the Expert Commission on Sanitary District Con-
struction, and helped to set at rest the minds of the
people of Joilet who had been fearful of a flood
from the drainage canal. For the ten years fol-
lowing he was now here, now there, in the United
States and Canada, establishing and reconstructing
power stations, water works, and other hydraulic
civil developments until 1917 when war work called
him to the Engineers Corps as a major. Since the
war he has been designing and appraising engi-
neering work in many of the larger towns around
the State of Michigan, including recent reports
on an additional supply of water for Detroit and
environs.
Among other things Mr. Williams has designed
and constructed the storage reservoirs for the Great
Northern Power Company at Duluth, Minn.; the
dam at Des Moines, Iowa; the water power plant
of the Watab Pulp &amp; Paper Company on the Mis-
sissippi River at Sartell, Minn; the water works
plants at Ithaca, N. Y., and Grand Haven, Mich.,
and the power plants at Ann Arbor, Big Rapids,
Cheboygan, Alpena, Sturgis, and Sault Stc. Marie,
Mich. His more important expert services have
included testimony in the famous Chicago Drain-
age Canal Case, argued in the Supreme Court be-
tween the States of Missouri and Illinois, and pre-
sentations before the Canadian Prime Minister and
the International Waterways Commission of the
St. Lawrence Waterway Question. Mr. Williams
(in collaboration with Mr. Clarence W. Hubbell
and Mr. George H. Fenkell, both members of the
Engineering Class of 1893, who were in the employ
of the Detroit Water Board) was the author of
"Flow of Water in Pipes and the Effects of Curva-
ture." For this he was awarded the Norman Medal
of the American Society of Civil Engineers, which
is one of the highest awards of distinction that an
engineer can attain.
Gardner Williams has a high sense of the moral
obligations of the engineer, as the engineer's work
in so many cases means life and death to citizens.
He will not tolerate the slightest irresponsibility
or laxity in his assistants' work. His friends say
that he always does his thinking to himself, and
that when he talks, there is a reason for every-
thing he says. Dean Cooley characterizes Mr.
Williams as a "determined arguer, a splendid looser,
and one who can uphold his convictions against
those of his friends without impairing their friend-
ship."
Mr. Williams advises all those engineers who
are ambitious to refrain from specializing before
they are forced to do so. He believes every engi-
neer should be an educated man before he is an en-
gineer. The writer who is taking water power
engineering, asked his opinion as to the best courses
in which to specialize for that subject, and his reply
was, "If possible, take some courses which have no
bearing on special work; take chemistry, take phy-
sics, take astronomy and minerology and try to take
some courses in the other schools. Know your sub-
ject in the broadest possible way, because you will
probably be specializing in it the rest of your life."
Gardner Williams is a member of the following
societies; Michigan Engineering Society, Western
Society Engineers, American Institute Construction
Engineers, American Society Mechanical Engi-
neers, New England Water Works Association,
American Water Works Association, Founder of
Detroit Engineering Society, American Engineer-
ing Council (elected Vice-President in 1923),
American Society Civil Engineers (Director 1908

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
SAVING NIAGARA FALLS
(Continued from Page 28)
as to impair the beauty of the Falls by depleting
the American Fall and leaving the heels of the
Horseshoe completely dry. This is well illustrated
by Figs.l and 2. The former shows present condi-
tions: 56,000 c.f.s. diversion and no remedial
works; the latter shows conditions with 100,000
c.f.s. diversion and no remedial works. Both the
American and Horseshoe Falls are seriously de-
pleted by increasing the amount of water with-
drawn above the Falls if remedial works are not
installed.
In order that the scenic effects may be improved
above their present state with a reduced quantity
of water, two plans have been devised. The first
calls for an upper submerged weir to replenish the
American channel and a submerged weir near the
Horseshoe toe. The second calls for the same up-
per weir but artificial islands at the Horseshoe.
Upper Weir and Weir at Horseshoe
To remedy the depletion of the American chan-
nel incident to increased diversion, an upper weir
would have to be thrown out to mid-stream from
the Canadian short approximately half way from
the Ontario Power Company intake to Chippewa.
This weir would remove a little more water from
the main channel but the amount would be so small
that its removal would go unnoticed. The Ameri-
can Fall would be left as it is now, but less water
would be flowing over the Horseshoe.
In order to correct the flow of water over the
Horseshoe Fall with a diversion of 100,000 c.f.s,
this plan calls for a submerged weir to be placed
across the dee]) part of the main channel just above
the toe of the Horseshoe. This weir would be
curved in shape, with the concave side downstream.
By means of it, a large amount of water would be
thrown from the middle of the stream over to the
edges or heels of the Fall, and the erosion would
then be equalized all along the rim.
To install this weir, a temporary dyke would
have to be thrown out from one shore to the center
(jf the stream and half of the weir could then be
placed in position. Then this dyke would have to
be removed and a similar one would then have to
be thrown out from the other shore and the remain-
ing half of the weir could then be placed.
Since the upper weir would preserve the Ameri-
can Fall as it now exists and the lower weir would
increase the beauty of the Horseshoe Fall, this com-
bination would seem to suggest itself as a solution.
Fig. 3 shows the results of using both weirs. A
comparison of this illustration with Fig. 1 shows
that nearly twice as much water can be diverted
and the scenery actually improved by means of
the double weir system.
Upper Weir and Islands at Horseshoe
In the second plan, which calls for an upper weir
and artificial islands near the rim of the Horseshoe,
the upper weir would be identical with the one
described in the first plan. The islands, when com-
plete, would resemble the "Three Sisters" islands a
short distance upstream. They would have to In-
placed in position in the same manner as the lower
weir previously described. They would have a sub-
stantial concrete foundation and above this a suf-
ficient quantity of earth to permit the growing of
trees. By the time these trees had grown to some
size, the artificial islands would be as beautiful as
the Three Sisters Islands.
Although this latter plan might lend an addi-
tional attractiveness to the scenery, it would also
alter it somewhat radically, so it is doubtful whether
the use of islands as a corrective measure would
be advisable, even though the results obtained, as
far as throwing more water to the heels of the Fall
is concerned, would be as good as if the lower weir
were used.
Conclusion
Either of the two plans for remedial works will
accomplish a threefold purpose. First, it will make
possible the removal at some future date of nearly
twice the quantity of water for power development
that is now being used, thereby spreading over a
greater area the material blessings of cheap, de-
pendable electrical energy and will save more coal
for other uses by supplanting steam-produced elec-
tricity by hydro-electricity. Second, it will distrib-
ute the water of the main channel evenly over the
entire rim of the Horseshoe, thereby increasing the
width of the waterfall and improving vastly its
scenic beauty. Third, and most important, it will
effectively check the concentrated and rapid erosion
of the Horseshoe toe by equalizing the wear along
the entire rim. thereby preserving what is left of
the horseshoe shape and preventing the formation of
a deep chasm in its place.
The engineers who have worked upon these plans
are confident that equally good results could be
obtained from either one. But no matter what plan
is finally agreed upon, its successful consummation
will call for close co-operation between the two
countries. Certain it is that, regardless of whether
the increase of diversion is to come now or in the
future or at all,'one of these two plans or some-
thing closely akin to them should be adopted as
soon as possible in order that the present Falls may
be preserved for future generations to see.
The Niagara Falls Tower Company has offered
to place the model at the disposal of the engineers
of the two governments, or at the disposal of any
other engineers who have ideas on the question of
remedial works, and has offered to co-operate in
every way possible.

ELECTRIC RAILWAYS—Do WE NEED THEM?
By B. C. COBB
Vice-President of the Hndenpyl, Hardy &lt;f Co., Inc.. New York
THE degree of financial success attainable by
any business is regulated by two factors.
First, there must be a market for the product.
Second, the price received for the product must be
sufficient to pay all the costs
of supplying it, plus a reason-
able return to those who repre-
sent the capital invested. The
electric railway business is no
exception to these elementary
but fundamental economic
laws. On them rests the
answer to the question regard-
ing the permanency of the elec-
tric railway as a public servant
—the question singled out dis-
cussion today.
I am not going to burden
you with a long-winded his-
torical and statistical review
of the electric railway indus-
try, but I am going to refer as
briefly as possible to the evo-
lution that has taken place in
urban and interurban transpor-
tation. It is said that the first
street railway in this country was operated on
Fourth Avenue, in the City of New York, in 1832,
the cars being hauled by horses over light strap
rail. From this crude beginning afterwards came
the cable car, which was introduced to the San
Francisco public in 1873. This advance in the art
was succeeded by the establishment of an overhead
trolley system in Richmond, Virginia, in 1888—and
there began the electric railway systems that have
since been developed.
THE vital problem of mass
transportation has been
brought before the public eye in
a striking manner by the develop-
ment of the motorbus and its com-
petition with the street railways for
the patronage of those who ride.
Traffic congestion and ruthless com-
petition have thus far resulted, and
the solution points directly to a co-
ordination of the bus and street car
systems, one management in charge
to use each facility in its place. Mr.
B. C. Cobb, one of the foremost auth-
orities in the country on the trans-
portation subject, has permitted the
Technic to use his address, which we
think will be welcomed by all who
are interested in the application of
engineering to such an important
public service. —The Editor.
From 1888 up to the year 1916 electric railways
grew and prospered. Their securities were held in
high favor among investors because they believed
that generally speaking the local street car company
had the exclusive right to fur-
nish an indispensable service to
the public at a price fixed to
yield a satisfactory profit. They
reasoned that the business was
operated on a cash basis, that
it required a moderate work-
ing capital, and that the riding
habit would grow with the in-
crease in population of the
communities served. These fac-
tors seemingly combined to
make a very satisfactory earn-
ings position. This reasoning
and these factors, however,
were somewhat disarranged
and interfered with by the ad-
vent and the development of
the automobile. The market,
because of this development
for public transportation by
1916 was undergoing an im-
portant change. This change at first was almost
imperceptible. It has been gradual but far reaching
ever since and it has caused those responsible for
the management of traction properties many anx-
ious moments, and likewise has it aroused misgiv-
ings in the hearts of many people owning traction
securities as to the safety of their investment.
Growth of the Private Automobile
In 1913 approximately only 1,200,000 passenger
automobiles were registered, or one automobile to


May.
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
approximately every ninety persons in the country.
By 1923 this registration had grown to over 14,000,-
000, or one automobile to every eight persons. Un-
der ordinary conditions the electric railway industry
would have taken more serious cognizance of this
new form of competition and would have prepared
to meet it, but the war and its disastrous conse-
quences upset everything and made impossible
many things that perhaps would have been done.
You are familiar with what took place in the way
of increased cost in
all lines of busi-
ness, and with
what happened to
to the electric rail-
ways with the price
of their product
fixed on a pre-war
basis and their abil-
ity to increase such
price surrounded
by many difficul-
ties. It is sufficient
to say that they
were harder hit and
s u ff e r e d more
financially than any
other large indus-
try.
Public's Riding
Habit Changes
Probably the
most important
change remaining,
after many fare ad-
justments had been made to meet the prevail-
ing cost of operation, was the change in
the riding habit of a large part of the public—
a change that seriously affected the market for the
service rendered by the electric railways. The de-
velopment of the automobile with its numerous
types of cars offering varying degrees of speed,
style and comfort made the cost of individual tians-
portation a very minor consideration to many peo-
ple. In fact pleasure vied with utility in transpor-
tation service. The public wanted variety in its
form of transportation, the same as it wanted va-
riety in its forms of pleasure. For example, the
person who had acquired the desire for good music
and had the money to gratify it was comparable
to the person who bought a high price motor car.
The person who had acquired a taste for musical
comedy and had the money to gratify it was com-
parable to the chap who bought a medium price
car. Again, a large number of people who no.
doubt would enjoy but could not afford either type
THE OVERHEAD TROLLEY TYPE OF CAR WAS FIRST USED IN
RICHMOND. VIRGINIA IN 1888. THIS MODERN 40-PASSENGER CAR
WITH TRAILER ATTACHED DURING PEAK HOURS OF THE DAY HAS
PROVEN CAPABLE OF CARRYING A LARGER NUMBER OF PEOPLE

OTHER FORM OF SURFACE TRANSPORTATION. THE SAFETY ZONE

of entertainment mentioned was comparable to
those who bought a low price car.
Thus the market for organized public transpor-
tation was affected to a considerable extent by the
increasing number of people who daily transported
themselves in their own cars. This evolution in
transportation left the street car company in the

United Service
Needed
Along with the
development of the
family passenger
automobile also
came the develop-
ment of the motor
bus operated as a
public utility for
group transporta-
tion. The automo-
bile appeal has
been so strong and
become so popular
that the thought in
the minds of manv
people has been
that this new type
of transpjrtation
service would
soc-ner or later en-
tirely supplant the
service rendered by the electric railway. It
has gradually become apparent, however, that
neither the street car nor the motor bus by
itself can give the public in most of our
cities the combination of pleasure and utility it
desires in all year round transportation facilities.
Each form of transport has certain operating limi-
tations and advantages over the other. Conditions
vary, of course, with the character and size of the
city served but generally speaking, it has been found
that the electric railway can carry a larger number
of people in a given time over more extended areas
than any other form of surface transportation. It
has also been found that street railway operating
costs under traffic density conditions usually are
lower than those of the motor bus. The principal
reasons for this are:
1. The electric railway car's right-of-way on
fixed steel rails makes far greater speed and inci-
dentally for smoother riding than in motor buses
operated on paved streets.
2. The average electric car in large cities is

ON A GOOD
capable of carrying from 100 to 110 passengers
as compared with from 50 to 60 passengers carried
by the modern type of double-deck motor bus.
3. The electric railway car interferes less with
the use of city streets for other purposes.
4. The electric railway car is the more practical
and a safer form of transport under unfavorable
weather conditions.
The principal advantages of the motor bus are:
1. Its ability to start and stop more quickly
than the electric railway car.
2. Its greater flexibility of movement because
of not being confined to a fixed right-of-way.
3. A fascination generally present with some-
thing new.
A Comparison of the Costs
From the financial side, the investment in the
fixed property of the electric railway, because of
construction costs, usually is larger than the prop-
erty investment of the bus, the right-of-way of
which at present is the city streets where the cost
of construction is borne by the public. For the
same reasons, the cost of maintaining electric rail-
way systems obviously is larger than the cost of
maintaining motor bus systems, as their expenses
of this character generally apply only to equipment.
This fixed capital advantage of the bus however,
plus the savings in maintenance mentioned, are
counteracted to some extent by certain advantages
held by the electric railway car. The large size
electric car and the double-deck bus each requires
two operators. In the case of single deck buses
only one operator is required, as is the case with
one man safety-cars in operation on many lines.
The unit cost for each revenue passenger carried
frequently is lower in the case of the street car on
account of the larger number of passengers carried.
The cost of motive power in the case of the electric
car usually is slightly lower, but a much more im-
portant item in operating costs is the life of the
equipment. An ordinary street car that has been
maintained, will give upwards of twenty years of
service. In the case of motor buses no hard and
fast depreciation rule has as yet been laid down,
but it is generally conceded that a motor bus has
a service life of from four to five years, or say, two
hundred and fifty thousand miles. This item of
depreciation is a very important one for both elec-
tric railway and motor bus companies, and it can
be truthfully said that at least 25 per cent of bus
value as against 31,4 per cent to 5 per cent of car
value should be charged off each year for this pur-
pose.
In the item of taxes the motor bus has a material
savings advantage over the electric railway, which
is obliged to meet a variety of burdensome tax obli-
gations that are not placed on the bus.
I am not going into definite investment and oper-
ating costs of electric railways versus motor buses,
and my remarks on account of the number of var-
iable factors which exist in practically every city of
any size and population must of necessity be gen-

eral in their character. It is my opinion, however,
that the great traveling public is not so much inter-
ested in processes as in results, and the results in
this instance are the character and cost of trans-
portation service.

The Bus as a Utility
Traffic density and congestion in many of our cit-
ies makes the electric railway the best and most
economical form of mass transportation known.
Outside of the rush hours, however, and in sparsely
settled portions of a city the motor bus at present
has an advantage, but this advantage cannot be

considered permanent as the time surely will come
when the motor bus will be obliged to pay a proper
proportion of the cost of maintaining the roadbed
provided by the public. Furthermore, the motor
bus eventually will come under regulations as to
schedules and routes similar to those that now ap-
ply to the electric railway. In other words, the
bus cannot always expect to select the routes and
time it desires to operate, but as a public utility
it must be organized to give city-wide transporta-
tion service at regular intervals of the day or night
whether or not any passengers are waiting on the
corner to be picked up.
The electric railways under proper franchise re-
strictions and requirements, with their organiza-
tion, equipment and years of experience—all of
which represent the investment of between $5,000.-
000,000 and $f&gt;,0()0.(XX),(X)0—are pre-eminently the
best qualified to, and should operate in the inter-
ests of the traveling public, such motor buses as
may be required to round out and improve exist-
ing city transportation systems.
As the editor of a leading motor bus magazine
said a few months Ago in commenting upon the
efforts to motorize Akron, Ohio, "After all the main
lesson from Akron is this—the bus has its place;
so has the street car. For city service of the kind
demanded by the American public, the local trans-
portation system must use both buses and street
cars, and the service of each must be co-ordinated
with the other. One management in charge, to
use each facility in its place—this is the rubber
city's latest message to the transportation world."
City Authorities Must Solve Traffic
Problem
The mere combination of the electric
railway and the motor bus, however, is
not going to entirely solve the problem
of city transportation. Both electric rail-
ways and motor busses are confronted
with an exceedingly serious problem, and
until it is solved or relief is granted from
present conditions the matter of render-
ing quick, efficient and dependable trans-
portation in cities is going to be in-
creasingly difficult. I refer to the traffic
congestion caused by privately 'owned
automobiles.
At the time the streets in our cities
were laid out, automobiles were unheard
of and therefore not considered when the
widths of the thoroughfares were decided
upon. With an increase of over 15,000,-
000 in the number of motor vehicles reg-
istered during the past twenty years and
little or no provision made for the ade-
quate handling of this traffic, it is high
time that some concerted effort is made
to relieve the situation in the interest of the
traveling public, and when I say this I include the
automobile owner, the property owner, the busi-
ness man, and the ordinary pedestrian. In fact, I
do not know of any business interest that would not
be benefited by relieving traffic congestion.

most unbelievable that more and better organized
steps have not been taken to remedy such condi-
tions. Surely it is an economic problem of suf-
ficient concern to deserve the consideration and
support of every citizen. It has been proposed in
some instances to widen the main streets of cities,
but as a practical matter this cannot very well be
done and if done, would involve the expenditure
of large sums of money which would have to be
raised by taxation—and most people rightfully be-
lieve that the taxation business has about reached
the limit of financial endurance.
A Solution for Peak Load Conditions
Traffic surveys recently made in several cities
have shown that during the rush hours automo-
biles passing a given point in the main business
section carried an average of only 30 per cent to 35
per cent of the travelers, whereas the electric rail-
ways carried from 65 per cent to 70 per cent. These
figures certainly indicate that the street car should
be given precedence over all other forms of public
transportation, and that it is not yet a public nuis-
ance—a thing to be done away with. It is not a
matter of benefitting the street car company—it is
more a matter of giving a large part of the public
faster, more economical, and more dependable trans-
portation.
As I have said, the street car and the motor bus
each has certain distinct advantages over the" other.
And I say further, in my opinion, the electric rail-
way now in the field should operate both together,
along with taxicabs, so co-ordinating the respective
utility features of each that more efficient transpor-
tation service can be rendered. The co-ordination
of the electric railway and motor bus service is not
a theory. It is now, and has for several years, been
a fact with many traction companies. One com-
pany with which I am connected has at present
seventy motor buses supplementing its citv railway
service and thirty motor coaches supplementing its
interurban service. No active steps have as yet
been taken by any traction company, so far as I
know, to operate taxicabs as a part of its transpor-
tation service, but it seems to me to be a logical
development for the future.
Future Market for City Transportation
I do not think we should be concerned about the
market for service—I mean, I do not think the
transportation man should worry about the insuf-
ficiency of passengers, for I am sure that the peo-
ple are beginning to go back to street car riding and
are learning to patronize motor buses and taxicabs
in preference to using their own automobiles. I
am further sure that this swing back to group or
public transportation is going to increase rather
than decrease during the coming years.
Increase in population will help to a certain ex-
tent, but another and perhaps more compelling
reason is the expense involved in any other method
of transportation. When the idea finally takes hold
that the cost of operating privately owned passen-
ger automobiles runs from lOc to 25c a mile, it is
extremely likely that financial necessity will result
in more discrimination in their use. Thus, those
who sell a combination of electric railway, motor
bus, and let us say taxicab service too, should find a
steadily increasing market for their offerings in
most of our cities, particularly those with a popu-
lation of HX).(XK) and upwards. In the case of cities
with a population of less than 100,000 the problem
of the electric railway is exceedingly difficult de-
spite increased fares, the use of one-man cars, and
other changes for the better, for after all, the prin-
cipal factor is the volume of traffic—the market in
which to operate. It may well be in many of the
small cities, although conditions vary greatly, that
the motor bus will supplant the local electric rail-
way insofar as public transportation service is con-
cerned. 1 venture the opinion, however, that few
(if any) successful attempts will be made to give
adequate and regular year 'round transportation
service in this way in cities of any size.
Street Cars Are Not Doomed
I do not fear that the motor bus will replace
the electric railway in the larger cities for, contrary
to the opinion of many people, the revenue passen-
gers carried per capita in such cities last year
showed material increases over 1910, and in some
instances increases over 1922. This is of consid-
erable significance when we remember that in 1910
there were only 468,000 motor vehicles of all sorts
registered as compared with approximately 15,000,-
000 at the end of the year 1923. It also surely is
of interest to know that in 1923 the electric rail-
ways of this country carried approximately 16,000,-
000,000 passengers, or in other words more passen-
gers than in any other year in their history. This
very clearly demonstrates the economic need and
usefulness of the industry. It cannot be possible
that an industry that carried this huge number of
passengers in one year—twelve times as many as
were carried by the steam railroads—is ready for
burial.
I have no sympathy for the railway man who
deprecates the automobile and the motor bus. He
is of the dark ages. Both are instruments of pro-
gress, and while their indiscriminate use on the
streets of our cities has interfered with the efficiency
and usefulness of the electric railway—the service
of which is required by such a large number of peo-
ple—they cannot be denied and should be used in
a proper way for the benefit of the whole.
I think that most railway operators in the coun-
try are constantly devising ways and means of in-
creasing the earnings of their companies, and I be-
lieve they are at the same time not neglecting any

operating efficiency or service that will be of benefit
to the public. It has been and still is an up-hill
job, but progress is being made. For example:
1. One-man safety cars (which cost about as
much as the ordinary single deck bus) have been
placed in operation by many companies, and their
use generally has resulted in operating economies
together with improved service to the public.
2. Traffic studies and surveys have been made
and car routings changed with benefit to the pub-
lic and savings to the companies.
3. Service during rush hours has been speeded
up by the adoption of skip-stop schedules and the
use of "Pay-as-you-Leave" cars.
4. Safety zones and loading platforms have
been established in congested districts.
5. Motor buses have been operated in territory
not directly served by car lines and free transfers
exchanged.
6. Lighter cars have replaced heavy equipment
and new types of motors better adapted to the ser-
vice have been installed.
Various other changes and improvements are go-
ing on, and a better feeling of gocd will on the part
of the public and the authorities has manifested
itself through adjustment of fares to meet increased
operating costs and taxes, and likewise the elimina-
tion of unfair motor bus and jitney competition and
relief from burdensome franchise restrictions have
been helpful.
Interurbans Developing Freight and Express
Business
What I have said in the foregoing applies largely
to city transportation service, but much of it ap-
plies equally as well to interurban service which,
along with city railway service, has had its fair
share of the vicissitudes and problems that have
confronted all railway companies—steam and elec-
tric alike—during the past few years. Without go-
ing into the history of interurban railway building
and expansion, I would not speak truthfully if I
did not acknowledge that many of them were con-
structed without proper thought as to their then-
time necessity or their outlook for the future. True,
they have done much to develop our suburban terri-
tory and have in many instances given railway serv-
ice to many •communities lacking it. On the other
hand, steam railway service was in just as many
instances unwarrantedly interfered with and hurt—
and without resultant benefit to anyone. It is just
this sort of unwarranted interference and unneces-
sary competition from unregulated busses and auto-
mobiles which ha»s in recent years made the path-
way of electric railway stony. Two wrongs do not
make a right, and if we learn as we go along we
should see to it that this mistake is not repeated.
And now we come to another phase—the grow-
ing competition from interurban motor busses and
trucks. This curse, and I say it advisedly, can-
not long continue—not if the American people are
mindful of their interests—I mean this sort of com-
petition cannot long continue unregulated and al-
lowed to operate at its own sweet will. The high-
ways are built for traffic—traffic of the individual,
the farm owner, the pleasure driver, and the ped-
estrian—as thoroughfares for those who in their
private capacity would go from one place to another
—not for use by incorporated companies and unin-
corporated individuals owning busses and trucks
as rights-of-way for the conduct of a public trans-
portation business. While it is true that this form
of transportation pays in a measure some taxes into
the public treasury for the privilege of using the
public highway, it is also true that it does not pay
enough by any means to adequately repair the dam-
age it does to the roadway. I do not believe, as I
have already said, that this use of the highways
can long continue without proper payment on the
part of those using them. It is manifestly unfair
not only to the railways, who are forced to main-
tain their own rights-of-way and in addition are
compelled to pay high taxes on their value as prop-
erty belongings—but it is also unfair to the pri-
vate individual—the property owner along the high-
way—who foots the bill for paving and repaving
whether or not he derives any benefit for so doing.
While many of the things I have said are not
strictly germane to the subject in hand, I could
not very well pass them by, for they are part of the
very essence of our problem—so interwoven with its
fabric as to make it difficult of unweaving.
If I have bored you, you must forgive—if you
do not agree with what I have said, that is your
privilege. I am not a soothsayer, a prophet or a
seer, nevertheless I believe that with co-ordina-
tion and the doing away with ruthless competition,
which in the end only mean disaster for all, the elec-
tric railways will "come back." They are, in my
opinion, indispensable and will continue so to be for
many years to come.

THE CONCRETE HOUSE
Us Design and Construction
By S. J. STACHOWIAK, '25A
THE demand for fire-resisting, durable and sani-
tary construction has been the dominant note
in most that has been said and written on the sub-
ject of architecture during the past ten years. The
American dwelling of the best class is a model of
convenience, comfort and beauty, and these quali-
ties may be found even in houses of moderate cost.
But with rare exceptions, three serious defects ac-
company modern construction. Modern houses are
not fire-resisting, not durable and to a lesser degree,
not sanitary. Knowledge of these facts, taken to-
gether with that newly awakened demand for
In the average house, a fire starting in the cellar
would soon transform the building into a smoking
ruin. Only the alertness of our fire departments,
maintained at a cost of more than one hundred
million dollars annually, prevents the destruction
of thousands of homes each year. A study of the
fire losses of this and European countries shows
our annual loss to be $2.50 per capita, while in the
cities of the six leading nations of Europe it is only
thirty-three cents. That fire-proof construction is
the exception rather than the rule, is due mainly
to a mistaken idea of its cost. Fire-resisting HOOTS

greatly increased economy and efficiency in the
nation's industrial and social development, has led
American architects to concentrate every effort
toward the solution of the problem. They found
that the highest standard of fire-resisting construc-
tion was so closely allied with extreme durability
and sanitary excellence as to inclose these three
important structural reforms under that single
head. Iron and steel did not prove to be fire-
resisting construction, unless protected, and in this
investigation many other matcrals were rejected
as non-fireproof in themselves.
and roofs are not prohibitive in cost, and even
though the architect be closely united to concrete,
brick or stone in the matter of walls, he is in favor
of fire-proof interior construction.
Experiment and research have reduced the list
of available fire-resisting materials to practically
two products, concrete and clay. Concrete is not
only a superior fire-resisting material, but ranks
supreme from the standpoint of economy, owing
to the facility with which it may be used for prac-
tically every structural detail of a house. Its wide
range of adaptability has been demonstrated by

such architects as McKimm, Mead and White, of
New York City, who used concrete with the best
of success in the construction of the new Pennsyl-
vania Terminal Station, in Xew York City, which
is usually mistaken for costly stone work. Mr.
Grosvenor Atterbury, in charge of the Sage Foun-
dation work, achieved remarkable results with con-
crete in seeking to better the living conditions of
the laboring classes by his invention of cheap
houses of solid and seamless concrete, a type more
durable, sanitary and fire-resisting than the ma-
jority of our most costly dwellings.
neys and flues, the inaccessible recesses of the
hollow frames into which chips and shavings have
fallen, and the knob and tube work of electric wir-
ing. To mention all these features of the ordinary
house brings to mind a realization of the constant
danger confronting those obliged to live in them.
But the solution of all this is found in concrete. Con-
crete means fire-proof walls and floors at very little
cost above that of combustible construction. Floors
of concrete are non-combustible. Moreover they con-
fine smoke and flames to the room in wrhich a fire
may start. They practically eliminate the danger

THESE CONCRETE HOUSES ARE FIREPROOF, RIGID AND PERMANENT WITHOUT SACRIFICE
OF ARCHITECTURAL BEAUTY
The fact that little or nothing is said of success
in the use of concrete for house construction, while
great publicity is given to failure, has led manv ti&gt;
believe that good houses cannot be built cf con-
crete. Such is far from the case. Many of the
best architects in the country have designed and
built residences of concrete, some of which have
cost more than one hundred thousand dollars. From
the smallest cottage to the palatial mansion, these
structures are satisfactory in every detail, a com-
bination of tasteful design with good workman-
ship.
It would be rather hard to plan and construct
a house that would ignite quicker or burn faster
than the common type of dwelling. Every archi-
tect and builder understands the danger of studded
partitions, wooden floor joists and outside sheating,
the close setting of timber construction to chim-
of suffocation from smoke, so often followed by loss
of life. Concrete not only affords a sense of secur-
ity in this respect, but so far as the building is
concerned, makes insurance unnecessary. There is
no instance on record where a building constructed
of reinforced concrete throughout has been des-
troyed by fire or conflagration.
In tests of concrete panels conducted by the
United States Geological Survey, a heat of 1700°
Fahrenheit was maintained for two hours. At the
expiration of that time paper labels on the backs
of these panels were not even scorched and tin-
concrete could be touched without burning the
hand. In another experiment conducted by the
same organization a structure with four-inch walls
of cinder concrete was used as test-house which,
according to the last report was intact after tests
aggregating twenty hours. The temperature ranged

from 1700° to 1900" Fahrenheit, which is in excess
of the estimated conflagration temperatures. More-
over, at the end of each four-hour test, and while
the walls were red hot, a stream of water at (;0
pounds nozzle pressure was played back and forth
over the ceiling for ten minutes, but the walls re-
mained intact. All this is far in excess of any-
thing builders encounter in ordinary fires. In a
word, in the true concrete house, lamps might ex-
plode, furnaces melt of their own heat, flues over-
heiit, or any of the many accidents that cause fires,
without the slightest danger to the building. Only
the contents could be destroyed. Many owners of
concrete buildings carry no insurance on the struc-
tures. In every large city of a million or more in-
habitants, five to ten fires start each day, and on
some days the list greatly exceeds this number.
The lists of fires are never noticed by the public
unless they are of the spectacular kind, involving
great loss of life or property, or attended with
dramatic features. It costs the country one hun-
dred millions a Year just to extinguish such fires.
Our total loss from fire is four hundred and fifty
millions of dollars annually. In nearly every in-
stance the damage could have been avoided by the
use of non-combustible material in building con-
struction. Concrete is non-combustible.
As to stability or strength of a concrete house,
the following is a very strikingly typical example.
Preceding the earthquake in Jamaica in 1912, there
was a scarcity of water, and at the concrete resi-
dence of Mr. Mitchell, in Port Antonio, bath tubs
were used as temporary tanks for reservoirs. Dur-
ing the earthquake this house was rocked until the
water splashed over the sides of the tubs. Mr.
Mitchell, whose American residence is in Connec-
ticut, wrote to the American newspapers that his
concrete house had passed through the test, with-
out showing the least crack, while other buildings
in the district of the earthquake were all demol-
ished. In this matter of durability we again learn
that concrete is the very opposite of other materials.
It improves with age, and its known life runs into
thousands of years. Wood shrinks, warps, burns
and decays, stone and brick units fall apart and are
disrupted through the action of frost and tempera-
ture changes. Concrete is improved both in quality
and appearance by exposure to the weather and it
may be used for foundations, walls, floors, roofs,
stairways and chimneys, thus making a solid, seam-
less house throughout,
With concrete it is possible to so build walls
and floors as to make them impenetrable to rats,
mice and other vermin, too often the carriers of di-
sease. Concrete houses may be made as sanitary as
the are fire-resisting. Floors and walls of this mate-
rial tend to prevent the admission and accumulation
of things dangerous to health, many of which find
protection in the recesses of the ordinary house.
The low conductivity of concrete, which makes
it such a good fire-resisting material, also prevents
the entrance of cold. When properly made it is
devoid of cracks and imperfect joinings. Settle-
ment of walls, so common in buildings of brick
and stone, does not occur in the building walls
of concrete. It would not be contradicting to say
that the concrete house is cool in summer and
warm in winter. It has been found by actual ex-
periment that a saving of 20 per cent, in the cost of
fuel, has been obtained by substituting concrete for
brick, stone or frame. In the concrete houses the
temperature- is 15 degrees lower than the outside
temperature on the hottest days in summer.
Concrete possesses sound-proof qualities. When
concrete is used throughout a dwelling there results
a minimum of sound transmission, insuring the
quietness so essential to the ideal home.
Connected with this is the exceedingly desirable
property of rigidity, which in turn means non-

THE MEASUREMENT OF NOISES
By D. L. RICH, Fh. D.
Assistant Professor of Physics
HOW loud is loud? And how much louder is
too loud? These are questions of very great
importance in this age of noise and machinery but
unfortunately they are questions very difficult to
answer. The worker in most any field other than
that of noise has both suitable measuring instru-
ments and commonly understood units for deter-
mining and denoting the magnitudes of the quan-
tities with which he deals. In
a lawsuit, for example, the sur-
veyor with confidence in his
carefully calibrated steel tape
can testify convincingly, "Your
line fence encroaches 7.46 feet
on your neighbor's property."
Questions and disputes be-
tween buyer and seller relating
to such things as weights or
dimensions or chemical analy-
ses can be considered in the
light of positive, quantitative,
measurements. Even more
elusive things, such as hard-
ness, color and texture, have
been standardized to some ex-
tent, perhaps not entirely sat-
isfactory as yet.
But in the field of sound and
of noise, how shall disputes be
settled? Suppose a carload of
gears are rejected, the buyer
saying, "These gears are too
noisy," what quantitative
measurements can the seller
take, either to find out how
noisy the parts really are, or to find out what im-
perfections result in noise?
All responsible manufacturers carefully inspect
their products before these products leave their
factories. Even in a relatively simple machine not
only is the final assembled machine inspected, but
the individual parts have also been previously in-
spected. To a person not familiar with factory
procedure the percentage of employes engaged in
inspection work exclusively is surprisingly large.
Primarily, dividends are increased by increasing
production and sales, leaving the side issues of
esting and inspection as necessary evils—very
necessary, but to a certain extent, absorbers rather
ihan creators of dividends.
WHAT is more universal
than the presence of
noise and of what significance is
noise to the industrial world?
Noise means imperfection which
in turn implies wear, waste and
inefficiency. Yet how shall this
criterion of perfection be eval-
uated in terms of positive and
quantitive units? More plainly
stated; how loud is loud and how
much louder is too loud? The
quality of gears are often judged
by the noise they make and
curiously enough, gears which
have been rejected as outrageous-
ly noisy at one price, seem to run
smooth as silk at a lower price.
The need for a "noise thermome-
ter" is apparent and Professor
Rich tells in an interesting man-
ner, of the successful quest for
such an instrument. —Editor.
Some types of inspection, such as size gauging
and sorting, can be done and are being done by
automatic machinery. Other kinds of inspection
involve the manual use of a "go and no go" toler-
ance limit gauges, in which the procedure is almost
as automatic as a machine, and the sorting almost
as consistent. But inspection for noise at present
is done almost wholly by ear—and the ear is not a
precision machine. Its toler-
ance limits are not fixed. There
are not only wide differences
among individuals, but worse
yet wide variations in the same
individual on successive days.
Xoise inspectors become re-
markably skillful in listening
for objectionable noises, yet
they do not approach the auto-
matic impersonal consistency
of a machine. In one factory
inspecting small cut gears for
noises, the assistant superin-
tendent, to the inspectors, sent
the same batch of gears
through inspection several
times. In a boxful of 100
gears, Inspector No. A passed
95 and rejected 5 as being too
noisy. The rejected ones were
secretly marked, mixed in with
the other 95, and the same
boxful passed along to In-
spector B. B accepted 93
and rejected 7 as too noisy;
but only a few of the 7 rejected
by B were among the 5 rejected by A. The next
clay the same boxful were inspected again by A,
without his knowing that he had ever seen them
before. But in the meantime A had drank too
much er-ah-pie-for supper, or perhaps had been out
too late with his best girl, or had acquired a slight
cold in his head, or had developed a grouch against
the boss, any or all of which may affect both his
sensitivity and his judgment—with the result that
he rejected 11 out of the same 100; but of the 89
accepted, four had been rejected by him the day
before. The assistant superintendent convinced
himself that inspection by ear eliminates consistent-
ly only the outstanding cases, only the very noisy
gears.

The importance of a satisfac-

First, improvement, the im-

a sincere desire on the part of
manufacturers to make better ma-

may be based largely on a finan-
cially selfish reason, the fact re-

a change from grass-covered ground to bare ground
or to a concrete surface would introduce very large
changes in the quantity of sound received from a
given source. The best place to carry en inves-
tigations in sound intensity is in a sound-proof
room, a room that theoretically at least has walls
impervious to outside noises, and at the same time
walls which are perfect absorbers or perfect non-
retlectors of noises produced in the room. To
approximate these conditions.-a special sound-proof
room was built in the tower of the old Physics
Laboratory. Within this tower two concentric
rooms were built, the outer room having its walls
and top suspended from the ceiling, and
the inner room built up from a special
foundation of felt and sand on the floor. The outer
room was sheeted on the outside with iron, which
is an excellent insulator of aerial sounds—it reflects
rather than transmits them. The space between
the walls and ceilings of the two rooms was filled
with layers of paper, felt and sand. The inside of
the inner room was covered completely with sev-
eral layers of hair felt and soft carpet paper. Then
the floor was built up several inches with layers of
felt. The one opening into the room was closed by
three doors, involving some twelve layers of sheet
iron, W(x)d, paper, felt and air. When these three
doors were closed, the room was fairly quiet. With
two exceptions, outside noises seemed to he entirely
eliminated. One of these exceptions was the throb-
bing of an old air compressor mounted three floors
below, and the other was the lowest pitch bell of
the chimes in the adjacent tower.
This room was, of course, only a small one,
about 5'xo'xh' inside. Tt was intended to house only
two things, a source of sound and a detector or
pick-up of sound. All control machinery and meas-
uring instruments were kept outside. Obviously
a person could not stay in this room long. Venti-
lating a sound-proof room is difficult, as experience
even in a telephone booth shows.
A rather loud noise was used at first as the
source of sound, but as experience was gained and
as the measuring apparatus was improved, less
intense noises were used, until finally the faint
whispers emitted by an ordinary telephone receiver
could be measured. Since the end in view was not
the measurement of the intensity of a musical tone
of definite pitch, but rather the measurement of the
intensity of a conglomeration of noises, resonance
methods were strictly taboo. There are detectors
of sound, for example the Rayleigh disc and the
Webster phonometer, which when carefully tuned
to- resonance, approach the sensitivity of the normal
ear. But for the measurement of irregular noises
any resonant device would give wrong results.
because it would give unequal weights to the vari-
ous components of a noise; it would give undue
prominence to any disturbance that happened to be
near the natural frequency of the detector, unless
this natural frequency lay far outside the range of
frequencies of the sounds to be studied. This
means that the measurement and proper cvalua-

tion of such complex and irregular disturbances as
ordinary noises is much more difficult than similar
measurements of relatively pure musical tones.
'1 he ordinary carbon microphone telephone
transmitter possesses two qualifications very neces-
sary in the detection of sounds—it is remarkably
sensitive, and it will respond to sounds varying
over a wide range of pitches and intensities. But
for quantitative work it has the insuperable dis-
advantage of inconstancy. Both its resistance and
its sensitivity are subject to wide changes. To
calibrate its responses so as to use it as a stand-
ard for measurement seems entirely out of the
question.
Quantitative work on the measurement of roller
bearing noises was first carried out by the use of
a Wcntc Condenser Transmitter as the pick-up.
This instrument, the product of the Western
Electric Company, and the American Telephone
and Telegraph Company—the Bell System, con-
sists essentially of an air condenser, one of whose
plates is relatively massive and rigid, and the other
a very thin tightly stretched metal diaphragm.
Air waves impinging on this light diaphragm
cause it to vibrate, and thereby produce changes
in the capacitance of the condenser. By applying
a few hundred volts to the condenser, fluctuations
in the capacitance are accompanied by variations

WORM DRIVE REAR AXLES As APPLIED To
MODERN AUTOMOBILES
.4 Future Development
By D. MI-CALL WHITE, Consulting Engineer
Mc-nber of A. S. M. K. and S. A. E.
THEKF. is a decided tendency today among
engineers to get their cars closer to the ground
without sacrificing road clearances but as I see it
they are still groping around in the dark on account
of the fact that propeller shafts, torque rods, bevel
axle housings, etc., have still a very disconcerting
habit of wanting to po-kc through the floorboards,
thus necessitating provision being made to accom-
modate them, either by constructing model dog
houses, for want of a better name, or raising the
chassis sufficiently high to take
care of the situation.
With the use of the worm
drive axle we can design the
housing in such a manner that
the diameter of the housing
alone will permit of lowering
the rear end of the chassis at
least one and one-half inches
while the worm would be of
the underslung type the pro-
peller shaft would be at least
six inches lower than that of a
car fitted with bevel axle, at
the axle end. The engine
therefore and also the trans-
mission can be inclined to
get a straight line drive and
thus giving a very pleasing
and attractive layout to the chassis.
When designing the Lafayette car my object
amongst other things, was to get the chassis as
close to the ground as possible as I wanted it to
have great stability on account of the enormous
speeds the car was capable of attaining and to en-
tirely eliminate rolling when negotiating curves.
Notwithstanding the fact that I fitted a bevel drive
axle, I was able to get this chassis as low as 221/f,
inches from the ground without sacrificing any
other points. 1 consider that for a car of this
capacity and without sacrificing wheel diameter
this is about the lowest measurement which can be
obtained having a bevel drive rear axle.
As far back as the year 19(19 the author has been
studying the desirability of getting automobiles
more stable and closer to the ground as well as
more silent without sacrificing clearances to pre-
clude their getting stuck on bad roads, and for that
reason has given very considerable thought to the
THE automobile of today is

veloped machines in common use.
Engine, transmission, chassis and

of the contributions of a count-
less number of highly skilled en-
gineers. D. McCall White, one

of the country, has here presented

tical form, one of the most prob-

application of the worm drive rear axle which pre-
sents many points of interest to the engineer least
of which is silence as well as an adaptability to the
design when bringing the chassis closer to the
ground without upsetting the clearance problem or
giving the car that low squat appearance so many
of our cars have when an attempt is made to get
them down without taking all pr-ints into consid-
eration.
With this in view, a design was first produced in
1909 by the author who was
then Manager and Chief En-
gineer of the English Napier
Company. This car had a six
cylinder engine driving
through a single plate dry
clutch, special transmission,
and conventional propeller
shaft to a worm drive rear
axle.
On this chassis, it was onlv
nineteen inches from the
ground to the top of the frame
and nothing whatever pro-
truded above the frame to pre-
vent the floor boards from be-
ing placed satisfactorily. This
measurement is at least six
inches below any modern car
of today which will give a fair idea as to what can
be accomplished in this direction without sacrific-
ing headroom in the body. Notwithstanding the
fact that this car was made some sixteen years ago.
the chassis layout permitted body lines and general
appearance not unlike the modern car of the same-
class.
The author is convinced that the worm drive
rear axle will come to its own in the very near fu-
ture, for although little is really known about this
type of drive by automobile engineers, the trend
is undoubtedly in this direction.
Most engineers in the past, in the struggle for
(juiet rear axles, when the straight tooth bevel was
to the fore, were in despair, and willing almost to
adopt anything, even at the cost of considerable
loss in efficiency, in order to obtain quiet rear axles.
Behold, then, the iniquities which came to pass in
the shape of worm driven axles, designed by engi-
neers who had no experience whatever with such

gears and regarding which there has been such a
lamentable lack of technical information published.
We had gears which ran hot, in fact so hot, that
they would almost boil the oil within the casings
of the axles and yet, what a beautifully running

gear is a worm drive gear when well, and properly,
designed?
During certain periods of my experience as en-
gineer to different companies in Europe I have de-
signed and marketed cars for both commercial and
pleasure purposes, fitted with worm driven axles,
capable of taking the torque of engines developing
from twenty-five, to one hundred and twenty horse-
power on the brake. These axles have been
entirely successful and I propose to analyze worm-
drive that it may throw some light upon what un-
doubtedly is an extremely interesting phase of auto-
mobile design.
The Mechanics of The Problem
The stresses which an axle, transmitting power,
is called upon to withstand, are of a singularly com-
plex nature, varying as they do, with the utmost
frequency, from minimum to maximum, and we
must needs be very careful in our analysis to cover
all of the loads which are thrown upon it. These
loads can be divided under principal headings on
the axle housing or casing and consist of the fol-
lowing:
1. Weight on spring seatings caused by car
load.
2. Tractive effort in one direction throwing a
cantilever load on that part of the axle housing out-
side the spring seats.

3. Re Hex brake load throwing torsional load

4. Torsional load due to reflex torque of engine.
5. Bending moment due to reflex load from
torque arm.
6. Bending moment due to axle weight.
7. Bending moment due to inertia of axle.
From the above it can be noted that here we
have no mean problem if we intend to design an
axle which will be light and scientifically con-
structed.
There are so many different types of axles that
it is almost beyond the scope of an article to cover,
in its entirety, the complex and interesting condi-
tions which can, and do, occur.
The approximate greatest stress in a full floating
axle is near the spring seating and the diameter of
the casing here cannot be very great, so the tubular
portion of the casing must have quite a heavy sec-
tion to withstand the stresses it is called upon to
carry. For the sake of discussion therefore I pro-
pose to consider only a worm driven rear axle with
alloy steel swaged tubes flanged and bolted to an
aluminum, duralumin, or magnesium alloy, center

housing, because this is a construction which never
has been used to any extent in production.
In order to make the subject more scientifically
interesting, without being technically burdensome,
I will deal with the bending moments graphically
in not too complex form and in so doing will en-
deavor to show just how and why some axles fail
from intensity of stresses, the reasons for which
will be amply seen from the diagrams.
Looking back for a moment you will find that 1
attempted to divide the loads into principal head-
ings, the first one of which, was weight on spring
seatings, caused by car load. The bending moment
diagram due to this load looks approximately like
figure 1, the forces marked "W" representing the
supported load on the spring seats and those marked
"P" being the reactions taken by the wheels. The
bending moment therefore, it will be noted, takes
a cantilever form from the wheel center to the
spring seat center and continues uniformly until
the other spring seat is reached, when it again be-
comes cantilever.

I'ndcr heading No. 2, we find the tractive effort
in one direction, and in order to diagnose this par-
ticular force it is necessary first to look at it from
a side elevation point of view in conjunction with
the force under heading No. 1, and this is shown
in figure 2.
"F" can only be considered in conjunction with
"\Y" which represents the weight on the spring
seat, and "F"' being the tractive effort, it is there-
lore dependent, not as might be supposed on the
torque of the engine .on first speed alone but. that
torque reduced to pounds or any other convenient
unit, figured with the coefficient of friction between
the tires and the road and coupled with the weight
on the axle.
It can readily be seen therefore that it may be
impossible to apply the whole torque of the engine
&lt;&gt;n to the rear wheels on first speed, due to the fact
that the weight in conjunction with the coefficient
of friction, is less than the actual amount of load
which could be applied except in the case of trucks.
It is always wise, however, to consider the whole
torque when calculating the stress and then one
is on the safe side, particularly in the case of truck-
work, as there the brake throws the greatest load,
instead of the tractive effort due to the heavy loads
carried on the rear axle.
With reference to the third division of loads, un-
der the heading of reflex brake load, this may be
summed up as the torsional resistance of the axle
housing tubes to the load which may be applied at
the brake drums, which in its turn, is tempered by
the weight of the car and the coefficient of friction
between the wheels and the road, the load being
transmitted straight along the tubes and taken off
by the torque arm. ,
Having dealt with load No. 3. we come to head-
ing No. 4 which is the torsional load due to reflex

torque of the engine, which load is transmitted
upon the point of application—the pitch line of the
form—and is taken care of through the axle hous-
ing by the torque rod.
Heading No. 5 is the bending moment due to re-
flex load from the torque arm and shows the ad-
vantage of a fairly long torque arm, as whatever
load the torque arm takes, at the front end, is re-
flected back to the axle at whatever point the arm
is applied.
Under heading No. 6 we have the bending mo-
ment due to axle weight and shows a reason, to-
gether with the force under .heading No. 7, why
an axle should be as light as possible in conjunc-
tion with maximum strength.

PHANTOM VIEW OF UNDERSLUNG WORM DRIVE
In analyzing, therefore, all the stresses above
mentioned without going into too complicated de-
tail with which the reader is no doubt very familiar,
we find that the vertical bending moment diagram
resolves itself into the diagram shown on Figure
1. while the horizontal bending moment diagram
resolves itself as shown in Figure 2. When the va-
rious forces, vertical and horizontal, are combined,
the diagram show-n on Figure 5, is a fair approxi-
mation.
The driving torque which has to be transmitted
becomes the governing factor in design, but the de-
signer is confronted by many variations which he
may make if he so desires, because should the cen-
ter distance be limited owing to ground clearance,
or rather, lack of it, the gear may have to be some-
what modified to work within the centers permis-
sible.
In general figuring, it has always been my prac-
tice to consider the torque in inch pounds, and if
we refer to anv handbook on worm gears we will
find that it is generally admitted that the angle
of the worm wheel teeth, to the axis, should approx-
imate between thirty and fifty degrees, to secure
maximum efficiency. The minimum angle which
will enable one to reverse, being approximately ten
degrees.
It is of course necessary to Settle upon the gear
ratio required, and in those days of high speed en-
gines, introduced commercially into this country

CURRENT STUDIES IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION
WILLIAM C. HOAD, B. S.
Professor of Municipal and Sanilary Engineering
THE College of Engineering has a faculty com-
mittee now at work on a fundamental study of
engineering education, or more particularly, a study
of the selection and training of young men for
entrance into the engineering profession, and for
serving organized society through that profession.
This study has been actively in progress for more
than a year, and certain aspects of the general prob-
lem have already been clearly exposed to view.
It should first be stated that while the work of
this college committee deals mere immediately with
conditions which have existed and still exist here at
the University of Michigan, the local study is also
definitely a part of a nation-wide investigation now
being carried on under the direction of the Board
of Investigation and Co-ordination of the Society
for the Promotion of Engineering Education. This
Hoard, with the aid of financial support from the
Carnegie Foundation, has undertaken a compre-
hensive survey of the present status of engineer-
ing education in the United States, together with
a study of the present and prospective future needs
of the engineering profession with respect to col-
lege training. In this enterprise the Universitv of
Michigan is joining its forces to those of more than
a hundred other institutions the country over, for
the Board is receiving the active co-operation and
support of practically all the engineering schools
of the country. Several of the national engineer-
ing societies also, including all the four so-called
Founder Societies, arc actively participating in the
work cf the Board, through appropriate commit-
tees.
In general the purposes of the investigation may
be said to be: First, to disclose engineering edu-
cation as it exists today with perhaps some expla-
nation of its historical development, together with
a statement of what it has accomplished and is
accomplishing; and secondly, to collect, arrange,
sift, and present in orderly array the great body
of available facts regarding the changing needs of
the profession, and other fundamental data which
will serve as a foundation from which the faculties
of the various engineering colleges may review or
reconsider their policies and objectives and, if need
be, strengthen their curricula, or improve their
teaching methods, or modify their standards of
accomplishment or of personnel, so as to make en-
gineering education in their respective institutions
as good as possible. There is no intention to
"standardize" college training, nor to impose rules
or regulations for entrance into the engineering
profession, nor to encroach upon or in any way
impair the freedom of choice of any engineering
college.
To be of the greatest ultimate value, such an
investigation as has now been undertaken must
include in its view all the conditions surrounding
engineering education and engineering practice in
all parts of the country, and even, to a diminishing
degree, in other countries as well. This great
breadth of view is actually being reached through
the genuine and complete co-operation extended by
both the schools and the national societies. More
important even than this, thoroughness in the in-
vestigation with a consequent sanity and balance in
the statement of final results appear to be pretty
well assured by the high character and sound judg-
ment of the engineers and engineering teachers and
administrators who make up the personnel of the
Board itself.
The investigations of the Committee on the
Study of Engineering Education here at the Uni-
versity of Michigan, of which Professor J. R. Nelson
is Chairman, so far have been chiefly fact-finding in
character. They have dealt with the following
subjects:
The entering student: his age; geographical,
racial and social background; preparation for col-
lege; and choice of vocation.
The student's progress through the college cur-
riculum; scholastic achievements; participation in
campus organizations and activities; social rela-
tionships; remunerative employment: age at grad
nation, etc.
The alumni: Their professional accomplish-
ments, and the relation of these accomplishments
to their college training.
Teaching facilities: Especially buildings and
laboratory equipment.
Teaching personnel.
A certain amount of statistical information is
now available concerning the sources from which
engineering students at the University of Michigan
come, and how they make their way through the
school.
Engineering students at the University of Mich-
igan are predominantly of American stock. Ac-
cording to the statistical information thus far as-
sembled, about 92 per cent were born in the United

His Reflections on the Motive Power of Heal
DR. C. H. PEABODY*
IT IS fitting that the engineers of the United
States should commemorate the centenary of
the publication of Sardi Carnot's work on the mo-
tive power of heat.
Sadi's father was the organizer of victory for the
French people at the time of the Revolution. Sadi
was born June 1, 1796, in
the smaller Luxembourg
and named Nicolas-Leon-
ard-Sadi. Prenatal condi-
tions gave him a delicate
constitution, which he so
fortified by correct living
and judicious exercise, that
he showed no lack of en-
ergy, but on occasion ex-
hibited courage, physical
strength and dexterity. At
sixteen he entered the
Polytechnic School and the
next year he left it, first in
artillery.
A portrait at the age of
seventeen years shows a
slender sub-lieutenant of
engineers with a firm, re-
fined face and a mathe-
matical head. Being too
young for the school at
Metz, he continued an-
other year at Paris, and
took part in military ex-
ploits at Yincennes in the
Polytechnic Battalion. He
was appointed lieutenant
at 23 and managed to con-
tinue his studies at Paris
for a time. He appears to
have hidden extreme sensi-
bility by a reversed man-
ner, but to have had a just appreciation of his own
ability unbiased by egotism.
In 1824, at the age of 28, he published his "Re-
flections." The modest work by an unknown young
officer, dealing with ideas far in advance of his
times and couched in language that few engineers
could appreciate, passed out of print and appeared
to be lost, until Lord Kelvin, then a young and bril-
liant mathematician, discovered it, revealed its ex-
traordinary merits and restated the propositions

working of his mind as
shown in his "Reflections,"
premising that the experi-
ments of Gay-Lussac and
Dalton were then young
and that before Regnault
(1811-1878) the properties
of steam were but dimly
known. He accepted the
caloric theory that heat
was a substance and
though his investigations
led him toward the modern
energetic theory of heat,
his data were insufficient
to reach such a conclusion.
His attention is given
first to the steam engine,
then the only known heat
engine. He questions
whether there is a natural
limit to improvements in
economy and concludes
that general principles
must include all possible
forms of steam engines. He
determines at once that the
work of heat is due to its
fall in temperature similar
to the fall of water on a
water wheel. The idea it-
self lea/Is, in the right di-
rection and he appears not
to be misled by the unfortunate parallelism. The
production of motive power is, in his mind, due to
the transportation of caloric from a hot body to a
cold body, with steam as an agent.
Then he questions whether the action varies with
the agent. To find an answer he invents his ideal
heat engine and thereby so clarifies the problem
that he comes wonderfully near the modern theory
of thermodynamics and its quantitative results. He
describes the combination of his hot body A, his
cold body B, his working cylinder of non-conduct-

INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT
Us Work and Its Requirements
By C. B. GOHDY, A. M.
Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering
A FEW years ago attention was called to the
small percentage of technically trained engi-
neers among the production executives of industrial
plants. There were, of course, many reasons for
this. There was very little in the usual engineer-
ing curricula that would lead the student in this
direction; many of our present day large industries
being in the formative stage where strictly cngi-
neering problems were paramount. Not that strictly
engineering porblems are less important than for-
merly, but that management problems are vastly
more complicated than formerly. Perhaps the most
important reason for this situation was the failure
to regard management, or the executive side of
plant operation, as a profession with certain prac-
tices requiring a kind of training somewhat differ-
ent from that of the orthodox engineering curricula.
or certainly a different emphasis.
The comparatively recent and phenomenal devel-
opment of science and its application to industry
has increased many fold the demand for technically
trained engineers to keep the industrial machine
in working order, and to develop and refine its oper-
ation. This same development has complicated
the various interrelationships involved in manag-
ing this vast industrial machine created largely by
the scientist and engineer. Business has become
involved and exacting in its demands; the executive
must know more than merely the processes involved
in creating his product. Competition has so in-
creased that the life of any organization catering
to the public need, depends upon operating at the
maximum efficiency, which means, of course, the
lowest possible cost. This means not only a study
of processes, but of proper financing, selling, per-
sonnel relations and management control which c&lt;&gt;-
ordinates all of these separate functions into a
unified objective.
In 1921 the Hoover Report on "Waste in Indus-
try," prepared by engineers of national reputation.
was published. The general conclusion of this re-
port was that over 50^, of the existing waste in
industry was due to management, in the sense that
the management was the only agency in industry
able to correct the deficiencies. It would seem that
this offered sufficient proof that management exist-
ed as a separate entity and that considerable effort
and study were necessary for the proper operation
of this function.
Coincident with the increasing complication of
industry and of business has come the develop-
ment ,,f Schools of Business Administration with
curricula as technical and extensive as the curric-
uia ,,f Engineering for the purpose of training men
jn finance, sales, personnel," and other phases of
industrial operation. The graduates of these schools
f,n a definite niche in the business activities of
industry which calls for as definite a course of
training as that required for- the -engineer.
At thc Prest'nt timt&gt; P'^ts are demanding stu-
dents with an engineering training for production
-work' ******* themselves are manifesting more
int"est in this field and educators are striving to
devise means for mating this new situation. It is
evident that there will be a constantly increasing
demand for technically trained engineers for design
;md research particularly; and just as evident that
there are a considerable percentage of engineering
graduates who show a bent toward the business
side of industry. The real problem then is how to
train both types in the same four-year courses in
engineering. It is scarcely possible to eliminate
vcrv ,,1ucn ,,f the present technical material, for it
js required for adequate preparation of the technical
man in this age of specialists. Certainly not enough
can ])t. eliminated to afford sufficient room for train-
ing in economics, finance, accounting, and statis-
tics, all of which the student with the desire for the
business side of industrial activity, really needs.
Some schools have solved this problem by eliminat-
jng many of the usual engineering subjects given
jn the tour-year course and have substituted the
above mentioned subjects. Thc product is neither
a fish nor a flounder; neither an engineer nor a
Business Administration graduate. It is rather dif-
r'cult to ht&gt;Ik'vt' that this is a real solution to the
Difficulty.
The student entering the employ of a plant pro-
ducing a product in which considerable engineering
is involved must needs have an engineering train-
ing to understand the processes involved in making
the product, and indeed thc student interested in
the production side of the business will find his
first employment in about the same work as the

men interested in the technical side. Consequently
he should be in a position to work side by side with
the latter, gradually working into the field of his
choice as conditions warrant.
The term Industrial Engineering is being used
more and more to designate this Held and the range
of activities this profession is called upon to per-
form assumes an engineering foundation.
As a result of the desire to meet the need for
this new type of training here at Michigan, and
with the above ideas in mind, a five-year course in
Mechanical and Industrial Engineering has been
devised. The basic idea of this program is that
its graduates should be engineers plus and not
minus. The plus constitutes training in economics,
finance, and allied subjects, and these do not replace
. any essential features of the present engineering
course. A fifth year was added because.it was felt
that a man must be grounded in the fundamentals
of engineering in order to practice as an industrial
engineer, and to secure this desired result no
pruning of the regular course was possible. The
course includes the following subjects with the
hours devoted to each:

REAR AXLES
(Continued from ]*nee 19)
by the author, we will find that such ratios as four,
five, and even five and one-half to one, are inclined
to become fairly common.
Having settled upon the ratio desired, and as-
suming an angle of between thirty and fifty degrees
as already mentioned, the ratio of worm wheel to
worm diameter can easily be found by dividing the
worm wheel pitch circle diameter by the worm
pitch circle diameter, the result being the tangent
of the angle of the worm wheel teeth, to the axis,
multiplied by the worm reduction.
It is necessary to assume certain center distances
which will naturally be.controlled by the general de-
signl as well as road clearances permissible, but
which as a guide, may be approximated as from
three to four inches for each one thousand inch
pounds torque on the driving shaft.
A great factor in the design of efficient worm
drive transmission, is the pressure per square inch
on the contact surface of the worm, wheel teeth.
As this naturally governs the size of the teeth as
well as their wearing qualities and running tem-
peratures, and as the number of teeth should not
be less than a certain number, an approximation


May, 1925
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
of the worm wheel diameter can easily be made.
For successful continuous working, the pressure
per square inch of projected tooth area, should be
kept low, calculations for which are exceedingly
simple, being merely relative to the driving shaft
torque in inch pounds, divided by the pitch circle
radius of the worm in inches, the result being the
radial pressure.
If the radial pressure is divided by the tangent
of the worm wheel tooth angle, the result is the
end thrust, which, when divided by the allowable
pressure per square inch on the contact surface of
the tooth, has as its quotient, the projected area of
contact surface for one tooth.
The angle of contact for wheel teeth can be as
high as ninety degrees and certainly should not be
less than sixty degrees and it should be noted that
it is not necessary to use standard circular pitches
when designing worm gears, as the gear cutters
are able to cut gears of any pitch and angle with-
out making special hobs.
The projected area of contact surface being
known, and an arc of contact decided upon, the
tooth sizes will naturally be proportional to the ad-
dendum and the number of starts in the worm, in
order to produce teeth of the required dimensions,
can be found simply by dividing the pitch circle
diameter of the worm, multipled by the sine of
the worm wheel angle, by the addendum of the
tooth.
The worm itself I have always made from case
hardened steel and the worm wheel from phosphor
bronze of a special mixture although experiments
have lately been carried out successfully where an
aluminum alloy has been used for the worm wheel
material which would be a great saving in weight.
Some interesting tests on the relative efficiency
at low speeds were carried out by me some years
ago on the same automobile, on the same track, and,
on the same day, under the same conditions, be-
tween straight tooth bevel axles and worm drive
axles, and demonstrated that the bevel was slightly
more efficient at speeds around twenty or thirty
miles an hour while at high speeds, there did not
appear to be any difference, as on occasions, the
worm would show up better than the bevel and
"vice versa."
These tests were duplicated many times on about
six different cars and it was noted that while accel-
erating rapidly upon hills the bevel showed to better
advantage to the extent of two miles an hour at
fifty m.p.h.
So it can be seen that in efficiency, the worm
and bevel drives are very nearly on a par, the for-
mer permitting that desirable feature of low chassis
design. Since this latter feature is being more and
more sought after in modern design, the worm
drive is due to receive a more serious consideration
in the very near future.
THE CONCRETE HOUSE
(Continued from Page 13)
vibrating floors. The excellence of concrete in this
respect is so pronounced that in factory construc-
tion it has come to be regarded as an economic fac-
tor of the highest importance, making for increased
efficiency as well as representing a material saving
in the wear and tear of machinery.
As stated above, concrete means the elimination
of insurance on the building and the same thing
applies to the cost of up-keep or repairs. For this
reason it is highly important to determine whether
the cheapest construction is not, after all, the most
expensive. At the expiration of seven or eight
years, repairs become an important item in the case
of the average house, and this should be carefully
estimated when the first cost is considered. If the
value of property is to be maintained it must be
kept in first-class condition and in the case of
ordinary construction this can only be done through
constant repairs. Walls of concrete, especially
when solid and untreated as to surface finish, re-
quire absolutely ri|&gt; repairs and when floors and
roofs are constructed of the same material the up-
keep would be confined merely to the painting of
windows and doors.
The prevailing notion that the cost of a concrete
house is far in excess of other materials is abso-
lutely wrong. The partial imitation of other houses
in concrete, that is to say, a house with concrete
• walls, may exceed slightly the cost of other types.
but it has frequently happened, especially where
sand and stone were convenient, that the cost was
less. But in the true concrete house, that is to say,
a house of concrete throughout, its duplicate in
stone or brick would be prohibitive in cost.
As matters stand today, there is not a fair basis
for the comparison of brick and concrete houses,
for as stated, all that has been done up to date ex-
cept in very rare cases, has been to build the usual
type of house with concrete walls. The trend at
present, however, is toward the absolutely fire-
proof and indestructible house that shall be of con-
crete from foundation to roof. The same-type of
house in brick or stone if practicable at all, would
cost three times as much as the concrete house.
So an undisputable evidence can be found that
the restricted use of concrete in the construction
of dwellings is not due to any defect or limitation
of the material itself, but chiefly, because architects
have failed to give the subject the serious consid-
eration it deserves. Another retarding influence


Page 25
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
which restricted the use of concrete is the fact that
concrete is a comparatively new material, but since
the striking examples of its extreme utility as well
as perfect adaptability of artistic expression are to
be found in many sections of the country, there
is a promise that the concrete house will become
the rule rather than the exception and it is in look-
ing at the concrete house from this point of view
that we begin to understand its true significance
and value.

States. Both parents of 66 per cent of all engineer-
ing students are native Americans.
About 73 per cent of entering freshmen come
from cities, and 27 per cent from the country and
from villages of less than 5,000 population.
The fathers of 30 per cent of engineering stu-
dents follow some commercial or business occupa-
tion (merchandising, banking, salesmanship, insur-
ance, real estate, and the like). The next largest
group of fathers, comprising 25 per cent, are en-
gaged in manufacturing and other industrial pur-
suits, including farming. Another 20 per cent are
in various professions, mostly engineering, medi-
cine, the ministry, teaching, and law, in the order
named. The next largest group are laborers,
skilled and unskilled, comprising 15 per cent of the
total. Contractors and builders comprise the re-
maining 10 per cent.
About 90 per cent of all freshmen enter the
college of engineering upon certificates from accred-
ited high schools, and substantially the same per-
centage is admitted without entrance conditions.
The Median age at entrance (for freshmen) is about
19.5 years.
During their high school courses 76 per cent
liked mathematics, and 72 per cent did well in it.
In physics 83 per cent liked the subject, and 71
per cent made good records in it. Chemistry held
the affections of an even 50 per cent, but only 45
per cent were rewarded by good marks. On the
other hand, only 38 per cent had a definite liking
for history, but 51 per cent did well in that study.
English shared in the affections of 28 per cent, but
38 per cent made good records. Finally, 29 per
cent professed a liking for foreign language, and 32
per cent did well in it.
Of those students who finish the college courses
and get the bachelor's degree, about 36 per cent
take part in the extra-curricular activities of the
campus, and most of these have some part in two
or more separate activities. Membership in fra-
ternities, societies, clubs and other organizations
is held by 80 per cent, and many students belong
to two or more.
Besides engaging in these extra-curricular activi-
ties, more than half of those students who finish
the programs of study and receive engineering de-
grees earn, during term-time, a substantial part of
their school expenses. Something like 75 per cent
of all students earn at least a little money at some
time during the four years, but this figure is of no
great importance, for unless a man earns, say, more
than ten per cent of his expenses he can hardly be
classed as partially self-supporting. Accurate fig-
ures for one class indicate that in their freshman
year 47 per cent of the students earn, during term-
time, more than ten per cent of their school ex-
penses, during the sophomore year the ratio is 51
per cent; during the junior year 52 per cent; and
during the senior year 55 per cent. The propor-
tion of expenses most commonly earned is between
one-fourth and one-half.
The age at graduation ranges from 20 years to
30 years or more, the Median age being 23.4
years.
Studies of the reasons why students leave the
college of engineering, whether to transfer to some
other department of the University or to leave
school entirely, are in progress, but results are
hardly yet in form for discussion. In a general
way, it appears that out of 100 students who enter
the college of engineering as freshmen approxi-
mately 40 are graduated after pursuing their courses
continuously to completion, and a few more ulti-
mately return and get their degrees.

ing material, and his working substance; he devel-
ops his cycle of operations with steam as the work-
ing substance, consisting of supply of heat from the
boiler adiabatic expansion, and the rejection of heat
to the condenser.
He then introduces the idea of the reversible
cycle, perhaps the most important for thermody-
namics. With the steam engine he gets into trou-
ble with the feed water when he reverses the cycle,
and so turns to the idea of the hot-air engine, for
which the cycle is clearly expressed and the rever-
sibility demonstrated. From study of the reversible
cycle, he demonstrates that the efficiency of the
ideal engine is independent of the working sub-
stance; otherwise a combination of a reversed en-
gine with a more efficient direct engine would
make power, an idea which he rejects as unthink-
able.
He concludes his discussion of the ideal engine
with the requirements that all heat absorbed must
be taken at the temperature of the hot body A, and
heaU must be rejected only at the temperature of

the cold body B. This clearly stated ideal cycle is
perhaps the most practical invention relating to
heat engineering.
Continuing his study of the properties of air, he
just missed discovering the constant ratio of the
specific heats at constant volume and at constant
temperature. He makes a computation of what we
now recognize as the mechanical equivalent of heat
and comes within 15 per cent of the joule function.
He concludes that the fall of caloric produces
more motive power at inferior than at superior tem-
peratures. In other words, it is better to get a
more perfect vacuum than to raise steam pressure;
a fact but recently realized by the modern develop-
ment of steam turbines.
No wonder that Carnot, unknown to his contem-
poraries, is the head of the corner of the edifice
of heat engineering.

NOISES
(Continued from Page 16)
in the current, and these variations follow quite
consistently the variations in sound, with regard
both to frequency and intensity. Inasmuch as the
natural resonant frequency of the small tightly
stretched metal diaphragm is very high, the Wentc
condenser transmitter gives practically equal re-
sponse to all ordinary frequencies. The fluctua-
tions, however, are very minute; this transmitter is
relatively very insensitive. To make much use of
it, its responses must be passed through three, four
or five stages of vacuum tube amplifiaction. Even
after such amplification, a delicate vacuum thermo-
couple and high sensitivity galvanometer arc re-
quired before readings are obtained. But in spite
of the complexity and the delicacy of such system,
there is today no more accurate method of evaluat-
ing the intensity of aerial noises. As a standard
method for the calibration of any other noise meas-
urer, the Wente condenser transmitter is unsur-
passed. With such equipment the noises of many
roller bearings were measured, and the ratings
assigned by ear inspection were found to corres-
pond satisfactorily well with the ratings as read
off our galvanometer. In a suitable laboratory
such equipment could be used for the frequent cali-
bration of standard bearings, or for the measure-
ment of the noise emitted by any bearing in ques-
tion. Obviously, however, such equipment is too
difficult to maintain in adjustment to use in regular
production inspection in a factory. And even if in
proper adjustment its use requires considerable
technical skill.
A breakdown in our apparatus in November,
1923, proved a blessing. While waiting for replace-
ments, some experiments were conducted on the
vibration of the plates on which the roller bearings
were mounted. The notion was quickly reached
that in the vibration of these plates we had accu-
rate evidence of the perfection or the imperfection
of the roller bearings. The source of noise always
is a vibrating body; in the case of roller bearings,
before the noise reached the stage of aerial vibra-
tions traveling towards our ears, it must have
existed in the form of vibrations in the metal of the
running machine. In a violin, for example, although
it is aerial waves that reach our ears, and although
primarily these waves are controlled by the vibrat-
ing string, yet from an energy standpoint most of
the sound proceeds from the vibrating body of the
violin. Similarly in an automobile-—consider a
rear axle assembly, for example. Imperfections in
the gears or in the bearings may produce noise, but
the noise is first transmitted to the housing, and
then later to the air. So that instead of measuring
the disturbance in the air near the rear axle, it may
be better to measure the vibrations of the housing
itself.
The sound inspection machines used in car in-
spection by the Timken Roller Bearing Company
have somewhat the general appearance of drill
presses. The shelf consists of two large flat plates,
about three inches apart and supported horizon-
tally at their edges. The bearing under test is
placed on the upper plate, and then run at varying
speeds under a predetermined load. The inspector
listens to the bearing for a few seconds at different
speeds and at changing speeds, and then assigns the
bearing either to the accepted basket or to the scrap
basket. Incidentally, the objectionable noises are
those which show up most prominently while the
speed is changing—a very noisy bearing giving the
easily recognized whine or whistle, or "north-wind
sound."
In order to study the motion of the flat plates on
these sound-testing machines, a wound permanent
magnet was fastened to one plate and an armature
to the other, the combination being similar to an
ordinary telephone receiver. In the ordinary re-
ceiver incoming fluctuating currents cause the disc
armature to vibrate and thus produce sound. In
our pick-up, the operation is reversed, the receiver
becomes a dynamic transmitter, the combination is
used as a generator, vibrations of the armature
induce minute currents in the windings, and these
currents are used to indicate the amplitude of the
vibrations of the plates. The method looked hope-
ful from the very start. Later the results obtained
this way were compared with results obtained from
aerial sounds, and the agreementwas such as to
justify the new method in every respect. Further
the new method of evaluating noises by investigat-


Page 27
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
ing the metallic vibrations causing the noises has
two very important advantages:
First, the large metal plates set in vibration by
the running bearings are not affected in the least
by ordinary noises. The necessity for a sound-
proof room entirely disappears, except as it was
used at first for comparison and calibration pur-
poses, used until we were convinced that metallic
vibrations give a truer method of inspection than
do aerial vibrations. The dynamic transmitter
vibration pick-up can be used and is being used
in the open factory, unaffected by even the loud
surrounding noises.
Second, aerial vibrations carry relatively little
energy, whereas the vibrating plates have energy
to spare. The energy picked up from the plates,
after only two stages of amplification, is sufficient
to operate an ordinary portable galvanometer, an
instrument that requires no more careful handling
than does a watch, and is just as easily read. Inci-
dentally the change from air noise to iron vibra-
tion did away altogether with the influence of the
so-called cage rattle in inspection. To understand
what this -means, the reader should know that in
roller bearings the rollers are held loosely in place
by means of a light cage. When the bearings are
run in air, the cage produces quite a rattle; in fact,
cage rattle is the principal sound noticed by an
inexperienced observer. However, this noise is en-
tirely unobjectionable, because when the bearing is
packet in grease in actual use the cage rattle entirely
disappears. On the testing machine this rattle is a
prominent sound, but does not affect in the least the
vibrating plates to which our vibration pick-up is
attached. It is pertinent here to mention a fallacy
held by some gear manufacturers, namely, that a
specially smooth accurately ground gear is noisier
than a similar gear not quite so perfectly made; in
other words, the fallacy that there is a stage in per-
fection above which a gear actually becomes noisier.
The fact is that not all noises are objectionable. In
an auto the rattles and bangs are not so objection-
able as that penetrating musical whine or sing that
appears when speeding up out of low or out of
second. In a roughly made gear unobjectionable
noises may mask fainter objectionable noises, so
that when the surface is made more smooth and
more nearly of the approved theoretical curvature,
the objectionable noises stand out relatively more
prominently. Similarly, in an auditorium an echo
may be drowned out by reverberation. A burning
candle, invisible a hundred feet away in glaring
sunlight, becomes a prominent landmark at mid-
night. A skilled inspector gets so he can ignore
cage rattle to a certain extent, but our present
device for picking up vibrations is not even aware
of the existence of such rattles.
The accompanying figure shows the general ap-
pearance of a self-contained portable outfit. The
machines in use at the factory are electrically' the
same, but differ in unessential details, such as in
having the pick-up permanently attached instead
of to be plugged in, running a group of these
machines off a single storage battery, and in hav-
ing the indicating galvanometers on separate
shelves near and in front of each operator. The
oldest machine has been in continuous production
inspection since February, 1924. In practice a
machine is so calibrated that a roller bearing so
noisy that it is just on the verge of being rejected
will give a deflection about half way across the gal-
vanometer scale. A red ink line is marked on the
scale at that point. In routine inspection, then,
any bearing that gives a deflection beyond the red
line is rejected, and those that fall short of the red
line are accepted. It is worthy of note that the
inspector does not need to hear the bearings at all;
although he is inspecting roller bearings for noise,
he may himself be totally deaf.
At first thought one might expect that the pro-
cess could and would be carried a step farther to
the total eliminaion of he human inspector, to the
completely automatic sorting of bearings. This has
not seemed feasible as yet, because a roller bearing
is not a precision source of sound. The readings
obtained are not steady but fluctuating. If the
intensity of vibrations were constant, the galvanom-
eter deflection would be constant. Hut in an ordi-
nary roller bearing there are ten, fifteen or twenty
or more moving parts, each one of which is a
probable source of some vibration. As the bearing
turns, these sources change in phase with respect
to one another, so that the resultant intensity fluc-
tuates. The inspector is governed by the average
behavior, not by the extreme. For example, suppose
the red line is at a deflection of 25 scale divisions.
A bearing which fluctuates between 23 and 26 would
be accepted, while one which fluctuates between 24
and 29 would be rejected. In some bearings with
two poor rollers and the rest practically perfect,
the gain of one imperfect roller on the
other results in slow regular beats in the gal-
manometer pointer. Owing to these fluctuations
in the deflections, there is still opportunity for the
discriminating judgment of the inspector. Further,
especially good, quiet bearings can be sorted out
from the average run of good bearings. The read-
ings of the indicating meter give direct quantitative
evidence as to the quietness of any bearing tested.
Further, the readings are consistent and repro-
ducible. With the same adjustment of sensitivity,
a bearing tested at intervals of several days gives
the same results. If it is rejected one day, it is
rejected another day. If it is quiet in the presence

of the seller's inspector it will be quiet in the pres-
ence of the buyer's inspector. If any question arises
as to which of two bearings is the quieter, the
machine will give an unbiased answer in a few
seconds. Since readings are practically instantane-
ous, the speed of the machine is limited only by
the rate at which the operator can feed in the bear-
ings. The inspection can be just as thorough as
the" type of bearing demands. Further, the toler-
ance limit can be changed through wide ranges just
by turning the dial rheostat that shunts the galvan-
ometer. For special bearings, the apparatus may be
adjusted so that a very faint noise or imperfec-
tion will send the pointer to the red line; for
rougher work, the adjustment may be such that
a somewhat noisier bearing will be passed.
In the former inspection by car it was necessary
for the inspector to refresh his memory by more
or less frequent reference to the noise of standard
bearings. In our vibration measuring instrument,
since it is fundamentally a measurer of small alter-
nating currents, generated by the vibration of the
armature of the pick-up, it has been possible by
means of a small step down transformer and a po-
tentiometer to introduce into the circuit a measur-
able, variable amount of oO-cycle a. c. electromotive
force, and thereby standardize the reading not in
terms of a bearing which may or may not change
as the months go by, but in terms of the more
constant, easily accessible 110-volt circuit. A snap
of a switch and a setting of a dial—the input cor-
responds precisely with the average input of a pre-
viously calibrated standard bearing; adjust the gal-
vanometer shunt to bring the pointer on the red
line for this standard input and the outfit is ready
for business.
In addition to the measurement of roller bearing
noises for which the apparatus was specifically de-
veloped, we find that it gives evidence of consider-
able usefulness in many other fields. In the por-
table model herein pictured, instead of the special
pick-up there may be plugged in an ordinary dyna-
mic telephone transmitter, such as for example a
Baldwin receiver. The instrument then becomes a
detector of noises. With the two stages of amplifi-
cation in this portable set an ordinary speaker's
voice will send the galvanometer off the scale, while
with four stages very faint sounds may be meas-
ured.
Equipped with a different kind of pick-up, a sort
of electrical geophone, in which the magnet is at-
tached to a relatively heavy mass of large inertia,
and the light armature is pressed gently against
any object whose vibration is to be investigated,
the instrument is adapted to the study of most any-
kind of moving machinery. It may be made suf-
ficiently insensitive to study the vibrations of bump-
ers and fenders, where the amplitude may be a
quarter of an inch, or it may be made so sensitive
as to be unable only in special quiet surroundings.
With four stages of amplification, the walls of our
new Physics Laboratory, for example, (a building
with unusually deep foundations and special con-
struction for rigidity and freedom of vibration so as
to be suitable for sensitive physical apparatus), are
seen to be in almost continual vibration during
the day. Late at night when the vibrations have
subsided so that the galvanometer will stay on the
scale, the instrument will detect the slight tap of a
small rubber hammer on the corridor floor a hun-
dred feet distant. As Mr. Firestone says, the in-
strument in its most sensitive form is not to be
sneezed at—because the response may be so violent
as to break the galvanometer.
But in spite of its good features it is not perfect
yet. It has been developed as a measurer of total
quantity of noise, or total energy of vibration, it
will not sort out one noise or one source of vibra-
tin from another. When placed in contact with
the window of a closed automobile, for example,
it will indicate the total amount of vibration for
that part, but it will not go farther and say that
27% °f that vibration is caused by an unbalanced
crank shaft, and 73% from a flat tire. It is hoped
that further work can be done toward the proper
evaluation of prominent component parts of noises
and vibrations, so that knowing the "spectrum" of
a noise, a study of the frequencies involved will
serve to locate the sources.
This work has been done under the auspices of
the Engineering Research Department of this Uni-
versity. Professor A. E. White, Director of En-
gineering Research, has smoothed the way over sev-
eral obstacles. The work has been done wholly
in the Physics Laboratory. Professor H. M. Ran-
dall, Director of the Physics Laboratory, has will-
ingly and gladly permitted us to make full use of
the facilities of the laboratory, in the way of rooms,
apparatus and the services of an instrument maker.
The work has been financed by the Timken Roller
Bearing Company, of Canton, Ohio, and to them
thanks are due for the liberal funds they have placed
at our disposal. Finally, the actual work has been
done very largely by Mr. Floyd A. Firestone, for
whose ability and industry 1 have great respect.
In the Nation's Business for January, we find
an interesting article by Arthur T. Hadley, former
president of Yale, on "Where Public Ownership
Fails." This is of special appeal because of its
authoritative treatment of public ownership ap-
plied to some new engineering enterprises.
If you have half an hour to spend, don't spend it
with someone who hasn't.

THE COLLEGE CHRONICLE
Items of Intercut to Michigan Engineers
Ft intent Jiody Honor* Dean Cooley
Perhaps the most impressive event of the year
was the Engineering Convocation held Friday,
March 27, in honor of Dean Mortimer E. Cooley.
The ceremony was planned as a surprise for the
Dean and was exceptionally well conducted. At
eleven o'clock, students were excused from their
sections and the classes assembled in Hill Auditor-
ium practically to a man, each class in a separate
section. The Junior section was bright with the
red jackets which that class has affected this year.
The Faculty was assembled upon the platform.
Mr. Gardner S. Williams officiated as chairman.
As an introduction to the exercises, "Al" Cuthbert,
22E, who was varsity cheerleader in 1922, lead the
crowd in some hearty yells. Cuthbert came to Ann
Arbor especially for this function. This cheering
was followed by "The Victors," everybody singing.
After a short talk by President Lloyd, Mr. L. \V.
Wallace, Secretary of the American Engineering
Council, ;uid a lifelong friend of Dean Cooley, deliv-
ered the principal address of the morning. \Yhen
Mr. Wallace had finished speaking, Waldo F.
Creiner, 25E, president of the senior engineers,
presented to the Dean, in behalf of the students
of the College of Engineering and Architecture, a
large silver loving cup. The convocation was ter-
minated by the singing of "America."

demonstrated the automatic control equipment.
The trip of May 5 included visits to the Connor's
Creek Tower House and the Congress Street sub-
station of the Detroit Edison Co. The Main and
Cherry exchanges of the Michigan Bell Telephone
Co. were also inspected.
Mr. W. K. Bradbury of the Niagara Falls Power
Co. on May 4 addressed an open meeting in the
Natural Science Auditorium. He outlined the his-
toric side of power development at the Falls and
then went into the construction of the new tunnel,
which carries 10,000 cubic feet per second, in con-
siderable detail. He also described the three gen-
erators, each of 70,000 horsepower capacity, which
are the largest of their kind ever built and which
weigh 1,700 tons each. Mr. Bradbury told of the
model of Niagara Falls built by the company to
study the erosion of the rim of the Falls and the
means of preventing its further pr&lt; egress.

Branch of Society of American Military
Enyineerit Installed Here
The University of Michigan Branch of the So-
ciety of American Military Engineers was officially
installed March 9, 1925, at which date the election
of officers also took place. The Michigan Section
is a Student Branch of the National Society, an or-
ganization of long standing, of which Major Gen-
eral Taylor, Chief of Engineers, is the president.
The purpose of the society is to promote national
defense and preparedness and to develop relations
of helpful interest between the engineering profes-
sion in civil and military life. The society pub-
lishes a monthly magazine, the "Military Engineer,"
which holds a high place among engineering period-
icals.
Active membership in the society is limited to
graduate engineers holding commissions in the reg-
ular and reserve branches of the army and navy,
while membership in the Michigan branch is re-
stricted to upper-classmen and post-graduate en-
gineers who are members of the R. O. T. C., or
other military forces of the United States. The

Architect*' May Party
The Architects' May Party, held in Barbour Gym-
nasium the evening of May 8, proved like its prede-
cessors, to be the most interesting and colorful af-
fair on the campus. It has become a firmly estab-
lished tradition since its inception five years ago,
and each year has attracted widespread attention
as the most beautiful and picturesque of the many
social functions at the University. As in former
years, it was entirely the product of the students
of the Architectural College. From the preliminary
designs and estimates, throughout the detailed or-
ganization and completion of the plans and the dec-
orations. A competition for a decorative scheme-
was held for all students in the Architectural Col-
lege as a part of the regular courses in Design.
These were judged by a committee composed of in-
structors, and from the solutions of a number of
*tudents. a composite design was evolved.
The committee, headed by Douglas D. Loree.
'25A, was composed of A. L. Roe, J. H. Barry, K.
C. Black. R. E. Burket. F. B. Joslin, H. S. Cassidy.
Leroy Kiefcr, C. A. Sirrine, R. E. Oester, O. K.

Advanced Architectural Dexiyn
Eliel Saarinen, distinguished Finnish architect,
who for a time last year was visiting Professor
of Architecture at the University, has again been
secured to instruct in a special course this semes-
ter. His distinguished work in modern conceptions
of architecture is widely known in Europe, as is
his exceptional ability in solutions of city planning
problems. Last year he participated in the compe-
tition for the Chicago Tribune Tower, and his de-
sign, placed second, attracted nation-wide interest,
and gained for him instant recognition in the United
States. His projects for the remodeling of the city-
plans of Chicago and Detroit have brought him into
further prominence.
The class is composed of seniors and graduates,
limited in number in order to afford a more inti-
mate acquaintance and closer personal contact with
Mr. Saarinen. Individual problems are selected,
and it is through these that the students obtain an
idea of the methods he employs to arrive at satis-
factory solutions. Among these projects are sev-
eral civic and community centers, waterfronts, and
aviation fields.
Clay models are a very necessary part of the
procedure for with these it is possible to secure the
third dimension effect, and better visualize mass and
proportion.
Although it is beyond the scope of any of the
students to evolve perfected problems by them-
selves, it is felt by all that the time and effort spent
in following Mr. Saarinen through the analysis and
to a solution is most profitably spent, and that the
ideas and principles involved are of very great
value to them.
Tail tfiyma Delta
Tau Sigma Delta, National honorary society in
Architecture and the Allied Arts, elected for the
second semester the following students:
Harry N. Halgren, '26A W. G. Chan, '25A
Frederick B. Joslin, '25A Harrison C. Cook, '25A.
The selections are based upon scholastic achieve-
ment, campus activities, and personality. Members
are chosen from the junior and senior classes in
Architecture, Architectural Design, Architectural
Engineering, and Landscape Architecture.
Death Claim H Profexxor Klockxiem
The passing of Professor Arthur C. Klock-
siem, of the English department, which oc-
curred Thursday, March 2o, was a severe
shock to all associated with him. His death
resulted from influenza, complicated with
pneumonia.
Professor Klocksiem, who was 48 years of
age, received his master's degree from the
University in 1908, coming to the University
faculty from Western Reserve University five
years ago. He did especially good work with
foreign students and conducted several special
courses in English. Before his death, Pro-
fessor Klocksiem was working for his doctor's
degree.
Professor F. L. Schneider, of the English
Department, characterized Professor Klock-
siem as "a quiet gentleman whose full worth
was not immediately appreciated and who was
ever ready to assist students with unusual pa-
tience and real understanding of their difficul-
ties."

Echoes from the Graduates
PROFESSOR C T JOHNSTON
PROFESSOR CLARENCE THOMAS JOHN-
STON was born on October 23, 1872, on a
Colorado farm in the vicinity of Denver, of Scotch-
Irish and Dutch descent. His father was engaged
in numerous .activities in Colorado and Wyoming,
being successively a farmer,
miner, railway builder, canal
builder, superintendent of irri-
gation systems, administrative
officer of W y o m i n g, and
banker.
From 1881 to 1884 Johnson
had onlv a country schooling,
but from 1884 to 1890 he at-
tended grade school and then
high school in Cheyenne,
Wyoming. As a small boy he
manifested an interest in en-
gineering. Due to the climate
of the country and the irregu-
lar rainfall, irrigation was nec-
essary to the success of their
farm. Helping in this work,
and being well trained in the
subject by his father— a canal
builder and irrigation superin-
tendent-Johnston developed a
keen interest in irrigation at an
early age. While working for
the State Engineer of Wyom-
ing during the summer of 1891, he came in contact
with a Michigan graduate, William H. Code, on
whose advice he came to Ann Arbor in the fall of
that year and entered the university to take up Civil
Engineering.
He roomed three of his years at Ann Arbor with
Professor Horace W. King, and it is interesting
to note some of the things of those days which made
college life so different from what it is now. In-
stead of electric light and steam heat, they had
two kerosene lamps and a small coal stove; instead
of autos or street cars, the high old-fashioned bi-
PROF. C. T. JOHNSTON
cycles with the huge front wheels. Their principal
recreation was the Saturday night meeting of the
Engineering Society, until their senior year when
they both learned to dance and attended the parties
every month at Grangers. Outside of school hours,
we have it that Professor
Johnston used to sell popcorn
where Quarry's drug store is
now located, and if it was a hot
evening, he might have been
caught serenading with his
guitar, playing his favorite
piece, the Spanish Fandango.
It might be said to his credit
that though he had plenty of
money to take him through
college comfortably, he lived
very modestly. He was a good
student, and particularly so in
mathematics and mechanics. A
very clever sense of turning
things with his dry sense of
humor, together with his quiet
and reserved manner, made
him a close friend to all that
knew him, and his popularity
is attested by his election to
the vice-presidency of the En-
gineering Society during his
senior year.
Previous to his college course he had studied in
a law office and this added to the law lectures, all
of which he attended while in school, lent a broad-
ening influence to his engineering education. In
1895 Clarence Johnston was graduated from the
University, with the degree of B. S. in Civil En-
gineering. In 1899, after pursuing graduate work
outside of school, the degree of C. E. was conferred
upon him.
Johnston's professional activities began before
he had been graduated from Michigan. For three
summers while he was an undergraduate, he was


Page 33
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
in the employ of the State Engineer of Wyoming.
During these periods he came into frequent con-
tact with Elvvood Mead, now Commissioner of the
United States Bureau of Reclamation and at that
time the State Engineer of Wyoming, and they be-
came very close friends. In July, 1895, Johnston
finished the survey and plans for a reservoir for
the Wyoming Development Company, having a
thirty-five mile water line and a dam thirty-five
feet high and one and one quarter miles long. Dur-
ing the same summer he surveyed a one hundred
mile line, estimated the costs and made a complete
report for a large canal to divert water from the
North Platte River. The ensuing fall, winter, and
spring he laid out nine thousand acres of placer
mining ground, put in a placer mining plant, com-
plete with the necessary equipment and apparatus
for amalgam treatment, and maintained thirty miles
of canal for the West Side Mining Company in
Routte County, Colorado.
Following this he spent about halt" a year meas-
uring streams for the United States Geological Sur-
vey. Early in 1897 Johnston undertook the con-
struction of a reservoir at Wheatland, Wyoming,
involving tunnels and special hydraulic structures
in reinforced concrete, which he completed during
the summer. In the fall of the same year he as-
sisted Captain H. M. Chittenden in a thorough in-
spection of reservoir sites in Wyoming.
In November, 1897, he was appointed Assistant
State Engineer of Wyoming and held this position
for two years. In 1899 he was selected as Assistant
Chief of Irrigation Investigations for the U. S. De-
partment of Agriculture. He acted in this capacity
for five years studying irrigation and drainage
throughout the southern and western states. In
1901 he was detailed by Secretary Wilson to study
the administration of water and the irrigation and
drainage systems in Spain, Southern France, North-
ern Italy, and Egypt. His most extensive work
was in Egypt where he spent the winter months
studying the administrative system and the large
canals and dams. Among these were the Assuan,
Assiout, and Cairo dams; the first was the largest
dam in the world, while the Assiout dam was a re-
markable piece of work because its foundation rests
on mud and silt. His journey took him up the
Nile as far as Abu-Simbel. One of the important
irrigation works he inspected was the Yusef Canal,
supposed to have been built by Joseph under one
of the Pharaohs. He had already inspected nearly
every important irrigation system in the United
States and he now had an exceptional opportunity
to extend his study to some of the important works
of the old world.
In 1903 he resigned from the government service
to become State Engineer of Wyoming. From 1903
to 1911 he had a part in the settlement of over
ten thousand claims to water and approved mil-
lions of dollars worth of construction. One of his
accomplishments was the design and construction
of the water system of Cheyenne with its reser-
voirs requiring two dams one hundred feet in height.
Besides he carried on a great deal of surveying and
construction for tunnels and roads in the moun-
tains of Wyoming where unusual topography adds
interest and difficulty to engineering work.
Johnston succeeded Professor Davis as Professor
of Geodesy and Surveying at the University of
Michigan in December, 1912. In Ann Arbor Pro-
fessor Johnston has been president of the S. C. A.,
chairman of the first discipline committee on the
campus, a member of the Board in Control of Ath-
letics, and one of the first officers of the mentor
system, a member of the Scientific Club, a Director
and Past President of the University Club, and
nineteen twenty-five delegate to the Senate Council
from the Engineering College. He has one partic-
ular hobby and that is collecting various old vol-
umes and editions of Boswell and Johnson.
A great satisfaction coming from his university
work relates to the improvement and rebuilding of
Camp Davis. A water system was installed in
1912, a concrete building to house a well and power
plant in 1913, and in the same year a unique boat
harbor and over fifty steel residence buildings, an
office, instrument room, club house, and keepers
house, all with a minimum of expense to the Uni-
versity. In 1915 a sanitary system was provided
and since then walks have been laid, trees planted,
and shrubs set out for the improvement of the
grounds about the camp.
Professor Johnston has published, "The \Vater
Rights of Bear River," in 1899 for the government,
"Egyptian Irrigation,' in 1901, "Some Principles
Relating to the Administration of Streams," in 1915,
frequent articles for the "Technic" and the "Michi-
gan Engineer," annual reports of the State Engi-
neer to the Governor of Wyoming, and numerous
government bulletins dealing with the legal and
economic phases of irrigation. He had a part in
drafting the Canadian Waterpower Law. He has
been consulted by several states, Oregon in par-
ticular, relative to irrigation legislature. He has
also done pioneer work in engineering photography,
geodesy, and the theory of least squares.
Professor Johnston is a member of the following
societies: Acacia Fraternity, Tau Beta Pi (one
of the three national councillors), Sigma Xi, an
American Society Civil Engineers, American Asso-
ciation Engineers, Michigan Engineers Society,
American Association for the Advancement of Sci-
ence, Society for Promotion of Engineering Educa-
tion, Association of State Engineers, and several
branches of masonry.

TRANSPORTATION IN INDIA
By B. S. SINDHU
IT needs no argument that the development ot
means of transportation has been a very great
factor in the progress of civilization. Some contend
that it has been the greatest single factor because it
has influenced the economic,
social, and intellectual sides of
human relationship. It is indeed
difficult to over estimate the
value of contributions of those
who discovered the buoyancy
of water. They unconsciously
laid down the foundations for
present highly developed
our
systems of transportation and
paved the way for exchange of
commodities', ideas, and knowl-
edge, which has gradually
broadened the outlook of human
life.
The history of India dates
back many centuries B. C. So
does the history of her transpor-
tation. Diverse civilizations
have flourished and decayed at
different periods, each rich and full of grandeur
in its own peculiar way. The means of transporta-
tion in the country played a most important part
in the progress of proverbial Hindu civilization.
Whether it was the bullock-cart, or the horse
driven buggy, or a primitive boat, or even a camel,
does not in any way alter the situation, nor does
it underrate the value of these ancient modes of
transportation.
THE development of trans-
portation on the other side
of the world, where conditions,
political, economical, and phys-
ical, contrast so strongly with
those in America, presents a
most interesting subject to the
engineer of to-day. The prob-
lems which confront him,
however, in India or America,
are fundamentally similar and
Mr. Sindhu has given us a
most graphic picture of the
successful manner in which
they have been solved in his
country.
—The Editor.
Ancient Shipbuilding and Shipping
Considering the fact that India is cut off from
the surrounding countries on three sides by
mountains and the only outlets to the outside world
are by her seaboard of over five
thousand miles, there is no won-
der that she should have devel-
oped shipping and maritime
trade to an appreciable extent
since very early times. There
is ample evidence for the claim
made by one of the Indian his-
torians on the subject: Profes-
sor Mookerjee of Calcutta Uni-
versity writes in "A History of
Indian Shipping and Maritime
Activity from Earliest Times"
which was published by Long-
man, Green and Company of
London some years ago:
"The early growth of her
(Indian) shipping and ship-
building, coupled with the gen-
ius and energy of her merchants,
the skill and daring of her seamen secured
to her the command of the surrounding seas for
ages and helped her to maintain her proud position
as the mistress of the Eastern seas."
Evidence collected by Professor Mookerjee is in
many respects foreign and goes back to 3000 years
B. C. Dr. Sayce, a famous Assyrologist, has as-
serted that commerce by sea between India and
Babylon must have been carried on as early as

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
about 3000 B. C. There is abundant testimony
of the Greek and Mohammedan historians, Chinese
and other foreign travellers, as to the ships which
were maintained for trade as well as formed the
defensive equipment of the Indian rulers. Emperor
Chaudar Gupta had a Board of Admirality which
formed one of the six boards of his War Office in
the years 297—321 B. C. During the time of Akbar,
who was a contemporary of Elizabeth in the six-
teenth century, a regular department of Admirality
was maintained to
look after the
maritime interests
of his Empire.
Lord Wellesley,
the Governor-
General of India
wrote in 1800,
"From the quan-
tity of private ton-
nage now at com-
mand in the port
of Calcutta, from
the state of per-
fection which the
art of shipbuild-
ing has already
attained in Bengal, it is certain that this port will
;\lwrays be able to furnish tonnage to whatever ex-
tent may be required for conveying to the port of
London the trade of the private British merchant
in Bengal." A Frenchman, F. Baltazar was highh
impressed by Indian ships and wrote in 1811,
"the Indian vessels unite elegance
and utility, and are models of fine workmanship."
The actual decline of shipbuilding in India began
about the year 1840 and lingered up to 1863, when
it was finally abolished, shortly after the assump-
tion of the Government of India by the Crown from
the East India Trading Company. It is thus
evident that fall of this industry is a matter
of recent years. One of the advocates of
discontinuing shipbuilding in India said that
the Indian ships will have to be largely manned
by the native element which he considered
was "undesirable," "inadvisable," and even "un-
patriotic." Mr. Digby, an English official, in his
dispatch to Home Government deplored this situa-
tion and remarked, "Scarcely anything has struck
me more forcibly than the manner in which the
mistress of the seas in the Western world has
stricken to death the mistress of the seas in the
East."
At present India possesses no shipbuilding and
shipping concerns worthy of mention. Her export
and import is a matter of British interest rather
A RATHER PRIMITIVE AFFAIR, BUT EFFICIENT WITHAL.
than Indian. It was indeed a sad day in the annals
of the history of India when her vessel-building
industry fell to pieces. Space does not permit even
a brief outline of some of the other very outstanding
causes which lead to the ultimate downfall of this
industry. However, it might be mentioned in pass-
ing that British commercial and political supremacy
over India would have been extremely difficult if
not impossible, if India's maritime activity had not
been forced to dwindle into non-existence.
River and Canal
Transportation
Rivers in India
have been formed
since very early
times, waterways
for inland com-
munication.
Transport a-
tion on the river
Ganges and the
Indus, is as an-
cient as is the his-
t o r y of those
primitive and dar-
ing tribes of Ary-
ans who fought
there, thousands of years ago, into the jungles of
India, inhabited by wild lions, tigers and elephants.
Like most other countries, the raft, the dug-out,
canoe, oar-boat, and the sail-boat, have marked the
successive steps in the evolution of modes of waier
transportation. Strange as it may appear, none of
these inventions have lost popularity, for even today
they not only exist widely, but promise to do so
indefinitely.
Prior to railroad construction, cities and towns
along the banks of some large rivers, possessed
great importance as river ports. Even today traffic
is very heavy on the Ganges and the Indus despite
the railroad competition. Railway lines have been
built parallel to important rivers which hitherto
possessed commercial importance as means of
transportation. The advocates of developing river
transportation, at least over such portions which
are easily navigable in all seasons, have not been
given a fair chance. The decision of the Govern-
ment has always rested in favor of railroads when-
ever there was a controversy over the respective
merit of the two modes of inland transportation.
India has a remarkable supply of canals and only
a few of them are fit for navigation. As • a rule,
people of India have not been eager to use them
for purposes of transportation. The most valuable
service rendered by them is from standpoint of
irrigation. The country is highly indebted to

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
canals because they have enormously increased the
total output of food-products, though they have
been a sad failure as means of transportation.
The modern methods of water transportation
seem to have hardly touched India. The sail-boats
and oar-boats are as much in vogue on Indian rivers
as they were a thousand years ago. The neglect
and gross indifference in the State and lack of
private enterprise
towards the
country's water-
ways is responsi-
ble for this back-
ward state o t
things. If Robert
Fulton were to
come back and
see thousands ot
old fashioned
"Kishtees" which
swarm the bank:;
of the Indus and
the Ganges, h e
would not only be
disappointed but
certainly estranged,
common.
Wooden tracks, horses as motive power for hauling
trains, the inclined plane etc., were not at all tried
in India. The fact that railway construction began
in India twenty-five years after the success of
steam-traction had been decidedly proven in Eng-
land and America, saved our pioneers from trying
and expensive experiments. The first track that was
laid in India was of iron and high class locomotives,
available at that
time, were im-
ported from Eng-
land.
The earliest
proposals to build
railways in India
were made i n

Hundreds of lives are lost every year
because many boats are either capsized by strong
torrents or smashed against bridge piers for lack
of power. But each time the river is blamed and to
some extent, the bad luck. Without the necessary
patronage and encouragement from the State,
there seems to have been a marked retrogression in
methods of water transport during the last century
and a half.
The Indian Railways
The pioneers of railroad building in India did
not have to face many of the difficulties which con-
fronted similar enterprises in Europe and America.
THE OX-CART, HOLDING ITS OWN AGAINST
THE AUTOMOBILE
1843. The Court
of Directors o f
the East India
Company sent a
dispatch to the
Governor-General
of India in which
they expressed
the desire of hav-
ing railways there. They also expressed the fear
that income would have to be drawn from transpor-
tation of goods and not passengers. They were
further afraid of the "violent winds, floods, insects,
and vermin" which in their opinion would make
railway building impossible.
Mr. Simms, an English engineer, was sent to
India to study the situation. He was associated by
two military engineers. In February 1846, he
recommended that companies be started to under-
take this enterprise under guarantee of small per-
centage on capital invested. Military engineers
submitted a separate report and observed that there
was no reason why railways should not be as suc-
cessful in India as in Europe.
The actual construction was started in 1849 and
first lines were not open for traffic till 1855. The
mileage built up to 1880 was 8494 and when the
mileage under construction at present is completed,
India can boast a total mileage of over 38,000,
fourth longest in the world.
The pioneer companies experienced no difficulty
whatever in financing the building projects. The
capital was raised in England under a guarantee
of Sc/c interest from the Indian Government. At
any time companies were authorized to demand the
Government to pay their actual investment on
roads, rolling stock, and plants at six months' notice.
Companies were furnished land free of cost for
ninety-nine years. These exceedingly generous
concessions were responsible for extravagance and
unnecessary wastage of tax-payers' money. The

cost of lines built prior to 1870 is estimated at
$85,000.00 per mile. In later years, however, con-
struction was carried on more economically.
The railway policy of the Government of India
has been, for a long time, a subject of considerable
controversy between the Indian and British pub-
licists. The Indian publicists almost unanimously
contend that the railroads in India, built and con-
structed with foreign capital and operated and
managed by foreign agents, with no or little knowl-
edge of local conditions, have been economically
ruinous to the country. On the other hand, some
ot the British publicists maintain that the growth
of the country's foreign trade and the amount of
traffic passing over the railroads, both conclusively
prove their trememkms success. There is, however,
no denying the fact that although railway policy
has been a source of great misery to the people
of India, economically and financially, India needed
railroads even at such a high cost. They have
largely contributed to the welfare and unification
of India; they have broken down the social barriers;
they have facilitated travel and thereby assisted in
social reform. They have made possible easy
mingling of people from different parts of the
country and thus helped the growth of national con-
sciousness and have broadened the people's outlook.
The leader may imagine a country as large as Eur-
ope, except Russia, with a population of 320 mil-
lions, with a different dialect every two hundred
miles and split up into heterogeneous castes and
creeds. The fashions in dress and customs change
likewise. Truly, India has been a home of variety
of everything in life. Nothing but transportation
and facilities of travel can improve this condition
and railroads have rendered valuable service in this
respect. No patriotic Indian will fail to acknowl-
edge this gratefully and unhesitatingly give credit
to England.
The railroads have far exceeded the expectations
of the builders. At first it was thought that rail-
roads would attract no passenger traffic and in-
come would have to be derived chiefly from book-
ing of goods. Today, each passenger train on main
lines, is cooped up to suffocation and each car is
loaded over twice its normal capacity. An American
tourist complained that it was "too hot" in sum-
mer and "too cold" in winter in the trains. On
branch lines, goods and wagons are often used for
passenger traffic which would be a disgrace to the
management in any country. The management is
decidedly defective, inefficient and often wasteful.
The fact that over 80 per cent of the railroad offi-
cials are covenanted from England for a certain
number of years and seldom possess an insight into
native affairs and needs, explains the reason.
The Indian Legislative Assembly decided in 1923
that all railroads be owned and operated by the
State. Gradually all railroads will be taken over
by the State from the companies. The Assembly
also made a provision that in case State operation
is a failure, railroads will be given over to the
Indian Companies, with Indian directorate and
rupee capital. This, however, is a big experiment
and the few following years alone can justify its
success or otherwise. But whether it be companies
or the State to operate the railroads, control and
management must shift from England to India and
bureaucratic authority must give way to democratic
principles of administration.

THE USE OF CONDENSERS FOR CORRECTING
POWER FACTOR
By BENJ. F. BAILEY, Ph. D.
Professor of Ekcirical Engineering
WHAT is meant by power factor can be well
illustrated by an ordinary ladder. A ladder
is used to gain height, but it rarely happens that we
are able to take full advantage of the length of a
ladder. If the ladder is fastened to a vertical wall
of a building we use it to its fullest extent and its
power factor might be considered as 100 percent.
Ordinarily however the ladder is set at an angle and
therefore does not reach so great a height. The
actual vertical distance gained is of course the
product of the length of the ladder, and the cosine
of the angle between the ladder and the vertical.
The "power factor" of the ladder then becomes the
cosine of this angle.
Similarly in the case of an alternating current
the power may be the product of the current and
the electromotive force, but this is true only when
the current and electromotive force rise and fall
together. Ordinarily the current lags behind the
electromotive force and the power factor is then
the product of the current and the electromotive
force multiplied by the cosine of the angle between
them.
This means larger currents to develop the same
amount of power. The current required is propor-
tional to 777; Since the loss in a conductor is
proportional to the square of the current, the loss
1 2
is proportional to ( ) .
This means that with low power factors we must
either invest a large sum of money in larger con-
ductors or we must suffer a very large loss of power
in the conductors. For example, if the power factor
were 50 per cent (and this is not uncommon) the
loss would be four times as much as it would be
if we were operating at 100 per cent power factor.
If we wish to keep the loss the same as at 100 per
cent power factor our conductors would have to be
four times as great in cross-section. With very low
power factors the losses run up very rapidly. Thus
at 25 prr cent power factor the loss would be six-
teen times normal and at 20 per cent power factor,
twenty-five times normal.
Not only does low power factor force us to in-
crease the size of our conductors but it forces us
also to increase the size of transformers, switches,
fuses, and the generators supplying the current.
The prime movers driving the generators are how-
ever affected only to the extent that the losses in
the system are increased.
Methods of Correcting Power Factor
Several devices are used in practice to improve
the power factor. Low power factor is frequently
due to induction motors. It is well known that the
power factor of the usual induction motor becomes
better as the load is increased up to about 25 per
cent overload and becomes quite low when the
motor is only partially loaded. Obviously condi-
tions can be much improved if care is taken to see
that all motors are fully loaded.
The power factor of a synchronous motor can be
adjusted between wide limits by changing the field
current. \Yith the proper field current, the power
factor can be kept very close to 100 per cent. Ordi-
narily more field current than this is used with the
result that the motor takes a leading current. This
leading current tends to offset the lagging current
taken by induction motors and improves the power
factor on the whole system. Unfortunately syn-
chronous motors of the usual type are not practic-
able in sizes much below 100 horsepower but where
such motors can be used they probably furnish the
best and most effective method of raising the power
factor.
In connection with large installations special de-
vices called phase advancers are sometimes used.
These arc ordinarily not installed except in cases
where attendants are always at hand to look after
them.
Recently a special type of synchronous motor has
appeared on the market. This motor possesses
most of the good qualities of the induction motor.
It can be adjusted to take leading current and thus
correct the lagging current due to induction motors.
These motors arc built in comparatively small sizes.
The principal objections to their use are their com-
plexity and consequently liability to break down and
their very high first cost.
Use of Static Condensers
The primary purpose of this article is to discuss
the use of static condensers for correcting power
factor. A static condenser is ideal in its simplicity.
It consists of a large number of thin sheets of metal,
frequently aluminum, separated by insulating ma-
terial. For this purpose paper is usually used. The
paper may be treated in various ways with oils or
waxes to increase its ability to withstand electric


November, 1925
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
pressures. Half of the sheets are connected to one
side of the circuit and the other half to the other
side, alternate sheets being connected to alternate
sides.
Such a condenser connected to a line takes a cur-
rent leading the voltage by almost 90 degrees.
FIGURE 1
There are no moving parts and nothing to wear out
in the ordinary sense of the term, although it is
true that the insulation of such condensers some-
times breaks down due to excessive voltage. The
losses are practically negligible being ordinarily
less than 1 per cent of the product of the voltage
and the current which the condenser takes. Such
a device can be connected to a line and practically
forgotten.
From most standpoints we have here an ideal
method of correcting power factor. The only thing
that has prevented the extensive use of this method
is the cost of the condensers. Intensive research
work is now being carried on and there is every
probability that such condensers will be much
cheaper in the near future. The energy that is in
a condenser is actually stored in the insulating ma-
terial or dielectric and the capacity of the condenser
is dependent upon the ability of the dielectric to
withstand electric strains. The energy stored in
a condenser is proportional to the square of the
voltage, since if we double the voltage we double
at the same time the charge thus making the energy
stored four times as great. This means that the
usefulness of a condenser is proportional to the
square of the volts per unit thickness of dielectric.
In practice this varies roughly between 30 volts and
300 volts per thousandth of an inch. The bulk and
cost of condensers will be very much reduced when
higher limits can be used for this value.
Fig. I illustrates the operation of a condenser.
The vector E represents the voltage. I is the
current taken by the load. This is shown as lag-
ging behind E by the angle O. A condenser con-
nected to the same circuit takes a current practically
90 degrees ahead of E and is represented by the
vector I . The total current is the vector sum of
Im and Ic or I. It will be seen that although the
condenser takes a considerable current nevertheless
the addition of the condenser has actually decreased
the current in the circuit from I to I. and the
m
power factor has been greatly improved. By mak-
ing the condenser a little larger the power factor
might have been made exactly 100 per cent.
In Fig II are shown three different ways in
which condensers may be used. The diagram shows
a single phase installation in which the voltage is
reduced from 2200 to 220 volts by means of a trans-
former. The current is used to supply motors or
other loads represented by M. Power factor cor-
rection may be made by connecting condensers
directly across the motor terminals as shown at C
or by one larger condenser directly across the sec-
ondary of the transformer as shown at C or by a
high voltage condenser directly across the primary
as shown at C . The advantages and disadvantages
of these three different locations will be discussed
in some detail.
Condenser Directly Across the Motor Terminals
In many ways the connection of the condenser
directly across the terminals of the motor is ideal.
If desirable the condenser can even be made part
of the motor, although normally it is better to have
FIGURE 2
it an independent unit located in any available place
near the motor. In this way every individual motor
installation can be made to have a high power
factor and consequently the power factor of the
system as a whole is high. In Fig. Ill are shown
the curves of power factor of 15 horsepower, 900
r.p.m., 3-phase, 60 cycle, 220 volt induction motor.


Page 11
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
The lower curve shows the power factor of the
motor itself. The improvement in power factor by
adding condensers of 2, 4 and 7 kva capacity is
clearly shown. With 7 kva the power factor is
practically 100 percent throughout the usual range
of the motor. The current leads however at light
loads and lags somewhat at heavy loads. The addi-
tion of the two kva condensers increases the cost
of installation approximately 50 per cent at the pres-
ent price of condensers. The use of 4 kva prac-
tically doubles the cost. At 440 volts the conden-
sers would cost approximately half as much and
the increases in price would be respectively about
25 and 50 per cent. The higher cost of a 220 volt
condenser is explained by the fact that the sheets
of insulating material must have a certain minimum
thickness for mechanical reasons and therefore the
electric stress per unit of thickness in the dielectric
cannot be so high. Moreover the number of sheets
of conducting material needed is much greater.
Condenser on Secondary of Transformers
Condensers located directly at the motor term-
inals correct the power factor of everything on the
system except the motor itself. A condenser located
as shown at C2 corrects everything up to that point,
but of course does not correct the power factor in
the wiring between the transformer and the load.
The factory wiring could therefore be smaller or
the losses would be less with condensers located at
Cj than with condensers located at C2. On the
other hand the condenser at C could be smaller
than the sum of all the condensers located at Cj,
since in general all the motors would not be used
at the same time. Moreover it is somewhat cheaper
to build one large condenser than a number of
smaller ones of the same capacity. Some of the
advantages of the location C2 can be obtained if
the condenser C is connected ahead of the motor
switch instead of directly on the motor terminals.
With this location the condenser would not be dis-
connected when the motor was shut down. It is
believed that this connection would in most cases
be the preferable one.
Condenser Across Primary
A condenser connected directly across the pri-
marv as shown at C, would usually be somewhat
m o
cheaper than one connected at C2 . The reason for
this, as previously explained, is that it is usually
cheaper to build condensers for higher voltages
although this is a matter to be determined in each
individual case. A disadvantage of the location C 3
is that it does not correct the power factor in either
the transformer or the wiring and the transformer
would have to be just as large as though there were
no correction.
The Economic Problem
It is almost invariably true in engineering that
there are several ways of accomplishing a given
purpose. .The decision as to which one shall be
used is ordinarily a question of which would be
the cheapest in the long run counting the first cost,
the interest on the investment, depreciation, etc.

The problem assumes a somewhat different aspect
depending upon whether we are considering an
isolated plant or a central station. The problem is
much simpler in the first case, since there is no
question as to who shall bear the cost of an im-
provement in power factor. In the case of a small
customer of a central station usually no attention
is paid to power factor and the bill which the cus-
tomer pays is not in any way influenced by the
power factor. Theoretically the customer should
always pay for low power factor but practically the
difficulties involved in metering, in making out bills,
and in convincing the customer of the justice of such
charges is such that the matter is ignored. In such
a case the only advantage the customer gains by
improving his power factor is that the losses in his
wiring are reduced and consequently his bill for
power is slightly less. Incidentally his voltage regu-
lation will be somewhat better and this is advan-
tageous since it means better starting torque,
greater ability to stand overloads and a better speed
regulation in his motors.
In the cases of many larger installations the
power factor is measured and the amount of the
customer's bill is partially determined by the power
factor which he maintains. In this way it is com-
paratively easy to figure the saving which he would
make by improving his power factor and it is conse-
quently comparatively easy to determine whether
or not the installation of devices for correcting the
power factor is economically justified.

THE TRANSMISSION OF PICTURES OVER
TELEPHONE LINES
By H. E. IVES and J. W. HORTON*
R. D. PARKER and A. B. CLARK
THE problem of directly transmitting drawing,
figures and photographs from one point to
another by means of electricity has long attracted
the attention and curiosity of scientists and engi-
neers. The bread principles of picture transmission
have been recognized for many years. Their re-
duction to suc-
cessful practice,
however, re-
quired, among
other things, the
perfection of
methods for the
faithful transmis-
sion of electrical
signals to long
distances, and the
development o f
special apparatus
and methods
which have be-
come a part of the
communica-
tion art only
within the last
few years. Prom-
inent among the
newer develop-
ments which have
facilitated picture
transmission are the photoelectric cell, the vacuum
tube amplifier, electrical filters, and the use of
carrier currents.
None of the systems heretofore devised have
been sufficiently developed to meet the requirements
of modern commercial service. The picture trans-
mission system described in this article has been
designed for practical use over long distances, em-
ploying facilities of the kind made available by the
network of the present telephone systems.
The desirability of adding picture transmission
facilities to the other communication facilities now
possible seems now to be well assured. Various
engineers of the System have made suggestions' and
carried out fundamental studies of the possibilities
for picture transmission offered by the telephone
and telegraph facilities in the Bell System
Plant which have aided materially in the develop-
ment of the method to be described.
•Mr. Parker and Mr. Clark, both of the American Telephone and
Telegraph Company, are Michigan graduates.
FIG. 1—SENDING END APPARATUS SHOWING MOTOR
FILM CARRIAGE, OPTICAL SYSTEM AND AMPLIFIER
MODULATOR.
The account of the picture transmission system
which follows is intended to give only a general
idea of the work as a whole. A number of engi-
neers have collaborated in this work, and it is ex-
pected that later publications will describe various
features of the system and its operation in much
greater detail.
General Scheme
of Picture
Transmission
Reduced to its
simplest term s.
the problem of
transmitting a
picture electrical-
ly from one point
to another calls
for three essential
elements: The
first is some
means for trans-
lating the lights
and shades of the
picture into some
characteristic of
an electric cur-
rent; the second
is an electrical
transmis-
sion channel cap-
able of transmitting the characteristic of the
electric current faithfully to the required distance;
the third is a means for retranslating the electrical
signal as received into lights and shades, corre-
sponding in relative values and positions with those
of the original picture.
Analyzed for purposes of electrical transmission,
a picture consists of a large number of small ele-
ments, each of substantially uniform brightness.
The transmission of an entire picture necessitates
some method of traversing or scanning these ele-
ments. The method used in the present apparatus
is to prepare the picture as a film transparency
which is bent into the form of a cylinder. The
cylinder is then mounted on a carriage, which is
moved along its axis by means of a screw, at the
same time that the film cylinder is rotated. A
small spot of light thrown upon the film is thus
caused to traverse the entire film area in a long
spiral. The light passing into the interior of the


Page 13
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
cylinder then varies in intensity with the trans-
mission or tone value of the picture. The optical
arrangement by which a small spot of light is pro-
jected upon the photographic transparency is shown
in section in Fig. 1.
The task of transforming this light of varying
intensity into a variable electric current is perform-
ed by means of an alkali metal photoelectric cell.
This device, which is based on the fundamental
discovery of the photoelectric effect by Hertz, was
developed to a high degree of perfection by Elster
and Geitel. It consists of a vacuum tube in which
the cathode is an alkali metal, such as potassium.
Under illumination, the alkali metal gives off
electrons, so that when the two electrodes are con-
nected through an external circuit, a current flows.
This current is directly proportional to the intensity
of the illumination, and the response to variations
cf illumination is practically instantaneous. This
cell is placed inside the cylinder formed by the
photographic transparency which is to be trans-
mitted, as shown in Fig. 1. -As the film cylinder is
rotated and advanced, the illumination of the cell
and consequently the current from it registers in
succession the brightness of each elementary area
of the picture.
Assuming for the moment that the photoelectric
current, which is a direct current of varying in-
tensity, is of adequate strength for successful trans-
mission, and that the transmission line is suitable
for carrying direct current, we may imagine the
current from the photoelectric cell to traverse a
communication line to some distant point. At the
distant point it is necessary to have the third
clement above mentioned, a device for retranslating
ribbon, which is in consequence deflected to one
side by the inter-action of the current with the
magnetic field, thus exposing the aperture beneath.
Light passing through this aperture is thus varied
in intensity. If it then falls upon a photographic
sensitive film bent into cylindrical form, and rotat-
ing in exact synchronism with the film at the
sending end, the film will be exposed by amounts

the electric current into light and shade. This is
accomplished in the present system by a device, due
in its general form to Mr. E. C. Wente, termed a
"light valve." This consists essentially of a narrow
ribbon-like conductor lying in a magnetic field in
such a position as to entirely cover a small aper-
ture. The incoming current passes through this

varying in proportion to the lights and shades of
the original picture. The ribbon and aperture of
the light valve are shown diagrammatically in Fig.
3. Fig 4 shows a section of the receiving end of a
system of the sort postulated, with its light source,
the light valve, and the receiving cylinder.
Adaptation of Scheme to Telephone Line
Transmission
The simple scheme of picture transmission just
outlined must be modified in order to adapt it for
use on commercial electrical communication sys-
tems, which have been developed primarily for
other purposes than picture transmission. Of ex-
isting electrical means of communication, which
include land wire systems (telegraph and
_^ telephone), submarine cable, and radio,
the wire system, as developed for the
telephone, offers great advantage when
all factors are considered, including con-
stancy, freedom from interference and
speed. The picture transmission system
has accordingly been adapted to it.
In the simple scheme of picture trans-
mission outlined in the preceding section,
the photoelectric cell gives rise to a direct
current of varying amplitude. The range of fre-
quency components in this current runs from zero
up to a few hundred cycles. Commercial long
distance telephone circuits are not ordinarily
arranged to transmit direct or very low fre-
quency currents, so the photoelectric currents
are not directly transmitted. Moreover, these
currents are very weak in comparison with ordinary
telephone currents'. On account of these facts, the
current from the photoelectric cell is first amplified

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
by means of vacuum tube amplifiers and then is
impressed upon a vacuum tube modulator jointly
with a carrier current whose frequency is about
1,300 cycles per second. What is transmitted over
the telephone line is, then, the carrier wave modu-
lated by the photoelectric wave so that the currents,
in frequency range and in amplitude, arc similar to
the currents corresponding to ordinary speech.
When the carrier current, modulated according
to the lights and shades of the picture at the send-
ing end, traverses the ribbon of the light valve at
the receiving end, the aperture is opened and closed
with each pulse of alternating current. The en-
velope of these pulses follows the light and shade
of the picture, but the actual course of the illum-
ination with time shows a fine structure, of the
periodicity of the carrier. »
Synchronization
In order that the light and shade traced out on
the receiving cylinder shall produce an accurate
copy of the original picture, it is necessary that the
two cylinders rotate at the same uniform rate.
This, in general, demands the use of accurate timing
devices. The means employed in the present ap-
paratus consist of phonic wheels or impulse motors
controlled by electrically operated tuning forks.
Were it possible to have two forks at widely separ-
ated points running at exactly the same speed, the
problem of synchronizing would be immediately
solved. Actually this is not practical, since varia-
tions of speed with temperature and other causes
prevent the two forks from operating closely
enough together for this purpose. If the two cylin-
ders are operated on separate forks, even though
each end of the apparatus runs at a uniform rate, the
received picture will, in general, be skewed with re-
spect to the original. The method by which this dif-
ficulty has been overcome in the present instance is
due to Mr. M. B. Long. Fundamentally the problem
is solved by controlling the phonic wheel motors at
each end by the same fork. For this purpose it
has been found desirable to transmit to the receiv-
ing station impulses controlled by the fork at the
sending end. The problem of transmitting both
the fork impulses and the picture current simultane-
ously could be solved by the use of two separate
circuits.
It would not, however, be economical to use two
separate circuits for the picture and synchronizing
channels, consequently the two currents are sent
on the same circuit. In order to accomplish this,
the picture is sent on the higher frequency carrier,
approximately 1,300 cycles per second, and the
synchronizing pulses are sent on the lower fre-
quency carrier, approximately 400 cycles per second,
both lying in the range of frequencies readily trans-
mitted by any telephone circuit. These carrier
frequencies are obtained from two vacuum tube
oscillators. The two currents' are kept separate
from each other by a system of electrical filters at
the sending and receiving ends, so that while the
current on the line consists of a mixture of two
modulated frequencies, the appropriate parts of the
receiving apparatus receive only one carrier fre-
quency each.
Description of Apparatus
Mechanical Arrangements
The essential parts of the mechanism used for
rotating and advancing the cylinder at the sending
station, and for holding the photoelectric cell and
the amplifying and modulating system are shown
in the photograph, Fig. 7. At the extreme left is the
phonic wheel impulse motor, which drives the lead
screw through a spiral gear. The spiral gear ordin-
arily turns free of the lead screw, but may be en-
gaged with it by a spring clutch. The lamp hous-
ing, which provides the illumination for the photo-
electric cell, is in the foreground at the center of
the photograph. The photoelectric cell is in a
cylindrical case at the left end of the large box
shown on the track and projects into the picture
cylinder on which a film is in process of being
clamped. The amplifier and modulator system is
carried in the large box to the right, which is
mounted on cushion supports to eliminate disturb-
ances due to vibration.
The receiving end mechanism for turning and
advancing the cylinder is similar to that at the
sending end. The parts consist of the light valve,
which is in the middle of the photograph, and the
lens for projecting the light from it upon the cylin-
der. The metal cylinder around which the sensitive
photographic film is wrapped, appears at the ex-
treme right. The microscope and prism shown are
used for inspecting the light valve aperture for ad-
justing purposes.
The Transmission Line
In view of the fact that the currents used in
picture transmission are caused to be similar both
as to frequency and amplitude to those used in
speech transmission, it follows that no important
changes in the transmission characteristics of the
telephone line are called for. \Vith regard to the
frequency range of the alternating currents which
must be transmitted and also the permissible line
attenuation, the transmission of pictures is less ex-
acting on the telephone line than is speech trans-
mission. In certain other respects, however, the
requirements for picture transmission are more
severe. For speech, the fundamental requirement
is the intelligibility of the result, which may be pre-
served even though the transmission varies some-
what during a conversation. In the case of picture
transmission, variations in the transmission loss of


Page 15
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
the line, or noise appearing even for a brief instant
during the several minutes required for transmission
are all recorded and presented to view as blemishes
in the finished picture. Picture transmission cir-
cuits must, therefore, be carefully designed and
operated so as to reduce the possibility of such dis-
turbances. In transmitting pictures over telephone
lines, it is also necessary to guard against certain
other effects, including transient effects and
"echoes" caused by reflections from impedance ir-
regularities. A high degree of balance between the
lines and their balancing networks at
repeater points is also required. These
conditions can be satisfactorily met on
wire telephone lines. Radio communica-
tion channels are inherently less stable
and less free from interference, and
special means to overcome their defects
are required in order to secure high-grade
pictures.
Characteristics of Received Pictures
.All electrically transmitted pictures
have, as a result of the process of scanning
at the sending and receiving ends, a
certain amount of structure, on the fineness and
character of which depends the detail rendering of
the result.
There are, in general, two methods by which a
transmitted picture may be received. One of these
is to form an image of the light valve aperture on
the sensitive photographic surface. A merit of this
kind of picture (when received in negative form)
is that if the structure is of suitable size (60 to 65
lines to the inch) it may be used to print directly
on zinc and thus make a typographic printing- plate
similar to the earlier forms of half tone, whereby
the loss of time usually incident to copying a pic-
ture for reproduction purposes may be avoided. A
disadvantage of this form of picture is that it does
not lend itself readily to retouching or to change of
size in reproduction.
Another method of picture reception is to let the
light from the light valve fall upon the film in a
diffused manner through an aperture of fixed
length so that lines of constant width (exactly
juxtaposed) but of varying density are produced.
1 rints made from film negatives received in this
way, if the structure is chosen fine enough (100
lines to the inch or more) are closely similar in ap-
pearance to original photographic prints and may
be reproduced through the ordinary half-tone cross-
line screen. They may be retouched or subjected
to special photographic procedures in any way de-
sired.
Electrically transmitted pictures are, in general,
suitable for all purposes for which direct photo-
graphic prints are used. Such uses include half-
tone reproduction for magazines and newspapers,
lantern slides, display photographs, etc. Among
these uses may be mentioned, as of some interest,
the transmission of the three black and white
records used for making three-color printing plates.
Some practical details of the procedure followed
in the transmission of pictures by the apparatus
described may serve to clarify the foregoing des-
cription. The picture to be transmitted is usually
provided in the form of a negative, which is apt to
be on glass and of any one of a number of sizes.

From this a positive is made on a celluloid film of
dimensions 5" x 7", which is then placed in the
cylindrical film-holding frame at the sending end.
Simultaneously an unexposed film is placed on the
receiving end. Adjustments of current values for
"light" and "dark" conditions are then made, over
the line; after which the two cylinders are simul-
taneously started by a signal from one end. The
time of transmission of a 5" x 7" picture is, for a
100 line to the inch picture, about seven minutes.
This time is a relatively small part of the total time
required from the taking of the picture until it is
delivered in the form of a print. Most of this total
time is used in the purely photographic operations.
When these are reduced to a minimum by using
the negative and the sending end positive while still
wet, and making the prints in a projection camera
without waiting for the received negative to dry,
the overall time is of the order of three-quarters of
an hour.
Fields of Usefulness
The fields in which electrically transmitted pic-
tures may be of greatest service are those in which
it is desired to transmit information which can only
be conveyed effectively, or at all, by an appeal to
vision. Illustrations of cases where an adequate
verbal description is almost impossible, are por-
traits, as, for instance, of criminals or missing in-
dividuals; drawings, such as details of mechanical
parts, weather maps, military maps, or other rep-
resentations of transient conditions.

TIPS ON LOGARITHMS
By W. W. SLEATOR, Ph. D.
Assistant Professor of Physics
ALL engineers use logarithms. Even chemists,
to say nothing of astronomers although not
real engineers, use them too. In fact it is the as-
tronomer whose working life the invention of loga-
rithms is said to have doubled. To add instead of
having to multiply, to sidestep the drudgery of cube
root, or to be able to find X if 3.7* = 1911 — the
advantages offered by the table of logarithms are
obvious.
A
FIGURE 1
It requires only a sheet of good cross section
paper to make a table of logarithms, or a sheet of
better cross section paper to make a better one. If
one uses perhaps twenty of the smallest divisions
along the X axis for unity, and will plot 1/x on the
same scale along the y axis, he will describe the
rectangular hyperbola xy = 1. This is a curve
reverently drawn up and explained by the professor
of physics as holding the secret of Boyle's law, of
the point of application of the resultant of parallel
forces, and of the location of images formed by
lenses and mirrors. It holds all the numbers of a
log table. For, in Fig. 1, if one carefully counts
up the area between the ordinate where x = 1, the
curve, the x axis, and the ordinante where x = n, he
gets the logarithm of n. The area A in the figure
is in fact log 3, A being bounded by the ordinate
at x = 3. Similarly the area between x = 8 and
x — 3 will be the logarithm of 8/3. If an engineer
gets cast away on a desert island he can in this way
make himself a table of logarithms, one of the first
things an honest to goodness engineer will need, of
course. The skeptical reader is encouraged to check
by his own count—or to call to mind that ^1/x dx =
logx.
The logarithms to be obtained from Fig. 1 are
not the most familiar kind. They are in fact loga-
rithms to the base e, which is about 2.71 and about
the most remarkable number there is. Since in any
system the logarithm of the base must be 1, it is
possible to compute e from Fig. 1. "e" is in fact
the abscissa of the point at which the ordinate,
with that at X = 1, encloses an area unity. To
make the actual calculation one would plot areas
as function of X, on rather a large scale. How-
ever, as a base for logs 10 offers certain advantages.
The greatest of these is that one need carry around
only the values for numbers from 1 to 10. For log
90 equals 1 plus log 9. If we had plotted the curve
xy = 0.43429 the corresponding areas would have
been common logarithms, which are smaller than
those with base e.
Every schoolboy is familiar with the curve
obtained by plotting log X as a function of X, just
as every engineer is familiar with the style of
Macaulay. Therefore that curve is given, in Fig. 2.
When one looks up the log of a number what he
wants is the ordinate of this curve at the abscissa
equal to his number. Of course he doesn't find it.
Except for 1, 10, 100, etc. (and certain numbers of
unlimited length) the logarithm of a number may
be exactly expressed only by an infinite number of
digits. If the logarithm of a number is given to
7
FIGURE 2
five places as 0.69900 one knows only that the actual
log is between 0.699005 and 0.698995. It might be
written 0.69900 ± 0.0000050, for this represents a
range within which the true log has a fifty-fifty
chance of falling. A number and its logarithm are
represented by a point on the curve of Fig. 2. A
number and the log obtained from a table are rep-


Page 17
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
resented by a point within half a unit from the curve
on either side—half a unit, that is, in the last place
given in the table. The band in Fig. 3 is bounded
by two curves E and F, one a half unit above and
one as much below the true logarithmic curve, and
the ordinates of A and B represent two logarithms
listed successively in the table.
In the actual use of a 5 place table one gets the
log of a five figure number only by interpolating
(unless of course his number ends in zero). The
table often includes a first aid to interpolation where
one learns that 6/10 of 14, for example, is 8.4. In
Fig. 3 the process of interpolation is represented
by dividing the straight line AB into proportional
parts at C. If now one adds the 8.4 which the table
has given him to the logarithm listed, and keeps
the 4, he has a six figure logarithm. But the chance
that C lies within the narrow band 1/10 as wide as
the one shown, as a true 6 figure log should, is
surely no more than 1 in 10. Accordingly the
appearance of 6 figures is a delusion and perhaps a
snare, and one does not keep the 4. In Fig. 3 the
interpolation does not give a 6 figure log, and there
is even a small chance that C will lie outside the
wider band altogether.
When the logarithm is given the process of find-
ing the number is represented in Fig. 4. What one
has is PQ, what he wants is the abscissa of J but
what he gets is that of K. The probable error in
the number will be due partly to the original un-
certainty in the logarithm, for PO is not absolutely
known, and partly to the uncertainty which would
be introduced by the table even if the log were pre-
cisely known. If the log is 0.69900 ± 0.0000025
one finds a common difference 9, and the number is
evidently 5.000 + (3/9 ± 1A of 1/9 in the last place)
,-e
FIGURE 3
or 5.00033 ± 0.00003. This probable error corre-
sponds to that of the original logarithm, but even
if there were no original uncertainty there would
still be a variation in our number because AB does
not follow the 'true logarithmic curve, and this
second correction would again on the average,
correspond to l/\ unit in the last place of the log.
For, in Fig. 4, M N is divided by AB at S and R S
is on the average l/\ MN. Accordingly, since
d(log X) = l/xdx,
d(log JX) = 0.43429 dx. Let x = 5, d (logifl X)
JO
= 0.0000025, and dx is 0.00003. However these cor-
rections are as likely as not to influence the result op-
positely and, on all accounts, our number is 5.00033
± 0.00004 and is onlv as likelv as not to lie between
FIGURE 4
5.00029 and 5.00037. Therefore the number is not
entitled to six digits but should be written 5.0003.
Again suppose 9.69903 is given as a five place log
of sin 0. Unless we have taken the log from a
table with more places, and are sure the next figures
are zeros, all that we really know is that log sin 0
= 9.69903 ± 0.0000025 as before. 0 is accordingly,
if one consults the table, 30° — min. ± y4 of 1/22
min. the difference being 22, or 30° 0' 16". 4 ±
15"/22. But there is, besides, the uncertainty in
angle which we will have even if we have none in
the log, and this corresponds to the same correction,
namely 0.0000025, so that what we really get is 30*
0' 16". 4 + 1" nearly, indicating a range as likely
as not to be exceeded. Five places therefore will
not give us our seconds with precision, though, in
this part of the log sin table, they come near it. If
9.93750 is given as a five place log cosine we find a
common difference of 7 and the angle is
30° 0' 26" ± 3".
Perhaps this is the best that may be said for five
place logs, but it is not the worst. For if the log-
arithm whose number we wish to find is the result
of addition the several errors in the added loga-
rithms produce a cumulative effect and we have an
uncertainty in the sum which is somewhat worse
than the 0.0000025 used in the foregoing arithmetic.
To cast any doubt upon the value and convenience
of logarithms is by no means the purpose of this
paper. But to employ them confidently one must
be aware of their limitations.

LAKE CURRENTS
By FRANK JEHMIN
Meteorologist, II. 8. W. B.
THE NORTHERN STAR, FLOATED ONLY AFTER THE THIRD ATTEMPT. THE STERN WAS REST-
ING ON THE BOTTOM OVER SIXTY FEET BENEATH THE SURFACE.
CURRENTS are a menace to navigation. They
exact a heavy toll which is reflected not only
in the amount of insurance premiums paid by
marine interests, but in the occasional unmanning
of some of our best navigators. This fact will con-
tinue until an accurate, definite, and widespread
knowledge of currents has been obtained. In the
preparation of wreck charts by the Weather Bureau
in 1892, those in charge of the work were impressed
with the fact that wrecks were clustered at certain
points. This suggested that unknown currents
might play a considerable part in wreckage, and
steps at that time were taken to get a better idea
of what currents are. The method pursued was
that of bottle papers and the results showed only
the prevailing currents of the Great Lakes. Mind-
ful of the fact that shipping was more vitally in-
terested in the set and drift of the currents from
day to day, further thought was given to the sub-
ject, which was taken up at the Weather Bureau
Office at Alpena.
In the preliminary study, information was ob-
tained from experiences as related by local marine
men. The records of Coast Guard Station at Thun-
der Bay Island showed that 95 per cent of the
wrecks were the result of grounding or stranding
due to the boats being off their compass course in
thick weather. From inquiries among the fisher-
men and vesselmen, it was found that the prevailing
currents are down the west shore; that the direction
and force are not always indicated by the wind;
and that those from the north are the strongest,
with the greatest flow seven miles east of Thunder
Bay Island. That the currents indicated on hydro-
graphic charts along the west shore as from the
north, are not always from that direction, and that
the direction is not always indicated by the wind,
was forcefully proven by an ice flow, which was ob-
served going up the lake into a moderate north-
west gale faster than a man can walk. Consider-
able difficulty is experienced in towing rafts, be-
cause of currents, and occasionally it requires sev-
eral large tugs to keep a raft off shore, even with
favorable winds. Fishermen suffer a greater loss
from the enormous force of currents than from
wind and sea in time with their boats and damage
to their nets. After making a run of from twenty-
five to fifty miles to the fishing grounds, the nets
can not be located because the "soldiers" or buoys
with staff, holding a small flag ten to fifteen feet
above the water, are swept below the surface. Nets
have been torn to pieces in from twenty to forty
fathoms of water during a time when the winds
were light to moderate variable. The nature of the


Page 19

damage indicated that it was produced by a strong
current of great depth. Debris from the bottom of
the lake found entangled in the nets offers further
evidence of a deep current. July and August are
called the "months of currents," because this is the
time the fishermen have their greatest losses; at the
time of strong currents the lake level is not at rest.
Results were enlightening in the correlation of
these facts and marine disasters with the develop-
ment of allobars or areas of rising and falling pres-
sure over the surface of bodies of water as indicated
by barometer readings and barograms. For in-
stance; the strange character of the sinking of the
Steamer Kirby on May 8, 1914, is outstanding.
The fact that the boat, regarded as entirely sea-
worthy, was lost in the middle of the day, in a
comparatively moderate storm, and that she sank
without warning, caused the inspectors to probe
the case with unusual thoroughness. They found
that a great wave came over the port bow submerg-
ing the deck, and by its weight, tipped the stern
of the ship high in the air. Before the Kirby could
right herself, a second wave followed and as the
boat stood poised with her after hull clear of the
water, a third wave seemed to catch her from be-
neath. She heaved upward, and for thirty seconds
or so stood motionless and then suddenly shot for-
ward to the bottom of the lake. The Weather
Bureau chart showed that the storm differed only
in one respect to other storms of moderate intensity
in the fact that it had traveled from Duluth to
S. S. Marie at the rate of fifty miles an hour instead
of twenty-five miles per hour, which is the usual
rate of movement of the center of storms. A no-
ticeable feature of the barograms obtained at Al-
pena and Port Huron during the terrific storm of
1913 was the sudden drop in the pressure curve
which indicated a sharp fall in pressure over a lim-
ited area, similar to those occurring during severe
squalls. This dip was felt at Port Huron at 8:00
P. M. and at Alpena at 11:00 P. M., a distance of
150 miles, showing a travel rate of approximately
fifty miles per hour. Attention is called to the fact
that at the time of the rapid, progressive, north-
ward movement of the intensified change in pres-
sure, the greatest number of boats were lost.
Shipmasters occasionally encounter a strong cur-
rent when the wind is light and variable and at
times when the wind is strong against it. At 1:30
A. M. October 18, 1920, the Steamer Sultana ran
aground near Thunder Bay Island in a fog. There
was nothing to indicate to the captain that he was
being carried off his course four or five miles to
the west, as there was scarcely any wind, and he
was in a "silent zone" of the Thunder Bay Island
fog whistle. While he was coming north, the
"glass" was falling more rapidly over Saginaw Bay
than elsewhere, causing the set and drift which
resulted in the accident. That night numerous
other vessels came dangerously near the Island, but
were more fortunate in passing when the silent
zones were less pronounced.
The Captain of the Steamer Conneaut reported
that he experienced a fresh south-southeast wind
and heavy sea crossing Saginaw Bay on the night
of November 28th and 29th, 1919. Further, a
strong current into Saginaw Bay had carried him
a few points to the west and retarded his move-
ment. At ten P. M. of the 28th, special information
from the Alpena Office was broadcasted advising
boats that conditions were favorable for the cur-
rents and a sea heavier than the wind indicated.
The warning was issued because the combination
of thick weather, abnormal movement of the water,
and heavy sea was anticipated.
THE CHARLES S. PRICE, AN UNKNOWN WRECK FOR AL-
MOST A WEEK AFTER THE STORM OF NOVEMBER 9, 1913.
The writer had an experience aboard the Annie
Laura, which was most extraordinary. The Annie
Laura was used in salvaging copper off the Pewa-
bic which was sunk in twenty-seven fathoms of
water seven miles south-southeast of Thunder Bay
Island. It was 3:30 P. M. September 17, 1918,
when a severe squall was observed over South
Point moving rapidly towards the Annie Laura
which was moored over the wreck. In a few min-
utes we were in a moderate south-southwest gale

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
CAUSES AND CONTROLLING FACTORS IN THE
CORROSION OF IRON AND STEEL
By W. P. WOOD'
THE subject of corrosion has become, during
the last five years, one of the most important
and vital considerations confronting those indus-
tries whose operations involve tKe use of large
quantities of metals. It is a curious thing that the
importance of corrosion as an industrial problem,
was not recognized years ago, but the main reason
for this is well stated in an editorial paragraph in a
recent issue of Chemical and Metallurgical En-
gineering.
"Corrosion's wastage is often neglected because
it does not appear on a separate ledger account. Its
loss is charged to installation,
to maintenance and repair, or, as
is most often the case, is totally
obscured in a blanket depreci-
ation figure, mysteriously ar-
rived at and sacredly guarded
against analysis and revision.
The neglect of corrosion was
particularly true in the days
when replacement and repair
costs were relatively small.
Then it scarcely mattered that
depreciation was rapid. But
with the increase in manufactur-
ing efficiency, with the tendency
toward standardization of pro-
cess and machinery, the margin
of profit has grown steadily less.
Replacement and installation costs have assumed a
greater importance. In many instances, corrosion
resistance has spelled the difference between profit
and loss."
It is not the purpose of this paper to cite and
describe a large number of specific or peculiar cases
of corrosion and then attempt to explain them, but
it is the purpose to present the best views with re-
gard to the fundamental reactions of the corrosion
cf iron and the factors which control the reactions,
once started. Examples and results of investiga-
tions will, of necessity, be introduced to illustrate
points in connection with the above mentioned
purpose.
Corrosion Phenomena
Corrosion phenomena divide themselves natural-
ly into two classes: those observed when metals are
exposed to the action of the atmosphere, and those
observed when metals are immersed, continuously
or intermittently, in various kinds of liquids. In
the present discussion, we shall confine ourselves
to the first class and that portion of the second
which is concerned with results of immersion in
water, with a few observations upon the behavior of
iron and steel in the presence of dilute solutions of
acids and bases.
While it has been stated that atmospheric cor-
rosion is somewhat different than that produced by
immersion in natural waters it should be pointed
out that the difference is largely one of degree and
a slight variation in the character of the final prod-
ucts. The fundamental reactions
are without doubt the same, for
we find that the presence of
moisture is an essential con-
dition in all common cases of
atmospheric corrosion.
Theories of Corrosion
Several theories of corrosion
have been advanced during the
last fifty years, but most ot
them have been discarded for
the more rational electrolytic
theory, which is the one accepted
by the great majority of inves-
tigators at the present time.
The most important theory op-
posed to the electrolytic theory,
was the so-called acid theory,
and there is little doubt that this theory has still
some adherents, but they, at least, are not so com-
placently confident as was the case a few years ago.
If one will turn to any text book of chemistry which
was in use fifteen to twenty years ago, he will al-
most invariably find that iron rust was considered
to be a mysterious mixture of hydrates, oxides, and
carbonates, mostly carbonates. This view was the
result of a tacit acceptance of the acid theory which
was much in vogue at that time.
Acid Theory
Since the acid theory was the first one of the two
to be proposed, we shall first consider it here. This
theory states that the presence of an acid is neces-
sary for corrosion of iron to start. In the case of
corrosion by the atmosphere or by immersion in
/•CORROSION is doubtless
V^the greatest destroyer of
modern structures, which the
engineer has to combat. By
searching experiments and in-
tensive study of conditions,
science has arrived very close
to the ultimate cause, and the
resultant benefit appears to be
almost incalculable. Professor
Wood's research on the topic
is typical of that carried on by
the Engineering Research De-
partment of this University.

natural waters, the main one which is present is
carbonic acid (CO,). It is thus easily seen why
most of the subsequent discussions hinged around
the question of whether or not CO2 was necessary
for corrosion to proceed. Many investigations
were carried out to settle this troublesome point.
The acid .theory states that the simple corrosion
of iron proceeds through the following reactions:
2Fe + 2H2CO3=2FeCO3 + 2H2
4H2CO3
4FeCO3 + 10H2O + O2=4Fe(OH)3
It is seen that the corrosion of iron would be a
cyclical phenomenon, a very small amount of acid
being required to corrode a large amount of iron.
Reasoning further, the corrosion of iron might be
much inhibited or even prevented by the presence
of a small amount of a base. This is actually the
case and for a considerable time was cited as one
of the proofs of the acid theory. This phenomenon,
however, is equally well explained by the electroly-
tic theory. It will be further seen that oxygen is
required for a completion of the cycle but the im-
portance of this fact was lost sight of in the vigor-
ous campaign to prove that the presence of an acid
radicle was necessary.
Electrolytic Theory
The electrolytic theory involves primarily the
partial solution of iron in water resulting in the
formation of soluble ferrous hydroxide. It was the
demonstration of this point which proved somewhat
difficult to the early proponents of the electrolytic
theory. Cushman and Gardner" finally carried out a
series of experiments which demonstrated quite
satisfactorily that a small amount of iron will be
dissolved in pure water, oxygen and acid radicles
being absent.
Probably the best exposition of the electrolytic
theory has been made by Wilson,7 from whose
article the following discussion is abstracted. As
stated by him, the fundamental reaction in the cor-
rosion of iron is:
Fe + 2H * = Fe « + 2H (1)
The broad interpretation of this reaction is that the
presence of the hydrogen ion is necessary for in-

cipient corrosion. One of the products of the above
reaction is hydrogen, which will collect at the re-
action point as a polarizing film. Un-
less this film of hydrogen is continu-
ously removed the reaction will soon
cease. The removal of the hydrogen
may be accomplished by one or both
of the following reactions:

It has been observed that in the cor-
rosion of iron by natural waters the
amount of hydrogen evolved is almost
negligible as compared to the amount of
oxygen consumed. It, therefore, fol-

This reaction is not considered important as influ-
encing the corrosion rate. As the alkalinity of a
solution increases the hydrogen ion concentration
decreases until a point is reached where reaction 2
ceases to be a controlling factor and reaction 1 be-
comes the determining factor. The rate of corros-
ion will, therefore, be much inhibited but not neces-
sarily stopped. It is well known that the presence
of a small amount of base will very noticeably
decrease the corrosion rate of iron.
Turning to the situation where corrosion begins
to take place in increasingly acid solutions, it is
noted that reaction (3) becomes the controlling fac-
tor as soon as any appreciable evolution of hydrogen
occurs. As affecting the rate of reaction (3) the
hydrogen overvoltage of the metal will be the most
important consideration. This in turn will be
markedly affected by the presence of any impurities
in the metal, and many reported differences in cor-
rosion rates of various metals have been, without
question, due to this factor. Wilson rightly points
out the fallacy of comparing the corrosion resist-
ance of various metals on the basis of acid tests.
Factors Influencing Corrosion
Accepting the fundamental reaction in corrosion
to be those which have been previously stated, it
next becomes necessary to consider the factors
which influence the reactions at the time of their
appearance and during their subsequent course. A
list of these factors follows:
1. Solution potential of the metal
2. Concentration of metal ions in the solution
3. Hydrogen ion concentration of the solution
4. Rate of removal of polarizing film of hydro-
gen.
9. Solubility of oxygen in the solution
10. Humidity of the air
11. Depth of immersion
12. Viscosity of solution

iently divided into two classes, the first four rep-

necessary for initial corrosion, the rest representing
factors which influence the ultimate rate of cor-
rosion.
In the light of the previous discussion of the
mechanism of the electrolytic conception of cor-
rosion, the importance of factors 1, 3, and 4 is easily
recognized. Factor 2 might not be at once appre-
ciated but it is evident that if there is a notable
quantity of ferrous ions present in a solution which
is in contact with iron, there will be a somewhat
decreased tendency for the metal to pass into solu-
tion. Roughly speaking, it might be considered as
a back pressure working against the solution poten-
tial of the metal.
As has been intimated previously, the effect of
hydrogen over voltage will be of greatest importance
in corrosion by dilute acid solutions. In corrosion
by natural waters, however, its importance would
be practically nil, except possibly in the case of dis-
similar metals in contact in the presence of water.
The importance of film production and influence
in connection with the inhibition of corrosion has
been only recently appreciated. We are indebted
to Speller* and Bancroft10 for emphasizing this
factor. Some extremely useful aspects of this
factor were brought out in a recent paper by Spel-
ler,11 who has been working on the corrosion of iron
in closed water systems for several years. It has,
perhaps, been insufficiently emphasized that oxy-
gen through its depolarizing action according to re-
action (2), is the most important single factor in
corrosion of iron in natural waters. The removal
or neutralization of oxygen is, therefore, one of the
most important considerations in preventing or in-
hibiting such corrosion. One of the commercial
means of accomplishing this is by the use of a so-
called "deactivator," which allowrs the dissolved
oxygen to be fixed by reacting on large replaceable
surfaces of iron, before the water passes into the
main system. Such installations are most useful
for large service, and Speller predicts that the
smaller ones may be taken care of by the use of
protective films.
To be in any measure a protection, a film must
be of such a nature that the solution is not allowed
to- come into contact with the metal, nor oxygen
permitted to diffuse to and from the surface of the
metal. Some waters form natural protective coat-
ings. The author recently examined a section of
pipe which had been in service for thirteen years1.
It contained a thin hard scale which had preserved
the inner surface of the pipe in almost the condition
which had obtained at the time of installation. The
scale was largely composed of calcium sulphate.
There is a limit to the desirability of such scale
deposits, since they continue to increase in thick-
ness and may in time completely choke the pipe.
Probably the most interesting recent develop-
ment in connection with film formation is the de-
liberate production of films by the addition of sol-
uble silicates to the water. The colloidal SiO2
which is formed combines with ferric hydroxide in
building up a dense and adherent coating which
furnishes notable resistance to corrosion. Fig. 1
is a chart reproduced from Speller's paper,12 which
illustrates the effect upon corrosion rate of Pitts-
burgh water by additions of sodium silicate.
This whole subject of film protection is bound to
receive greater and greater attention as the practice
of installing industrial and municipal water soften-
ing plants increases, for it has been noted in many
such cases that as the troubles from the use of hard
water begin to disappear, difficulties from corrosion
make their appearance.
When corrosion is taking place in moving water,
it is manifest that the velocity of the water will
exert some effect upon the reaction. Heyn and
Bauer,13 and Friend14 report that corrosion under
such circumstances proceeds at a rate directly pro-
portional to the velocity of the liquid up to a certain
point and after that point is reached, exhibits' a
marked decrease in rate. Speller15 has also studied
this phase of the subject and his results do not
check those of the above mentioned investigators.
Fig. 2 is a reproduction of one of Speller's charts
which conveys the general trend of his results.
The specific rate of corrosion which is used in this
chart is obtained from a formula suggested by
Wilson16 and is equal to milligrams loss per square
centimeter per year per cubic centimeter of oxygen
in one liter of water. The factor of temperature is
also included in this chart which is a rather happy
occurrence as far as the present discussion is con-
cerned, for it gives concrete evidence of the usual
accelerating effect which increase of temperature
causes in any underwater corrosion. Briefly stated,
the chart shows no diminution of corrosion rate
with velocity in the pipes tested, but rather, indi-
cates that at lower temperatures, the corrosion rate
becomes constant after a certain velocity is attained
and at higher temperatures, shows a rapidly accel-
erating rate.
Remembering the importance of oxygen as a con-
trolling factor of corrosion, it is not necessary to
enlarge upon the importance of the oxygen solubil-
ity of the corroding medium. It has been shown,
that other factors being non-effective, corrosion
drops almost to zero in the absence of oxygen.
The importance of humidity of the air as a con-
trolling factor lies largely in the field of atmos-
pheric corrosion, although it is conceivable that
it might have a noticeable effect upon the oxygen

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
EDWARD DEMILLE CAMPBELL
By GEO. M. STANLEY, '27E
THE loss of Edward DeMille Campbell-'86 on
the 19th of September came as a great shock to
his friends, the University of Michigan, and the
scientific world at large. During 33 years of blind-
ness as Professor of Chemistry and Metallurgy and
Director of the Chemical Laboratory at the Univer-
sity of Michigan, he had carried on work and
formed associations that will distinguish him for a
long time as an outstanding chemist and a remark-
able man.
Professor Campbell was born in Detroit, on the
9th.of September, 1863, of a distinguished family.
His father, James Valentine Campbell, was for
twenty-six years a professor in the Law School in
Ann Arbor, and for thirty-seven years a justice of
the famous first Supreme Court of the State of
Michigan. Professor Campbell received his early
education in the public schools in Detroit, which
at that time was nothing more than an important
country town. Being an ardent sportsman and very
fond of hunting, he was attracted to the study of
zoology and he enrolled in the University of
Michigan in 1881. After a year in college, the lure
of chemistry drew him away from zoology, and he
entered on this new field with tremendous interest
and specialized in the branch of metallurgy. He
was assistant to Professor Byron Checver during
his senior year and at that time he published his
first article of research on "A Colorimetric Process
for Estimating Phosphorus in Iron and Steel." In
1886 he was graduated from this University with
the degree of Bachelor of Science. For the next
four years Campbell was chemist for the following
concerns successively: The Ohio Iron Company at
Zanesville, The Sharon Iron Company at Sharon,
Pa., and the Dayton Coal and Iron Company at
Dayton, Tcnn. Practically all of this time was
spent at lone blast furnaces where he was without
the cooperation of other technical men, but never-
theless he carried on research work and published
two more papers in 1887 and 1888, after intense an-
alytical study on the determination of phosphorus
content in steel. In 1888 he married Jennie M. Ives
of Cincinnati and shortly following he began his
famous career as a professor of chemistry.
It was to fill the place of Professor Cheever who
died in 1888 that Campbell came to serve on the
faculty of this University as Assistant Professor of
Metallurgy in 1890. Immediately he outlined and
began quite an extensive research on the hardening
of steel. One of his problems was the identification
of the hydro carbon gases which were emitted from
a solution of heat-treated steel. The apparatus
which dealt with this problem cost Professor Camp-
bell the loss of his vision. An assistant was con-
ducting the experiment one day near vacation time
when he entered the room and stooped to examine
a glass tube in which a combustion of oxygen and
hydrogen was going on. Without warning the
tube suddenly exploded, sending fragments of glass
into his eyes, and Campbell, throughout the rest
of his life, never saw again. Such an accident
would have ended the career of an ordinary man,
but with the reopening of school ten days later he
was back at his desk with a broad white bandage
over his eyes, and resuming his regular classes and
lectures. It was a mark of the courage and deter-
mination of the man. He was not the type that
worked forever in a secluded corner. He enjoyed
society, sport, and human companionship, and the
loss of sight spelled the loss of many of the things
he loved, but never did any of even his most inti-
mate friends hear him speak a word of complaint
on his misfortune.
In the further development of his work, a new
program of daily life was forced on Campbell: an
hour a day of exercise in the gymnasium, certain
hours when his assistants read to him, hours of
compiling his own notes by the -Braille typewriter
system of raised letters, and many long hours of
careful planning. Mention should be made of one
of Professor Campbell's outstanding features, that
of being able to work with untrained assistance.
Experiment after experiment he conducted with
none but undergraduate help to perform the opera-
tions and announce the results. Occasionally only
did he take an active hand in the manipulation
himself, but it was Campbell who layed the plans
for the experiments and he only who could inter-
pret the results to an effective end. He brought
about the founding of the Chemical Engineering
Department of the University in 1899 and was
Professor of Chemical Engineering at the head of
this department from then until 1914. In due time
he made immense advances in metallurgy, and on
the results of one we may repeat an acknowledg-
ment of Professor John Oliver Arnold of Sheffield,
from the Journal of the Iron and Steel Institute in
1899: "The authors have the utmost pleasure in
directly confirming the accuracy of Professor
Campbell's general conclusion, and here congratu-
late him upon an important discovery in metallur-
gical physics, so remarkable and unexpected as to
have been received with general incredulity."

In 1902 he began a comprehensive study and re-
search in concrete, his main effort being to prevent
the cracking of concrete from its expansion after
setting. Following considerable Work along this
line he demonstrated the limitations of Portland
Cement and along what lines it could be used with
the high degree of success with which it is used
today. Immediately upon our entrance into the
war in 1917 he was called upon by the Ordnance
Department for assistance to combat the corrosion
of gun steel. He was peculiarly fitted for this task
as he was one of the foremost metallurgists in the
world and possessed a unique knowledge of steel,
and in response he rendered most invaluable serv-
ice up till the signing of the armistice.
Even in his blindness, Professor Campbell de-
signed many of his most complicated instruments
and insisted on operating some of them himself.
He also planned the Chemical Building of the Uni-
versity and practically all of its arrangement of
laboratories and apparatus. It is said of him that
he could state from memory any dimension in the
building, a feat which indeed rivals Macaulay's
memorization of "Paradise Lost." Nor with all
his planning and experimenting was he too busy to
make known the results of his work, and from the
time of his own attendance at college to his death
he wrote 77 scientific articles for professional
journals, and a few more which will reach publica-
tion this year.
In regard to his position in Ann Arbor, we can
do no better than to quote from the Detroit Satur-
day Night: "In Ann Arbor Professor Campbell was
an institution. There has been, perhaps, no other
member of the University of Michigan faculty who
was more beloved by his students and all those
who came in contact with him. Anyone who heard
him lecture in the chemical theatre before several
hundred students will never forget it. His remark-
able memory served him far better than written
notes. He wrote complicated formulae on the
blackboard as though his vision were unimpaired,
and it was only in the arrangement of demonstra-
tion apparatus and the mixing of materials that he
required any assistance. Personally Professor
Campbell was a delightful companion. He loved
to associate with young people and he made a
point of meeting as many students as he could. No
one ever heard him complain and it seemed im-
possible to believe that he was blind at all. He
would lead visitors about his home, showing them
the different rooms, the pictures, the views, as if
he saw them perfectly through his own eyes. Had
he desired, Professor Campbell might have enjoyed
a far more considerable public reputation than he
did, for his work had a greater bearing on modern
industrial progress than anyone save those intim-
ately associated with him ever realized. But his
work was his principal interest, and he cared noth-
ing for any fame or glory connected with it."
It is of particular note that Professor Campbell
was a man who stood out in his profession, head
and shoulders above other men, without being lost
in that profession, that in addition to being a scien-
tific man with an exceptional knowledge of his
science, he was a lover of sport and companionship,
a character with an amiable, cultured, and mag-
netic personality.
His death is an unfortunate loss, and he will be
revered not only by the professional men who ap-
preciate his work, but by all of his friends and the
faculty and the students whose privilege it was to
know him.
He was a member of the following societies:
American Chemical Society, Iron and Steel Insti-
tute, Faraday Society, Washington Academy of
Sciences, Tau Beta Pi, Alpha Chi Sigma, Sigma Xi,
and Phi Lambda Upsilon.
He is survived by his wife, three sons, and three
daughters: Mrs. N. G. Begle of Greenwich, Conn.,
Mrs. J. G. Hayes of Ann Arbor, Mrs. E. L. Troxell
of New Haven, Conn., Edward D. Campbell of De-
troit, Dr. James V. Campbell, and Charles D. Camp-
boll of Ann Arbor.
TRANSPORTATION

face and easy grades with bridges over rivers and
streams it crosses. It also possesses adequate
drainage. Such roads did not exist in India prior
to 1840, although there were thousands of miles of
"second class" and "fair-weather" roads connecting
large cities and towns. The Shahi road, having a
complete length of 1500 miles, was built by Shcr
Shah between Calcutta and Peshawar, in the fif-
teenth century. Except for bridges over rivers, it
was a fine specimen of engineering.
Lord William Bentink, Governor-General of
India from 1825-35, is to be credited as the pioneer
of building highways in India. He rebuilt the
Shahi road and named it the Grand Trunk Road.
Its completion took two decades. This is a first
class highway in every respect and for a number
of years, this road remained the most magnificent
in India.
The work started by Lord Bentink was continued
with the same earnestness by his successors. By
1870, all great trunk roads had been completed. In
1902, country's first class highways reached a total
of 37,000 miles and unmetalled roads 136,000 miles.
Both these figures relate only to roads under super-
vision of Government.
Curious as it may appear to the reader, no less

to the writer himself, India has been using the
bullock-cart, horse-buggies, the camel, etc., for
ages. One generation has handed down to the next,
the same old fashioned heritage, century after cen-
tury. Now it looks as if it were a traditional affair.
The bullock-cart has survived many a century and
its design seems to have undergone little change
since the time of Adam. Such carts form the larg-
est traffic on roads and carry both passengers and
goods, particularly in rural areas. Fifteen miles a
day is considered a big day's run.
Unlike America and other industrial countries,
the bulk of India's population does not live in cities.
Over 75 per cent of the country's population is en-
gaged in farming, scattered all over the country,
and less than 10 per cent constitute urban popula-
tion. Therefore, railroads which have linked large
cities and towns with sea-ports can never be an
entire solution of country's transportation needs.
They do not reach the heart of India. The Indian
masses are backward educationally and depressed
economically. They are mostly illiterate and ignor-
ant about the outside world; even about their own
country. And yet, it is these people -who form the
backbone of the nation. It must, therefore, be
emphatically asserted that call for transportation
in rural areas is the greatest. All these evils may
be directly attributed to the lack of proper trans-
portation facilities.
The possibilities of highways transport in India
are second only to the United States. Of course, I
refer to motor transport and not the one that has
already existed for centuries. India could use un-
mctalled roads much more successfully than any
of the European countries. The absence of snow,
the lack of grades over vast plains, and the absence
of rains for much of the year, seemingly offer
unique opportunity for motor transportation. The
country possesses many miles of first class high-
ways which can be immediately used for long hauls.
The "second class" and "fair-weather" roads can be
used for lighter machines. Although present road
conditions are far from what they should be, they
are, in no way, a hindrance to the introduction
of auto-transport on large scale. Only initiative is
lacking.
There were only 63,500 automobiles in India at
the end of 1924, according to official statistics. This
is an extremely discouraging figure considering the
size, population, and volume of agricultural indus-
try of the country. The cause of backwardness is
not far to seek. People of India, as a whole, are
poor and the prices of cars and cost of fuel are
both prohibitive for them. The Ford car, at present
the cheapest, though not the lowest in quality and
workmanship, sells in India for nearly $900.00. If
the price were the same in America, "Fords"
wouldn't find easy markets even here.
Now that America commands the largest per-
centage of automobile business in the country,
American manufacturers can materially reduce the
prices of their products by establishing small assem-
bly plants in India. This would most assuredly in-
crease the volume of their business. The people of
India would be too glad to welcome and patronize
such schemes. It would also be humanitarian on
the part of Uncle Sam.
Conclusions
India's economic weakness lies in the inadequacy
of her productive industry other than agriculture.
Her rich material resources are yet waiting to be
developed and exploited. Industrial progress would
be impossible without the cheap, rapid, and efficient
means of transportation. When these facilities for
the distribution of goods and conveyance of men
are supplied, industrial development would un-
doubtedly follow. Much of the misery and poverty
of the people is unnecessary. The railroads have
done their part. Motor transportation has to ac-
complish the rest. In future, transportation needs
of agricultural communities of all countries will be
met by highways transport, rather than railroads.
Again, India's present economic organization
which is chiefly dependent upon agriculture, de-
mands effective means of transportation particu-
larly in rural areas. Motor transportation is adapt-
able to varying conditions and should, therefore,
be used as the chief agency for improving the
economic and industrial outlook of the country.
CONDENSERS
Continued from page 11
If in any case it should appear that the saving
to the customer would not be sufficient to warrant
the expenses of power factor correction it may fre-
quently be well worth while for the central station
to assume all or a part of the expenses for the sake
of improvement of the conditions on its own lines
outside of the customers premises. Thus the cen-
tral station is frequently justified in paying the dif-
ference in cost between a synchronous motor and
an induction motor in order to induce the customer
to use the former.
APPENDIX:—DETERMINATION OF BEST
SIZE OF CONDENSER. For the benefit of those
who wish to go further into the matter the follow-
ing method of attacking the problem may be of
interest. In Fig. 1 let the current of the uncorrected
installation be I . We wish to determine how
much leading current I _ we are economically justi-
fied in introducing to improve the power factor.
The first cost of the condensers will be propor-
tional to I and the fixed charge will also be
proportional to I . This fixed charge of course


Page 27
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
includes the interest on the investment, de-
preciation, maintenance, insurance, taxes, etc., and
will be somewhere in the neighborhood-of 10 per
cent of the first cost.
Let the fixed charge per ampere of condenser
current per year be C. The cost of the con-
denser per year equals I C. Power loss equals
12R. Let the current be on the condenser y per
cent of the time. Let the value of a watt year be V.
Then cost of lost power per year equals PR y V.
Total loss =
R y V + Ic2 R y V — 2
+ IcC = Ip2 R y V +
I 1° R y V + I C.
we-7 c
For minimum yearly loss we differentiate the loss
with respect to the condenser current I and place
the result equal to zero or
d '=21 R v V — 2 I R y V + C = 0 or
P » TJL' *
d I
c" » 2RvV
The above expression will give us the correct value
of the current to be taken by the condenser as soon
as we substitute the values of the constants. The
expression is rather peculiar in that the value of
the actual current does not appear at all but only
the value of the wattless component of the current
I . The condenser current is always less than the
total wattless current. In other words correction to
100 per cent power factor is never economically jus-
tified.
Many times in practice it will be found that the
last term is greater than I . In other words we
are not justified in supplying any condenser capac-
ity. This will quite obviously be the case if the
resistance is small or if the cost of energy is low
or if the condenser is connected to the lines only a
small portion of the time.
Looking at the problem as a whole, the term R
should of course include all the resistance back to
and including the generator proper, allowance be-
ing made for changes in voltage by transformers
when such changes occur.
Although every case must be considered on its
merits we can perhaps get a better idea as to when
condensers would be justified by taking a specific
case.
At 220 volts and 60 cycles condensers can be
bought for about $60.00 per kva. This corresponds
to $13.20 per ampere or if we assume the fixed
charges as 10 percent, this means a fixed charge
per ampere per year of $1.32. If we assume the
cost of a kw hour as 3c we have
Value of watt vear = V =
0.03 x 24 x 365
1000
$0.263.
The time which the current is on may vary
widely. Assume for example the motor operates ten
10
hours daily, then y = — = 0.417. Inserting these
values into the equation we get I ,R = 6.02 or it
will pay to use condensers if the product of* the
resistance and the wattless component of the cur-
rent exceeds about six volts. If we assume 24 hour
operation, it would pay to use condensers if this
product exceeded 2.5 volts.
The above is figured for 220 volt operation. As
nearly as can be judged from the prices at hand a
440 volt condenser costs about half as much per
kva as a 220 volt condenser. On this basis the cost
per ampere is the same. Consequently the same
figures would apply. (This would not be true how-
ever if we should go to much higher voltages say
2200 volts.) Since the probable drop in voltage in
a system is proportional to the voltage used, it is
evident that drops justifying the use of condensers
will occur much more frequently in 440 volt than in
220 volt systems.
It can readily be seen from the above that
whether or not it will pay to use condensers de-
pends very largely upon the length of the transmis-
sion considered, in other words upon the value of
the term R. In the case of an isolated plant if
the distance between the power house and the
motors is small the probabilities are that it would
not be worth while. If the current is transmitted
for a considerable distance the probability would
be much greater that it would pay to use conden-
sers.
It will also be found that in many cases the reduc-
tion in losses in the wiring can be more cheaply
accomplished by increasing the size of the wire
rather than by using condensers. In the case of a
plant already in operation it may however be im-
practicable to increase the size of the wire without
prohibitive expense and in such cases the use of
condensers may offer an easy solution.
Perhaps the great importance of this subject lies
in the fact that condensers may be very much re-
duced in price and their reliability greatly increased
in the future. If this should come about conden-
sers would undoubtedly be used in very large num-
bers for power factor correction. o
PICTURE TRANSMISSION
Continued from page 15
connection with police work has been recognized
from the earliest days of experiments in the trans-
mission of pictures. Besides the transmission of
portraits of wanted individuals to distant points,
there is now possible the transmission of finger
prints. Some of the possibilities of the latter were
demonstrated over the New York-Chicago picture
sending circuit at the time of the Democratic Con-
vention, July, 1924. The Police Department of New
York selected the fingerprint of a criminal whose
complete identification data were on file in the
Police Department in Chicago. This single finger-
print, together with a code description of the prints


November, 192?
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
of all the fingers, was transmitted to Chicago and
identified by the Chicago experts almost instantly.
This method of identification will be, it is thought,
of value in those cases where difficulty is now ex-
perienced in holding a suspect long enough for
identification to be completed.
The fact that an electrically transmitted picture
is a faithful copy of the original, offers a field of
usefulness in connection with the transmission of
original messages or documents in which the exact
form is of significance, such as autographed letters,
legal papers, signatures, etc. It would appear that
this method might under certain circumstances
save many days of valuable legal time and the ac-
cumulation of interest on money held in abeyance.
F'or these reasons, it is thought that bankers, ac-
countants, lawyers, and large real estate dealers
will find a service of this kind useful.
Messages in foreign languages, employing alpha-
bets of forms not suited for telegraphic coding, are
handled to advantage.
Advertising material, particularly when in the
form of special typography and drawings is often
difficult and costly to get to distant publishers in
time for certain issues of periodicals and magazines.
A wire service promises to be of considerable value
for this purpose.
A very large field for electrically transmitted
pictures is, of course, The Press. Their interest
in the speedy transportation of pictures has been
indicated in the past by the employment of special
trains, aeroplanes, and other means for quickly con-
veying portraits and pictures of special events, to
the large news distributing centers. The use of
pictures by newspapers seems at present to be
growing in favor, and many are now running daily
picture pages as regular features.
Some of the possibilities in this direction were
demonstrated by the picture news service furnished
to newspapers, especially those in New York and
Chicago, during the 1924 Republican and Demo-
cratic National Conventions at Cleveland and New
York. During these conventions several hundred
photographs were transmitted between Cleveland
and New York and between New York and Chicago
and copies furnished the Press at the receiving
points. Photographs made shortly after the open-
ing sessions, usually about noon, were transmitted
to New York and Chicago and reproduced in after-
noon papers. A demonstration of picture news
service on a still larger scale was furnished on
March 4th, 1925, when pictures of the inauguration
of President Coolidge were transmitted from Wash-
ington simultaneously to New York, Chicago and
San Francisco, appearing in the afternoon papers
in all three cities.
Other news-distributing agencies can also use
electrically transmitted pictures to advantage.
Among these are the services which make a special-
ty of displaying large photographs or half-tone
reproductions in store windows and other promin-
ent places. Electrically transmitted pictures of in-
teresting events, about which newspapers have pub-
lished stories, appear suited to this service, and
have already been so used by some of these picture
service companies. They may also be used as
lantern slides for the display of news events of the
day by projection either upon screens in front of
newspaper offices or in moving picture theaters.
Miscellaneous commercial uses have been sug-
gested. Photographs of samples or merchandise,
of building sites, and of buildings for sale may be
mentioned. The quick distribution of moving
picture "stills" which is now done by aeroplane
is one illustration of what may prove to be a con-
siderable group of commercial photographs for
which speedy distribution is of value.

LAKE CURRENTS

accompanied by a downpour of rain. The attention
of Mr. J. D. Sarles, Manager, was called to the
whitecaps, and choppy sea which developed so
rapidly in spite of the downpour of rain. At this
time we realized we were standing at the side of
the cabin instead of the end to protect ourselves
from the rain, indicating we were broadside to the
wind. He thought we were drifting. We rushed to
the other side of the boat and discovered that the
line, barely visible in the rain, was hanging limp
between the boat and the anchored float, and that
the water, twenty-five feet into the wind, was
smooth, except that it had the appearance of a
swiftly moving creek passing under a log. In other
words, a current had developed during the squall
sufficiently strong from the east-northeast acting
on the hull to hold the boat still against the moder-
ate gale from the opposite direction. The pheno-
menon was most remarkable when it was con-
sidered that the Annie Laura was light, thereby
offering a large exposure to the wind. As the
storm passed, the Annie Laura swung around and
headed west. Another feature equally startling
was the action on nearby boats. Just as the squall
broke loose, three large steel freighters were pass-
ing north on a course about three-fourths of a mile
to the east; they were about a mile and a quarter
apart, and the first one was abreast of us. About
fifteen minutes later, as the squall was clearing,
it was observed that the third vessel was headed
for us, and would have run us down had the
weather continued thick with heavy rain. The


Page 29
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
current had carried the freighter to the west and
the captain did not know it until the weather
cleared and could observe us. He turned sharply
to the east. It was noted, that apparently, the two
vessels ahead were not affected. The barograph
sheet at the Alpena Weather Bureau Office showed
a sharp dip in the pressure as the squall passed
over.
The key to the current problem lies in the fact
that the barometric fluctuation, whether of "storm"
or "ripple" type, has a forward progressive move-
ment and that much depends upon the barometric
gradient and the velocity of the gradient over the
surface of the water. The application of this
hypothesis offers the best solution of the mysteries
connected with numerous marine disasters. While
accurate forecasts of these unusual phenomena have
been issued from the U. S. Weather Bureau Office
at Alpena to local marine interests since 1914, and
broadcast by radio to boats on Lake Huron since
1917, our knowledge is yet limited. Much research
work is necessary and the Weather Bureau looks
for cooperation from shipmasters in giving their
experiences to be correlated on weather charts with
atmospheric conditions. Progress in the work will
depend upon funds available to the Weather
Bureau.
CORROSION
Continued from page 23
content of water exposed to the air, and thus effect
the corrosion rate of metal in the water. There
is an unmistakable difference in corrosive attack
upon iron and steel in dry climates and in humid
climates. The classic example of the iron pillar
at Delhi in India is an instance of this. It has been
claimed that the extreme purity of metal'was re-
sponsible for its resistance to rusting, but the metal
is not pure. There can be little doubt that the low
humidity of the climate has, in large measure, been
responsible for its preservation. On the other hand
we witness the rapid rusting of steel in regions of
constantly high humidity. Speller17 cites a case of
interest in this connection. In examining some
French steels which had been left in the Isthmus
of Panama for twenty years, it was found that they
were in a good state of preservation, having appar-
ently acquired an impervious rust coating. Upon
removing this oxide coating these steels rusted
badly in a few months. The explanation advanced
is that the original rust coating was probably
formed during the dry season, under conditions of
low humidity. It is possible that coatings formed
under such conditions carry larger amounts of pure
oxide. These observations have considerable prac-
tical interest, for they seem to indicate that the
whole life of iron and steel when exposed to atmos-
pheric action, may be vitally affected by the con-
ditions obtaining at the time of initial exposure.
When metals are immersed in various corroding
media, it has been observed that the rate of cor-
rosive attack is noticeably decreased as the depth
of immersion is increased. The corrosion rate of
iron is decreased as the viscosity of the medium in-
creases, other things being equal.
One of the most familiar and interesting of cor-
rosion factors is the effect brought about by dis-
similar metals in contact in the presence of the
corroding medium. Walker18 and Wilson19 have
discussed very completely the theoretical aspects of
this phase of corrosion. This effect is brought
about primarily by the relative positions of the
metals in the electromotive series. This is a series
of the metals, including hydrogen (Table 1), ar-
ranged in descending order of their tendency to
pass into solution, or, in other words, into the ionic
condition. Each member of the list in the free state
will displace ions of any metal following it in the
list, when placed in a solution of one of the latter's
salts. A familiar example is the precipitation of
copper upon iron when iron is placed in a solution
of copper sulphate. Any member of the list is
spoken of as being electronegative to any metal
following it and electropositive to any metal pre-
ceding it.

Electromotive Series of the Metals

2. Sodium 15. Tin

A glance at the electromotive series explains one
reason why zinc is used as a protective coating for
iron. When both are exposed to water the zinc
tends to go into solution and suppresses, as it were,
the tendency of the iron to dissolve. The second
reason that zinc is used as a protective coating is
that zinc in and of itself is quite resistant to cor-
losion, provided there is no contact with more
electropositive metals in the same solution. The
icason for this individual resistance of zinc to cor-
rosion is possibly in its hydrogen overvoltage.
An intelligent application of the information ob-
tained from a consideration of the electromotive

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
series of the metals will often effect an important
decrease in the corrosion observed in various types
of installations. An interesting instance of this
came to the author's attention last year. An almost
intolerable condition had been present in a mun-
icipal water system on account of corrosion of dom-
estic meters, particularly the gear trains. In some
cases the teeth on the gears had entirely disap-
peared. An investigation of a large number of
such failures revealed the fact that the corrosion
was practically confined to all-bronze meters. An-
alysis of the water showed an unusually large
amount of bicarbonates and some dissolved oxygen.
The corrosion product upon all the gear trains was
practically completely made up of basic copper car-
bonate, which proved that the bicarbonates and
the oxygen were largely responsible for the cor-
rosion observed. During the examination of vari-
ous types of meters which had been used, remark-
ably good service was found to have been given
by a meter which was fitted with a cast iron body,
the cast iron body being in metallic contact with
the bronze gear train. In some instances these
meters had given uninterrupted service for from
twelve to seventeen years, while many all-bronze
meters had been replaced after a few months' ser-
vice. The iron was apparently electronegative to
the bronze, as might possibly be predicted from the
positions of copper and tin in the electromotive
series, and had thus p'reserved the bronze gear
trains from serious attack.
Corrosive action as a rule will be very evenly
distributed over a polished surface and the tendency
for local action or pitting not so evident. In such
a case it may be considered that the condition of the
surface will have an inhibitive action upon the
corrosive attack. The presence of small areas of
oxide, however, may produce a very decided ten-
dency toward pitting, which, of course, may cause
an earlier failure than would be the case if the
action were uniform over the whole surface. Such
small areas of oxide serve to hasten the oxidation
of the nascent hydrogen and thus accelerate cor-
rosion at that point.
Investigations concerning the effect of light upon
the corrosion of iron and steel have been carried
out by Cribb and Arnaud,20 Friend,21 and Kimura.22
The results in each case appear to have been posi-
tive, but there has been a question raised each time
as to whether or not the results may have been due
to differences in temperature. In most of the work
reported the light used has been sunlight and in that
case it is easily seen that temperature conditions
would be difficult to control. In order to obtain
more precise results, the author constructed a cab-
inet, the temperature of which could be held con-
stant by circulating air and water and in this car-
ried out some corrosion experiments, having one
section of the cabinet brilliantly lighted by means
of a frosted 50 watt electric light and another
section completely dark.
The metal used in the tests was open hearth
iron having the following analysis:
Per Cent per Cent
Carbon 0.028 Sulphur 0027
Silicon 0.014 Phosphorus 0.003
Manganese 0.014 Iron 99.914
This metal was obtained in sheets about 5/16
inch thick and samples were cut to a width of 3.5
centimeters and length of about 5 centimeters. All
samples were ground on a 200 M wheel to produce
uniform surface conditions, and after being meas-
ured carefully were washed in alcohol, dried and
weighed. The corroding medium used was dis-
tilled water and each sample was supported hori-
zontally on stirrups at equal depths in separate
breakers. At intervals of seven days samples were
removed, washed, dried and weighed as before.
The condensed results of this test will be found in
Table II, from which the conclusion seems almost
unavoidable that there is some actinic effect in
corrosion. This effect is undoubtedly much more
pronounced in the case of sunlight.
Table II
Loss in milligrams per square centimenter of open hearth
iron exposed to the action of distilled water, in darkness
and in the presence of white light. The temperature at no
time dropped below 23 degrees Cent, or rose above 25 de-
grees Cent.
Time of Exposure 14 days 21 days 28 days 35 days
White Light 5.2 7.5 9.7 12.1
Darkness 4.5 6.6 9.3 10.3
One possible instance of variation in corrosion by
light may be in the decrease of the action as depth
of immersion in water increases. At depths of one
hundred feet or more in most bodies of water there
is not much light present, and the slower rate of
corrosion at these depths may be partly due to this
fact.
In the light of what has been said here it is quite
evident that there are two methods of attacking
the question of rust proofing when the articles are
to be exposed to the action of natural waters or the
atmosphere. One is to so regulate chemical com-
position that reaction (1) will not take place, and
the second is, to provide some means, usually coat-
ings, which will absolutely prevent the contact of
the oxygen carrying water with the iron or steel.

Professor Hibbard Spencer Busby, the latest
addition to the staff of the Department of Drawing,
is a man of wide experience and practice. He Was
born at Maiden, Massachusetts, receiving his early
education in the city of Greater Boston. His engi-
neering training consisted in a large number of
special courses in different institutions. He studied
Mechanical Engineering at Massachusetts Institute
of Technology and took special courses in Physics
and Mathematics at Lowell Institute, Boston, and
Northeastern University, Boston. He also studied

Fifty-Fifth tension of Camp Davis Closes
Fifty-one Civils and Foresters were graduated
from the fifty-fifth session of Camp Davis last sum-
mer, after eight weeks of ceaseless toiling over the
Base-line and Bryant's Trail.
At a meeting of Camp men held in Ann Arbor
before the close of school, "Johnny" Coale, '26E,
was elected Camp Manager, "Tex" Howe, '26E,
Editor of the "Black Fly," the Camp Davis pub-
lication, and "Bud" Heath, '26E, Transportation
Manager.
Orientation, a new course, was introduced this
year, Capt. G. W. Dunn, of the Military Science
Department, being the instructor. This course
comprises graphical and analytical solutions of
surveying problems connected with the locating
and firing of large ordnance.
The 1925 Session's contribution to the permanent
improvement of the Camp was the repair and re-
building of the Harbor entrance, which had been
ruined by the ice in previous years. The new
entrance was so well designed and stoutly con-
structed that there is little likelihood of its being
again damaged.
The Camp athletics were well taken care of by
""Ed" Line, '27E, an indoor ball tournament being
arranged among the parties. This contest was won
by The Steam-Rollers of parties eleven and twelve.
The engineers were on excellent terms with the
University Biological Station, which adjoins Camp
Davis. Each Camp gave an entertainment for the
•other, the surveyors' contribution bc-ing a dance.
The annual Visitor's Day and a trip to Mackinac
Island were other pleasant departures from the
loutine of camp life.
Juniors Elect Officers and J-Hop Chairman
The first meeting of the 1927 Class of Engineers
was held October 15, for the purpose of electing the
•class officers for the coming year and the engineer
members of the Junior Hop Committee. In accord-
ance with the rule that the General Chairman-ship
cf this Committee must alternate between the

Motion Pictures to be Used in Teaching
Descriptive Geometry
The Drawing Department will use Moving pic-
tures in an attempt to bridge the gap between Plane
and Space Geometry. The pictures will be shown
in the early part of the course and should aid
materially in demonstrating some of the more fun-
damental conceptions of Descriptive Geometry. o— •
Mr. Samuel Chamberlain, who has won well
merited praise for his work in pencil sketching and
rendering at home and abroad, is a welcome addi-
tion to the staff of the Architectural College.
After attending the University of Washington for
a few years, Mr. Chamberlain enrolled at Boston
Tech. where he completed his study of architecture.
During the World War he served in the ambu-
lance corps of the French Army and was awarded
an American Field Service Traveling Fellowship
at the close of hostilities.
When Mr. Chamberlain was discharged from
service, he started an extensive tour of Europe,
covering most of Europe and a goodly portion of
Northern Africa, during the course of which he
made many interesting sketches; some of which
have been reproduced by the leading architectural
magazines of the country.
Mr. Chamberlain has also done some fine work in
the professional field, doing all the rendering on the
proposed Boston War Memorial and assisting the
City Plan Commission of Boston on one of its proj-
ects. While abroad, he worked with students of
the Beaux Arts of Paris.
At the present time exhibits of Mr. Chamberlain's
work are being held in the larger cities of the
country such as Chicago, Minneapolis, Cleveland,
Detroit, Toledo, Buffalo, Boston, New Haven,
Seattle.
A book, which contains many interesting sketches
of Spanish architecture taken in Spain has been
recently published by Mr. Chamberlain.
At the second meeting of the Architectural
Society which was held October 27, Mr. Chamber-
lain was appointed faculty adviser.
The annual May party of the Architectural Col-
lege was discussed and it is planned that an early
start shall be made in preparation for it this year.

Echoes from the Graduates
PROF. HENRY EARLE RIGGS
Henry Earle Riggs, born at Lawrence, Kansas,
May 8, 1865, was graduated from the University of
Kansas with the class of 1886, receiving at that
time the degree of A. B. Later, in 1910, he received
his C. E. degree from the University of Michigan.
Mr. Riggs was engaged in
railroad construction in Ne-
braska, Missouri and Texas
from the time of graduation
from the University of Kansas
until the spring of 1890, when
he became Chief Engineer of
what is now the Ann Arbor
Railroad. During his six years
with the Ann Arbor, plans for
complete changes of the line
and grade of the road were
made and largely carried out.
The car ferry steamships were
introduced on Lake Michigan
and terminals were built at
Toledo and other Lake Mich-
igan landings. From 1896 to
1912 he was engaged in a gen-
eral engineering practice at
Toledo, Ohio, a partner of the
firm of Riggs &amp; Sherman,
which did municipal as well as
railroad work. During this
period, Riggs &amp; Sherman were
engineers for the design and construction of some
500 miles of electric and steam railroad, the latter
consisting of city belt lines, terminals and industrial
branches. The municipal department designed and
constructed sewers and waterworks besides engin-
eering paving in a large number of smaller cities
and towns in the states of Ohio, Michigan and
Indiana.
Cornea in Contact irith Dean Cooley
In 1910 Mr. Riggs became associated with Dean
M. E. Coolcy on the Michigan Railway appraisal
which was the first state-wide valuation work
undertaken in the United States. He had charge of
the Civil Engineering part of this work under Dean
Cooley, while Mr. T. II. Hinchman, of Detroit, had
charge of the Mechanical Engineering. • In
1903 and 1905, two additional appraisals were
made which brought the work
up to date. In 1904 Mr. Riggs
and Dean Cooley were engaged
with the Michigan tax . cases
before the United States Su-
preme Court.
Commencing with this Mich-
igan Railway appraisal he ap-
plied his energies particularly
to public utility engineering,
in which he was closely associ-
ated with Dean Cooley and
Prof. H. C. Anderson. Ap-
praisals in which Mr. Riggs
was often principal constituted
a large part of the practice.
Perhaps the most noteworthy
were the Duluth, South Shore
&amp; Atlantic passenger rate case,
the Central of Georgia Rail-
road income bond case, the Sa-
vannah, Georgia street railway
case and the Atlanta, Georgia
gas case. He was engaged from
1908 to 1920 in this work, also
serving as head of the Department of Civil Engi-
neering at the University of Michigan to which
position he was appointed in 1912. Immediately fol-
lowing, the Department of Civil Engineering was
completely reorganized, creating a number of new
professorships which were filled by the appointment
of Professors King, Hoad, Gram and Decker. Sub-
sequently, the chairs of Highway Engineering and
Highway Transport and Transportation Engineer-
ing were established. In recent years outside con-
sulting practice has been less along appraisal lines
but more in connection with studies in depreciation

of public utility property and studies of transporta-
tion problems. A report submitted by the Board
of Arbitration on the Detroit Street Line
track case in 1923, of which Mr. Riggs was
a member, shows in a measure the nature
of his work. A section taken directly from
the report is as follows: "The extreme technical
character of many of the questions at issue between
the parties, the large number of comprehensive
scientific papers and publications introduced as ex-
hibits, and the character and standing of the wit-
nesses, make it not improbable that this record
constitutes the most complete discussion of many
phases of electric railway operation that has ever
been recorded."
Recent engagements have been in capacity of
adviser to the General Counsel of the Norfolk &amp;
Western Railway, Pere Marquette Railway and
Ann Arbor Railway in connection with federal
valuation; at the present time he is engaged in a
similar capacity by the Illinois Central Railway.
Within the past year he has completed a study of
the local transportation problems in Kansas City
for the eighth United States Circuit Court, and will
shortly complete a report on a study on the trans-
portation problems of Toledo, Ohio.
Writings
From 1913 to 1917 he was a member of the
American Society of Civil Engineers Committee on
Principals and Methods of Valuation and was one
of the joint authors of the report of that committee
published in 1917. He was also author of an ex-
tended paper on Valuation of Public Utility Prop-
erties, published in 1911 and of a book entitled, "De-
preciation of Public Utility Properties," published
in 1922.
Prof. Riggs is a member of the following
societies: American Society of Civil Engineers,
American Railway Engineering Association, Ameri-
can Institute of Consulting Engineers, American
Economic Association, American Academy for
political and Social Science, Society for Promotion
of Engineering Education, Michigan Engineering
Society, (President 1899-1900) Sigma Xi, Phi
Gamma Delta, and Tau Beta Pi. He was a member
of the Ann Arbor Board of Education from 1916
until this year.

New Equipment Received by the Engineering
College
The monoplane which is now on exhibition on
the first floor of the New Engineering Shops Build-
ing was presented to the University by the General
Motors Corporation. It was designed by M. C.
Bauman, '17E, for the .Gordon-Bennet races in
France in 1920 and at that time was considered the
fastest plane in the world, though it did not win the
races. The plane was built by the Dayton-\Vright
Airplane Company in 1920. Some special features
of its design include retractable landing wheels and
variable camber wings.
A complete House Refrigeratory Plant has been
donated to the Mechanical Engineering Department
by The Kelvinator Company of Detroit, and The
Leonard Refrigerator Company of Cedar Rapids,
Wis. This plant will be of great interest to those
studying refrigeratory apparatus.
The Military Department has recently received
a Boulenge Chronograph from the Wrar Depart-
ment. The Chronograph is an instrument used to
measure the muzzle velocity of projectiles and this
particular one is for use on large ordnance. The
R. O. T. C. Dept. has requisitioned for a small-arms
chronograph, also. The instrument, which will be
used by members of the Ordnance Unit, will be on.
exhibition in the R. O. T. C. Building. It may be
of interest to note that the chronograph, because
of its delicate and precise construction is of great
value.
The Materials Testing Laboratory has received
a Rhiele Bending Machine. This large instrument
is used to test specimens under bending and can
bend rods up to three inches in diameter thru an
angle of 180 degrees. A series of very interesting
experiments to test the effect of low temperatures
upon the bending of steel is being run now on the
Bending Machine. The pieces are chilled in a
mixture of liquid air, ice and salt before subjection
to the test.
At the present time, also, a number of concrete
Bridge Spindles are being tested in compression
arid tension in the Laboratory.
Booth Fellowship Awards
The second annual Booth Fellowship Competi-
tion was held in the drafting rooms of the Architec-
tural College during spring vacation. This fellow-
ship was created through a gift of Mr. George C.
Booth, of Detroit. The winner of the competition
receives $1,200, with which to tour and study in
Europe. Considerable freedom is given the suc-
cessful candidate during the period of travel, so
that the trip may be thoroughly enjoyable as well
as instructive, and not be unduly hampered by a
number of required measured drawings. To par-
ticipate in the competition, the candidates must
have completed substantially the last two years of
the design courses. In selecting the winner, weight
is given the scholastic record of the candidate, as
well as the excellence of the solution in the compe-
tition.

said a word!"

ENGINEERING RESEARCH and the MANUFACTURER
Never in the entire history of industry has such a widespread and determined effort been made
as at present to delve into the unknown and discover a solution of many of the manufacturing
problems which heretofore have been allowed to pass unheeded.
The volume of industrial research now in progress in an effort to apply and make practical use
of known scientific facts and laws already discovered by the true researcher of an earlier day is
far in excess of the amount of purely scientific research.
A far-sighted ancestry, however, has again saved the day for the industries of our time, because
it insisted, even as far back as history records, that science should receive its just recognition and
that universities or other places of learning should be provided where the investigator could carry
on his work free from the ordinary interruptions of every day life; and here began the teaching of
the youth who later was to blossom into the scholar to tell us why, when and how. These men are
the products of scientific research and they are the ones to whom industrial research is indebted
for the progress it is now making.
Realizing thoroughly tliat the teaching of 1lie sciences anil their practical application to influx-
try would exercise a potent influence in axxixting the Ktate to take tin proper place among other in-
dustrial ulates. the Regents of the University of Michigan established, in October, 1920, a Department
of Kngineering Research and placed its facilities at the disposal of the manufacturers and tech-
nical interests.
In this way industries may acquire the services of trained investigators, special laboratories and
equipment, and exceptional library facilities. This equipment, is a part and parcel of the property
of the State and its citizens. The right to its legitimate use by citizens of the State has been recog-
nized by the Regents of the University.
Therefore no sound reason exists why any industry in the State should suffer because of lack
of proper and efficient facilities for study, research and creative work. The opportunity has been
created through the generosity and far-sighted administration of a benevolent state government, and
if the manufacturer or technician does not avail himself of the advantages so near at hand the re-
sponsibility clearly is his.
The Department of Engineering Research at Ann Arbor may be likened unto a service bureau for
industry. It is not its purpose to undertake merely the physical or chemical testing of raw material
unless upon urgent request of a citizen or in the capacity of an arbitrator. It prefers to leave this
work to the commercial laboratory. But in the survey of peculiar economic or technical conditions
which so frequently overtake even an old established industry, or in the development, of a new indus-
try where the adaptation of the laws of science is involved, the Department of Engineering Research
stands ready to put its shoulder to the wheel and render assistance.
The Department of Engineering Research holds itself in readiness at all times to render assist-
ance to the industries of the State in any manner possible and extends to those who may be interested,
a most cordial invitation to visit the University and examine its equipment.

THE VITAL NEED FOR GREATER FINANCIAL
SUPPORT To PURE SCIENCE RESEARCH
Ky THE I.'OIN. HERBERT HOOVER. Secretary of Commerce
I WISH on this occasion to say something upon
our great national need of a much more vigorous
support to pure science research in our country.
There is no body of men more interested in the
advancement of pure science
than our engineers, for the en-
gineering profession is built
upon the application of scien-
tific discovery. And of larger
vision, if we would commend
the advance of our material,
and to a considerable degree, of
our spiritual life, we must
maintain the earnest and or-
ganized search for truth. We
could well put such an appeal
wholly upon moral and spi:-
itual grounds; the unfolding of
beauty, the aspiration to knowl-
edge, the ever-widening pene-
tration into the unknown, the
discovery of truth, and finally,
as Huxley says, "the inculca-
tion of veracity of thought."
All are ample justification for
our finding dollars to Iceep
these searchers alive. But as
I am proposing to support an appeal for dollars, I
propose to discuss the dollar's results as well.
Research in the biological and physical sciences
takes two forms; industrial research (which is the
application of science) and research in pure science.
Obviously, there must first be a pure science before
there can be an application. I am aware that
there is a twilight zone between them, but no
scientist has difficulty in finding the borders.
THE HON. HERBERT HOOVER
While we have in recent years developed our in-
dustrial research upon a scale hitherto unparalleled
in history, we have by no means kept pace in the
development of research in pure science. \Ve have
an increase in some 10 years
from 100 to over 500 labora-
tories' engaged upon search for
applications of known scientific
fact and law. These results
have been magnificent. But all
these applied science laborator-
ies arc dependent upon the raw
material which flows from the
laboratories and men engaged
in pure science. And the in-
dustrial investigators are the
first to demand more support
to pure science.
Not only is our nation todav
greatly deficient in the number
of men and equipment for this
patient groping for the sources
of fundamental truth and nat-
ural law, but the sudden
growth of industrial laborator-
ies has in itself endangered pure
science research by drafting
the personnel of pure science into their ranks—de-
pleting at the same time not only our fundamental
research staff, but also our university faculties, and
thus to some degree drying the stream of creative
men at the source. Thus applied science itself will
dry up unless we maintain the sources of pure
science. This is no complaint against our great in-
dustries and their fine vision of the application ut
science. It simply means we must strengthen the

first line of our offensive. The day is gone by whan
we can depend very much upon consequential dis-
covery or invention being made by the genius' in the
garret. A host of men, great equipment, long pa-
tient scientific experiment to build up the structure
of knowledge, not stone by stone but grain by grain,
is today the fundamental source of invention and
discovery.
Compared with other expenditures of far less im-
portance to human welfare, the amount of money
annually devoted in the United States to the aid of
investigators and investigations in pure science is
absurdly small. It is less than one-tenth what we
spend on cosmetics. We have, indeed, some fine
foundations for pure scientific research—the Car-
negie Institute, the Smithsonian Institution, the
Rockefeller Institution, and many other research ac-
tivities of much more limited but special endow-
ments. The work of our Universities, together with
the work of the National Research Council and our
Government agencies, have shown fine accomplish-
ment in this field. But the whole of the income
available from these sources for research in pure
science certainly does not exceed $10,000,000 a year
—whereas in the professional schools of our univer-
sities, in technical and agricultural colleges and ex-
periment stations in industrial laboratories, and in
our Government bureaus, we probably expend today
$200,000,000 a year upon applied science research.
The wealth of the country has multiplied far
faster than the funds we have given for these pure
science purposes. And the funds administered in
the Nation today for it are but a triviality compared
to the vast resources that a single discovery places
in our hands. Men of science know, from their own
experience, how seriously scientific work has been
impeded by lack of resources, and they will appreci-
ate how great, in the aggregate, must be the result-
ing loss to the Nation and to the world.
The progress' of civilization, as all clear-thinking
historians recognize, depends in a large degree upon
"the increase and diffusion of knowledge among
men." It is not merely a question of applying pres-
ent-day science to the development of our industries,
the reduction to the cost of living, the eradication of
disease and the multiplication of our harvests, or
even the diffusion of knowledge. We must add to
knowledge, both for the intellectual and spiritual
satisfaction that comes from widening the range of
human understanding, and for the direct practical
utilization of these fundamental discoveries. A spe-
cial study in an industrial laboratory, resulting in
the improvement of some machine or process, is of
great value to the world. But the discovery of a
law of nature, applicable in thousands of instances
and forming a permanent and ever available addition
to knowledge, is a far greater advance
Radio communication would have remained not
merely impossible but wholly inconceivable except
for the fundamental experiments of Faraday, the
mathematical formulation of the wave theory by
Maxwell, and the experimental realization of Max-
well's predictions by Hertz; successive advances in
knowledge made without thought of immediate ap-
plication or financial return.
No newspaper headlines noticed Becquerel's
discovery of radioactivity from which long after
sprung the whole train of discoveries leading to rad-
ium and its vast human service. No one reads in
the popular journals of the theory of the hydrogen
ion. We do hear sometimes of the effect in econ-
omy and production that its understanding is hav-
ing upon scores of industrial processes, but how
many know the name of the scientist who has added
billions in money value to the world? And I am
not sure he had even a stenographer to save his time
in his race in search of other laws. The rise of
the Einstein theory, which has revolutionized
physical science and fundamentally affected modern
thought, was rendered possible by the most abstruse
developments of mathematics over long terms of
years, and who may say that some day it may not
become the raw material of our industrial labora-
tories with a fine outpouring of benefits in added
human comfort and convenience?
If we were to survey the Nation, we should find
that the technically trained men engaged in pure
science research fall into two main groups; on one
hand, those supported in the great pure science re-
search institutions, and on the other, those in our
universities or engaged in individual investigation.
The number supported by our pure science research
institutions, such as Carnegie, Rockefeller, Smith-
sonian, and others probably does' not exceed 500
technically trained men. Those engaged in pure
science research in our universities or upon their
own resources probably do not exceed 5,000, and
most of these devote only part of their time to
this work. And there are some men in our
industrial laboratories who are engaged in pure
science work. It is an interesting contrast that
the scientifically trained personnel in applied science
investigation today probably exceeds 30,000.
The problem as I see if is to secure much larger
support—
First—To our university men, in order that they
may be able to give a larger proportion of their time
to research, and that our universities may increase
the number of men.
Second—To co-ordinated research for certain def-
inite purposes.
Third—To the pure science research institutions.
It is on the men in independent research and in

HIGHWAY SAFETY PROMOTED BY MECHANICAL
TRAFFIC CONTROL METHODS
By ARTHUR H. BLANCHAHD
Professor of Highway Engineering and Highway Transport, University of Michigan, and
Consulting Engineer, Michigan State Highway Department
BEFORE considering the specific conditions in
connection with which mechanical traffic con-
trol methods should be used to promote the safe
use of highways, it is well to have in mind the
general status of highway acci-
dents. A bird's-eye view was
presented in the Report of the
Committee on "Statistics," sub-
mitted at the First National
Conference on Street and High-
way Safety which was held un-
der the auspices of the Hon.
Herbert Hoover, Secretary of
Commerce, in Washington, D.
C. in December, 1924. Perti-
nent abstracts from this report
follow:
"In 1923 the loss in the
United States due to street and
highway accidents amounted to
22,600 human lives, 678,000 ser-
ious personal injuries and $600,-
000,000 economic loss, an in-
crease of 80 per cent in the past
seven years. About 85 per cent
of these accidents were due to
automobile traffic.
In this discussion, only one ~~
problem will be considered, namely, safety devices
and regulations at railroad crossings. This topic has
been selected as a consideration of its complex fea-
tures introduce most of the fundamentals of the
utilization of mechanical control methods for other
road conditions requiring signals and special regu
latmns to promote the sa-fe&gt; ust: .of. highways by the
motor vehicle driver.
OF the vast loss in human
life and property which
occurs yearly at our grade
crossings, only a small portion
can be laid at the door of the
deliberately reckless motorist.
Complete elimination of grade
crossings is an ideal which can
never be attained. Hundreds
of lives could be saved by the
use of properly regulated sig-
nal systems. Prof. Blanchard
makes here a plea for the stand-
ardization of such systems, co-
ordination of highway and rail-
road signal codes, and the edu-
cation of the public to this
practice so that the all too pre-
valent confusion in this regard
can be removed.
— The Editor.
In considering the problem of traffic control
methods by mechanical devices, it is always ad
visable to glance for a moment at the methods
which are now available for reducing the num-
ber of accidents at railroad
grade crossings. Engineers and
investigators in the railway
fields propose a program which
consists of four lines of action
First, the elimination of grade
crossings in congested areas as
rapidly as it is financially prac-
ticable at the joint expense of
the railways and the local com-
munities.
Second, the increase of pro-
tection at grade crossings as
much is practicable. Under
this head are considered meth-
ods which are applicable to a
great many existing railroad
crossings at the present time,
such as increasing the distance
of vision along the tracks from
the highway, by the removal of
obstructions of one kind or an-
other, the changing of grades
approaching railroad crossings, and relocations in
a great many cases to obviate dangerous grade
crossings.
Third, to place warnings at the approaches of all
crossings.
Fourth, the education of the motorist relative to
the danger of careless driving across railroad grad.e
crossings.

Contact with the first item on this program is
met in discussions of this problem through the
public press and at various organization meetings
of laymen, the contention being generally made
that the only solution is the immediate elimination
of all grade crossings. Is this solution practicable?
At the end of 1921 there were 252,507 grade cross-
ings. In 1922 there were 705 eliminated and 4,437
were added, giving at the end of the year a total
of 256&gt;239. The cost during 1922 was $70,000,000
or an average cost for the elimination of one grade
crossing of $100.000. Taking as an estimate $75,000
for the elimination of a grade crossing, the bill for
the elimination of all the grade crossings existing
on January 1, 1923, would be $19,500,000,000. A
contemplation of these figures indicates that it is
absurd to depend solely upon elimination of grade
crossings for the solution of the problem.
A MOST DANGEROUS TYPE OF GRADE CROSSING. COM-
PLETELY UNPROTECTED
There is one phase of this matter that deserves
more than casual consideration. Reference is made
to a timely recommendation by A. H. Rudd, Chief
Signal Engineer of the Pennsylvania Railroad Sys-
tem, as contained in the following statement:
"The Pennsylvania Railroad System in 1921
killed two passengers in train accidents; in 1922 it
killed six, five of them in one collision on a road
that had been recently taken over and had no block
system. Last vear the road didn't kill one, and
in that time—three years, eight passengers killed—
there were 711 people killed at highway crossings.
"The Pennsylvania Railroad has been ordered
to install automatic train control on three passenger
engine divisions. It will cost in the neighborhood
of $6,000,000. To equip our whole system with
train control would cost $115,000,000. For this
sum we can protect 57,000 crossings with flashing
lights, indicating the approach of the train, the new
signal recommended by the Signal Section of the
American Railway Association, and still have $80,-
000,000 left for separation of grades, if we didn't
have to put in train control (and if we had the
money)."
The present program of the Interstate Commerce
Commission to force the installation of automatic
train control should receive the careful considera-
tion of every citizen because of the immense amount
of capital involved, which, in the opinion of many
railroad and highway officials, could, from the
standpoint of the safctv of the people as a whole.
be much more effectively expended in the elimina-
tion of grade crossings and installation of signals
at all crossings.
The next phase of this subject is with reference
to traffic control relative to which there has been
a wide diversity of opinion between highway offi-
cials and motorists on the one hand and railroad
officials on the other. Railroad officials have been
contending, in many cases, for a full stop law which
would mean that every one of the 260,000 railroad
crossings in the United States vehicles must stop
before crossing the track. The effects of a full
stop law should be given thorough consideration,
not only from ,the standpoint of safety but also
from the viewpoint of the economics of transporta-
tion.
Take, for example, a highway which has a daily
traffic of 10,000 vehicles and which is crossed by a
railway carrying one passanger train with an aver-
age of 30 passengers each way per day. An exam-
ination of the traffic on that highway might indicate
the following conditions which are based upon per-
sonal observations. In traveling a highway of this
type for a distance of eight miles, 15 groups of
massed automobiles, ranging from 10 to 32 vehicles
in each group, were passed. Contemplate the dan-
ger from collisions and the delay involved in requir-
ing each one of these vehicles to come to a full stop
before it crosses the railroad track. Such a regula-
tion would mean, based on a conservative estimate,
that in one day 20,000 people would be delayed for
the benefit of 60 train passengers. There are at the
present time many railroads of this character in the
United States.
From a broader viewpoint, a universal full stop
regulation would mean, assuming one grade

crossing in every ten miles of highway and that
each motor vehicle travels twenty miles per hour,
that there would be not less than 35,000,(X)0 vehicle
stops at railroad crossings each day throughout
the United States.
This subject was discussed during two sessions
at the National Conference on Highway and Street
THE IDEAL PROTECTION — COMPLETE ELIMINATION OF
A WAYNE COUNTY CROSSING BY UNDERPASSING
Safety. The following conclusion was adopted
which, it is believed, all will agree was based on
sound common sense principles: "Properly desig-
nated state commissions should be empowered to
designate dangerous grade crossings at which mo-
torists must stop."
Now what is the other side of this full stop regu-
lation? There is a growing opinion among high-
way officials and some railroad officials that there
are conditions under which it is advisable to have
a full stop provision which has not been outlined
as yet, namely, to have trains come to a full stop
before crossing a highway. Within the next year
there is little doubt but what this provision will be
placed in operation on many short line railroads
carrying perhaps a total of 300 passengers on
trains as against 20,000 or more carried on the high-
way during a given day. In other words, in many
cases it will be advisable that a transportation sur-
vey be made of a railroad grade crossing to ascer-
tain the traffic on the railway, the traffic on the
highway, and the physical conditions which sur-
round the crossing from the standpoint of visibility
of the tracks from the highway.
Those railway officials, who in recent years have
worked so strenuously for the general adoption in
our Legislatures of a full stop provision, admit that
the regulation proposed by the Committee on
"Traffic Control" of the Hoover Conference and
adopted by that Conference, to the effect that, un-
less a state commission has designated a grade
crossing as one at which motorists must stop,
"vehicles should not be permitted to exceed a
speed of 15 miles per hour when approaching with-
in 100 feet of a grade crossing," has never been
given a chance to demonstrate its value. In con-
nection with that recommendation, which is based
upon the practical operation of motor vehicles
under control, it is of interest to cite the following
opinion of Supreme Court Justice Charles Van
Kirk of the State of New York.
"Having provided for a disc sign and how and by
whom it shall be placed the statute in peremptory
language provides 'It shall be the duty of the
driver of any vehicle using such a street or high-
way and crossing to reduce speed to a safe limit
upon passing such sign and to proceed cautiously
and carefully with the vehicle under complete con-
trol'.
"It is our view that if the drivers of automobiles
obey this statute to its letter and its intent, seldom
if ever will injuries be suffered at grade crossings.
The price of safety by obedience to this statute
means no more than three or four seconds of time,
a small price for a life, and in any event we believe
the legislature was more interested in preserving
life and limb than in preserving the right to recover
damages for life and limb lost.
"The safe limit of speed in approaching a cross-
ing is that speed at which the driver of an automo-
bile, as he arrives at a point where he can see an
on-coming train when it is near enough to render
crossing ahead dangerous, can stop his car if neces-
sary before he reaches the track. It is futile to
look when one can not see. If he can not see with-
out stopping he must stop."
Those who are in favor of adopting a reduced
speed limit at grade crossings, also contend that its
value is dependent upon its enforcement. That
does not mean that an officer must be present at

THE CONQUEST OF SNOW
By FREDERICK D. KNOBLOCK, '27E
FIG. 1—CONQUEST OF THE ABRASIVE SNOW ON THE
SLOPES OF THE JUNGFRAU
SNOW, one of the few remaining barriers c
modern transportation, is now under human
control. No longer will the trend of progress be
restrained by dominance of this natural force over
the intelligence of man. The snowbound com-
munity of yesterday will be open to year-around
traffic tomorrow. For the first time in the his-
tory of civilization the possibility of a northward
course of Empire becomes a reality. Abundant
and invaluable natural resources1 will be utilized,
routes to other countries established, and new lands
will become populated.
This has been brought about through the in-
vention of Snow-Motor, a machine that can travel
over any depth or kind of snow. The cover illustra-
tion for this issue illustrates one of the early
machines which pulled more than 80 tons of logs,
starting at a standstill on level ground. This same
machine demonstrated its ability by traveling over
fresh snow five feet deep where there were no roads,
over ice and over bare ground.
Figure 1 illustrates one of the latest models oper-
ating in Switzerland. This machine operated 14,000
feet above sea level in the Alps Mountains with
entirely satisfactory results. The quality of snow
encountered differs from the usual packing kind,
generally known in that it is of a granular struc-
ture, almost abrasive in action. More than 2,000
feet of film, made during the tests on the Jung-
frau Mountain, show this Fordson-propelled Snow-
Motor performing feats which are actually astound-
ing.
In Figure 2 is seen one of the Snow-Motors now
in use at the McKenzie Pass, Oregon. For the first
time in history traffic has been kept open from
Eugene to Bend, Oregon, a distance of 16 miles'
over a mountain one mile high, where snow varies
in depth from 12 to 16 inches. Regular passenger
service is now maintained by the use of three
machines.
The Snow-Motor, Fordson propelled, has hauled
more than 20 tons of logs, operates successfully in
drifts and over protruding fences where its nose
points on an angle of 45 degrees. In Cook City,
Montana, it easily pulled a White motor truck out
of a drift when all other means had failed.
Necessity, rather than the love of invention,
caused the creation of the Snow-Motor. Years ago,
a miner in Alaska, was the first to conceive the
idea of employing the Archemedean screw prin-
ciple for propulsion over snow. By using, on each
side, a large torpedo shaped drum on which was
mounted spiral skates forming a thread, and revolv-
ing these drums in opposite directions, a positive
worm drive would produce forward motion. The
immense surface of the drums would provide proper
flotation while the skate threads, when revolved,
would offer the necessary traction. The packed
snow would act as the worm wheel.
These principles were the basis for the construe-


Page 11
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
tion' which resulted under the supervision of the
miner's brother, Mr. F. R. Burch, of Seattle, Wash.
To the surprise of all the first machine, with its
crude wooden drums' covered with sheet steel,
proved a success. Years of development followed
and under the guidance of Col. H. H. Armstead,
a well known mining engineer, metal drums re-
placed the original type, constructed of wood.
Steering was accomplished by large runners in
front, and a center chain drive to the two pair of
drums through a Blood universal joint system was
used. The drums were of cast aluminum, turned
down in sections, and internally bolted together.
The skates, also in sections, were triangular in shape
and attached by means of screws from the inside of
the drums. The powerplant was a four-cylinder
Wisconsin engine.
Col. Armstead had so proven the ability of the
Snow-Motor that nation-wide interest was aroused.
In due time he became affiliated with Senator R. L.
Owen, of Oklahoma, with the result that a com-
pany was organized in Detroit for further develop-
ment and production. The officials of this new
company had enough vision, coupled with good
engineering sense, to see that the design and
method for production had to be revised. The
principal changes were in steering, power-plant, and
the lack of a separate frame.
CONSTRUCTION
The present design consists of a running-gear on
which is mounted the Fordson tractor. Plans are
being completed for manufacturing a second model
on which can be mounted all standard makes of
automobiles and light trucks. On this model the
gear ratios will be such that a high speed can be
maintained for passenger use. In either design the

wheels and axles of the vehicle to be used are re-
moved and replaced by the Snow-Motor drum as-
sembly. Power furnished by the machine used is
transmitted from the propeller shaft through the
duplex clutch to the sprockets which revolve the
drums' by means of roller chains. Steering is ac-
complished by a differential movement of the drums
regulated by means of the clutch.
Figure 3 shows the Fordson propelled Snow-Mo-
tor, the only type now in production. The Fordson

ing, I-beam, having one pivot hole in which fits the
standard Fordson pivot bolt. The radius rods are
also attached in the usual position. The ends of
the axle are cut off and held in place around the
front drum bearing by bolts. Thus, the front axle
is replaced by one having the same characteristic of
being perfectly flexible. This action is clearly
shown in Figure 2, taken on the McKenzie Pass.
The Fordson rear wheels, axle, housings, worm
gear, and wheel, and the drawbar are next removed.
The Snow-Motor is joined to the tractor by two
bell housing side supports, made of cast iron and
ribbed for strength. A spacer joins these two hous-
ings with the clutch gear box.
The rear axle is a pressed steel channel section
of ^-inch stock amply secured to the rear of the
gear case by 30 bolts. On the tapered ends of the
rear axle are riveted malleable iron castings which
carry the spherical bearings.
The drums consist of a straight portion terminat-
ing at each end in conical sections. The straight
portion is of 8-gauge sheet steel, 6 feet long, rolled
into a cylindrical form 30 inches in diameter, and
seam-welded. The rear cone is a steel casting 8
inches long and lap-welded to the straight portion.
A hub carrying the large sprocket, protrudes 6
inches. The drive shaft in the hub is of chrome
nickel steel and held in place by a square key, the
full length of the hub. The inner end of the shaft
is tapped and a washer and nut screwed on, ac-
cessible through a hand hole in the cone, which
takes the thrust in one direction. Thrust in the
other direction is taken by a shoulder on the shaft
where the hub is entered. The front cone consists
of two sections of 8-gauge flat steel pressed into

MAKING UP AIRSHIP BALLAST IN FLIGHT^
By ROBERT F. KOHB, M. E.*
THE navigation of lighter-than-air craft is, in
some respects similar to that of surface ships.
Any old sea dog with his well-known instruments
can successfully take an airship from port to port,
so far as navigation in a single plane is concerned.
However, the airship pilot must work, not in two
dimensions, but three.
If a gas filled ship is allowed to become either
greatly heavier or greatly lighter than the air it
displaces, a large proportion of its available engine
power will be required to maintain a constant alti-
tude. The cause of the departure from a condi-
tion of static equilibrium may be, in general, put
into one of two classes. Changes
in the temperature and hence
the volume of the lifting gas,
caused by change of intensity of
solar radiation upon the enve-
lope, may produce substantial
changes in lift. Such changes
can not always be predicted,
either as1 to magnitude or direc-
tion.
Another change, however, is
always in the same direction,
cumulative, and can be predicted
with some- accuracy. This
change is the lightening of the
ship due to the consumption of
fuel by the engines during
flight. A large airship with
engines of two thousand horse-
power will use under full throt-
tle operation at least one thou-
sand pounds of gasoline per
hour. A change in lift of a
thousand pounds can not be ignored, and must be
compensated in some way if continued flight is to
be attempted.
In the past it has been the practice of all airship
pilots to valve off hydrogen in large quantities to
decrease the lift of the ship and thus counteract
the loss of fuel weight. This method was a
frankly wasteful one but had to be tolerated in the
absence of anything better. When, however, it
developed that helium was to replace the relatively

cheap and plentiful hydrogen as a lifting gas for
military airships, it at once became imperative to
devise less wasteful methods of navigation. In the
fall of 1920, the Army Air Service requested the
Bureau of Standards to develop some means for
maintaining a constant lift without waste of lift-
ing gas.
Several methods of attaining this end have been
proposed. Foremost among these have been com-
pression of the lifting gas into rigid containers,
absorption of atmospheric moisture by hygroscopic
substances, and condensation of water of combus-
tion from the engine exhaust gases.
The first of these methods is
prohibited by the great weight
of compressing machinery and
high pressure gas containers,
while the second, on account of
the extremely small quantity of
water in the air, would require
an enormous hygroscopic sur-
face to collect sufficient mois-
ture. However, the recovery of
water of combustion by cooling
and condensation at once offers
some hope of success.
When the usual gasoline fuel
is used, about 1.4 pounds of
water vapor is formed for each
pound of fuel burned. This
affords an ample margin for in-
efficiency in the process of cool-
ing the gas, and collecting the
entrained moisture, so that ex-
treme refinements are unneces-
sary.

The recovery of exhaust water for ballast was
not by any means a new project. As early as
1915 experiments had been made on one form of
recovery apparatus on a British airship, while at
the time this project was undertaken at the Bureau
of Standards, the U. S. Navy, Bureau of Aero-
nautics, was just completing a series of ground
tests well calculated to demonstrate the feasibility
of such a method for obtaining ballast. The Eng-
lish work, as well as that of the U. S. Navy, was
useful in indicating the lines which might best be
followed in further development work.

and water cooling and neither was entirely suc-
cessful, due in the case of the former to insufficient
continuous cooling, and in the latter case because
of a prohibitively great weight per horse-power ot
the engine served. It must be recognized, how-
ever, that the U. S. Navy apparatus was designed
for purposes of demonstrating principles without
regard to weight and any statement as to the weight
of service apparatus is necessarily based upon an
estimate of the reduction in weight, which could
be obtained by the greatest refinement in design.
appearance of 150 parallel 1-inch tubes in one bank.
A baffle type separator at the cold end collects
the small drops which would otherwise leave the
condenser with the gaseous exhaust products.

treme left will be seen a stock Liberty engine, used

After several false starts, the Bureau of Stand-
ards apparatus was laid out as a full air-cooled unit,
effecting a very substantial saving in weight
through the elimination of water cooling and hand-
ling apparatus.
The design of this unit was checked by con-
structing a small size condenser and testing it in
connection with a correspondingly small engine.
The condenser was placed in a small wind tunnel
and both the power to move the air, and the exhaust
for the condenser, were furnished by a small auto-
mobile engine. A baffle type separator was pro-
vided to collect the entrained moisture from the
cooled gases leaving the condenser.
Measurements were made of gasoline consump-
tion, exhaust water collected, air velocity and tem-
perature, and final exhaust temperature. The re-
sults were found to closely check those expected
from theoretical considerations and the work of
construction of a full-size unit was begun without
further delay.
In general, the method is to pass the exhaust gas
at high velocity through parallel lengths of about
60 feet of 1-inch aluminum tube, the outer surface
of which is swept by air at a rate determined by
the flying speed of the ship. For convenience the
60 feet are arranged in three banks connected by
return headers so that the overall length is about
21 feet. To handle the quantity of exhaust gas
produced by the two 150 horse-power engines under
consideration, with due consideration for the de-
sired velocities and back pressures, there are fifty
such tubes in parallel. The whole unit presents the
satisfactory, the recovery varying from about one
pound of water to 1.3 pounds per pound of fuel
burned. An endurance run was begun at once and
continued until failure of the engine at 90 hours.
It was thought that the endurance had been amply
demonstrated and the apparatus was shipped to
Langley Field for flying test.
The work of installation was commenced about
July 21 and the first flight was made on the morn-
ing of August 17, 1922. It is noteworthy that this
was the first flight of a successful ballast recovery
apparatus in this country and probably in the
world.
"Figure 2 gives an idea of the relative size of the
apparatus as mounted on the ship. The condenser
is suspended horizontally between the hull and
the car by six cables attached to "finger patches"
on the envelope. A closer view is shown in Figure
3. Both of these pictures were taken just prior
to the first flight.
In over 50 hours of flying at Langley Field and
at Aberdeen Proving Ground, the recovery aver-
aged 80% of the weight of fuel burned. The ap-
parent inefficiency may be blamed on two condi-
tions. In the first place, the air temperature during
most of the flying time was about 7°C, higher than
that assumed in the design considerations. This
alone would normally make the difference noted.
However, a further cause was found in stoppage
of the drain from the baffle type separator. The
exhaust water always contains more or less soot,
and a shoulder in the small diameter drain tube
allowed an accumulation of solid matter to build

up and clog the tube. Of course when the water
separated by the baffles from the issuing gases
could not drain away, it washed along the bottom
of the separator and was lost.
It may be of interest to follow through, qualita-
tively, the process by which the water ballast is
obtained. To begin with, a very small quantity of
water enters the carburetor with the air, more or
less according to air temperature and relative
humidity. In the process of combustion the hydro-
gen of the gasoline (about 15% by weight) com-
bines with the oxygen of the air to form water.
This is the real source of the water ballast ulti-
mately collected.
FIG. 3—CLOSE-UP OF CONDENSER INSTALLATION.
The water from both the sources mentioned
issues from the exhaust manifold as superheated
steam at a temperature in the neighborhood of
900°C. The total mass of exhaust gas must be
cooled to the temperature of saturation before any
water can be condensed. If the steam alone were
present, this point would, of course, be reached at
100°C, but in the presence of a large proportion of
nitrogen and CO,, the saturation temperature is in
the neighborhood of 55°C. This figure applies only
to fuels of the general composition of gasoline,
since those fuels poorer in hydrogen produce less
water of combustion with resulting low saturation
temperatures of the exhaust gas. Fuels in the aro-
matic group (benzol, toluol, xylol) can not pro-
duce ballast water in the proportion of one pound
per pound of fuel even though the exhaust gas be
cooled to 0°C.
Having reached the temperature of saturation,
at which condensation begins, the exhaust gas must
be further cooled until approximately one pound
is condensed per pound of fuel burned. For gaso-
line this point is reached at about 35"C.
In the design of condensers allowance must be
made for inefficiency in the separation of entrained
moisture so that a somewhat lower final exhaust
temperature should be assumed.
An idea of the action of fuels of different com-
position may be had from Figure 4, which shows
water condensed plotted against final exhaust tem-
perature. Per cent condensation is based upon the
weight of fuel burned as 100%. For the purpose
of computing the curves in Figure 4 the relative
humidity of the carburetor air was assumed as 60%
and its temperature as 15°C lower than the final
exhaust temperature. The exhaust gas temperature
can not be efficiently brought much closer to the air
temperature on account of the low temperature
head available for transfer of heat from the gas to
the air stream.
It should be noted that the apparatus herein de-
scribed was of an experimental character and was
not intended for service use. Its operation, how-
ever, was markedly successful and it must be re-
garded as the forerunner of other and better equip-
ment already in use and yet to be devised.

POSIBILITIES OF A CONCRETE ARCHITECTURE
By FRANCIS S. ONDERDONK, Ph. D.*
THE more possibilities a material possesses, the floor below, thus providing balconies for each story
nearer it approaches perfection. With regard and still giving the sunlight free access to the rooms
to extension, strength, ability to be reinforced, and
treatment of surface, concrete has practically un-
below.
It is just this wealth of possibilities that endan-
limited possibilities. No other mode of construe- gers the creation of a specific concrete architecture.
tion can so well express the supremacy of man's
mind; many possibilities mean as many chances for
man's taste to choose and his will to decide.
Many so-called characteris-
tics of concrete architecture ap-
ply to the "wood-centering
style," and not to concrete it-
self. The increased use of
curved metal molds, self-center-
ing reinforcement and the ce-
ment gun will allow the actual
concrete qualities, plasticity and
adaptability to every form, size
and curvature, to develop.
Wood-centering causes "stam-
mering," that is, building every
part twice, first as mold and
then in concrete. Neither is
done with that care and patience
as is customary with materials
where what is done remains
permanently (wood and stone).
Reinforced concrete has con-
quered the third dimension. All
former styles of architecture
were characterized by adher-
ing to the vertical; brick was
laid upon brick, stone upon
stone. Projecting cornices and balconies were
like daring features in an acrobat's display.
The unity of reinforced concrete construction,
however, makes projection on a much larger
scale a natural, commonplace matter. A
console can be so strongly reinforced as to make
it support a small house. For the first time, the
architect is fully master of space. He has unlim-
ited possibilities in designing the outline of his
building. As the Barocke architect curved and cut
in the design of his floor-plan, so the concrete archi-
tect will be able to abolish the straight line con-
tour in his elevation. A Paris apartment house
of reinforced concrete shows the realization of one
ORNAMENTAL LIGHT STANDARD IN A
MUNICH PARK
As critics and architects have recognized, the weak-
nesses and limitations of a material are essential
in developing its style; by overcoming obstacles,
the builder wins our admiration.
Professor Fabian has pointed
out how the short distance be-
tween the columns in ancient
and mediaeval buildings pre-
sented a unit for the rhythm of
the entire structure whereas the
span of the reinforced concrete
columns is so large that it can
no longer serve this purpose.
Reinforced concrete is danger-
ous by its wealth just as great
riches not only enable good
deeds but also tempt to reckless
waste. In fact, the designs of
concrete buildings made some
architects remind one of the
manners of a parvenu. No other
mode of construction tests the
architect's abilities as reinforced
concrete does.
As several authors have re-
marked, the unity of reinforced
concrete construction eliminates
base, capital and the like parts
as separate members. One part develops' from
the other just as members of organic bodies
grow out of each other. According to Ruskin,
"Truth does not demand that the constructive
core be laid bare; a protecting skin which with
organic bodies covers the bones and muscles
is justifiable likewise on buildings." Continuing
this simile "veins" of darker colored concrete
particles, indicating the reinforcement on the
concrete surface, would enable the layman to ap-
prehend the strength of reinforced construction and
especially the slender parts would become bear-
able to his eye. Such "veins" would accentuate
the contrast to stone and brick and show the unity
of these possibilities; the wall of each successive Of reinforced concrete. These "veins" would not

but would replace their angles by curves, thus
becoming aesthetically valuable.

In our days of rush and hurry, people have no
time to look at small ornaments and decorations as
they pass in the crowded streets. Clear, simple
outlines, large spaces of even surface, set off by
outstanding features, alone can stand the test of the
automobilist who flashes by, or the business man
who sends up a quick glance. The technique of
placards must be adopted, espe-
cially as the method of building
concrete makes "gingerbread"
undesirable.
The following two modes of
decoration are suggested as com-
plying to the above standard:
Cement Gun Fresco
"Squirting" colors on buildings
has been already done on the con-
crete Palais Hindou d'Heliopolis
and on halls at the International
Hygiene Exhibition in Dresden.
Moyer's statement that the archi-
tect, by choosing the sand worked
into the stucco, has as much free-
dom in designing the colors and
hues as the painter has in mixing
the colors on his palette, could
be made true by supplementing
the hopper of the cement gun
with a row of smaller hoppers,
each of which contains a differently colored
sand or gravel. These small hoppers would be
arrayed like the colors of a palette and each be con-
nected with the main hose by a short hose that
could be shut and opened by pressing a button;
when open, the colored sand of the corresponding
hopper would be sucked out and, mixed with
cement and water, squirted onto the wall. The

closing buttons would be arranged on a sort of
palette. By guiding the nozzle and at the same
time pressing the desired color-button (as a flute-
player handles his instrument), the artist could
cover the wall or object with a concrete fresco.
An attached sand-blast acting as a sort of "concrete-
rubber" would erase faulty outlines and colors from
the concrete wall. "A wall is for an architect what
a white canvas is for a painter."—Ruskin. In our
time mosaic and fresco are seldom used on account
of the work and time involved. But cement gun
fresco would have the advantage of speed and
durability and necessitate a tech-
nique of broad spaces and simple
outlines as recommended previ-
ously.
Reinforced Concrete Tracery
The window openings take up
so much of the well surface that
if the need for large, smooth wall
spaces is kept in mind, no room
for outstanding decorative fea-
tures remains. The window open-
ings with the deep shadows must
serve as such, but rows of rec-
tangles are hardly interesting.
Reinforced concrete has con-
quered the third dimension and
overcome the vertical contour; its
unity and plasticity enable the
adoption of freely designed,
curved outlines for wall aper-
tures. The columns and floor
slabs divide the facade in a num-
ber of fields which we can treat as the tympanum
and metope were used by the Greeks. Ornaments,
figures and scenes can be designed in silhouette
technique, the apertures with their shade serving
as strong contrasting background. Thin, elastic
metal molds which would be inserted between the
molds used in constructing the wall, would serve
to create apertures of any size and outline. The
regulation of the curvature and the tightening of
these inserted metal forms could be effected by
spike-like steel rods, in the center connected by
turnbuckles. A few window-panes of the concrete
tracery would be on hinges for ventilation. The
panes with more complex outline would be em-
bedded in the concrete.
According to the type of building, the concrete
tracery would have a simple ornamental outline or
be a scene with figures. The depth of shadow would
be variable according to how far to the front of the
wall or how far to the back of the glass panes are set.
The manifold possibilities of concrete surface treat-
ment in addition to the variation of the glass ac-
cording to color, thickness, fluorescence and like
factors can supply every decorative effect •desired.
Concrete tracery would have to be designed in
silhouette technique with a plane of symmetry

Hospital.
The building of this has occupied several years—
the delays in construction have been due to many
causes, the chief of which was the distraction and
general upset incident to the Great War.
Important as we deemed this addition to our
State Institution, and much as we regretted the fre-
quent interruptions, no forward looking person had
more than passing regret, for the decision that car-
ried the conscience of America into an unsought
and unwished for conflict was so lofty in sentiment
as to commend it to all mankind, and it was like
the heart of this great State to set aside even the
caring of her own sick and needy to rally to the
support and help share the greater burden of sor-
rows of her cousins across the sea.
But here at last this magnificent structure
stands, not indeed a pile of architectural splendor,
nor a monument in glorification of the subjugation
of a people, nor to commemorate any personal
triumph, but rather as a testimonial that the great
heart of the people of Michigan has accepted not
as a high-sounding phrase, but as a central and
abiding philosophy of life the belief, that they are
their brother's keeper.
The hospital today is a vitally important institu-
tion deeply rooted in the family and civic life of the
American people. Originally designed only for the
care of the sick, it is becoming more and more a
community health center, influencing as no other
agency the well-being of the public.
Hospital authorities are practically agreed that
in order to meet the demands for hospital service
today there should be a minimum ratio of one active
bed to every 150 of population, depending of course
on local conditions. The University Hospital, in-
cluding both active and con-service, will provide
about 1,100 beds, or a ratio of 1/3300 of the popula-
tion of Michigan.
The hospitals are educational centers with
branches all over the country. In these schools
more young women are studying the profession of
nursing than are enrolled in all the universities and
colleges. That these influences are not futile there
is abundant evidence. In support of this, it is1 only
necessary to mention that largely through the aid
of hospital and allied activities the average length of
life has been increased twenty-one years during the
generation just past, and, without a doubt, a similar
period will be added in the next fifty years.
That the hospital has a double function, keeping
well people well and restoring the sick to health,
are among the reasons why the hospital idea has
been universally accepted by the American people.
Restoring the sick to health, while originally the
only function of the hospital, is more and more
being supplemented by the service of keeping well
people well, and all over the country hospitals are
taking active leadership in health educational work.
The recognition of the importance of adequate hos-
pital service, both in cities and rural communities,
is ample and logical reason for present advance-
ment.
The rapid development of the hospital field with-
in the past few years will undoubtedly continue over
a considerable period. The hospital facilities of the
country, particularly in outlying regions, must be
greatly increased in order to meet the standards
of hospital service. The magnitude of the hospital
field, expressed in terms of daily population and ex-
penditure, is a surprise even to those closely con-
nected and intimately familiar with hospital service
in this country.
Over 1,250,000 people must be housed, fed and
cared for each day, involving an expenditure in ex-
cess of $3,000,000 each working day or over
$1,000,000,000 annually. This year the new con-
struction and equipment program represents an ex-
penditure of over $300,000,000.
There are in service in the United States and its
possessions about 8000 hospitals and sanitoriums.
It is interesting to note that as recently as 1873
there were only 149 hospitals in this country. The
increase since that time has been 4,661 % in the
number, and 3,162% increase in the bed capacity
and a population increase of but 174%.
There are, in Michigan, 273 hospitals and allied
institutions, representing a bed capacity of 30,551—
206 hospitals are for acute service, providing 22,737
beds, or 1-161 of the population.
Now, what is the function of this Institution?
Broadly, it is operated in the service of the people of
Michigan. And how does it function? The people
of this state and country need doctors and nurses
to care for them in their sickness and sorrow. This
hospital is so equipped as to afford every oppor-
tunity for the adequate training of doctors and
nurses in order that we may supply that demand—

and not only does it help to train doctors to send
out for service in all parts of the country, but it
provides their return from time to time so as to
keep them in touch with the more recent advances in
medicine and surgery to the end that even the most
isolated community and the humblest citizen may
have the privilege of the latest and best that science
has to offer.
In addition to this, it helps care for the sick.
Many communities are still without hospital facili-
THE NEW UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
ties—only about half of the counties of this country
are provided with hospitals—many doctors are
handicapped by lack of equipment and the facilities
necessary to diagnose difficult conditions. To both
of these calls, we are prepared to give help; and yet
with all the wonderful advancement that medical
science has made, the sad fact remains that the
causes of many diseases are still unknown and many
still remain incurable. So that it seems fitting
that with the opportunities afforded by this great
organization, we should undertake the development
of research—should set aside certain time and equip-
ment for the investigation of those problems the
causes of which are still unknown, with the hope
and prayer that our children and our children's
children may be spared much in the way of sickness
and suffering that has come to so many of us.
Should we forget the patient after he has left
the hospital? We fail to get full value of this ex-
penditure unless we follow the patient after his
discharge from the hospital, not only for the pur-
pose of conserving his health, increasing his intel-
ligence in health matters and preventing recurrent
illnesses, but also for the purpose of getting and co-
relating worth-while statistical records on the re-
sults of our methods of treatment. It certainly is
a distinct advantage to the staff of the hospital to
maintain a complete record of the final results of
the patients' treatment. Should we not know how
the broken-down human machine fared after the re-
pair in the hospital and how long it remains re-
paired?
Follow-up methods and periodic examinations of
their machinery or products are now an established
practice in commercial institutions and manufactur-
ing plants'. This is done to forestall unnecessary
expense, accidents and sometimes loss of life. All
automobile owners know of the monthly inspections
conducted by all automobile concerns. Why should
not we, in a similar manner, conduct periodical ex-
aminations of the human machines that are being
repaired daily at our plant at such an enormous ex-
pense?
Let us consider first the function of the hospital
to the community. It performs a definite service.
By affording facilities to the medical profession, it
enables them to give a higher type of service; to
care for the sick, crippled and injured members of
its society and teach them how to keep or regain
health.
Every community in the state demands certain
hospital service. To what extent are our hospitals
filling this demand? Every hospital director pon-
ders over this question repeatedly, for as the com-
munity grows the hospital should also grow.
To meet this demand hospitals have come into
existence in various ways. Physicians who have
been hampered in their work by lack of facilities
have built their own hospitals. These usually have
a very limited bed capacity and the service limited
to a specialty.
Industrial concerns called upon to render service
to their employees have established institutions.
This service is usually limited to accident cases, al-
though frequently it is extended to include general
care to members of employees' families.
Philanthropic and charitable organizations and
individuals have built and endowed hospitals to
render various services. Some of these are unre-
stricted and offer general hospital service to the
public at large; others are limited to the care of
children, maternity cases or research in specified
diseases.
Religious organizations have established hospitals
which usually render general service to the com-
munity in which they are built.
But, in addition to these, our cities, counties and
state have, through necessity, been called upon to
operate institutions for the unfortunate members of
its society. General Hospitals, Contagious Hos-
pitals, Tubercular Sanitariums, and institutions for
the blind, deaf, feeble-minded and mentally de-
ranged, have been established.
Our University Hospital does not come under
any of these classifications. Its original purpose
was to provide teaching material for the medical
school of the University. By acts of the legislature.

WHAT Is IRON, WHAT Is STEEL?
New Short Definitions Offered in the Light of Modern Developments
By ALBERT SAUVEUB, Prof, of Metallurgy, Harvard University
THE incongruity of calling steel a product that
represents the nearest approach to the element
iron commercially obtainable is so glaring that it
once more brings forcibly before us the much-
debated question of the nomenclature of iron and
steel and reveals the confused and unsatisfactory
condition in which it has been left in spite of the
labors of many committees appointed to clarify it.
Some still contend that the commercially pure
iron I have in mind, known to the trade and to
science as Armco Ingot Iron, should be labeled
steel, because it is produced in a liquid condition.
The manufacturers of this metal have selected for
it the name "ingot iron," and who can deny that
if any metallurgical product was ever entitled to
be so described it is indeed this
practically carbonless and man-
ganeseless product of the open-
hearth furnace? The term "in-
got iron," however, which is
the equivalent of the German
term Flusseisen, was proposed
by Dr. Wedding to designate
bessemer steel, and in Germany
it has been applied to the pro-
duct of the bessemer converter,
at least when not too highly car-
bonized. Instead of objecting
to this iron being called ingot
iron, if we followed the dictates
of common sense, we should ex-
pel all low-carbon steels from that class and admit
only Armco Ingot Iron or similar products. In-
deed, is not this iron the only real ingot iron ever
commercially manufactured?
Attempts have been made to distinguish between
wrought iron and steel (1) by classifying as steel
all malleable ferrous products which could be hard-
ened by quenching, and as wrought iron those
which could not, regardless of the process of manu-
facture; and (2) by classifying as steel all malle-
able products obtained in a fused condition and as
wrought iron those obtained in a pasty condition,
regardless of their chemical composition and physi-
cal properties. The first classification prevails to
some extent in Germany, where, however, as al-
ready stated, the mild varieties of steel—that is,
those which cannot be hardened by quenching—are
known as Flusseisen. The second classification is
generally followed in the United States, England
Many definitions of "steel"
and "iron" have been presented
and discussed during the past
few years. Some of them are
voluminous and replete with
technical detail, but none of
them has proved to be entirely
satisfactory to all concerned.
Dr. Sauveur "offers for discus-
sion" in four short sentences
definitions that are both simple
and complete. —The Editor.
and France, where it has been accepted not because
it satisfies but as the only apparent way out of the
difficulty.
As secretary of the international committee "on
uniform nomenclature of iron and steel," appointed
in 1910 by the International Association for Test-
ing Materials and of which Professor Howe was
chairman, I took an active part in the deliberations,
and in common with other metallurgists, in a spirit
of resignation, I accepted the following definition
proposed by the committee as the best solution it
could offer:
Steel—Iron which is cast from the molten state
into a mass which is usefully malleable, initially
at least, in some one range of temperature.
Wrought Iron — Malleable
iron which is aggregated from
pasty particles without subse-
quent fusion and contains so lit-
tle carbon that it does not
harden usefully when cooled
rapidly.
So long as steel only was
produced in the bessemer con-
verter and in the open-hearth
furnace this classification, al-
though far from sound, did not
cause much confusion. When,
however, iron practically car-
bonless and of a degree of pur-
ity never before commercially
attained was manufactured by the open-hearth pro-
cess, the shortcomings of this classification were
strikingly revealed; to insist that the product of
the open-hearth furnace, even if it were chemically
pure iron, shall be called steel offends our intelli-
gence and our common sense.
These thoughts have led me to offer for discus-
sion the following short definitions:
1. Commercial Iron—Commercial iron is the
element iron as pure as it can be commercially
produced.
2. Ingot Iron—Ingot iron is commercial iron
which has been produced in a fluid condition and
cast.
3. Wrought Iron—Wrought iron is a ferrous
metal which is malleable and which has been pro-
duced from a pasty condition.
4. Steel—Steel is a malleable alloy of iron and

VANADIUM—A CHEMICAL CURIOSITY PUT To USE
By B. D. SAKLATWALLA, Ph. D.
THIS silver metal appears to have derived its
name from Vanadis, a goddess of Norse myth-
ology. But the tales of mythology are no more
romantic than the narrative of the search for van-
adium, when once its possibilities for usefulness be-
gan to be perceived. The story of vanadium is a
history of geographical exploration, scientific re-
search and technical development, sustained by
human pluck and persistence through great diffi-
culties and many discouragements to ultimate suc-
cess. The world is enriched by the victories of busi-
ness foresight co-operating with scientific talent.
The chemical element, vanadium, was discovered
in 1801 by Del Rio, a mineralogist in Mexico, but
for practically a century it remained in oblivion,
being relegated to the specimen cabinets of miner-
alogical museums. It aroused the scientific curios-
ity of such eminent chemists as Wohler, Berzelius,
and Sir Henry Roscoe, who studied its chemistry
without finding any practical application for it in
the arts. In 1900, Professor Arnold, who was con-
nected with the University of Sheffield, England,
pre-eminent center of the cutlery and tool steel
world, conceived the idea that this strange element
might impart some beneficial properties to tool
steel. He experimented on a small scale in his
laboratory and found that the addition of vanadium
had wonderfully increased the cutting qualities of
his steel. As vanadium was not commonly found
in minerals, and was considered a rare element cost-
ing much more even than gold, the knowledge of its
useful properties in steel could not be readily com-
mercialized.
It was left to the adventurous spirit and com-
mercial vision, inborn of the American business
man, to overcome these obstacles. Two brothers,
J. J. and J. M. Flannery, of Pittsburgh, having
heard of this strange metal element and its stranger
influences in steel, and being born and raised in
the cradle of the American steel industry, Pitts-
burgh, conceived the idea of obtaining financial aid
from a few of their business friends, in order to
make this element commercially available to the
industry of their home town. They scoured all the
world for possible sources of vanadium minerals.
Finally, they succeeded in locating the richest and
most unusual deposit of vanadium sulphide, a min-
eral known as patronite, in the Peruvian Andes, at
an altitude of over sixteen thousand feet above sea-
level.
This discovery of the only known deposit of vana-
dium ore, while a stupendous task in itself, was
only the beginning of the difficulties which the
small company, organized by the Flannerys, had to
face. They had to convince the steel-makers at
home that the use of vanadium had salutary effects.
American steel-makers had not heard of vanadium
before After they had convinced the steel-makers,
the Flannerys were confronted with the problem of
reducing the vanadium to metal out of the ore. No
one had done this commercially before. Undaunted,
they turned again to the world and obtained the
services of the best suited men for the task. With
full belief in the success of their undertaking, they
devoted all their available funds to building up
from the bottom the metallurgy of vanadium, by
scientific research, with the aid of these men.
For the very serviceable result, the world should
thank the pioneering spirit of the Flannerys and
their collaborators, for this result is one of the most
potent metallurgical factors in the rapid progress
of our industries, namely: "Vanadium Steel."
Vanadium is an essential component of all high-
speed tool steel, which fashions all our machines
of peace and war, big or small, from monster guns
to automobile engines. Again, the stresses devel-
oped by our present tendency to speed could not
have been overcome without the use of vanadium.
It is for this reason that vanadium steel is used
largely in the construction of automobiles, aero-
planes, and railroad equipment. It has thus con-
tributed immeasurably to our comfort and safety
and to our rapid industrial advance.
Where could we find a more romantic tale than
that of the adventurous spirit and commercial fore-
sight of a few business men who succeeded in dis-
covering an isolated deposit of an unknown min-
eral at the top of the world, and in gathering to-
gether a coterie of scientific and technical talent to
solve new metallurgical problems, thus founding a
branch of metallurgical industry, which has fortu-
nately proved of such immense value to our modern
civilization?
Conveyed at first on the backs of llamas and
later by narrow-gauge railways and trucks, from
the perpetual snows of the Andean heights, vana-
dium finds1 its way to the elevated temperatures of
metaflurgical furnaces. It imparts to steel qualities
which make possible the cutting of metals at speeds
so high that the tool glows at a red heat. Its possi-
bilities for service to mankind have only begun to
be explored.

THE NEED FOR RESEARCH
Continued from page 6
our educational institutions that the great burden of
scientific advancement must always rest, and from
them that the inspiration of the younger generation
of oncoming scientific workers is derived. What we
need above all things is the better support of these
men. They should not, by the necessities of living
and the cost of equipment, be forced into our indus-
trial laboratories. Those men who show an apti-
tude for research should be less engulfed in teach-
ing. Often their productivity can be greatly aided
by being released from teaching and administrative
demands and endowed in research positions. Much
can also be done by providing them with instru-
ments, skilled assistants, measures, computers, and
stenographers, and all the aids that the nature of
their researches and the most economical use of
their time may demand. To attempt to herd into
great laboratories, even for pure research, is often
their least useful service. To alter their mode of
life and thought would merely result in the exhaus-
tion at the source of the vital essence of their suc-
cess. Moreover, the very researches which they
prosecute and the discoveries they achieve demand
just such concentration of attention and originality
of perception as their freedom tends to foster.
There is no price that the world could not aftord
to pay to these men who have the originality of
mind to carry scientific thought great strides—and
they wish no price. They need opportunity to live
and work. No one can estimate the value to the
world of an investigator like Faraday. Our whole
banking community does not do the public service
in a year that Faraday's discoveries do us daily. As
national assets, men of his type, even when much
less gifted than Faraday in the past and Millikan
todav, are beyond valuation, and no effort should be
spared to facilitate their work. Only thus can they
be reasonably expected to make the best use of their
willingness to advance knowledge and therefore
civilization, without thought of personal gain.
The universities in which most of them are em-
ployed are not to be blamed for this because they do
maintain vital interest in research and they would
be glad to devote much largei sums to its support if
the pressure of other demands would permit. In
seeking assistance elsewhere the investigator en-
counters ample good will but sadly inadequate
means. We may make these academic posts so at-
tractive to the student of science that he will seek
and occupy them permanently because of the op-
portunities they afford him to advance knowledge
by original research without anxiety for bread and
family and equipment. It is true that money can
not buy genius but many a genius in science has de-
faulted because he has had to eat.
Aside from direct support to these men there is
another method of organization of research among
them that is no less in need of support. That is,
co-ordinated research in specific directions by men
in different localities—again, men mostly in our uni-
versities. Some of these are broad inquiries, de-
manding the joint consideration of specialists from
various fields of science. Others are of narrowed
scope but of such character or magnitude that the
combined efiorts of manv workers are essential for
their solution. The National Research Council has
organized many co-operative investigations. Such
organized campaigns against the unknown are few
and far between in our country, for but few men
have had the vision to give them financial support.
Thus, we need to find great funds which, wisely di- •
reeled, can be used to support and stimulate the
work of the many indigent investigators, the many
men in our universities, the great research institu-
tions, and to organize definite campaigns of co-oper-
ative research among them.
The third type of pure science research that re-
quires much more liberal support is the special in-
stitution. The recent appeal of the Smithsonian in-
stitute for additional endowment to enable it to sup-
port a larger staff, so that it may properly compass
that fraction of the field of science which has been
its province, should have the support of every citi-
zen. The Smithsonian has been peculiarly the
architect of scientific investigation in our country.
Much of the work we have in progress today has
been inspired from this great pioneer of all Ameri-
can research.
It is unfortunately true that we can claim no such
rank in pure science research as that which we enjoy
in the field of industrial research. Instead of lead-
ing all other countries in the advancement of funda-
mental scientific knowledge the United States oc-
cupies a position far in the rear of the majority of
European nations. A list of the awards of the Nobel
prizes to men of various nationalities reveals the
small proportion of first minds that we support.
Other tests lead to the same conclusion, namely,
that the number of first-rank investigators devel-
oped in the United States is far below that which
our poulation, education, and wealth would lead one
to expect.
The difficulty we experience in securing a place
in science beside the nations of Europe can hardly
be due to a lack of men of innate ability, judging
from the leading part already played by the United
States in finance, in architecture, and in applied
science. It results partly from the fact that Ameri-
can civilization is only beginning to emerge from
the pioneering stage, and partly from the financial
and other inducements which so often lead talented
men reluctantly to accept well-paid industrial posi-

tions instead of poorly-paid academic and research
posts.
The far-sighted leaders of industry fully recog-
nize the dependence of their progress upon advances
in science, and emphasize their belief that funda-
mental research should be much more greatly aided.
Dr. J. J. Carty said in his presidential address to
the Institute of Electrical Engineers ten years ago:
"By every means in our power, therefore, let us
show our appreciation of pure science, and let us
forward the work of the pure scientists, for they are
the advance guard of civilization. They point the
way which we must follow. Let us arouse the
people of our country to the wonderful possibilities
of scientific discovery and to the responsibility to
support it which rests upon them, and I am sure
they will respond generously and effectively."
But the response has not yet come.
After many years of experience in industrial re-
search he echoes the words of Tyndall spoken in
New York in 1873:
"It would be a great thing for this land of incal-
culable destinies to supplement its achievements' in
the industrial arts by those higher investigations
which our mastery over nature and over industrial
art itself has been derived."
We have prided ourselves on our practicality as
a Nation. Would it not be a practical thing to
do to give adequate organized financial support to
pure science? And if by chance we develop a little
contribution to abstract learning and knowledge,
our Nation will be immensely greater for it. o
TRAFFIC CONTROL
Continued from page 9
vehicles soon will acquire the habit (if observing
such laws.
Other methods of control will be considered
under the general subject of mechanical methods.
Gates will be passed by as there is a decided differ-
ence of opinion among railway officials as to the
value of the utilization of gates at railroad grade
crossings. It is self-evident, however, that gates
and flagmen may be used effectively at many dan-
gerous crossings on highways subjected to intensive
traffic.
A phase of control by mechanical methods has
been promoted in certain quarters. Some have ad-
vocated the construction of humps and corrugations
in the roadway surface in order to force operators
to reduce speed. Others have urged the installa-
tion of various devices which will require cars to
slow down their speed because of obstructions
placed in the highway, causing vehicles to be di-
verted from the regular path. Some of these in-
clude two turns marked on the highway by curbs
which a vehicle must pass around before reaching
a grade crossing. While there may be a difference
of opinion regarding the value of these methods,
it is believed that the following conclusion pre-
sented by the Committee on "Construction and
Engineering" headed by Hon. Frank Page, Chair-
man of the North Carolina State Highway Com-
mission, and adopted by the Hoover Conference is
sound: "Roughness in the pavement or other con-
ditions at or near the tracks, which tend to divert
the attention of the motorist, should be avoided."
The Committee report described the "conditions"
mentioned in the conclusion as follows:
"Transverse ridges in the road, zigzag turns and
various other expedients designed to force the mo-
torist to reduce speed at railroad crossings have
proved ineffective and are not recommended. On
the contrary, your Committee believes the opera-
tion of the motor vehicle, particularly on and m
the immediate vicinity of the tracks, should be
made as simple and easy as possible so that the
operator can apply himself to watching for ap-
proaching trains. Very much can be done along
these lines for a relatively small expenditure, and
the dangers of many crossings can thereby be
greatly reduced. Frequently where the railroad
is on an embankment the highway is carried up to
the level of the tracks by a short steep grade which
breaks sharply at the track itself, causing danger
of stalling. Such approaches should be extended
and provided with easy vertical curves or level
places so that the motorist can stop and hold his
car easily within ten feet of the railroad if he dis-
covers a train coming. Short sharp descents to the
tracks should likewise be cut away to easier grades
to lessen the likelihood of motorists being unable to
stop near the tracks, or of being rammed from be-
hind and driven upon the tracks.
What mechanical method may be employed?
In discussing this subject, it is desirable to present
definite recommendations relative to the meaning &lt; f
different light colors. The Hoover Conference
adopted the following conclusions: "For signs and
signals, both luminous and nonluminous, the fol-
lowing color indications are recommended, and
these colors should not be used for any other pur-
pose: Red for 'Stop'; green for 'Proceed'; yellow
for 'Caution', as at curves." This subject may be
considered from two standpoints, first, mechanical
devices which may be employed during daylight,
and second, those which may be employed cither
at night or during both the hours of daylight and
darkness.
During daylight it is self-evident that the stand-
ard disc signs at the side of the pavement usually
are effective as well as markings on the pavement.
Of course there are conditions under which both of


Page 23
THE MICHIGAN T E C H N I C
these may not function. As a general proposition,
the sign if properly placed and at a height of visi-
bility will be effective except when it is covered
by snow or ice. Markings on the highway or pave-
ment, of course, are not effective when the pave-
ment is not clean or is covered with snow or ice and
dirt. To indicate the approach of trains during
daylight hours, the automatic wigwag signals have
proved effective, provided they arc efficiently
maintained.
The most difficult and complex phase of this
problem is in regard to the methods by which the
highway officials and engineers and the railroads
can give adequate warning to motorists approach-
ing railroad crossings during the night.
What methods may be utilized at crossings des-
ignated as dangerous? There is no question but
what it will be desirable, as rapidly as practicable,
for railroads to install at all crossings signals of tin-
type advocated by the Committee of Signal Engi-
neers of the American Railway Association, namely,
the showing of intermittent lights, red in color, to
indicate the approach and passage of trains at given
crossings and giving a definite signal to the opera-
tors of vehicles that they must come to a full stop.
There may be a difference of opinion as to the
method to be employed to give constant notice that
a crossing has been designated as a full stop cross-
ing by a state commission. There is no question
but what a red light should be employed. The
difference of opinion will come as to whether it
should be a clear continuous light or a Hashing
light. In this connection, it should be borne in
mind that the education of the public relative to
the utilization of uniform signals is of paramount
importance. Otherwise there is a tendency for
motorists to become callous and neglect the warn-
ing which it is intended should be indicated by a
given type of signal. In other words, if an inter-
mittent light is to be used by the railroads to indi-
cate an approaching or passing train, the utiliza-
tion of a flashing red light would be of doubtful
expediency. The position of such a light indicat-
ing full stop should be near the railroad tracks.
To provide for maximum safety, the railroad signal
of intermittent lights, red in color, should be in-
stalled to indicate the approach and passage of
trains and a continuous non-flashing red light, hav-
ing a lens with the standard black cross and R R
painted on its face, should be used to signify to the
motorist that he is approaching a full stop railroad
crossing. This type of light also should be em-
ployed at full stop crossings in cases where the
railroad has not erected train approach signals.
In the case of grade crossings which are classed
among those at which speed should be reduced, a
continuous yellow warning signal light, having a
lens with the standard black cross and R R painted
on its face, should be placed at a distance of 3(X1
feet to give the necessary warning. As previously
stated, the regulation is that within a distance ot
100 feet from the railroad the motor vehicle oper-
ator should reduce the speed of his vehicle to 15
miles per hour. Such a law may be easily com-
plied with if the light is installed at 300 feet from
the railroad crossing. Of course, the railroad inter-
mittent red light signal should be erected at the
crossing to indicate the approach and passage of
trains. Without lights or illuminated signals, it
appears that it is placing a degree of responsibility
&lt;m the motorist which is unreasonable as it is with
extreme difficulty that the ordinary non-illuminated
signs are visible to the traveling public at night.
The endeavor has been made to base these rec-
ommendations relative to mechanical methods on
the principle of reasonable traffic control. They
have been proposed in the interest of the safety
of a very large percentage of the 17,000,000 owners
of motor vehicles, rather than to penalize this vast
majority for the foolhardy acts of a small minority
of operators who race an express train to a cross-
ing, crash through a gate, or collide with a train
and pass on into eternity.

tion and in addition a ball hearing is used to take
the thrust.
Figure 4 illustrates how steering is accomplished.
The drive shaft (A) is directly coupled to the pro-
peller shaft of the Fordson through the spacer. On
this drive shaft are mounted two plate clutches in
tandem, separated by two 600-lb. springs and a
collar. Gears B and C are connected with the driven
plates and mesh with gears on the sprocket shafts.
The collar between the springs is linked with the
steering wheel by a forked connection, lever arm,
drag link and Fordson steering lever arm.
Thus, revolving the steering wheel, the col-
lar moves in such a direction as to com-
press the plates in one clutch and release the
plates in the other clutch. This causes one driven
gear to rotate faster than the other, thereby vary-
ing the relative speed of the two drums and turn-
ing the Snow-Motor. With the wheel in neutral
position the pressure is equalized between the
clutches and motion is straight ahead. The only
pressure on the wheel is that due to the springs
which is always constant under any conditions, and
is greatly reduced by the leverages used. There
are 58 hardened plates in each clutch that run in
oil.
The large sprockets are of soft steel while the
small sprockets are carburized steel of .10-.20 car-
bon with a 70-80 scleroscope hardness. The roller
chain has a I'/^-inch pitch. The gear ratios are
5:1 on the tractor. 2:1 on the gear box, and 4:1 on
the chain drive, making a total of 40:1.
The Snow-Motor owes its rapid development
principally to the combined efforts of Mr. A. i7.
Knoblock, with his management and financing
abilities, and Mr. H. C. Oliver, with his engineering
skill, backed by the support of one of the strongest
groups of men in the automobile industry. o
MAKING UP AIRSHIP BALLAST
Continued from page 14
Mr. Humphrey F. Parker, who participated in
the design of the condenser described in this paper,
has since been employed by the Navy Department
and is responsible for the installation of successful
water recovery equipment on our largest airships,
the Shcnandoah and the Los Angeles.
During all the flying of the Shenandoah with the
water recover}- apparatus installed, the ballast re-
covery averaged 110%, and, at the time of her de-
struction, the condensers had been in use for a
total i/f more than a thousand hours.
The subject of water ballast recovery has been
discussed pro and con by airship authorities, and,
in the past, opinions as to its value have varied
from fanatic enthusiasm to rabid antagonism. How-
ever, if we desire to use non-inflammable helium to

FIG. 4—RELATION OF EXHAUST TEMPERATURE TO CON-
DENSATION WITH VARIOUS FUELS
replace hydrogen as a lifting gas, ballast recovery
must be used. We know that with the greatest
care in conserving our helium supply and with the
use of water recovery equipment we may be able
to operate a few helium-filled ships. We also know
that without ballast recovery operation of airships
with helium on even a relatively small scale, is
out of the question.
CONCRETE ARCHITECTURE

within would be the same as that seen from the
street. The glass panes seen as shadows from the
street would be light spots when viewed from in-
side the building, the concrete tracery light from
the street and dark from within. Consequently,
where scenes and figures would be depicted by the
concrete tracery on monumental buildings, such as
churches and libraries, the concrete would have to
be enlivened with mosaic or color on the interior
side and supplemented by stained glass, all the
more since the spectator would have a closer view
from within.
The Bahai Temple which is now being erected
at Wilmette, 111., will be the most remarkable ex-
ample of concrete tracery on this continent if not
in the whole world. Its windows as well as the
dome are covered with delicate lacework of rein-
forced concrete created bv the master-designer,
Louis Bourgeois. His personality and art resemble
that of the Gothic masters. Several years ago he
gave up a successful practice to be able to devote
himself to designing and building a model of the
Bahai Temple even before knowing that he would
be chosen as architect by the Bahais. He thus
sacrificed two years without recompense, being an
ardent believer in the Bahai faith. Religious de-
votion led his hand, just as it did that of the
Gothic builders and once more the result is real
art.

indigent patients may be sent to the University
Hospital for care.
The new building is the result of a natural
growth. You will remember when the University
Hospital was comprised of but one building. Addi
tional units were added from time to time to keep
pace with developments in the science of medicine
and the increasing number of patients. But, like
those before them, they finally became inadequate
and the new building became a necessity.
What is expected of this new building?
First, we hope that the teaching material will be
used to its fullest extent. To accomplish this, we
have provided demonstration rooms in each diag-
nostic service and on each patient's floor. We have
established a central record room where all patients'
records will be housed. Cataloguing and statistical
work will be done under the supervision of our hos-
pital librarian.
The main amphitheatre, with a seating capacity
of 200, the pathological amphitheatre, with a capac-
ity of 100, and several lecture rooms and labora-
tories, provide facilities for student lectures and re-
citation classes.
Second, we hope that the service rendered the
patient will be of the highest degree. This has al-
ready been accomplished to a marked degree. All
the advantages of a new and modern building lead
directly to better service for the patient. All waids
have an outside exposure and are light and cheerful.
Sun porches off each ward are equipped to increase
the comfort of the patient. Each ward unit is also
provided with a nurses' utility room, diet kitchen,
laboratory for routine work, and a treatment room.
Nurses' rest rooms are provided on each patients'
floor and operating room unit, so that nurses taken
ill while on duty may be properly cared for. Con-
sultation rooms are provided on each floor, so that
the medical staff may retire to discuss their cases
requiring consultation and to interview patients'
relatives.
Bacteriological, serological and pathological la-
boratories render service to all patients.
Our new nurses' home affords better living con-
ditions for the nurses in training, with the result
that better and more cheerful service is given the
patient.
Third, that the research laboratories will help
solve some of the problems confronting the medical
profession, laboratories and animal rooms have been
equipped with standard equipment and have been
specified as reserve laboratories. These will be used
from time to time when various research problems
present themselves.
Let us think of this great hospital as a magnifi-
cent institution set aside for the service of the sick
and suffering, for the advancement of learning and
a monument to the intelligence and the heart of the
people of Michigan.
IRON AND STEEL
Continued from page 19
carbon, usually containing substantial quantities of
manganese.
Following this classification, such a material as
Armco Ingot Iron may be further defined as "ingot
iron" produced in an open-hearth furnace and con-
taining not more than 0.02 per cent carbon and
not more than 0.035 per cent manganese.
If, accepting my nomenclature, it is asked that a
line be clearly drawn between ingot iron and steel,
I venture to recall that ingot iron as here defined
differs sharply from the mildest steels in regard to
their respective manganese contents, which in ingot
iron should not exceed 0.05 per cent, while steel
seldom contains less than 0.20 per cent.
Again, ingot iron should not contain more than
0.03 per cent carbon, while steel seldom contains
less than 0.05 per cent of that element.
Between a metal containing not more than 0.03
per cent carbon and not more than 0.05 per cent
manganese and a metal containing not less than
0.05 per cent carbon and not less than 0.15 or 0.20
per cent manganese or even, in exceptional cases,
as little as 0.10 per cent, there is a wide gap by
which ingot iron and the mildest steels can readily
be chemically differentiated.
Ingot iron, moreover, because of its extremely
low percentage of manganese, unless indeed it con-
tains considerably less than 0.02 per cent of sul-
phur, is red-short within a certain range of temper-
ature, whereas low-carbon steel, owing to its much
larger percentage of manganese and although it
may contain considerably more sulphur, is free from
red-shortness.
In the absence of the thermal critical point A,,
when iron contains less than 0.03 per cent carbon
and in the absence of pearlite in its micro-structure,
we might find an additional means of distinguishing
between ingot iron and mild steel.
A sound and rational nomenclature of our fer-
rous products is of importance alike to producers,
to consumers and to scientific men interested in
the metallurgy of iron and steel. The problem
should be approached in a spirit of service and of
fairness devoid of commercial considerations of
technical sophistry and of ingenious attempts at
begging the question.

Coast Artillerymen Attend Camp at
Fort Monroe
Fifteen Michigan men, with forty-four from
Kansas State College and forty-three from Michi-
gan State College, comprised Battery "C" of the
R. O. T. C. Camp at Fort Monroe, Va., last summer.
Special trips to places of historical or scientific
interest were arranged for the R. O. T. C. students.
The first of these excursions was to Langley Field,
where a special bombing demonstration was ar-
ranged for their benefit. Many men visited the
Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Com-
pany, which is one of the largest on the Atlantic
seaboard. Other trips were taken to Cape Henry,
\ irginia Beach, Norfolk, Hampton Roads Naval
Base, Portsmouth Navy Yard, Jamestown Island,
the site of one of the oldest English settlements in
America, and to Yorktown, the scene of Cornwallis'
surrender to Washington in Revolutionary days.
At Virginia Beach a special matinee dance was
given in the Casino for the R. O. T. C.
Living conditions were excellent, and ample
facilities for sport and amusement included tennis,
baseball, horse-back riding, fishing, track, and
swimming, besides the weekly dances and the
movies.
The Michigan delegation, though small, made an
especially brilliant showing in the activities of the
Camp. M. W. Heath, '26E, won two first places
in the track meet, while P. D. Welch, '26, won the
Dingles championship in tennis and was proclaimed
the fastest swimmer in Camp. M. L. Ireland, '26E,
and N. E. Holland, 26E, represented the U. of M.
on the staff of the "Home Ram," the Camp publica-
tion.

Architects Hold Annual Smoker
The annual smoker of the Architectural Society
was held in the assembly hall of Nickels Arcade,
Wednesday evening, November the eleventh and
proved to be an enjoyable gathering of the students
of that college.
Entertainment was furnished by a group of the
students, who seemed to be the original exponents
of extemporaneous harmony, and Colburn, '28A,
Snyder, '29A, and "Bud" Lewis, '29Lit, rendered
some very fine solo work.
The speaker of the evening, Mr. Chamberlain,
the popular new addition to the staff of the college,
gave a very interesting talk on the trials, tribula-
tions and general conditions confronting the sketch
stool artist abroad. Some personal experiences,
cited by Mr. Chamberlain, aroused much interest
in the audience.
C. A. Sirrine, general chairman of the smoker,
then announced that those present were confronted
by a real problem, the consuming of cider and
doughnuts, which was soon taken care of after
which the smoker came to a close.
Tau Sigma Delta Elect* Officers
At a meeting of Tau Sigma Delta, national
honorary architectural fraternity, the following
members were elected to hold office for the ensuing
year:
President, Le Roy Kiefer.
Scribe, Harold Beam.
Recorder, Harrison Cook.
English Department Very Progressive
The English Department of a technical school, and
especially one of such a cosmopolitan nature as
Michigan, is confronted with special conditions not
encountered elsewhere. In spite of this fact the
enrollment in English in the Engineering College
has had a steady increase for nearly twenty years.
The presence of a rather large group of foreign
students whose native tongue is not English, pre-
sents another difficult problem. The way this prob-
lem has been met, and the progressive steps that
have been taken in the revision of the English
curriculum are well set forth in the words of
Professor J. R. Nelson, Head of the Department of
Engineering English:
"The total enrollment remains practically the
same as last year, since from 1583 enrolled must
be deducted the 379 freshmen enrolled in both
English 1 and 2, a condition obtaining this year for
the first time. Except for the upheaval incident
upon the War, this is the first halt to occur in the
steady increase of students taking English, an in-
crease which has continued for more than twenty
years.
"The demand in engineering education for things
practical has been rapidly displaced by the desire
for broader and more humanistic influences. Ac-
cordingly, the courses in business correspondence,
advertising and sales, technical journalism, have
been allowed to languish and are this year officially
discontinued. In their place, a survey course in
literary masterpieces, and a course in Shakespeare
have been added to the list of electives—both
courses of a broad and comprehensive nature in-
tended to stimulate the interest and appreciation of
our students and to give them a glimpse into a
number of new fields which they may care to study
later more intensively.
"The development of courses in oral composition
has been a well marked movement in engineering
education during the past four years. In harmony
with this very sensible ideal the English Depart-
ment is this year for the first time requiring every
freshman to take two hours of public speaking in
connection with his first course in English composi-
tion. Moreover, the two advanced courses in oral
composition or public speaking for engineers, i. e.,
English 3 and 4, have now been supplemented by
a still more advanced course in argumentation and
debate.
"This year for the first time a really adequate
plan has been tried for looking after the foreign
students in the College. I append a copy of the
resolution of the faculty which created a permanent
committee on English for foreign students. In
spite of the absence of the chairman on leave, the
second semester and the death of one other of the
committee, the plan was fairly initiated and has
given very satisfactory results. The case of every
student entering the Colleges of Engineering and
Architecture was studied by the committee and
advice given as to the best course for him to follow.
All such students were called together by the com-
mittee for frequent conferences during the year,
and reports on their difficulties were solicited from
their instructors. A system of records was worked
out which should be of great value to the adminis-
tration of the committee's tasks the coming year.
I believe the sympathetic interest of our own com-
mittee and the actual help rendered has been great-
ly appreciated by the majority of the foreign
students."

Echoes from the Graduates
HILL
In the year 1847, on the fifteenth of March, there
was born in the small town of St. Clair, Michigan,
a man whose name was to become firmly linked
with the history of the University of Michigan.
Arthur Hill was the son and only child of James H.
and Lecretia Brown Hill.
In his youth, Arthur Hill
displayed a remarkable intelli-
gence and an avid desire for
knowledge. He availed him-
self of every opportunity to
read and enjoy good literature,
and was by no means lacking in
a more concrete mathematical
ability. At the termination of
his preliminary education in
high school, he had developed
a most magnetic and command-
ing personality, and a habit of
quick and effective decision fol-
lowed by immediate action.
In the fall of 1862 he entered
the University of Michigan, in
the College of Engineering,
where for four years he distin-
guished himself in his studies
and associations. It is said of
him that he never put off his
work, and even son that he never
missed a social event. This
might seem impossible to the college man now, but
that was over fifty years ago, in a time of which
we have but hazy traditions. It is certain that the

studied the ways and procedures of law until 1867.
In this year he perceived the opportunities of the
lumber business in eastern Michigan and entered
that industry where he was to have later such a
marked degree of success. There is one very inter-
esting tale about him. When
the United States Government
gave the Cass River Block over
to the local Indians, appor-
tioned out in sections, all of
the lumber owners of the vicin-
ity were present at the distri-
bution with wagon loads of
blankets, whiskey, and trinkets
to exchange for the newly ac-
quired land of the Indian*.
However, all of this land was
not as rich in timber as the
strips just back from the river
which bore almost one hun-
dred per cent cork pine. By
gathering much information
previous to the affair, Hill
was able to determine which
Indians were assigned sections
in these strips of land, and
for these only did he ex-
change. Many often won-
dered how it was that Arthur
Hill happened on all the choice
this mad scramble purchasing. It
pressed by the question years after-
he came out with the storv. He

ing in Minnesota. However, in the following particularly interested in education; he served five
year, he returned to his alma mater where he years as President of the Board of Education of

Saginaw, and was three times elected Mayor. Dur-
ing his holding office as Mayor, Saginaw prospered
mightily. It was in the time of his chairmanship
of the Board of Education that Saginaw's schools
were based with the efficient system on which they
run to-day. His knowledge of timber backed by
his public standing caused him to be appointed one
of two of the first Michigan Forestry Commission,
and he served on this commission until death over-
took him. His work in this department estab-
lished the much needed forest fire protection for
Michigan.
In 1901, Governor Bliss appointed Arthur Hill a
Regent of the University of Michigan to fill the
vacancy left by the decease of Regent Cocker. His
sound judgment in this capacity, his knowledge of
the needs of the university, and his generosity with
donations in time of need were all factors in the
growth of Michigan, and he was re-elected Regent
by the people in 1905 to serve until 1913. It is as
Regent and benefactor of the university that people
know him best. To encourage the study of
forestry, he purchased and presented to the univer-
sity the Saginaw Forest Farm, an eighty acre tract,
three and one-half miles west of Ann Arbor. This
land contains two lakes and a wealth of different
timber, and its various soil conditions, left at the
border of the glaciated area of Michigan, make it
useful to the university also as a point of geological
interest. In Memorial Hall is a beautiful bronze
base-relief by Karl Bitter, of James Burril Angcll,
Michigan's venerated old president. This is another
gift of the Regent to his Alma Mater. Unfortu-
nately for the university and for his friends came
Arthur Hill's untimely death on December 6th, 1909.
His place as Regent was filled by the appointment of
John H. Grant by Governor Warner.
In his will Hill left the university $200,000 to
build a much needed auditorium. He left $200,000
to Saginaw to build a trade school. He left over
$100,000 to different welfare sects in Saginayv and
many large bequests to his family and friends. The
auditorium which was named the Hill auditorium,
has a seating capacity of five thousand and its acous-
tics are remarkable. A whisper on the stage can
be heard almost anywhere in the audience. Its
beauty and usefulness render it an invaluable gift
to the students. The trade school in Saginaw is an
example of the many different kinds of work that
can be successfully taught to boys and girls of the
school age, when they will probably not have the
chance of a college education. It has been named
the Arthur Hill Trade School. Saginaw has also
named after this generous man a new high school in
which there are four $1200 scholarships left by him
for boys whose ambition it is to attend the state
university and who might not otherwise be able to
do so.
Arthur Hill was co-author with John Bertram in
1918 of "The Pine Industry of Michigan." He is
also the author of "Fire the Greatest Enemy of the
Forest Reserve." He was an exceptionally well
educated and well travelled man, of broad views,
varied information, and marked social instincts, and
his liberal generosity is appreciated by all who at-
tend the University of Michigan.

THE CONDENSER TYPE SPLIT PHASE MOTOR
By BENJ. F. BAILEY, Ph. D.
Professor of Electrical Engineering
ELECTRICAL engineers have been endeavoring
for years to produce a satisfactory single phase-
motor. The polyphase induction motor is an ex-
cellent piece of apparatus. Its construction is sim-
ple, its cost is low and its effi-
ciency and power factor are rea-
sonably good.
Single phase motors are more
costly, have lower efficiency and
power factor and are more com-
plicated due to the fact that
most of them are provided with
a commutator and brushes or
automatic means for changing
connections after the motor is
under way.
It may be a surprise to mam
to know that it is possible ti.
produce a single phase motor
which is better than the poly-
phase motor in most of its char-
acteristics. It is true that the
cost is higher due to the pres-
ence of a condenser, but it is
thought that this difference in
cost could be materially re-
duced by manufacturing the
condensers in quantities.
Description of the Motor
The circuits of an ordinary split phase motor are
shown in Figure 1. When the motor is starting
the switch S is closed and current flows in both of
the windings. The phase of the current is different
in the two windings due to the resistor R connect-
ed in series with one of them. As a matter of fact
a separate resistor is usually dispensed with and
PORF. B. F. BAILEY
the necessary resistance obtained by winding the
coil B with fine wire. The fact that the currents in
the two windings are out of phase produces an im-
perfect rotating magnetic field. This gives the
motor the necessary starting
torque. When sufficient speed
has been obtained the switch S
is opened automatically and the
motor thereafter operates with
the winding A alone carrying
current.
The connections of the con-
denser type split phase motor
are shown in Figure 2. The
windings A and B are placed 90"
from one another on the core.
Winding A is connected directly
across the line but the winding
B is connected in series with a
condenser. The condenser has
the effect of causing the current
in the phase B to lead that in
the phase A. By proper pro-
portioning of the condenser and
winding, the difference in phase
between the two windings can
be made almost exactly 90°.
This is, of course, the ideal con-
dition for efficient starting. It
cannot be obtained in the ordinary split phase
motor since both currents are lagging and the dif-
ference in phase between them is rarely more than
about 30°.
The condenser type motor has the further advan-
tage that since one current is lagging and the other
leading, the sum of the two is little more than that


March, 1926
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
of either current alone and the combined current
will be nearly in phase with the line voltage, in
other words the power factor at start is nearly
100%.
FIG. 1—CIRCUIT OF ORDINARY SPLIT PHASE MOTOR.
Starting Torque
If the condenser capacity in Figure 2 is varied
from a small value to a large one it will be found
that the torque will increase up to a certain ca-
pacity, beyond this point it will decrease. There
is, therefore, a certain capacity which will give the
maximum starting torque. This torque will be very
nearly the same as that which would be given by
the same motor operating from a two phase circuit.
It is, however, possible to obtain much greater
torque than this by winding the phase B with a
smaller number of turns of larger wire. This is of
course done at the expense of greater starting cur-
rent but almost any desired value of starting torque-
may be obtained in this way.
Running Characteristics
Unfortunately the capacity which gives the best
results in starting is too great for the best running
conditions. It is therefore necessary to connect the
motor as shown in Figure 3. While starting, the
switch S is closed. It is opened as soon as the
motor attains practically full running speed. This
opening can be done by means of an automatic
switch or the starting switch may have two posi-
tions, a starting position in which S is closed and
the running position in which S is open.
When the motor is in normal operation with the
proper value of capacitance, the voltages across the
windings A and B will be practically equal if the
number of turns in the two windings is the same.
The motor itself therefore acts almost exactly as if
it were a two phase motor and with practically the
same efficiency.
The power factor of the single phase condenser
type motor is however very much better than of a
two phase motor. This is due to the fact that while
the current in phase A is lagging that in B is lead-
ing. With the proper value of condenser capacity
the power factor can be made practically 100^-
through the range of the motor. Normally the cur-
rent will be leading at light load, in phase at about
normal full load and somewhat lagging for over
loads. By using somewhat more capacity the cur-
rent can be made to lead through the entire range
of the motor. This can be done at no additional
expense since more than enough capacity is avail-
able in any case.
Results of Tests
A standard two phase motor rated 1/2 horse-
power, 1800 r.p.m., 60 .cycles, 220 volts, was tested
both as a two phase motor and as a single phase
condenser motor. The two windings were identical.
It will be seen from Table I that as a single phase
motor the starting torque was 288% and as a two
phase motor 292%. The difference is slight and
may have been due to the fact that the motor was
somewhat warmer in one test than in the other.
The starting current was however only 13.3 amps,
single phase compared with 10.7 amps, per phase
equivalent to 21.4 amps, single phase. There was
also a slight reduction in the power required, the
single phase motor taking only 2928 watts com-
pared with 3400 watts in the two phase motor. The
starting efficiencies were respectively 36.6% and
28.3%. The power factor was unity in the case of
FIG. 2—SIMPLE CONDENSER CIRCUIT
the single phase motor and 74.6% in the case of the
two phase motor. Obviously the single phase motor
is decidedly better in starting characteristics than
the two phase motor. It must also be remembered

A UNIVERSAL TEST ENGINE
W. K. LAY
AUTOMOBILE manufacturers are beginning to
realize the value of research along fundamental
lines, the results of which may be ultimately applied
to the betterment of the motor vehicle. If we buy
a dollar's worth of gasoline for our vehicle, we are
really purchasing a certain quantity of potential
energy. When we contemplate the fact, that when
our car is driven at moderate speeds, on a good
highway, less than ten cents' worth of that energy
is actually utilized, we begin
to realize that there are still
possibilities for improve-
ment in such a machine. By
means of antifriction bear-
ings and accurate gearing
the losses in the transmis-
sion of the power has been
reduced to a minimum. The
great losses occur in the con-
version of our heat to me-
chanical energy.
Since our thermal effi-
ciency depends directly on
th'.- expansion ratio, it is
rather obvious that an in-
crease in expansion ratio
will improve that factor. In
a carburetted engine, how-
ever, the expansion ratio is
also the compression ratio.
A greater compression
means a higher compression
pressure and a denser mix-
ture which is not as badly
diluted with products of
combustion. All this brings
about a very rapid combus-
tion rate and gives rise to
detonation. This is objec-
tionable on the counts of noise, loss in power and
actual breakage of parts by the very high deton-
ation pressures. This year has seen a considerable
advance in design of the combustion chamber to
reduce this tendency toward detonation resulting
in a considerable increase in compression ratios for
automobiles. Chemical treatment of the fuel may
reduce its tendency to detonate and attain the same
end, an increase in the expansion ratio.
Thus, whether we attack the problem from the
standpoint of improving the engine to burn the fuel
or improving the fuel to be burned in the engine
it involves a careful studv of the effect of com-

pressiun ratio. Usually this has been done by
changing the cylinder head or pistons in a stock
engine. This requires a partial tear down of the
engine between tests with attendant changes in
adjustment which may seriously derange the test
results. By means of a specially designed test
engine this change of compression 'may be ac-
complished in a few seconds without stopping the
engine or in any way altering any other con-
dition of its operation.
Such an engine has been
in almost daily operation
since 1923 at the laboratory
of the National Advisory
Committee for Aeronautics
at Langley Field, Virginia.
The work done on this en-
gine and that of Ricardo in
England has opened up a
new field of research with
almost unlimited possibili-
ties. On this "Universal
Test" or "Rubber" engine as
it is commonly called the fol-
lowing events and conditions
of operation may be changed
to any reasonable value
while the engine is in opera-
tion:

2. Point in the cycle at
which the intake
valve begins to
open.
3. Point at which intake valve closes.
4. Lift of intake valve.
5. Point at which exhaust valve begins to open.
6. Point at which exhaust valve is closed.
7. Lift of exhaust valve.
8. Timing of fuel injection pump used in Diesel
cycle work.
The change in compression ratio is affected by
tiding the cylinder bodily in toward, or out from,
the crankcase. A large screw thread is cut on the
lower end of the cylinder and runs in a ring shaped
nut recessed into the crankcase. This nut may be
turned by means of a hand wheel and worm gear

i eduction to lower or raise the cylinder. When it
is in the desired position it may be clamped solidly
in place.
The arrangement of the valve mechanism is in-
genious. The overhead valves are operated
through rocker arms by a cam, that, like all Gaul,
is divided into three parts. The central portion is
keyed to the camshaft but the outer sections are
driven by means of a
spiral spline on a sleeve,
that in turn is driven by
a straight spline in its in-
terior. If this sleeve is
moved endwise it will ad-
vance its section of the
cam to cause the valve to
open earlier. In a similar
manner the other section
of the cam may be re-
tarded to close the valve
later. The lift of the valve
may be changed by slid-
ing the fulcrum endwise
along the rocker arm.
Veeder counters geared to
the control wheels are cal-
ibrated so that any of
these variables may be ad-
justed to any desired
value, as indicated by the
counter reading.
Aside from the variable
features just discussed
there are others worthy
of mention. Using four
valves located in the cyl-
inder head gives the larg-
est valve opening and the
smallest combustion
chamber wall area possi-
ble in any practical pop-
pet valve engine, thus
raising the volumetric and
thermal efficiency as high
as possible. With four
valves they are able to
have three holes for spark plugs and pressure indi-
cators. The water jacket of the cylinder head is
entirely separate from that of the cylinder
wall so that heat losses' from the combus-
tion chamber may be noted by temperatures of the
former and piston friction controlled by the latter.
The bore and stroke of this engine is the same as
that of the Liberty aircraft engine so that piston,
connecting rod and many other parts are standard
on the Liberty engine and replacement parts will
be easy to obtain. Using a single cylinder, no
\

trouble with distribution of equal changes of
fuel to different cylinders will be experienced and
any improvement in power or economy of the whole
engine is known to have originated in this cylinder
and may be studied by a single indicator. It might
be expected that such an engine would vibrate very
badly but it actually operates very smoothly be-
cause of the very heavy cylinder, crankcase, crank-
shaft and flywheel. Sum-
ming up we may say that
this engine is built for re-
search purposes only, to
study the principles in-
volved in the operation of
the internal combustion
engine.
It has been stated that
the obvious method of in-
creasing the efficiency of
our engine is to increase
the expansion or compres-
sion ratio and that the
phenomena of detonation
seems to be the principal
obstacle in our way. Let
us consider just what hap-
pens between the end of
the compression stroke
and the beginning of the
expansion o r working
stroke. The hydro-car-
bon fuel charge is very
quickly burned while the
piston is practically
standing still (at con-
stant volume) to form
carbon dioxide and water
vapor. Burning is usually
a progressive affair. If
you wish to burn a pile of
straw you may toss a
lighted match into it. The
lighted match heats some
of the straw immediately
around it to such a high
temperature it ignites.
The heat from this burning straw heats other
parts until they catch fire and though the
match flame soon goes out the fire con-
tinues to burn, spreading in every direction
until the whole is consumed. Now an ex-
plosion is merely a very rapid burning, good ex-
amples being the explosion of the powder in a rifle
barrel or the fuel and air mixture in the combustion
chamber of our internal combustion engine. In the
latter case the initial fire is started at the sparkplug.
A small particle of mixture at the sparkplug elec-

trodes is brought to the ignition temperature by
heat from the small electric arc. Heat from the
burning of the first particle heats the adjacent layer
of mixture to the ignition point and the flame
spreads as in case of the straw but with much
greater rapidity. Detonation may then be said to
be very rapid explosion, a common example of
which is the discharge of a can of nitro-glycerin.
FIG. 3—ASSEMBLY OF CAM SHAFT. BY ITS FLEXIBLE
CONTROL, THE CYCLE EVENTS MAY BE TIMED AT WILL.
Before going further with the question of deto-
nation let us carefully consider how the flame
travels in a normal explosion. Let us imagine the
fuel and air mixture to be compressed into a com-
bustion chamber whose section is ABCD, shown
at "a" in Figure 5. The compression pressure
may be 100 pounds per square inch. Let us divide
this mixture into ten equal parts. Each part occu-
pies 1/10 of the total volume and has a pressure
of 100 pounds per square inch. When the burning
has been completed the products of combustion re-
sulting from the burning of each part of the total
mixture will occupy the same volume but the pres-
sure will have increased to say 400 pounds per
square inch. Let us now ignite fuel and air mixture
simultaneously along the line AB. The flame will
spread to the right toward CD. At the time when
the first 1/10 has been burned, one-tenth of the
total energy in our charge will have been developed,
the average pressure of the resulting products of
combustion and the nine parts of fuel mixture will
be raised to 130 pounds per square inch, one-tenth
of the way to our final pressure of 400 pounds per
square inch. At the completion of the explosion
the products of burning our first part of fuel mix-
ture will occupy 1/10 of the total volume but at
this point in the process it is under a pressure of

only 130 pounds so it will expand until it occupies
400/130 x 1/10 or 31/100 of the total volume, crowd-
ing the nine parts of fuel mixture into 69/100 of
the total volume as shown in part "b" of Figure 5.
The point where the mixture is burning, the so-
called flame front is certainly between the burned
and unburned portions so it has moved 31/100 of
the distance from AB to CD. In like manner at
the time when two parts of the mixture have been
burned the products of combustion will occupy
50/100 of the total volume and the 8 parts of un-
burned mixture, 50/100 of the total volume and the
flame will have traveled 50/100 of the distance
across the combustion chamber as shown in part
"c" of the diagram. This action may be followed
up burning each tenth part of the original mixture
and noting the conditions of combustion products

THE FIRST TOOL IN RESEARCH—
A COMPREHENSIVE BIBLIOGRAPHY
By DONAL HAMILTON HAINES
IN the article on "The Vital Need for Greater
Financial Support to Pure Science Research" by
the Hon. Herbert Hoover, Secretary of Commerce,
which was printed in the January number of "The
Michigan Technic," there was a single passage of
the utmost significance to anyone concerned with
the progress of engineering research at any of the
great universities of the country. In the course of
his article, Secretary Hoover said:
"The day is gone by when we can depend very
much upon consequential discovery or invention be-
ing made by the genius in the garret. A host of
men, great equipment, long patient scientific experi-
ment to build up the structure of knowledge, not
stone by stone but grain by grain, is today the fun-
damental source of invention and discovery."
It is not only the statements themselves but the
inferences which must inevitably be drawn from
them which arrest the attention of the man vitally
interested in research, whether on the side of prac-
tical application to industrial problems, or on that
of pure science. While Secretary Hoover does not
make the assertion in specific words, he leaves one
to draw the conclusion that it is in the great
universities of the United States that we must look
for the greatest progress in scientific investigation.
Surely one is more apt to find at a great univer-
sity than anywhere else that combination of ele-
ments from which great results are to come in the
future—trained men, adequate equipment and that
comparative freedom rrom the pressure of some
form of economic necessity which gives time for
the "long, patient, scientific, experiment," particu-
larly if, as in Secretary Hoover's appeal, the empha-
sis is laid on the side of pure science.
On two counts—those of providing trained men
and ample time for thorough work—the advantages
of such an organization as the Department of En-
gineering Research of the University of Michigan
are too evident to call for emphatic restatement.
But in the matter of equipment—particularly one
essential of it—the University is especially well pro-
vided.
Even while recognizing the necessary complexity
of the equipment with which the investigator in
scientific fields must be provided, one is likely to
think of it largely in mechanical terms and lay too
little stress upon what is perhaps its first most es-
sential single element—the literature dealing with
the particular field of investigation in which a given
problem lies. With the steady and rapid increase
cf experimental work and investigations in all
branches of the scientific field, and the ever larger
number of facilities for publication offered to the
men doing such work, the bulk of such material and
its value are matters of almost daily increase.
In library facilities, the University of Michigan
is peculiarly fortunate. The Engineering Library,
housed in the East and West Engineering Building
and including the Architectural Library, contains
19,039 volumes, in addition to which more than 4000
volumes on Engineering and Architecture are on
the shelves of the General Library, while the Davis
Library of Highway Engineering and Highway
Transport occupies a room in the East Engineering
Building. It may be said with safety that there are
not five libraries in the entire country which can
provide superior facilities to the scientific investi-
gator—a statement borne out by the fact that two of
the largest industries in the State, the Detroit
Edison Company and the Parke-Davis Company,
both of which maintain large and well equipped
research departments, make constant use of the
University libraries.
The part played by books in the work of the man
embarked upon a search for truth in the field of
science is one of paramount importance, not merely
in the obvious sense in which the word of authority
is of value in any such pursuit of truth, but with a
peculiar significance closely connected with those
statements quoted above in regard to the "genius in
the garret" and the process of "building up, not
stone by stone but grain by grain."
Human progress produces similarly altered con-
ditions in fields as far apart as the poles. Less than
a century ago, a Michigan farmer could walk a hun-
dred yards from his own door and bring home
enough game for several meals without much waste
of time or ammunition. Today, starting from the
same point, he may walk a score of miles and come
home empty-handed without having fired a shot.
This difference carries no inference that the man
of the present is his forefather's inferior as a shot
or as a tracker of game, but simply that the game
is not there because of the enormously increased
number of humans engaged in its destruction.
There is a parallel, far-fetched though it may ap-
pear, in the altered position of the scientific investi-
gator. The day has passed when society can ex-
pect frequent discoveries and inventions of immense
importance and profound significance from men
working alone, not because these men are inferior


Page 11

cither in mental equipment or methods of work to
their predecessors, but because the progress of the
past few decades in scientific investigation and the
far larger number of trained men now giving all
their efforts to such work has narrowed the field to
such an extent that most of our individual searchers
must concentrate upon a detail instead of giving
their years to patient progress toward some vast,
half-understood but undiscovered law which will
make clear a hundred phenomena as yet inexplicable.
Their problems can not be stated in the terms which
were applicable for their prototypes of several gen-
erations ago. Their questions are not, "What is the
law back of these recognized but unexplained oc-
currences?" but, "Since this law explains why these
particular activities occur, what are the rules gov-
erning the consequences of its action in this par-
ticular case?"
In no form of human endeavor is it more essen-
tial to make full use of every short-cut which has
been provided by man's ingenuity, in none is the
element of time a more inexorable factor. There is
an absurd tale which illustrates the point perfectly.
A fussy and elderly gentleman of the early nine-
teenth century arrived finally at that state of afflu-
ence when he could build his own house—an ambi-
tion which he had cherished for years. He pur-
chased the ground for the site, then, after equipping
himself with a spy-glass, he wasted weeks scrambl-
ing over the surrounding hills, climbing trees, peer-
ing from the roofs of high buildings, until he had
squinted at the precious bit of ground from every
possible angle and every available point of vantage.
Then, when he had exhausted them, he marched
down to the chosen site and soberly laid the corner-
stone, absolutely convinced as the result of his ex-
haustive efforts that he had put it in exactly the
right spot! The chances are that the fussy old
gentleman was entirely correct in his choice; but
the significant aspect of his folly is that he might
have saved himself all those weeks of effort and
been just as sure of the result had he availed him-
self of other men's labors and profited by other
men's experience through the simple expedient of
leaving the decision to a trained architect.
The case of this absurd figure in the tale is al-
most precisely that in which the scientific investi-
gator would find himself had he to begin his labors
at the very beginning of the path worn through the
centuries by other men's feet, and not been able to
start from the firm ground well along the way
which they had provided for him. No figure could
be more tragic than that of a man who devoted the
best years of his life to the solution of a given prob-
lem, only to find, when his endeavors had been
crowned with success and he was ready to give the
results to the public, that the thing had already
been done by another, and that the record had been
plain for him to read had he only known that it
existed.
But owing to the peculiar nature of his situation,
the mere existence of a mass of literature on the
subject is not a sufficient aid for the man about to
set out upon an adventure into the uncharted re-
gions of science. It is not enough of a short cut
for his busy feet to be told that a given book or
article exists, or even that he be provided with a
library-card and the knowledge that a pleasant
young woman is waiting behind the desk to give
him her assistance. He must have more exact, more
t:me—and labor-saving help.
Of course the obvious help in such case is the
bibliography. Progress in the field of scientific
library cataloguing and management has reached
a point where it is almost impossible to find a sub-
ject on which some bibliography, more or less ex-
haustive in nature, has not been prepared and made
available. But the average bibliography has its
limits, (matters of far greater moment to the scien-
tist than to his fellow-worker in some other field.)
A consciousness of this ever present need for the
making of an even more efficient labor-saving de-
vice of this nature has led the Department of En-
gineering Research to undertake the preparation of
bibliographies which should be in the fullest sense
of the word "scientific," in their nature and in their
construction as well as in their subject matter and
in the purpose for which they were designed. It
was felt that the defects of the ordinary bibliography
were not inherent, and that they might be elimi-
nated. An effort at this elimination of defects has
been made, with results of a satisfactory nature, as
will be revealed by a somewhat detailed examina-
tion of one of them.
One of the recent bibliographies on which the
Department has been engaged was an "Investiga-
tion of Stainless Steels." At the time the bibliog-
raphy was completed, exhaustive investigations on
the literature relating to the subject revealed the
fact that there were in existence no fewer than one
hundred and twenty-three different articles, pub-
lished during a period of thirty-three years, between
1892 and 1925.
A mere list of these publications, with the titles,
names of the authors, books or periodicals in which
they appeared and the dates of printing is evidently
of very considerable use, and yet of limited availa-
bility and help for the man whose days are worth
too much an hour to be dissipated in the thumbing
of catalogues and the investigation of library shelves.
The amplification of such a list by brief three- or
four-line abstracts of each article or book is a dis-
tinct step in advance. It enables the investigator to
determine with some degree of accuracy the gen-
eral nature of a given work, but it performs no more

BOILER WATER CONDITIONING
The Special Problems Presented by High Operating Pressures and Corrosion
By R. E. HALL, Ph. D. °
WHEN the criterion for control of scale preven-
tion on the evaporating surfaces is made the
conditions in the concentrated boiler water, then
this control becomes an exact operation amenable
to an accuracy commensurate with all other opera-
tions in the boiler room. The responsibility in
boiler water conditioning, however, includes more
than clean surfaces. Corrosion in feed lines, econ-
omizers and the boiler is a function of the condi-
tion of the water, and must be controlled. Steam
line and turbine blading deposits must be obviated
by the system of conditioning. By the chemical
treatment employed, the
amount and character of non-
condensable gases in the steam
must be controlled in accord-
ance with the intended use of
the steam. All in all, the
responsibility in boiler water
conditioning ends not with the
entrance of the water into the
boiler but with the passage
from the boiler nozzle of steam,
the dryness and purity of
which are defined by the uses
to be made thereof.
Consideration of the scope
of the boiler water conditioning
leads to the following outline of its problems:
(a) Prevention of scale formation on surfaces
(1) In contact with water but at which
no evaporation occurs.
(2) At which evaporation is occurring.
(b) Prevention of corrosion on surfaces (1)
and (2) of (a).
(c) Selection of chemical treatment on the
basis of non-condensable gases that are
permissible in the steam.
(d) The control of sludges and soluble salts
in the boiler water.
(e) The removal of entrained moisture from
the steam.
Prevention of Scale Formation on Evaporating
Surfaces
The following expression serves as a general cri-
terion for the elimination of scale formation on the
evaporating surfaces:
ELECTRIC power is the one im-
portant commodity whose pride
has remained stationary or been
lowered in the last ten years. The
development of the central station,
which has made this possible, is an
epicin the utilization of materials. The
power station boilers, the largest
which the ingenuity of man has yet
devised, owe no small part of their
hitherto unattainable thermal effi-
ciency to the elimination of scale by
proper conditioning of the feed water.
With cheap power, human drugery is
lightened and the work of men like
Dr. Hall takes on a larger meaning
of service to mankind.

cal used in treatment (b) concentration of
sulphate (SO4) in the
boiler water.
This expression makes no limitations regarding
the type of feed water to be used or as to the
methods of conditioning which will be employed.
It makes no specifications whatever regarding the
methods which will be used for removing any
sludges produced. It is a generalized statement
of the fact that the two major factors to be consid-
ered in prevention of scale
formation on the evaporating
surfaces are operating pres-
sure and the sulphate concen-
tration in the boiler water.
Two principles governing ad-
herent scale formation on the
evaporating surfaces must be
recognized in order to define
the term, chemical' used in
treatment.
1. The adherent scales which
grow in thickness are formed
by deposition from the boiler
water directly on the surfaces
where found when the boiler
is opened. This may be called deposition in situ.
There are three substances which deposit from
the boiler water in this manner, namely, calcium
sulphate, calcium and magnesium silicate.
2. The solubility of substances which form ad-
herent scales decrease with temperature increase;
vice versa, those substances which separate from
the boiler water as sludge increase in solubility with
temperature increase.
Therefore, the chemical used in the final condi-
tioning of the boiler water must be one that if main-
tained at the concentration defined by the operating
pressure and the amount of sulphate present in the
boiler water, prevents the formation of any calcium
sulphate or calcium and magnesium silicate at the
evaporating surfaces, and insures the separation of
sludge forming substances only.
This discussion has to do only with the final con-
ditioning of the boiler water, and consideration will
be given to but two substances which meet the re-
quirements noted above, namely, sodium carbonate
(Na2CO3, soda ash) and sodium phosphate


Page 13

(NasPO4). Sodium carbonate and phosphate have
been specified because they can be purchased in the
market more cheaply than other carbonates or phos-
phates. It must be recognized, however, that they
are used because of their available carbonate (CO3)
and phosphate (PO4) content, and that other than
their sodium compounds, as for example their potas-
sium compounds, might be used if they were cheap-

er or if a special reason existed, for their use, (as
for instance, in the use of barium carbonate
(BaCO,).
Regardless of any pretreatment which may have
been given to the feed water, the essential relation
to maintain in the boiler water is expressed thus
when soda ash is used for the purpose.
CO3 = K, (at operating pressure p) x SO4.
If sodium phosphate is used, then the expression
becomes
PO4 = K2
i
(at operating pressure p) x SO4 2 x
In these expressions, CO3, PO4 and SO4 are pref-
erably measured in parts per million though grains
per gallon may be used as well. Kt and K., are
specific for CO3 and l'O4 respectively, and are con-
stants for a definite operating pressure p, but vary
with variations of the operating pressure. D refers
to the relation of ionic to total SO4 in the boiler
water and is a function of the operating pressure
and of concentration of SO4. As an example of the
application of these criteria at the operating pres-
sure of 150 Ibs. gage
KJ = 8.83 x 10-2
Thus if the sulphate concentration in the boiler wa-
ter is 1000 p.p.m, the concentration of CO3 therein
must be slightly more than 88 p.p.m., etc.
For the use of phosphate at this operating pres-
sure
K2 = 1.64 x 10-1
when concentrations are expressed as parts per mil-
lion.
For a concentration of 1000 p.p.m. of SO4,
D^O.65; for 2000 p.p.m. of SO4, D = 0.59.
Substituting these values in the general equa-
tion for the use of phosphate, we find that for
a concentration of 1000 p.p.m. of SO4 in the boiler

water, the essential concentration of PO4 necessary
to prevent adherent scale formation is' slightly more
than 4 p.p.m. and for 2000 p.p.m. of SO4 slightly
more than 11 p.p.m. Simple types of apparatus are
described for the determination of SO4, PO4 and
CO3 in the boiler room.
The Relation Between Chemical Used in Treatment
and Operating Pressure

pends upon keeping a definite supply of CO3 in the
boiler water. At boiler temperatures, however,
soda ash decomposes according to the reaction
Na2CO3 + H2O = 2 NaOH + CO2
and the rate of its decomposition is a function of
the operating pressure, and the rating at which the
boiler is operated. These two, therefore, in con-
junction with the concentration of SO4 in the raw

make-up water, and blowdown practice are the ele-
ments which control the feasibility or infeasibility
of maintaining the necessary CO., concentration.
Thus higher operating pressures are characterized
by more rapid decomposition of CO.,; and at the
same time by the necessity for maintaining higher
CO3 concentration since the value of K, is greater
at higher than at lower operating pressures. In a
I oiler operating at low rating, it may be possible to
maintain the necessary amount of CO3 in the boiler
CORROSION UNDER SULPHATE SCALE
water while in the same boiler at high rat-
ing, the more rapid decomposition of CO3
may render such maintenance impractical un-
less blowdown of uneconomical proportions is
resorted to. The basic cause for these trouble-
some limitations in the use of soda ash lies wholly
in its decomposition into caustic soda and car-
bon dioxide. Also apart from the uncertainty from
maintaining satisfactory CO3 concentrations, the
high caustic alkalinity developed in this decompo-
sition makes it impossible at higher operating pres-
sures to keep within the alkalinity-sulphate ratio
recommended in the proposed boiler code as insur-
ance against embrittlement. The remedy lies in
the substitution for COS of a substance satisfactory
from the standpoint of scale prevention and entirely
stable at the operating pressures. It has been one
of the most pleasing developments of this investi-
gation to establish the proof that PO4 gives beau-
tiful results on the side of scale prevention and that
the total alkalinity necessary in the boiler water
can easily be kept well within the limits recom-
mended from the standpoint of caustic embrittle-
ment.
A satisfactory and economical answer to the com-
plete conditioning of water for high pressure ope-
ration may be given as follows:
If the make-up water is evaporated and the only
impure water entering the boiler consists of the
condenser leakage, then the conditioning of the
boiler water with phosphate is the only chemical
control necessary. If the make-up water is not
evaporated and is of some magnitude, then economy
demands the pretreatment—with lime and soda ash
for any water or by a base exchange process if the
water is not high in temporary hardness—followed
by the final conditioning of the boiler water with
phosphate. In the pretreatment, however, any addi-
tion whatever of excess chemical must be avoided
else detrimental concentrations of caustic alkalinity
will develop in the boiler water. If it is deemed
desirable to limit the amount of soluble solids in
the boiler water, and the feed water is one that con-
tains sulphate, a variation in pretreatment may be
made by using barium carbonate in place of sodium
carbonate, thus removing much of the sulphate as
well as the calcium. In any event, however, the
final control of the boiler water must be based on
the use of a suitable substance such as phosphate.
Prevention of Scale Formation on Feed Water
Lines and Preheating Sections
The problem of scale prevention is much simpler
on these surfaces than on the evaporating surfaces
since (1) there is only one main constituent in these
scales, namely, calcium carbonate (CaCO3), (2) de-
position of insoluble solid material occurs by rea-
son of supersaturation throughout the body of the
water and not at the surfaces alone as in the case
where evaporation is occurring, and (3) no decom-
position of the chemical used in treatment occurs.
In order to prevent scale formation on these sur-
faces, it is necessary that no bicarbonate (HCO3)
remains in the water, and it is advisable that a
small concentration of caustic soda (NaOH) and
loose crystals of suspended calcium carbonate be
present. This condition may be maintained in a
water which has been correctly treated externally
or by using the excess caustic alkalinity in the boiler
water itself. The latter control involves recircu-
lating water from the boiler through the feed lines
or the preheating sections.
The Prevention of Corrosion on the Surfaces in
Contact with the Feed or Boiler Water
On the basis of experiments which are described
under this heading, it is concluded that in general
any corrosion of the boiler system surfaces in con-
tact with water is electrochemical in character. An-
odic conditions in the metal develop from differen-
tial oxygen concentration, especially in feed lines
i'.nd economizer tubes, from impurities in contact
with the metal (as mill scale) or from a state of
strain or local differences of temperature. The con-
trol of corrosion, therefore, signifies so conditioning
the water that at any anodes which may develop,
passage of current generated results not in the dis-
solution of the boiler metal but in the discharge at
the anode of some component in the boiler water.
It is our belief based on experimental work and
operating control now in progress (1) that hydrox-
ide (OH) is specific in this respect as regards

TAU BETA Pi—WHAT IT MEANS
By A. D. MOORE
BETWEEN the time when The Editor of the
Technic asked me to write something about
Tau Beta Pi, and the writing of it, I have been
somewhat at a loss as to what to say. After think-
ing it over, it appears that there are perhaps two
principal points of justification for taking up some
space in these pages. One of them derives from the
A. D. MOORE, NATIONAL PRESIDENT, TAU BETA PI.
fact that many students, mainly underclassmen,
know less of Tau Beta Pi than they should; the
other revolves about some recent reorganization
experiences which may, if passed on, be helpful to
other student organizations.
When Professor Edward H. Williams started
Tau Beta Pi at Lehigh in 1885, his action followed
swiftly upon his realization that Phi Beta Kappa
did not care to recognize engineering students. In
general, Phi Beta Kappa still recognizes merit
gained only in Literature, the Arts, and the Sci-
ences; and no doubt she has made a wise decision
in sticking to this policy. Founder Williams (still
alive and active) decided that engineers should
have their own society for recognition, but that not
only should merit be honored with the giving of a
badge,—the society and its chapters should also
engage in active support of those movements in
technical education which tend to develop broader
and better engineers.
The preamble to the constitution is significant:
"To mark in a fitting manner those who have con-
ferred honor upon their Alma Mater by a high
grade of scholarship as undergraduates, or by their
attainments as alumni; and to foster a spirit of
liberal culture in the engineering schools of Amer-
ica." It is very likely true that it was a lack of
liberal culture in the engineering students which
JOHN ROSS, EDITOR OF "THE BENT."
kept them from being blessed by Phi Beta Kappa;
and although I do not know this to be a fact, I
suspect that Founder Williams inserted the "liberal
culture" clause with a full realization of the de-
fects of the usual engineering training, and an in-
tent to create an organization capable of exerting
a corrective-influence.
As the foregoing thought bears directly on the
question of elections, I may well treat that subject
row. No student is considered for membership
unless his grades place him in the upper fourth of
his class. However, that is but the first require-
ment; it merely determines the list of eligibles. It
is perfectly evident that one who has merely gotten
into the upper quarter of his class has reflected no
particular honor upon his Alma Mater. Some, but
not much. Now, if the chapter to which he is eli-
gible is to make any headway whatever in fostering
liberal culture, the elected man must be able to
contribute more than his scholastic standing; he
must bring with him some of the elements, attri-

butes, interests, or. abilities of the man, who be-
sides being good technically, has humanistic in-
stincts and the unselfish makeup necessary to their
effective liberation.
If a man stands very high scholastically and has
no objectionable traits that would render him unfit
for unselfish cooperation in the life of the chapter,
he is very likely to be elected, even if he has little
else to recommend him. Those standing midway
in the eligible list are very closely scrutinized, and
compared one with another. Of course, the man
who has served his college in any of the several
lines of activities that are worth-while, is far more
likely to be admitted than one with a similar stand-
ing who has done nothing but make grades. Why?
Because the first man shows evidence of extra abil-
ity and of unselfishness; moreover, he is likely to be
much better known. No matter how worthy an
eligible student may be, if he is almost unknown to
his classmates who are already in Tau Beta Pi, he
has no right to expect the chapter to take a chance
on him. Those eligibles who support themselves
and have therefore been unable to do anything for
their Alma Mater but to study, are given full credit
for their efforts. Men low in the list must be out-
standing in some respect, in order to be considered
at all.
I have talked rather frankly here, one reason
being that I can see no good reason for doing other-
wise. No doubt many eligible students have silent-
ly wondered why they were not elected to Tau Beta
Pi, when some classmates, seemingly no better,
were. Perhaps the above may serve to explain.
Changing the subject to reorganization, I will
repeat the reason back of saying anything here
about it. Most large schools and many small ones
are over-run with campus organizations, most of
which are ineffective. Probably all the readers of
the Technic are members of one or more such or-
ganizations. A brief resume of some experience
may- therefore be helpful. Beginning with the
national end of things, we now find the Executive
Council of Tau Beta Pi, except for its Secretary-
Treasurer, concentrated in Ann Arbor. The mem-
bers of the Council here are Professor Harold H.
Higbie, Professor Clarence T. Johnston, and the
writer. Up until something over a year ago, our
Council was scattered to the four winds; it was
lequired that no two Councillors should be of the
same place. Worse yet, every year a new man was
elected and an old member retired. It was impos-
sible for the Council to get together to discuss the
several pressing problems that changing conditions
brought about. The first major step in the right
direction was the passing of a bill which concen-
trated the Council and gave one body of men simul-
taneous terms of office of three years. With Coun-
cil meetings thus made possible, the accumulated
problems of the last twenty years, as our revered
President Burton used to put it, were taken up.
It was soon seen that Tau Beta Pi's publication,
the Bent, was inadequate. By the way, John Ross
has been editor of the Bent for several years now.
He first graduated here in Engineering, and this
February finished in Law. Ross took up the reins
after the Bent had suspended publication during the
war, and has done some mighty effective work.
But the Bent was and is a quarterly, whereas the
Council felt a pressing need for frequent contact
with the chapters and the active membership. So
this fall, beginning with October, a new Bulletin
was created and issued. It is a simple two-or-four-
sheet bulletin, sent to the active men and addressed
wholly to them. The Bulletin appears monthly.
It carries articles of the moment, most of them in-
tended to stimulate chapter activity; and it serves
to remind chapters frequently of things it is neces-
sary for them to do as the year goes by. With
the Bulletin on its feet, we found it possible to turn
the quarterly Bent into an alumni publication, to
cut it down and cheapen it. The result is a big
increase in effectiveness all around and a big sav-
ing in costs.
Many campus organizations suffer because of the
short time any one member remains on the grounds.
It is a usual thing for seniors to be elected to some
organization, and just when they have learned what
it is all about, they graduate. Therein lies a vital
weakness. It was one of the defects in Tau Beta
Pi, until a change in rules made it easily possible
to elect, at the beginning of the Junior year, from
one to three high men. These men will be with
the chapter for two years, and the methods and
procedure they pick up in their first year make
them invaluable as senior members. Waldo
Greiner and Curt Will are examples. Both were
elected to the presidency of the chapter here. This
same principle of necessary continuity is carried
out more broadly by the election of juniors from
the upper eighth of the class in the second semes-
ter. Thus, if all seniors should graduate and go
away, there is a nucleus left to start the next year
with.
As to what Tau Beta Pi is doing nationally, aside
from internal reorganization (much of which has
not been mentioned here), I shall only mention the
work on the Honor Codes of engineering colleges.
It is striking that, so far as the writer can find out at
least, there are no statistics available on the con-
dition of the Honor System nationally. Through
our forty-eight chapters, located in most of the
principal engineering schools, the Executive Coun-
cil is making a survey, and some extremely inter-
esting material already is at hand. Only eight or
ten schools have been heard from, but from these
ontinued on

NOTES ON THE DEMONSTRATION OF
SYNCHRONOUS VIBRATION AND CRITICAL SPEED
By R. T. LIDDICOAT
FOR a number of years I have attempted to
demonstrate Synchronous Vibration and Criti-
cal Speed to my Engineering Mechanics 3 classes.
In the belief that this may be of interest to others
I am offering this article. Before explaining the
demonstration I shall attempt to summarize the
underlying theory.
At the outset it may be well to state that simple
harmonic motion is motion in which the acceleration
is proportional to the displacement and opposite in
sign. Expressed algebraically a = w2s, where a is
the acceleration in feet per second and w is a con-
stant representing the uniform angular velocity of
a point on a reference circle, the radius of which
is the maximum displacement of the point having
S. H. M. While the reference point travels around
the circle its projection on the diameter has S. H. M.
In the above s is a variable, representing the dis-
placement of the point having S. H. M. from the
center of its path in feet.
Most materials in engineering are elastic within
the limits used, that is, stress is proportional to
strain. A beam, a shaft, a bridge will be displaced
under load, each developing a resisting force which
is proportional to the displacement. If the load is
suddenly removed, the accelerating force, and there-
fore, the acceleration of the mass of the beam, shaft,
or bridge is proportional to the displacement and
each will vibrate with S. H. M. Practically all
engineering structures have this natural frequency
of vibration when disturbed.
In the illustration, shaft C is supported by a
flexible bar A, with a self aligning bearing B. F is
a ring which limits the amplitude of vibration of
the shaft C. Bearing G is self aligning, and univer-
sal H improves alignment of the driving motor K;
flexible shaft M operates tachometer L; rheostat N
is used to vary the speed of the motor. Flexible
support A has a natural frequency of vibration
which we can measure with a calibrated tuning
lork P. Tuning fork and flexible support A when
set in vibration scratch a series of waves on smoked
paper S as it is pulled along. The tuning fork P
makes two thousand vibrations per minute and
thus by counting waves between similar points on
the wave series the frequency of the flexible support
can be calculated.
Wheel D is out of static balance, that is, its
center of gravity is not on the axis of rotation.
When shaft C is rotated a centrifugal force is set
up due to wheel D being out of balance. This
centrifugal force is up during part of a revolution
and down during part of a revolution, causing sup-
port A to vibrate. The rotative speed of the shaft
is indicated at all times by tachometer L. As this
speed approaches the natural frequency of vibration
of support A, the amplitude of vibration builds up,
reaching a maximum when the rotative speed of
shaft C is the same as the natural frequency of
vibration of the support A. As the speed of the
shaft is increased, we pass through a speed at
which the lateral amplitude of vibration of support
A is a maximum. As the speed of the shaft is
increased again the amplitude of vibration dies
down until the vibration is practically nil at very
high speeds. By the use of the tuning fork, the
frequency of lateral vibration of support A is found
to be the same as the rotative speed when the ampli-
tude of lateral vibration, mentioned above, is at a
maximum.
The tuning fork could have been dispensed with,
since this natural frequency can be found by equat-
ing the restoring force to the accelerating force.
The restoring force is proportional to the displace-
ment, or F = Ks, where F is the restoring force
and K is the proportionality factor. If s is in feet
and F in pounds, K must be the force in pounds
necessary to produce a displacement of one foot at
the point where the vibrating mass can be con-
sidered concentrated. The force absorbed by the
accelerating mass is W &lt;u2s where W is the weight of
K
the vibrating body and g is 32.2 feet per second per
second. Equating forces K s = W &lt;o 2s cancelling

K = W «)J Then « X 60 is the natural frequency,

in vibrations per minute.
Assuming that the shaft in the above demon-
stration does not deflect and that all the deflection
comes from the elastic support; assuming also, that
the elastic support vibrates with S. H. M., having
an amplitude of vibrations, it is found that the maxi-
mum force distorting the elastic support A will be

In the above formula W, is the weight of part of

the vibrating support. u&gt;2 is the angular velocity of
the rotating shaft C. W2 is the portion of the
weight of the rotating shaft carried by support A,
and h is the amount that the center of gravity of the
rotating shaft is off the axis of rotation. The re-
storing force will be K s, as before explained.

SPEEDS AND SYNCHRONOUS VIBRATION.
Equating distorting force to restoring force and
solving for displacement we get
W2 o,,2 h

K-(W,
g
Since W, + W2 is the vibrating weight, the de-
nominator of the above equation will be zero when
«&gt;, is the &lt;o of natural frequency of vibration; and s,
the displacement of the support A will be infinite.
Of course, after building up a comparatively large
amplitude, the conditions change. At very high
speeds the denominator becomes large and nega-
tive; therefore, s becomes small and negative, mean-
ing that it is opposite to h; that is, the center of
gravity of the shaft is below the axis of rotation,
when support A is in its upper position. Just below
this natural frequency the denominator just men-
tioned is small and positive; hence, s is large and
positive, that is, when the center of gravity of the
shaft is above the axis of rotation, support A is in
its upper position. This is demonstrated by a
colored slip of paper E, in the illustration, which is
colored red on the side of the center of gravity and
blue on the side of the shaft opposite the center of
gravity. The relative position of the center of
gravity is established by placing a bolt in the bal-
anced wheel D. At a rotative speed of the shaft
below the natural frequency of support A the center
of gravity is thrown out and we see a red fringe
around the shaft at E and a blue core; at a speed
of the shaft above the natural frequency of support
A we see a blue fringe and a red core indicating
that the center of gravity is thrown in.
Another phase of vibration illustrated with this
apparatus is Critical Speed. This is a vibration, or
whipping, of the shaft itself. For this experiment
bearing B replaces limiting ring F. Limiting ring
F takes the position of bearing B, its purpose being
to prevent the apparatus from flying apart. A
metal marker is attached to the right end of the
shaft C and by the use of the tuning fork P and
smoked paper S, we obtain the natural frequency
of vibration of shaft C supported as explained and
carrying wheel D.
Motor K is started up, tachometer L indicating
the rotative speed of shaft C. The shaft rotates
smoothly at first starting to vibrate or whip as the
speed increases until it starts to pound the limit-
ing ring at a rotative speed that corresponds to the
natural frequency of the shaft for this condition of
support. Then the speed is increased and the whip-
ping decreases until at very high speeds the shaft
runs very smoothly and the whipping is practically
eliminated.
Assuming that the supports in the above dem-
onstration do not deflect and that all of the deflec-
tion is in the shaft, the centrifugal force distorting
the shaft will be
W
G,2 (h + S)
g
where W is a portion of the weight of the rotating
mass to the right of newly placed bearing B, &lt;D is
the angular velocity of the shaft, h is the amount
that the center of gravity of weight W is originally
off the axis of rotation, and s is the displacement
of the shaft from its axis of rotation. .It is to be
understood that part of the shaft to the right of
bearing B does not whip materially and therefore,
skill is required in choosing W. Equating this
distorting force to the restoring force K s and solv-
ing for s, the displacement of the center of the shaft
from the axis of rotation, we get
Wu,2h
g
s —
K — W a,2

When the rotative speed of the shaft is the same
as the natural frequency of vibration of the shaft,
the denominator in the above equation will be zero
and s will be infinite. Of course conditions change
when the amplitude of whip becomes relatively
large and we have a limiting ring to limit the am-
plitude. Just below the natural frequency the de-
nominator in the above equation is small and pos-

LABOR SAVING IN TUNNELING
Mucking Machines and Drill Cars
By D. W. BRUNTON, Consulting Engineer, Muff at Tunnel
AMERICAN distaste for back-breaking labor has
led to many inventions. Tunneling for cen-
turies was laborious, dangerous, uninviting. Only
crudest methods and tools were employed until
power drills and explosives were used in rock, and
power-driven shields in soft ground. Explosives
have been made safer and more powerful. Com-
pressed air has been introduced to exclude water
which would
otherwise come
in through the
interstices o f
the ground.
Metal and ma-
sonry tunnel
linings have
been improved
and machinery
invented for
placing them.
W i t h engines
and boilers
came steam
drills, then
drills driven by
compressed air,
and finally elec-
tric drills. Com-
pressed air
drills, however,
do most of the
tunneling today. Tunnels are now ventilated by
power-driven fans and blowers. Electricity has
made good lighting possible. Electric and com-
pressed air locomotives have supplanted the patient
mule and the push-man. Surveying instruments
and methods, too, have advanced remarkably. Tun-
nels can now be driven for long distances from por-
tals or shafts, on straight lines or curves, or with
angles, and the "headings" will meet exactly. Con-
sequently, tunneling has become much more expe-
ditious and economical, making feasible great im-
provements in alinement and grade of railways,
highways and aqueducts. For great waterway
crossings, tunnels have been preferred to bridges.
(See footnote.)
In rock tunneling, holes 2 to 3 inches in diameter
are first drilled in suitable number and directions,
then, in proper sequence, loaded with explosives
and "shot." The rock is broken out and thrown in

must stand to begin the next "round."
Drills, although much lighter than a few years
ago, still are heavy. They have to be mounted on
heavy steel columns, bars, or tripods. After the
holes have been drilled, the machines have to be
dragged out of range of damage. Then as soon as
enough of the "muck" has been cleared away, the

ment has to be

has been gained by experience and partial failures.
On the Moflfat tunnels now being driven through
James Peak of the Rocky Mountains, near Denver,
for railroad and water supply, the engineers took
advantage of all recent advances and went a few
steps further. A practical and efficient muck-
ing machine has been developed and installed and
great improvements made in methods of drilling.
The rate at which broken rock at a heading could
be loaded into cars has heretofore been the limiting
factor in tunneling. Where speed was desirable
and hand mucking was employed, it was common
practice to level the top of the muck, mount the

drills on a crossbar and drill the holes in the
upper half of the face while standing on the muck.
By the time this was done, the muck would be so
nearly cleared that the drills could be taken down
and the remaining muck thrown back so that drill-
ing could be begun on the lower half, either by
lowering the cross' bar or putting up columns.
With mechanical muckers reducing at least 60%
the time to clear the muck, when the drills were
ready to begin operation, the mucking machine
would be removing the muck on which the drillers
were standing. Therefore, it was economy not to
begin drilling until the muck was entirely cleared,
when it was possible to lay track up to the face and
thus avoid carrying the drills into the heading and
setting them up by hand. The drills are now perma-
nently mounted on a heavy car, which also carries
the manifold air and water pipes for each drill, and
can be pushed into the face by an electric locomo-
tive, clamped into position and drilling commenced
in from fifteen to eighteen minutes.
This, however, is not the sum total of advantages.
Under the old system the drillers were usually tired
before they began drilling. Under the new system
the men begin drilling while they are still fresh,
take greater interest in that work and make better
speed. While men had to do such back-breaking
work, when they accumulated a few hundred dol-
lars, they quit the job. With introduction of muck-
ing machine and drill car the men were no longer
forced to do hard manual labor, but had merely to
look after and operate machines. To most men,
especially Americans, this is a congenial occupa-
tion. Hence, "turnover" has almost disappeared.
As the men remain for longer periods, they become
more expert. The net result has been greatly to
cheapen and expedite the work. Thus has a new
invention improved a whole chain of interlocking
operations in tunneling through rock.
A Research Narrative of the Engineering Foundation. O
SPLIT PHASE MOTOR
Continued from page 6
that the starting torque of the single phase motor
could easily have been doubled had it been desira-
ble to do so. In case less starting torque were
satisfactory, more turns could be used on the wind-
ing B and the starting current very much reduced.
Running Characteristics
It will be seen from Table II that the efficiency
of the two motors is practically identical. This is
to be expected since the single phase motor is really
operating with two phase current, and the power
wasted in the condenser is practically zero. In
power factor however the single phase motor is
very much better, the improvement varying from
55% at light loads to 26% at full load.
The only point in which the single phase motor
suffers by comparison by the two phase is in pull
out torque, the figures being respectively 612% and
295%. It would, however, be easy to raise this
value for the single phase motor by using slightly
greater condenser capacity.
Weight
If we compare the condenser motor with the split
phase motor it is obvious that the former will carry
more load since both windings are active all the
FIG. 3—VARIABLE CAPACITANCE CIRCUIT.
time. The condenser motor will therefore weigh
less than the split phase motor although this dif-
ference will be more than offset by the weight of
the condenser.
Reliability
It is thought that this motor should be more reli-
able than either the split phase type or the repul-
sion start-induction run type of single phase motor.
It would be better than the former due to the fact
that the starting winding is much less likely to
burn out, since it is wound with much heavier wire.
The condenser type motor should be more reliable
than the repulsion start-induction run motor since
it does not require a commutator or brushes. The
rotor would normally be of the squirrel cage type
although there is no reason why a wound rotor
should not be used if desirable.
Noise
The condenser type motor is somewhat quieter
in operation than either of the other types men-
tioned although the difference is not probably very
great. Anyone who has tried the experiment of
opening one phase of a polyphase motor knows
that the hum of the motor increases noticeably,
when running single phase. The difference is due
to the more uniform rotating field of the polyphase
motor. As compared with the repulsion start-in-
duction run type of motor, the noise of the brushes
during starting is of course absent and during run-


Page 21
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
ning there should be less magnetic hum, and also
less noise from the smooth squirrel cage rotor than
we normally get from the wound rotor of the repul-
sion start induction run motor.
Application to Elevators
The condenser type single phase motor possesses
qualities which render it particularly applicable to
elevator work. Single phase motors have not been
successful in this field largely due to the fact that
the ordinary type of single phase motor cannot be
reversed at full speed. The motor must be allowed
to come to rest due to friction, and then a change
of connections or a shift of brushes is made and
the motor can be started in the reverse direction.
This and other defects are so serious that when
it is absolutely necessary to operate an elevator
from a single phase line it is customary to provide
a direct current elevator motor. This is supplied
with power from a direct current generator which
in turn is driven by a single phase alternating cur-
rent motor. This scheme is obviously costly and
consumes a great deal of energy since the single
phase motor and its generator must run all the time
providing the elevator is to be available for service.
The condenser type single phase motor operates
much like a two phase motor and therefore can
be applied directly to the elevator.
We are now having built a 7J4 horsepower ele-
vator motor which will be thoroughly tested and
if successful placed in actual service.
Patents
The motor as described above is rather costly,
due to the large condenser capacity required. Ap-
plications have been made for patents upon various
changes which will greatly reduce the cost of the
motor for many applications. It would however
be undesirable to describe these in detail at the
present time.
Conclusion
In spite of the fact that this motor, at least with
present prices of condensers, costs more than other
types of single phase motors it is thought that its
improved characteristics, particularly its much bet-
ter power factor, may justify its use in many appli-
cations.

than half the task, because it is strictly impersonal
and unbiased epitome of what has been written; it
does not and can not exercise any selective faculty.
Here is perhaps one defect in the average bibli-
ography which is available for use which may be
called inherent. In the majority of cases, there is
no opportunity to make these three-line synopses
anything more than what they are, for the excellent
reason that the man or women who has "briefed"
them does not possess the qualifications which al-
low him to be discriminating.
It was therefore felt that perhaps the first requisite
of a thoroughly adequate bibliography is that it
should be prepared by someone whose knowledge
of the subject matter is as thorough and extensive
as his familiarity with accepted methods of sum-
marization, and who could perform his task with a
guarantee of intelligent discrimination.
As a result of this effort, the Department has
produced in connection with its reports on problems
brought to it for investigation, "scientific" bibliog-
raphies which comprise,—
1. A several page review of the findings in
important articles. This review may be
from one to twenty pages in length. It
is the portion of the bibliography which
it is expected that the busy person in-
terested in the subject matter will read.
2. A half page summary, at the least, of the
important articles.
3. A very brief and succinct summary, not
more than three or four lines in length,
making no attempt at evaluation, and
printed immediately beneath the chrono-
logical list, making it unnecessary to turn
the page.
The very complete nature of this "three-ply"
method of bibliography making may be more
readily understood from an example taken from the
bibliography of the report on the Investigations1 in
Stainless Steels.
Number 30 in the list of one hundred and twenty-
three articles is entitled "Manufacture of Stainless
Steel Articles," by W. H. Marble, "Chemical and
Metallurgical Engineering," Vol. 23, p. 257.
Immediately beneath this is the following brief
summary,—
"Discussion of composition, effect of elements;
heat treatment, uses and properties of stainless
steel." This is in Part 3.
In the section of the report immediately preced-
ing the chronological list—Part 2—and also, for
convenience, arranged according to date of publica-
tion, appears the following summary,—
"Carbon must be above .20% for necessary hard-
ness, but below .40% so as to avoid difficulties in
forging. Silicon tends to neutralize effect of car-
bon, but enough must be present to insure sound-
ness. Chromium furnishes resistance to corrosion
while tungsten and nickel are added to increase
the luster in polishing. Freedom from corrosion is

This summary has been given in full, not because
of any peculiar interest contained in the article, but
as a fair sample of the summaries, and as a proof in
anticipation of possible criticism—namely, that the
preparation of such a summary by a specialist in a
particular line might tend to boil the result too dry
of any but purely technical matter to leave it of
value to any but a reader of similar training and
interest.
Any process which brings forth valuable by-
products increases its own value to humanity many
fold. The truth of this assertion has already been
forcibly proved in the making of these bibliog-
raphies, for evidently the more thorough and
scientific such a listing of printed material is in its
final form, the more thorough and enlightening the
process by which this completeness is achieved.
These experiments in scientific bibliography mak-
ing have been most satisfactory, because the results
are not only of the utmost assistance to the scien-
tist, but to the general public and the librarian as
well.

practical purposes as regards chloride, (2) that the
control for inhibition of corrosion is as exact as that
given for elimination of scale formation, and (3)
that even in the extreme case of a raw water satu-
rated with air, feed line or economizer corrosion can
be reduced to negligible proportions.
Control of Non-Condensable Gases in the Steam by
Conditioning of the Boiler Water
In general, the necessity for controlling the con-
centration of carbon dioxide in the steam arises
most frequently. For such control, the obvious
thing to do is to keep all carbonates so far as pos-
sible from the boiling water. If the make-up water
is evaporated directly, control of the boiler water
with PO4 limits the quantity of carbon dioxide to
the amount derived from condenser leakage. If the
feed water is given primary treatment with lime
and soda ash, it is necessary to avoid excess of
treatment and to use a secondary control with PO4
on the boiler water. If the feed water contains
temporary hardness and is treated by a base ex-
change process, it may be necessary to remove the
excess sodium bicarbonate in the water after treat-
ment by the use of acids or other means, and the
final control must be established on the boiler water
with a chemical which does not decompose at the
operating pressures in question.
Other Factors in Boiler Water Conditioning
The control of sludges and soluble salts in the
boiler water, their relation to wet steam and the
removal of any boiler water and its suspended in-
soluble material from the steam before it leaves the
boiler nozzle are as integral parts of any complete
system of boiler water conditioning as the factors
which have been considered already. It is the pur-
pose of this paper, however, to present those fea-
tures of such a system in which the Bureau of
Mines is actively cooperating. This has been done,
and I must, therefore, extend this discussion no
further.

In this research covering a period of four years,
it is impossible adequately to recognize the achieve-
ments of all those associated in the development,
but the author takes pleasure in ascribing any suc-
cess attained to the unstinted support which has
been given by Mr. A. C. Fieldner, Chief Chemist
c-f the Bureau of Mines, and Mr. J. M. Hopwood,
President of the Hagan Corporation, and their re-

to the success or the failure of an Honor System
can be collected.
When the survey is complete, a report with con-
clusions will be published. It is to be hoped that
this work will be instrumental in helping to pre-
serve the proper functioning of the Honor System
in those schools which have one, and will be help-
ful in establishing a Code where now there is none.
The survey will, I hope, be of value to our own
College. I have made some little study of the con-
ditions here, and my belief is that, while we are
attaining a considerable degree of succss, we could
benefit quite largely by knowing the experience of
other colleges. I further believe that we are likely
to experience a breakdown at any time. Why?
I would rather prepare a statement on the point,
for another appearance in the Technic. The Editor
has been good enough to ask that a report of the
survey be made in these columns, and it may be
ready for the next issue.

itive and therefore s is large and positive. Just
?bove critical speed the denominator is small and
negative; therefore, s is large and negative, the
negative sign meaning that the displacement of the
shaft from its axis of rotation is opposite in direc-
tion to h. With a positive displacement the center
of gravity of the rotating mass is thrown out; with
a negative displacement the center of gravity is
thrown in. This can be shown by the colored paper
E as described before. In the above equation for
displacement attention is called to the fact that the
critical speed occurs where the denominator is zero
and is independent of h, therefore, no matter how
small h is made, that is the amount of unbalance
of the shaft, it will have a critical speed. In the
first demonstration with this apparatus, fairly close
fitting holes at B and G in the cast iron formed the
bearings; at critical speed the whip was so great
that the motor could not be speeded up without
first gripping the shaft and thus reducing the am-
plitude of vibration and consequent binding in the
bearings. For both types of vibration, if the shaft-
is speeded up rapidly enough the vibration is hardly
noticeable at natural frequency. It is good practice
to avoid operating at a speed that is near the nat-
ural frequency of vibration.

and unburned mixture in each case until all is
burned and the products of combustion occupy the
same space as was occupied by the original un-
burned mixture but the pressure has risen to 400
pounds per square inch. If one considers any small
portion of unburned mixture just in front of the
flame it may be easily seen that it is being driven
forward as the unburned gases are compressed. As
soon as this particle, however, has combined with
oxygen in the flame front it is driven violently
backward to the rear where the products of com-
bustion are being compressed. Two things are to
be noted. First: If the rate of chemical action be
constant, i. e., the first and second parts of our
mixture were consumed in equal intervals of time
then the velocity of flame movement or propaga-
tion will be progressively slower. Second: That
the unburned charge is compressed into a smaller
and smaller volume as the burning progresses prob-
ably one of the few practical examples of real adia-
batic compression in a cylinder. Experiments show
the first to be untrue, that on the contrary the
speed of flame propagation is very rapidly acceler-
ated and when we look for the reason we can hnd it
in the increasing density and temperature of the
unburned charge, as it is being compressed during
the burning process, bringing about a higher rate
of reaction.

Shaded portions represent products of combustion. Unshaded
portions represent unburned mixture. Numbers In shaded por-
tions represent number of parts of mixture burned. Numbers In
unshaded portions represent number of parts of mixture not
yet burned.
So we may say that in normal combustion we
have an accelerating flame and that each succes-
sive layer of mixture is heated mainly by radiation
and conduction to the critical ignition temperature.
As the velocity of inflammation increases ignition
is aided to an increasing extent by a rise in tem-
perature due to a momentary compression of the
fuel mixture just before the flame front. The fol-
lowing experimental data will give an idea of the
velocity of flame travel in this type of combustion.

Under certain conditions a charge is ignited and
the flame is propagated at an accelerating rate to a
certain point when the rate of flame propagation
suddenly takes on a very much higher velocity and
a constant velocity. The pressure in the flame
front has now risen to as high as 1800 pounds per
square inch by actual measurement. Just how this
new type of flame propagation is initiated is not
very clear. Harry Ricardo, the noted English
authority says, "Detonation is initiated when the
rate at which heat energy is developed in the flame
front exceeds by a certain amount the rate at which
it can be dissipated." This might be stated in
another way that when the rate of pressure rise
exceeds a certain value a pressure wave is set up
which moves through the mixture at a velocity de-
pending on the density, pressure, and ratio of the
specific heats of the medium through which it
travels. In other words it moves at the velocity of
sound through such a medium.
So we may say the detonation wave proceeds at a
definite velocity. Each successive layer of the gas
is heated above its ignition temperature mainly by
adiabatic compression in the pressure wave which
moves through the gas particles at the velocity of
sound. Since the particles of gas are themselves
moving forward in a body, the velocity of the pres-
sure wave will actually exceed the velocity of sound
in the gas. Combustion in this stage may be in-
itiated some distance ahead of the flame front at
such overheated points as sparkplug electrodes ex-
haust valves, etc. The high initial temperature of gas
immediately surrounding such points requires a
smaller increase in pressure to bring it to a
temperature higher than the ignition temperature
of the mixture. This last condition is always present
to a more or less extent in the combustion chamber
of an engine and has caused much confusion in the
application, to the actual engine, of the lessons
learned from bomb experiments.
•S. A. E. Transactions
Part 1 1'g. 3:0.
We may now ask the question, "What is wrong
about detonation?" and the answer will be:
1. It causes a loss of power. The flame of
normal combustion is like that of a Bunsen
burner, almost colorless. The flame in de-
tonation is highly luminous caused by in-
candescent particles of carbon which are
not burned but appear as puffs of black
smoke from the exhaust. This luminous
flame radiates much more energy than the
colorless flame which goes into the com-
bustion chamber walls and through into
the cooling water raising its temperature.
2. It causes a so-called fuel knock. If the
detonation wave front with its very high
pressure strikes any considerable portion
of the combustion chamber wall at the
same instant it will cause a knock very
much like a hammer blow.
3. These same high pressures have a destruc-
tive effect on pistons, valves, and spark
plugs.
The next question is, "How can detonation be
eliminated or at least alleviated?" At present the
two most reasonable methods are either to place
the spark plug in the center of the combustion
chamber and design the combustion chamber shape
to have the shortest possible distance for the flame
to travel or by using multiple sparkplugs. Thus
the accelerating flame propagation will not have
time to reach the velocity where detonation begins.
The other method is to add a chemical agent which
will slow up the flame velocity so that it will not
reach the critical value. The noise or knock may
be prevented by use of very irregular combustion
chamber walls so that the wave strikes only small
portions at a time.
It can readily be seen that a scientific study of the
situation is most urgent and that like most problems
of the engineer it is going to require the combined
efforts of mathematicians, chemists, and physicists,
as well as engineers to bring about a successful
solution.
Perhaps the most interesting part of this discus-
sion will be the fact that the University is to obtain
a duplicate of the Langley Field Universal Test
engine. This is made possible by the generosity of
the National Advisory Committee in allowing the
use of designs and patterns whose development cost
them upwards of $75,000, so that the cost to the
University will be a very nominal sum. This engine
will be delivered early next semester and will soon
begin work on a program of fuel investigation for
the department of Engineering Research. It is
hoped that much benefit will accrue to students,
faculty and the automotive industries of our state by
such an opportunity for original research.

Gas in Industry and the Home
The first gas known or used to any extent was
natural gas, the gas that comes out of the earth.
In ancient Greece, a shepherd was once wandering
with his flock on a certain hill, on which the oracle
of Delphi was eventually located, and suddenly for
no reason that he could see, he was partially over-
come and became hilarious, as if he had imbibed too
much of the fermented juice of the grape. The
townfolk saw in him and his plight incarnation of
some evil spirit but the priestcraft of the country
soon realized that here was an agency of which they
could make use. Thus was founded the oracle of
Delphi on a spot where natural gas issued from the
earth and the priestess, being overcome by this
earthy emanation, delivered the oracle of the gods.
Natural gas was, however, used in a practical wax-
by the Chinese shortly after the opening of the
Christian era for such purposes as the evaporation
of salt from brine. It is said that certain houses in
Pekin were heated—if not lighted—with the gas.
In Europe the first use of gas for commercial
purposes dates back to the experiments made by
Murdock, who lighted his home with it in 1792 and
to the work carried to a more practical conclusion
by Winsor. In the United States the first gas plant
was established in Baltimore in 1816, which was fol-
lowed by one in Boston in 1823 and one in New
York in 1825. —Valve World.
Use of Natural (ran
Natural gas is still used in large quantities in
the United States, although the limited character
of the supply makes further development of its use
impossible and in fact is already curtailing the
present uses to which it is put. It is piped from
the fields and used for cooking, heating and lighting
in the home and is also employed for some indus-
trial purposes. This gas possesses the highest cal-
orific power of any gaseous fuel, possessing from
1000 to 1200 British thermal units per cubic foot.
Almost all of this gas is constituted of the simple
hydrocarbon, methane.
The manufactured gas that was first made was
coal gas, that is. the gas that is obtained by the dis-
tillation of coal in the absence of air. At the present
time large quantities of coal gas are used in this
country and all over the world both in the home and
in the industries. The gas is made in retorts, which
are either horizontal, vertical or inclined and is col-
lected therefrom, purified and finally distributed
through the gas lines from the holder to the con-
sumers. Coal gas is used to a large extent in indus-
trial processes. Its calorific power varies according
to the legal regulations. It is generally in the
neighborhood of 400 to 600 British thermal units
per cubic foot.
Water gas is a distinctly American development.
The first successful water gas plant was put in oper-
ation in Phoenixville, Pa., in 1873. Water gas is
made by the reaction of steam and incandescent
carbon. The hot carbon breaks up the steam into
hydrogen and oxygen and the oxygen combines
with the carbon to give carbon monoxide. Thus
water gas is essentially a mixture of hydrogen and
carbon monoxide. Water gas is also known as blue
gas for it burns with a blue flame. Blue gas has a
calorific power of around 300 to 320 British thermal
units per cubic foot. It is an ideal fuel for industry
and for domestic consumption, for it carries the cor-
rect number of heat units to give a flame of maxi-
mum intensity of temperature and efficiency.
Carburetted water gas is also a fuel which is
used for domestic and industrial purposes. It is
made by enriching water gas by mixing it with the
vapors produced by the cracking of gas oil, a
product obtained in the distillation of petroleum.
Producer gas is used in industry only. It is made
by blowing air through a bed of hot coal. Its calor-
ific power is low. Coke-oven gas is the gas that is
recovered from the by-product coke oven in the
manufacture of metallurgical coke and the recovery
of tar, ammonia and other valuable by-products.
Blast-furnace gas, recovered from the blast furnace
making pig iron, and oil gas, made from oil, are also
of some importance.

Our recent accessions to the Architectural Lib-

on architecture as Davison's City Churches, those
on allied arts such as Kendrick's Hand-woven Car-
pets, and others on drawing, as Gordon's Linear
Perspective. From this long list it is possible at
this time to name only a few
of those having a distinct ap-
peal.
Louis Sullivan: The Auto-
biography of an Idea.
The story of the author's life"^
in terms of his very personal
and original philosophy. The
man who perhaps more than
any other -American architect
has in his practice freshened
our thought about design has
here given us an equally stim-
ulating view of the background
upon which his patterns were
woven.
Louis Mumford: Sticks and
Stones.
Another thought-provoking
book about American archi-
tecture. With penetrating
analysis he removes the glass through which we
have seen darkly as a pleasant panorama our prog-
ress from the first New England village to the
modern city. He shows us, always in the most
readable style, the sincerity of the early American
style and the subsequent drift to the "Imperial
Facade." At the end, socialist-wise, he plans a way
of escape from the toils of present day city life.
Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue, Architect and Mas-
ter of Many Arts.
The great artistic ability and distinguished work
of Mr. Goodhue has made his recent death especially
lamented. His high reputation has been well
recorded in this memorial.
Halsey and Cornelus: The Metropolitan Mu-
seum of Art. The American Wing.
An appreciation of good design, as well a curi-
osity about our American "antiques" has been very
evident in the wide popularity of the American
Wing at the Metropolitan. The resources of the
Museum have here made possible a unique collec-
tion. The publication of the Museum is more than
a catalogue and both architect and layman whether
they have made the pilgrimage to this Mecca or not
will find the book pleasant and profitable reading.

WE all have heard or uttered
the old cry, "I haven't time"
when questioned about the
latest books in our sphere of interest.
The busy life of most engineering un-
dergraduates too often prevents the
familiarity with our Engineering
Libraries which in many cases would
be much more beneficial than those
things that so monopolize our time.
The graduate engineer is often
called by his work to communities
where the latest literature of his pro-
fession is seldom seen. Such a man
is bound to gradually lose touch with
the latest advances in his field and
hence fail to progress as he might.
The classics are always modern; to
keep abreast of the strides in the
scientific and professional world,
knowledge of the latest research and
investigation is a prime requisite. Ac-
cordingly, this department is intended
to fulfill such a demand and through
the help of our Librarians and certain
of the Faculty has been made possible.

Pulverized Fuel, A Practical
Handbook, by W. F. Goodrich,
Charles Griffin &amp; Co.,
London, 1924
This small volume of about
200 pages presents in a very
interesting and readable man-
ner a general description of the
methods used in firing powder-
ed coal, and discusses briefly
the important factors necessary
for successful operation.
Chapter I of 15 pages' out-
lines the origin of powdered
coal firing in England (1831)
and traces the early develop-
ment which took place mostly
in the United States.
Chapter II reviews the Rayco, Fuller-Griffin,
Aero and Quigley methods of preparing and firing
powdered coal. While superficial in some places,
this chapter of 75 pages is a fairly adequate presen-
tation of American practice, particularly to an Eng-
lishman or one not familiar with American plants.
Chapter III describes the Simon Carves, Bet-
tington, Powder Fuel Plant Co., Vickers-Griffin,
"Atritor" and Buell methods as used in England
;md France.
Chapter IV of 23 pages emphasizes the need of
simplicity in equipment as gained from American
experience. Drying is shown to be economical un-
der certain conditions, but in small installations is
generally a needless expense. Fine grinding may-
be carried to wasteful extremes, although necessarv
to a certain degree, uniform grinding is correctly
stated to be more important than extreme fineness.

The importance of large combustion space, intimate
mixing of air and coal and low air velocity are men-
tioned. The author again in this chapter takes up
his case for the unit system as against the central
system generally used in America. The importance
of magnetic separation, ash and cinder removal and
safety regulations are also discussed in this chap-
ter.
Chapter V emphasizes that satisfactory results
cannot be obtained unless the proper conditions
exist. If proper conditions are maintained almost
any solid fuel may be burned satisfactorily, from
low ash dry bituminous coal to high ash wet refuse.
Chapter VI considers the future development of
powdered coal machinery in Great Britain, particu-
larly as applied to firing boilers of the internally
fired type.
The book is well written, completely illustrated,
and gives a true perspective of the possibilities of
firing boilers by powdered coal. Many tabulated
test data are included and add greatly to the value
of the volume. It can be read easily and is well
worth reading whether one is experienced in the
use of powdered coal or not.

Dearborn Gax Tank is Landmark for Aviators
Aviation is beginning to affect the general ap-
pearance of gas plants. Officials identified with
Henry Ford's flying field and airplane construction
factory here have started a movement which may
result in using the huge gas holders which can be
found in every progressive American city as land-
marks and guides.
When the big tank was finished, aviation men
asked the builders to paint it a bright color, instead
of the neutral gray that had been planned. They
also requested that an arrow of white be painted
across the top to direct fliers to the aviation field
and to point out the air routes. Wherefore, Dear-
born now has a bright red gas tank, which is seen
for many miles by the men who carry mail and com-
modities. The white arrow across the top is 140
feet long. If the need arises, this arrow may be
floodlighted as a guide for night fliers.

College Notes
A. S. C. E.
At a recent meeting of the A. S. C. E. the follow-
ing members were elected to the officers of the
society for the following year: president, Curt H.
Will (re-elected); vice-president, Alfred Hansen;
secretary, Herbert Hinckley; treasurer, Lloyd H.
Fitts.
An essay contest, sponsored by the Detroit sec-
tion of the A. S. C. E., is being carried on by mem-
bers of the senior class of engineers. This contest
consists in writing a paper on some subject which
should be of general intertst to all engineers. In
order to create greater interest in the contest and as
a reward for the efforts of those entering, a prize
will be awarded the one whose paper receives first
place. The papers will be judged by a committee
chosen for the purpose. The prize offered is a
junior membership in the A. S. C. E. plus the pay-
ment of one year's dues.
The following are the rules of the contest:
1. All subject matter shall consist of the follow-
ing:
(a) A history of some notable achievement in
engineering, such as the Eads Bridge, Suez Canal,
Appian Way, or other similar structure; or
(b) A discussion of some phase of University
work which is a common requirement for all mem-
bers of the chapter; or
(d) A history of the development of some
branch of engineering; or
(e) Any other subject that will meet with the
approval of the committee.
It is hoped that the policy of the Detroit section
of the A. S. C. E. in sponsoring this contest will be
continued in the future for the training received by
the engineers who enter such contests will be found
invaluable to them in their later work.

and Listed four days. The conference was spon-
sored by the University in cooperation with the
Michigan State Highway Department.
The several sessions and meetings of the confer-
ence were presided over by Prof. A. H. Blanchard
head of the department of highway engineering and
highway transportation. President Little ad-
dressed the engineers at one of the sessions.
Prof. Henry E. Riggs of the civil engineering de-
partment acted as toastmaster at the smoker given
at the Union. The purpose of the conference was
to aid in supplying to road commissioners and en-
gineers information relative to highway administra-
tion, organization, financing, traffic, drainage sys-
tems, and foundations, and the construction and
maintenance of highways and bridges. Owing to
the publicity given the conference by technical
journals many out of state engineers attended.

Military Engineers Give Banquet
The Society of American Military Engineers gave
its annual banquet at the Michigan Union on Thurs-
day, February 11, 1926. At the banquet the new
men entering the society were received into mem-
bership.
Joseph H. Barkovich, 25E, exercised the powers
of toastmaster, introducing the speaker of the even-
ing, Mayor Robert A. Campbell, of Ann Arbor.
The Mayor in his speech emphasized the value of
training, discipline and fair play in the battle of life.
He made it apparent that, to get the full value of
life, one must form ideals and stand by them.
John G. Perkins, 26E, president of the society
welcomed the initiates. The response for the initi-
ates was given by John H. Lovette, 27E, Major
Melberg, professor of military science and tactics
also gave a short talk.
On Wednesday, February 24, the S. A. M. E.
gave a joint meeting with Scabbard and Blade. On
this occasion a talk was given by Prof. Miller of the
drawing department. Prof. Miller holds a commis-
sion as colonel in the Ordnance Reserve. His talk,
which had to do with anti aircraft developments,
was of great interest, both military and general.
The officers of the society for this year are:
President, John G. Perkins, 26E.
Vice-President, William N. Van Koughnot, 26E.
Secretary, Robert C. Shaw.
Treasurer, John W. Hickman, 27E.

THE PRESENTATION OF THE NEW CADILLAC CHASSIS
University Presented With Cadillac and Buick
dhaxsex
Through their Detroit distributors, the Cadillac
motor car company presented to the University a
specially constructed chassis which had been used
at the various Auto Shows this winter. The gift
was accepted by Prof. H. C. Anderson of the
mechanical engineering department on behalf of the
University.
The chassis has been very carefully constructed,
all of the parts' are nickel plated and sectioned so
that the functioning of all the mechanisms may be
examined. The starter motor operates the engine
and transmission and small lights illuminate the
moving parts.
A similar chassis has also been given by the
Buick company. On this job several of the regular
castings' have been replaced by duplicate castings
of glass.
These two chasses, according to Prof. W. E. Lay
of the automotive department, will be placed as a
permanent exhibit in the main floor corridor of the
West Engineering building. This exhibition will
have a total value of about $30,000.

Echoes from the Graduates
CORNELIUS DONOVAN
ALTHOUGH it is almost four years since the
entire engineering world mourned the loss of
one of the most exponential men of its recent his-
tory, the innovation of the Donovan Scholarship
Fund in the Engineering College of the University
of Michigan gives us occasion to review again the
magnificent work to which he
dedicated his life. His life
should stand out as an example
of the great services that an
engineer of the true type can
do for his fellowmen. Every
engineer, whether a graduate
or student, will hardly need to
look further for an ideal than
the life and works of Corndiu*
Donovan.
His entire life was devoted to
the development of navigation
channels thru the delta of the
Mississippi River. The impos-
sibility, or seeming impossibil-
ity of securing and retaining a
navigable passage from the
Mississippi River thru the
deltas to the Gulf of Mexico
has been one of the greatest
obstacles to the development
of the great Middle West. The
Mississippi River, the "key to
the prosperity of half a nation,"
was practically useless to the territory it drained
as a practical commercial outlet to the sea. Ever
since the Civil War, when the first deep draft river
gunboats were developed, futile attempts have been
made to combat the ever growing mud deposits at
the mouths of the Mississippi.
But for the life work of two men, Dr. Eads and
Mr. Donovan, we would probably still be struggling
with the problem, which the late Professor J. B.
Davis defined as the "Protean Puzzle of the Nation."
I'o overcome the great river was a task that not
only required engineering knowledge, as learned in
books, but knowledge such as comes only from life
CORNELIUS DONOVAN
long study of the particular problem involved.
Mr. Donovan's youth was spent in Ann Arbor
where he graduated from the local high school and
entered the Engineering College of the University
of Michigan. He graduated in 1872 with the
Degree of Civil Engineer and took up a position of
Assistant Engineer of the Ann
Arbor, Jackson, and Lansing
Railroad. In 1874 Professor
Davis, at that time very active
in the research of the lake sur-
vey, interested Mr. Donovan in
that work. For the following
two years he worked on the
survey of the northern lakes.
He proved very capable and he
soon drew the attention of the
government engineers. He
was sent to Port Eads, then the
center of the Mississippi im-
provement project, under Dr.
James Eads. He spent the rest
of his life in the completion of
that great work.
Dr. Eads had been commis-
sioned by the government to
build a channel through the
South Pass, the smallest of the
mouths of the Mississippi. The
task at first seemed merely the
building of some eight miles of
jetties, which would confine the river waters so that
they would not deposit the mud and sand they car-
ried until they reached the Gulf of Mexico, thus
eliminating the formation of sand bars. But it was
rot so easy, sand bars continued to form and even
after the jetties were completed, the sand was de-
posited at the end and worked its way back up the
channel.
For five years Mr. Donovan worked under Dr.
Eads. He devoted himself to the study of "His
River" and he became expert to such a degree that,
at the death of Dr. Eads, he was placed in charge
of all government work on the Mississippi. He


Page 31
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
sacrificed the comforts of remaining at a headquar-
ters in New Orleans, in order to be in more intimate
contact with his work, and for twenty-three years
lived in a houseboat on a mosquito-infested river.
In a short time he succeeded in maintaining the de-
sired depth along the entire channel.
The War Department saw that a channel to the
gulf was possible and decided that another channel,
a more efficient and larger one, be developed. Al-
though Mr. Donovan was maintaining the channel
thru the south pass, it was only with the greatest
difficulty. A committee composed of two army
engineers and two civilian engineers drew up plans
for the proposed operations. But Mr. Donovan was
such an authority that the plans were sent to him
for any suggestions that he might have to make.
He presented.his ideas which were so good that the
plans of the committee were immediately laid aside,
and his taken up. He was placed in charge of the
project. The channel thru the southwest pass
was a success and was opened to shipping in the
winter of 1911.
During the construction of the South West Chan-
nel, Mr. Donovan lived in New Orleans, and upon
the completion of his task he retired to the old
"Chess, Checkers and Whist" Club of that city,
where he lived the remainder of his life.
Despite the fact that he lived almost half his life
in the primitive surroundings of his projects he was
a man of very broad understanding and culture. He
was very well read, and there can be no doubt
but that he was considerate of the fortunes of
others. Professor Davis wrote the following after
a two weeks' visit with him. "He is a modest, un-
assuming gentleman of the finest personal appear-
ance, bearing and manners. Socially, he makes
friends immediately with the best people."
Then, in the closing chapters of his forty-five
years of service devoted to his country and to his
fcllowmen, he has left his entire fortune to the
University of Michigan in the splendid scholarship
that was just instituted the semester beginning
February, 1926. The services of this son of Michi-
gan have not come to an end but will go on. This
semester seventeen men in the Engineering College
have secured scholarships ranging from two hun-
dred to three hundred dollars. Qualification and
disposition of the funds are in the hands of a com-
mittee of which Dean Cooley is the chairman. Any
man who has over sixty hours of credit in the
Engineering College, whose average grade is "B"
or better and who is partially working his way
through school is qualified to apply for a scholarship.
May some of the men who arc benefited by the noble
work of this man climb to the pinnacle of success
which this son of Michigan attained.

The Question of
Lubrication
You men who are engaged in the study of engineering will soon be out in the
industrial world, working in engineering positions and, in many cases, taking
charge of machinery valued at many thousands of dollars. Your success in
these positions will depend, to a very great extent, on your efficiency in hand-
ling this machinery. The responsibility of increasing production for your em-
ployers, and of cutting down production costs, will rest largely upon your
shoulders.
In these days of close competition, economy is the watchword of all manufac-
turers. Waste must be eliminated, and production costs cut to the lowest pos-
sible figure.
One of the largest sources of waste in the industrial world is incorrect lubrica-
tion. Friction hastens the depreciation of machinery, causes loss and waste of
power and makes necessary expensive repairs and replacements, and causes loss
of working time on every occasion when it is necessary to shut down a
machine.
Standard Oils and
, Greases
when used in the correct grades, will reduce friction to a minimum, lower de
preciation and repair costs, and will save power. These lubrications are made
in many grades to meet the requirements of any machine now used in industry.
In order to give industrial engineers ths greatest possible help in selecting the
proper grades for their machinery the Standard Oil Company (Indiana)
maintains a corps of highly trained lubrication engineers who will gladly make
a survey of any plant and recommend the grades of oils and greases which will
give the best results for each piece of machinery.
We urge that when you students take up your engineering positions in indus-
try, you remember this service and avail yourselves of it.

Electricity, which can release
woman from her burdens, has
already created a revolution in
American industry. Wherever
mankind labors, General
Electric motors can be found
carrying loads, driving machin-
ery and saving time and labor.
And there is no branch of elec-
trical development today to
which General Electric has not
made important contributions.
A series of G-E advertisements
showing what electricity is
doing in many fields will be
sent on request. Ask for book-
let GEK-1.
Crows
In a field in sunny Spain stands a stone mortar.
Crows hover around it, picking up bits of grain and
chaff—cawing.
Here Marcheta, in the fresh beauty of her youth,
will come to pound maize. For years she will pound
maize. The stone will stand up under the blows;
not a dent has the muscle of three generations of
women made upon it. But the crows will hurl their
black gibes upon a woman aging early and bent
with toil. Old Marcheta—still in her thirties.
The American woman does not pound maize. But
she still beats carpet; she still pounds clothes; she
still pumps water. She exhausts her strength in
tasks which electricity can do better, and in half
the time.
The high ideals of a community mean little where
woman is still doomed to drudgery. But the mir-
acles which electricity already has performed
indicate but a fraction of the vast possibilities for
better living and the tremendous opportunities
which the future developments in electricity will
hold for the college man and woman.

SUPERHIGHWA YS
By J. L. HENDRY, '06E*
MOST cities and towns came into existence in
the first place more or less by accident, or in
the words of the song, "We're Here Because We're
Here." It would be quite difficult to assemble a
list of cities that were
located by the pioneers
because the site was
particularly adaptable
to deep draft ocean
docking, or for railroad
terminal facilities. Nor
were these same pio-
neers in a position to
give deep study to the
problem of locating
their settlement in such
a way that the water
supply and sewage dis-
posal problems destined to come up one or two
hundred years later could be handled to the best
advantage with the minimum expenditure. When
Cadillac came to Detroit to establish a military
and trading post, he hesitated between the present
site and Grosse Isle, down river, preferring the
island, but deciding for the mainland because there-
was more standing timber available there.
However, when a settlement has once been estab-
lished, its growth is not so closely related to the
accidental. There is always a reason for whatever p
happens, and usually the cause of growth is self-
evident after the village has expanded to a city
or after the small city has suddenly expanded to a
large one. But before the growth takes place, while
the little community is still wondering how it is
going to raise the price to pave Main Street or how

soon it can undertake the financing of a water sys-
tem, looking ahead twenty-five or fifty, or even a
hundred years, and wisely planning for its future
needs is not so easy.
Occasionally a small
community does con-
tain a citizen who fore-
sees great things in the
future for that com-
munity, and incident-
ally his prophecies oc-
casionally come true.
Finances usually pre-
vent building for any
great distance in the
future however. There
is' one form of provi-
sion costing little or
nothing which no city or village in the U. S. can
afford to disregard, and that is a city plan of some
kind.
By way of illustration—in 1837 a group of plan-
ners decided to move the University of Michigan
to Ann Arbor. Instead of buying a small plat suf-
ficient for the one or two buildings then necessary,
they planned to lay the foundations large enough
to take care of the University needs forever, and
accordingly bought forty acres. The fact that the
University now occupies many times this acreage
does not lessen the value of their foresight, but
emphasizes the fact that they could have looked
longer and harder—with profit.
The Planning and Growth of Detroit
Detroit was founded in 1701 by the French and
grew hit or miss fashion, without a plan, until 1925,

when the "Master Plan" was adopted by the Com
mon Council. During this period only one attempt
was made to apply a city plan. In 1805 the village-
was entirely destroyed by fire, and in 1806 the "Gov-
ernor and Judges Plan" was adopted to govern its
replatting and rebuilding. This plan, which en-
tirely disregarded the old layout, was a remarkable
piece of city planning. The main arteries were two
hundred feet wide; the secondary, one hundred and
twenty, and all tertiary streets, sixty feet. In addi-
tion, plazas and parks
were provided at regular
intervals. In the area
bounded by Adams, Ran
dolph. Cass and the River
this plan was staked out"
and property owners in
the old town were given
equivalent holdings in the
new, but the plan was
never carried out beyond
these limits.
In 1830 Governor Cass
acquired and laid out the
so-called radial militarv
roads, namely, Michigan,
Grand River and Gratiot
Avenues, extending prac-
tically across the State in
various directions. These,
together with Fort Street,
Woodward and leffer-on
Avenues, are quite like
the spokes of a wheel con-
verging in the downtown
section, and have exerted
Detroit's growth,
influence.
In 1880 the Grand Boulevard, beginning at the
river on the West and ending at the river on the
east side, and encircling the city about three and
a half miles out from the center, was purchased.
'At that time this was mostly outside the city lim-
its and entirely outside the built-up section. The
idea was conceived and put over by a group of
public spirited citizens in the face of strong, and at
times, bitter opposition. Today it is one of the
greatest assets the city has.
The foregoing about covers anything that might
be classed as city planning. Certainly it was not
much for a city covering a hundred square miles of
territory and containing a million persons and two
hundred years of time at its disposal.
The results were exactly what might be expected
without a plan or supervision. The results were
further aggravated in Detroit by the fact that most
of the town occupies the long, narrow French

considerable influence in
Later we will touch upon this
claims laid out by the first settlers. These are long,
narrow, ribbons of land facing the river and run
r.ing back two or three miles at right angles. These,
with their subsequent ownership and divisions had
quite a different influence on the town's growth
than the usual sections and section-line roads would
exert.
The Purpose and Plans of the Rapid Transit
Commission
Early in 1923 the Detroit Rapid Transit Com
mission was appointed to
investigate the general
subject of Rapid Transit
for Detroit. The instruc-
tions to the Commission
were explicit and compre-
hensive. Among other
tilings it was directed "To
lay out a thorotare s\ &gt;
trm for the future city
that will provide the right
• if way for the enlarged
rapid transit on rails and
also provide for rapid
transit on rubber tires,
both of which will then
be required."
"To study the adap-
tation of the present
street system within the
City to this future super-
thoroughfare plan outside
the city."
The direct result of the
foregoing portion of the
Commission's instructions was the Master Plan of
Superhighways and Major Thoroughfares for De-
troit and Environs. This plan has been accepted and
adopted by the Common Council of the City of
Detroit and by practically all the municipal author
ities within a radius of fifteen miles of Detroit.
It has also been approved by the interested author
ities of Wayne. Oakland and Macomb Counties.
These authorities are requiring all new plats to
conform to the Master Plan and to dedicate all
portions of the highway* running through the plat
under consideration. A great many subdivision
owners have voluntarily deeded additional street
widths in plats which were recorded before the
Master Plan was adopted. In general the attitude
of interested property owners has been one ot
friendly cooperation. Cases of opposition have been
comparatively rare.
In addition to the above agencies for acquiring tin-
rights of way for the Master Plan thoroughfares,
the Superhighway Commissions, consisting of mem-
bers of the Wavne, Oakland and Macomb Countv


Pate 7
THK MI CHIC] AN TECH NIC
Road Commissions and tin- State Highway Com-
missioner, is now functioning. Under the Darin
Bill, effective August 28th, 1925, the Commission
may receive donations of land and property, may
purchase, lease or'option land, or may take private
property by condemnation proceedings. Funds are
provided for this activity by the levy of a tax not
to exceed one-half mill.
Briefly stated, the Master Plan is a coordinated
load and highway plan for all the territory lying
within fifteen miles of the City Hall of Detroit. It
provides for Superhighways 2()4 feet wide about
three miles apart outside the seven-mile circle.
Lying between the Superhighways at mile intervals
are the main thorofares 120 feet wide, and lastly
between these are the secondary thorofares, 86 feet
in width.
An inspection of the Master Plan will show that
every part of the thirty mile semicircle is accessible
to every other part by reasonably direct and con-
tinuous routes. All sections are equally served in-
stead of over-servicing some districts at the expense
of others. The natural result of this type of layout
will be a tendency toward diffusion instead of con-
centration, of both residential populations and com-
mercial activities, and above all, relief from the
almost hopeless traffic congestion of the modern
large city.
The Need of an East and West Artery
When the Rapid Transit Commission undertook
the study of the highway situation it was discov-
ered that there was not a single continuous east and
west street across the city between the river and
the Seven-Mile Road. This is an area more than
tight miles wide extending east and west across
the city. The few streets that extended any con-
siderable part of the way across often contained
numerous bad jogs, were often narrow or it was
necessary to make long detours where they were
discontinuous.
Lacking proper crosstown streets, a large portion
of traffic wishing to get from one side of the city to
the other naturally gravitated to one of the radial
arteries mentioned earlier and was conducted down
town. Here it traversed part of this congested dis-
trict and eventually emerged on a radial leading
out on the other side. The points involved here are:
1st. The down town streets would be crowded
to capacity by the traffic that had business there.
2nd. Other traffic that has no business or desire
to he there is forced into the district by lack of by-
pass facilities.
Effectuating the Master Plan will make it entirely
unnecessary for traffic to enter a congested area,
where it has no desire to be. and also allow such
areas to expand and even multiply and so reduce
congestion in the area itself.
High Speed Transportation Service
The Master Plan also provides rights of way for
Rapid Transit construction. It provides them in
such a way that a rapid transit system can be built
to give adequate service for all sections and still
serve as a diffusing medium rather than as a con-
centrator.
And now a word as to the character of an differ
inces between the 120-foot thorofare and 204-foot
superhighway. Each thorofare and superhighway
is a potential rapid transit route. Rapid transit may
be defined as transportation of at least moderate
speed free from interruptions. The elimination of
interruptions being of prime importance, it there-
fore follows that we may have rapid transit on the
surface or above or below if we can provide an
exclusive right of way for it free from interference.
The Detroit Superhighways were designed to pro-
vide such a right of way on the surface and the
120-foot thorofares will provide it above or below
the surface on elevateds or in tunnelways. The
Detroit Rapid Transit Commission is of the opinion
that tunnelways are to be preferred to elevateds un-
der Detroit conditions.
The sidewalks and road widths of the 120 and
204-foot highways are identical, the overall differ-
ence in width being due to the 84 feet in the center
of the superhighway occupied by the rapid transit
rig'ht of way. This right of way is exclusively for
rapid transit trains and is to be fenced and free
from cross traffic its whole length.
Semi-elevated stations will be located half a mile
;;part along the superhighways, and at these points

a semi-depressed street will pass cross traffic under
the rapid transit right of way, eliminating mutua
danger and interference.
Lying next to and each side of the rapid transit
right of way is a one-way express, vehicular road-
way 20 feet wide. This is carried up over the cross
traffic streets on the same elevation as the rapid
transit, creating a safe high-speed roadway. This
arrangement eliminates all interference from cross
traffic on this roadway and also the necessity of

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
THE HONOR SYSTEM
By A. D. MOORE
IN the last issue of the MICHIGAN TECHNIC
the writer stated that through the honorary en-
gineering society, Tau Beta Pi, a survey of the
honor systems of forty-eight engineering schools
was being conducted. The survey is far from be-
ing complete. At present there seems to be little
hope of receiving reports on a majority of the chap-
tered schools until sometime next year. But even
it the investigation were finished, my guess is that
while an interesting table of
results could be given showing
how many schools have honor
systems and how many have
not, the data would not be
more valuable than the conclu-
sions one may draw from re-
ports already in hand.
Thirteen schools have re-
ported. For various reasons,
certain facts cannot be pub
lished which have come to
light concerning certain insti-
tutions. We are treading on
delicate ground, and it be-
hooves us to draw a kindly cur-
tain over certain names and
places; not, however, refrain-
ing from profiting from the
experiences of unfortunate
schools by reciting the facts.
I will therefore turn this paper
into a discussion of the honor system, making men-
tion of particular cases where necessary to the
development of the argument.
To plunge into the subject with a question, we
can ask, why have an honor system? The answer
to it is complicated, but it can be partly answered
by the reminder that once a school is created, along
with it is brought into being a system of rewards
and temptations. Given a school, there follows a
group of young people striving to pass courses; in-
evitably, the situation is more or less conducive
to cheating. We may state the general principle
that, if an administration sets up a machine that
incidentally tends to strain the good qualities of
human nature, it is only fair to ask that along with
the temptations offered, proper character-building
steps be taken. The school in the aggregate—fac-
ulty, alumni, present students—is responsible for
assembling and putting to test, a group of people
now in a formative period of their lives. Then the
THERE has recently appeared
a shower of unfounded criti-
cism upon the honor system by
people who are unqualified by
lack of facts to hold such views.
The very vital connection of en-
gineering with the public service
requires as few other professions
a spirit of honor among its mem-
bers. We present here a treat-
ment of this subject by a man with
a background of study and in-
vestigation, who has kept faith in
the honor system. The Technic
firmly believes not only in the
desirability, but in the vital neces-
sity for a tradition of Michigan
honor and to that end will direct
its fullest effort.—The Editor.
school in the aggregate should introduce the proper
strengthening measures. One measure sorely need-
ed by many schools is—the honor system.
But just any old honor system will not work.
The name "honor system" helps to point out the
cause of some failures. The name is unfortunate,
for the thing with which it deals is the character
and sportsmanship of the student body—and who
can systematize that sort of thing? Yet that, exact-
ly, is what some people have
tried to do. I have talked
lately with quite a few of the
ones who are concerned with
the movement on foot t&lt;"&gt; place
the honor system in the Liter-
ary College. One such opened
our conversation by reciting
the various methods employed
at other places, for warning
the class that cheating was
going on. One method was to
rap on something; another, to
rise and make a speech; and so
on. Now, this1 sort of detail
belongs to system more than
to honor. If this is the kind
of discussion that must use up
the time of committees at work
on the job, we can confidently
predict an early failure for the
"system" when installed. In
looking over reports that have come to me from
schools where the "system" either has failed, or is
falling down, it is often evident that the builders
of the "system" had taken fine care of the details
of policing, gathering of evidence, trial, con-'iction
and penalty, and had done little or nothing to edu-
cate the members of the school on the honor side
of it.
Simply to transfer authority and responsibility
from faculty to students, does not create an honor
system. Going by what some of the opponents of
the honor system who have recently written their
peculiar ideas in the Michigan Daily have said, that
is what they think an honor system is. They are
very much mistaken. Simply by transferring the
job of proctoring from the professor to his students,
does not materially change the honor aspects. If
the professor had formerly so misconducted his
work and his relations with his students that they
welcomed a chance to cheat while he watched them.

then very likely the class will agree that he still
should be gotten around in any way convenient.
To differentiate between "honor" and "system,"
here is virtually what is told the freshman, in some
places: be honorable; be a gentleman; you ought to
be anyway; if you are not, learn how; we want your
respect, and we wfill give you ours, if you earn it;
and incidentally, if you violate our trust, the pen-
alty is severe, sure and swift. That is the language
used where the honor part of it is given first place.
Now contrast that with what the freshman reads
when going to certain other schools; if you cheat,
our efficient honor committee will certainly throw
you out of school; every man will watch you close-
ly, and you are under suspicion until you get your
reputation with us; we insist upon honesty; and
incidentally, we believe it pays to be honest any-
way. Under which honor system is the freshman
the more likely to give the right reaction?
As examples of institutions where honor is not
placed second to system, and where the honor sys-
tem is splendidly successful, there are Stevens In-
stitute, and the University of Virginia. To be sure,
at both places, all necessary phases of the honor
system are thoroughly systematized; but system is
not emphasized at the expense of honesty. As ex-
amples of the other type of organization, I could
give you instances, but it would hardly be the cour-
teous thing to do.
At each of the aforementioned institutions, long
experience has shown the way for doing things
right. It is not assumed that all the freshman needs
is to be told once, verbally, that he is going to work
on his honor. Instead, the complete Honor Code
is printed in the yearly Handbook; in this section
of the Handbook, there is a splendidly written
preface, calculated to appeal to the sense of honesty
and fairness of the freshman, and not to his sense
of fear; and the rules of administration of the honor
system are put in last. Then the Handbook, in-
stead of being handed to the freshman when he ar-
rives, is in all possible cases sent to him in ad-
vance. Not only that, but every student gets one
every year of his college life.
Nor is that all. At Virginia at least, when the
freshman matriculates, he is handed a full-page
statement of the Code and the honor system. After
reading it, he finds a detachable part at the bottom
of the manuscript, which is printed on very heavy
paper. On this portion is a statement which he
signs, by which he agrees that he understands thor-
oughly what is expected of him, and that he will
never plead ignorance. That is all; he is not asked
to swear that he will never cheat, nor anything of
the sort; he simply signifies that he understands
the rules of the game.
Even with these precautions, Virginia is not sat-
isfied; the freshmen are given at least two talks in
assembly, on the Virginia code of honor; and the
school paper, by requirement of the honor system
rules, carries two or more stories about the honor
system early in the year. It is likely that these
later efforts may be regarded not so much as pre-
cautions against ignorance on the part of an indi-
vidual, so much as effectual educative propaganda
calculated to stimulate respect for the rules of the
game. Be that as it may, no one can question the
fact that Virginia and Stevens are very proud of
their honor systems, and that they are entirely justi
fied in being so.
At Virginia the penalty for violation of trust is
pretty stiff. The guilty one is quietly told to leave
school and never to come back. After he has de-
parted, the full facts are published. As a result,
violations are very rare indeed.
This brings up the point, what relation does the
amount of cheating have to do with the stiffness
of penalty attached, if the cheater is caught? That
depends entirely on something else; it depends on
the same thing for the lack of which a successful
honor system is impossible; and that is, the favor-
able attitude of the student body as a whole towards
honesty in school affairs. There is a very good case
in which two colleges exist side by side, on the
same campus. In College A, if the proctor catches
a student cheating, the student is sent home, and his
name is published; but his classmates sympathize
with him, and the cheating goes on in wholesale
fashion. In College P&gt;, where an honor system is
in vogue, the violator is sent home, but the penalty
is less severe, in that his name is1 not published;
instead of having the sympathy of his classmates,
he has their contempt, and cheating is a fairly rare
thing. What relation has formal punishment to the
amount of cheating done? Far less than has the
opinion of one's1 fellows.
As the favorable attitude of the average student
towards the honor system is vitally necessary to
the success of it. in which schools may we expect
success, and in which, failure? That is, are there
student bodies in which the element of crooked-
ness is so pronounced that general honesty is bound
to be submerged? Again, 1 refer you to certain
of the opinionated gentlemen who opposed, in the
columns of the Michigan Daily the introduc-
tion of an honor system into the Literary College.
Some of these writers like to say that the student
body over there is so "heterogeneous" as to pre-
clude any hope of success. Do they mean that
everv degree of intelligence may be found among
the "Lit" students? Hardly. Even if true, that
point has no bearing. Do they mean that many
races are represented in that undergraduate body?
If so, what of it? Uo they mean that those stu-
3ents come from all over the United States, and
are therefore bound to represent unchangeable de-

grees of honesty? If they mean that, they certainly
have not made the point clear. No, the only infer-
ence I can draw from their remarks about hetero-
geneity is this: they mean that a large percentage
of the "Lit" students are dishonest, and are going
to insist on staying that way, honor system or
none. I think that the student body concerned
should appreciate having this pointed out to them.
If the degree of dishonesty is as high as these argu-
ers would have us believe, then is the situation any-
thing to be proud of? Should it be continued as it
is? Could it be made any worse by having an
honor system? If the situation is really a bad one,
some radical clean-up measures ought to be taken,
and there is no better wa\ of cleaning house than
by introducing an honor system and letting the
honor committee go after the first violators in a
way that leaves no doubt in the minds of those who
intend to get by, no matter what the means.
There are any number of facts leading to tin-
conclusion that the average person is in ninety-five
per cent of the cases honest, if trusted. Also, that
if distrusted, most of us will at times do something
to earn the suspicion. The honor part of the honor
system gives the ninety-five per cent a chance to be
natural; and the penalty part of the honor system
is necessary only to take care of very small per-
centages who should not be allowed to contaminate
otherwise honest students by the example of their
actions.
In my former article I said that I believed that
the honor system in the Engineering College, good
as it is, might experience a breakdown at any time.
A statement of this sort should be backed up.
Please let everyone understand that what will be
said is in no wise meant as criticism of the Honor
Committee. We have our honor system, it is work-
ing according to its rules, and the Honor Commit-
tee is following out its instructions to the letter.
I am criticizing the system itself.
First, education: our freshmen are told, in a part
of one assembly, something about the honor sys-
tem. That, so far is I know, completes our educa-
tional program. Second, follow-up work: none.
Third, published stories about the honor system:
none. Fourth, publication of names of violators:
not permitted. Fifth, publication of the facts of
cases of violations, without names: none. Sixth,
how vigorously can the Honor Committee act to
defend the honor system against unwarranted at-
tacks and statements, such as are habitually made
by persons who should know better?—no defense;
the Committee should be instructed to assume
power to deal with such attacks, no matter who
makes the assault: it is the insidious remark
dropped here and there, that breaks down morale.
These are not all of the weak points, but they
ate the important ones. Now how about a possible
break-down? As Honor Committee actions are not
given any publicity, it can easily happen that some
student may attend school for two or three years
without hearing of a single case being taken up, or
i,f ever having been taken up. He may happen to
see some cheating which he should have reported,
but did not. He may hear one of those rumors to
the effect that there is lots of cheating going on.
about which nothing is done; in fact, he may read in
the Daily about alleged wholesale cheating, every
time one or more of those peculiar-minded "sus-
picionists" get into print. Then if his particular
crowd reacts the same way he does, and if none of
them have heard much about the honor system for
a long time, he may, if weak, "get by" with some
cheating. Imperfectly formed as our honor system
is, the surprising thing is that it works so well.
Does it? It certainly does, and if anyone wants de-
tailed proof of that statement, let him ask for it.
We are particularly fortunate in not having more
trouble in the freshman class. We take freshmen
from any number of high schools, and that means
that many of them, if not expert at cribbing, at
least have had every chance to observe the game
and learn it. Then we expect them, after one fif-
teen-minute lecture, to be perfectly familiar with
what the honor system expects of them. Give the
freshman a chance to realize fully just what the
game is that is being played, and you can trust
him, in nearly every case, to go the limit with it.
no matter what his background may have been.
As an earnest supporter of the honor system
idea, and of Michigan, I do not like to admit that
some other schools can do a better job than we
can. I hope that the honor system can in the near
future be made a subject for discussion in the Engi-
neering College, and that the system we now have
may be greatly improved.
A word about reporting violations is in order.
Again using as examples the statements of recent
opposers of the honor system who got their opin-
ions into the Daily, it would seem that for one stu-
dent to report another would first, be tale-bearing,
and second, would not be done anyway. Well, it
is certainly sure that no decent student would ever,
under the proctor system, tell the proctor about
cheating he had seen. I never heard of such a
thing. That indeed smacks of tale-bearing. But
under the operation of an honor system, to report
a cheat is not tale-bearing, and should not be looked
upon as such. Only by proper education of the
student-public, by methods such as outlined in the
case of the University of Virginia, can such dis-
tinctions become universally understood and agreed
upon. So much for that. Now, suppose someone
does cheat, and another person sees it, and fails to
report. Has the honor system broken down? Yes.

IX this, the highly commercialized age. it is some-
times well to give a thought to the engineering
lying behind the design of some small, though im-
portant parts, of the automobile engine. The car-
buretor, to the casual observer, is just small pecu-
liarly shaped pieces of metal to which the fuel is
piped and into which the air is induced: a mixing
device in the main.
The observations set forth are correct, but if the
complexity of duties were itemized the name mix-
ing device could not be normally used. It is true
the carburetor by virtue of the change in air flow
governs the fuel flow to the engine and in so doing,
satisfies the engine's desires.
An automobile engine inherently has a certain
thermal efficiency. The ideal carburetor system
will allow that engine to develop that maximum
efficiency. The foregoing statement implies much,
especially in an automobile power plant using
present day gasolines.
Much has been done in controlling cumbustion in
sieam power plants in order to maintain high ef-
ficiency. Here the rate of change in the fuel burned
per unit time is rather small compared with the
•variety of conditions the internal combustion en-
gine encounters. This power plant must be operat-
ing under load, with proper combustion, within a
very few moments after starting cold. The follow-
ing moment it must idle slowly, and perhaps, the
next, full load under acceleration to perhaps 2.000
revolutions per minute. Some cars now require the
top speed to be as high as 4,000 R.l'.M.
Using the liquid fuel available today, and no
doubt, tomorrow will supply the same, the engine
must start at zero Fahrenheit with a combustible
mixture in each cylinder. This condition involves
a real distributing system or intake manifold.
From the intake manifold the charge must travel
thru the engine port to the proper valve ami then
into the receiving cylinder, ready for combustion
after compression. Thus unless the intake mani-
fold, engine ports, and valves are considered as
parts of the carburetor system, trouble will be ex-
perienced.
To sum the main requirements necessary for posi-
tive carburetion of a multi-cylinder engine, the fol-
lowing points are essential.
(1) Proper temperatures maintained for fuel dis-
tribution and combustion.
(2) Correct metering of the fuel to the air to al-
low high thermal efficiency and high power
development.
(3) Ample capacities through ducts for flow of
combustible charge.
(4) Proper means for changing engine speeds
and loads, i.e., acceleration.
(5) Minimizing warm up period by providing
automatic fuel control to maintain proper mixture
proportions at all temperatures.
During and immediately following the World
War, the meagre carburetion technology available
was realized and several laboratories attacked the
pioblems from many viewpoints. As time passed
these data were made public property until today
the results are comprehensive but by no means com-
plete. The author was fortunate in being connected

with a laboratory starting this work and hence, was
able to follow the results step by step. The re-
search laboratory at Purdue University is shown in
part by Figure 1. The tests conducted here were
mainly to determnie the proper temperatures for
good carburetion when using regular commercial
gasoline; and to block out the metering character-
istics (fuel-air ratios) required by various auto-
motive engines.
Until the proper manifold temperatures are de-
termined little can be done in specifying a carbure-
tor to deliver the proper metering characteristics.
To illustrate this point, Figure 2 is included to
show how this temperature is established. The en-
gine was run with varying- mixture iratios and
throughout the whole range of normal mixture
temperatures in the manifold. The result is appar-
ent at once. With the engine used and under this
load and speed condition, 80 degrees F. is the low-
est mixture temperature desirable. Curve A, shows
that the brake thermal efficiency is nearly maximum
at 80 degrees F., curve B, that the power is not ap-
preciably decreased due to the lower volumetric
efficiency; curve C, that the mixture giving maxi-
mum power at that throttle opening is the leanest
possible and curve D, the mixture for maximum
efficiency is nearly the leanest possible.
With the foregoing tests repeated at the various
loads and speeds the temperatures required for the
best operation are evolved. Once the proper tem-
peratures are established the fuel-air ratios can be
found by using nearly the same method. The re-
sults in the final analysis are stated in the following
paragraphs, parts of which are taken from one of
my bulletins published by The Purdue University
Engineering Experiment Station.
"The exact value that the ratio of fuel to air
(mixture) should assume at any time is dependent
upon the n.ixture required by the engine for the
condition under which it is operating at that in-
stant. The ideal mixture is one which is homo-
geneous throughout, and of such a composition as
to enable the engine to develop maximum economy
but one which may be suitably altered to permit
development of the maximum power when required.
The quantitative values that the fuel-air ratio must
attain for each condition of engine operation have
been determined by previous researches on engines,
and are shown by the curve of Figure 3.
There are three (3) conditions of engine opera-
tion which may occur: (1) the engine may operate
under a constant load with varying speed; (2) the
speed of the engine may remain constant ancl the
load change; (3) both the speed and the load may
change simultaneously. Of there three conditions
of operation, the third is the one which normally
occurs in the case of passenger car engines. How-
ever, in order to understand precisely what strength
of mixture the engine requires under each condition
of operation, it is necessary to study only the re-
quirements for constant engine speed and constant
engine load.
When an engine is operating at constant speed
it is found by experiment that the air flow required
at full load is practically four times that required
at no-load operation. For the case of constant en-
gine load and assumed constant volumetric ef-
ficiency, the air flowing to the engine is directly
proportional to the piston displacement; that is, to
the engine speed. Hence, the engine load is readily
expressed in terms of air flow for any constant en-
gine speed.
It is common experience that the engine requires
a much richer mixture at the very light loads, and
also when it is called upon to develop its maximum
possible power. For the intervening loads, the
engine will operate satisfactorily with a much leaner
mixture. These facts are illustrated by the curve
of "ideal mixtures," shown in Figure 3. From this
curve it is seen that the ideal carburetor must
furnish the engine with a considerable range of mix-
tures depending upon the engine load, i.e., upon the
air-flow rate. For no-load operation the mixture
required is 0.0825 pounds of gasoline per pound of
dry air. As the load increases the mixture required
leaner, until it reaches a value of 0.0625 pounds of
gasoline per pound of dry air.
The strength of the required mixture then re-
mains constant (0.0625) up to full load (open
throttle). At full load the engine is required to de-
l?ver its maximum power and the 0.0625 mixture
enables the engine to develop only from 92 to 95
per cent of this amount. Hence, the mixture must
be enriched to about 0.0775 pounds of gasoline per
pound of dry air, when maximum power will be ob-
tained.
In the case of an engine operating under full load
(torque), or a constant fraction thereof, a change in
speed does not require a change in mixture strength,
that is, if the engine is operating with X per cent of
full load, and with an engine speed of N R.P.M.,
FIGURE 2.


Page 13

the mixture required for economical operation with
X per cent load remains constant no matter what
value N may attain. Hence, the "ideal mixture"
curve of Figure 3, gives the mixture required for
FIGURE 3.
satisfactory operation for any engine load, irrespec-
tive of the engine's speed.
The curve just discussed makes a four per cent
enrichment allowance for uncertainty in metering
by the carbureter. This is necessary since the mix-
ture for maximum economy is seen in the figure to
be quite close to the lean limit of inflammability.
By using the "ideal mixture" curve of Figure 3
for a basis, and knowing the maximum air-flow
nites for different constant speeds for a given en-
gine, it is possible to construct a set of curves such
as are shown in Figure 4, which determine the exact
mixtures the carburetor must furnish the engine
for several different conditions of constant-speed
operation. Thus the curves ABC, DEF, etc., repre-
sent the engine mixture requirements which the
carburetor must satisfy for a change in engine load
alone. The points labeled A, D. G and K represent
the no-load mixtures which the carburetor must
furnish at different engine speeds. Since an auto-
motive engine is rarely, if ever, operated with no
load at high speeds, such points as D, C and K are
not of great importance. On the other hand, it is
of great importance that the carburetor should fur-
nish the engine with the correct mixture for idling
at the lower speeds.
The size of the manifold and carburetor must be
of sufficient capacity to allow maximum power de-
velopment. Now if the dimensions are excessively
large, poor operation at the lower speeds and part
loads will result. However, the total frictional loss
in the carburetor and manifold should be kept as
low as practicable. A large frictional loss decreases
the absolute intake pressure, and hence the density
and amount of the charge entering the engine cylin-
der. Thus, since engine power depends primarily
upon the weight of charge and not upon volume, a
Lrge pressure drop in the carburetor results in a
decrease of engine power. Moreover, since the
thermal efficiency of the engine cycle decreases as
the value of the compression pressure is decreased,
a low intake pressure resulting from a large pres-
sure loss through the carburetor decreases the com-
pression pressure and causes a corresponding lower-
ing of efficiency (full load).
The public demands instantaneous and smooth
acceleration. This imposes a change of engine speed
and load and if the proper economical mixtures are
used they are too weak if the throttle is rapidly
opened to take care of the sudden change. For such
a change in operation, as in acceleration on level
road, the engine requires a rich mixture which will
enable it to develop high power until regular flow
conditions are once again established. This means
that the carburetor must be so designed that on
such occasions, it will provide the difference be-
tween the fuel which is required for high power
development and that needed for economical engine
operation, until the transition is completed. When
the regular engine operation conditions are reestab-
lished, the carburetor should react correspondingly
and again furnish the engine with the constant con-
dition mixtures.
Now, if the world were so constructed that our
atmosphere were isothermal the foregoing would be
sufficient, but in this climate we have had winter
most of the year (1926) so the carburetion system
must be flexible and adapt itself to temperature
changes. Normally, the engine on warming can
utilize leaner and leaner fuel-air mixtures. The
carburetor in many instances furnishes richer and
richer mixtures as it warms. This is due to the re-
sulting changes in fuel viscosity and in the densities
of both air and fuel. Thus, the engine and carbure-
tor are actually working in opposition. However,
no*
FIGURE 4.
in the ideal carburetor, the mixture ratios would
automatically become leaner as the engine warmed
until the proper metering was effected at normal
engine temperatures.

THE NEED FOR RESEARCH, MOTHER OF PROGRESS
By ALBERT WHITE, Sc. D.
Director of the Department of Engineering Research, I nirersily of Michigan

UR State has made a record of which we may
be particularly proud. It was the first to es-
THE EAST ENGINEERING BUILDING
lahlish state-supported
higher education. It has
always loyally provided
for its universities and
colleges. It has viewed
educational programs and
policies in a broad way
and for these reasons the
State of Michigan has
been looked upon as the
mother (/f Stat.- universi-
ties. Her three collegiate
institutions aie the Uni-
versity of Michigan, the
Michigan State College THE OLD ENGINEERING BUILDING
and the Michigan College of Mines. Just a word
will be said with regard to the first two.
The University of Michigan was founded in 1837.
Its income was mainly from land grants made to
it by the legislature of Michigan. These grants
were almost invariably well located and were sold
at a good price, but would have brought much
larger returns had their sales been less hasty. For
instance, one of the tracts was in what is now the
heart of Toledo and is in consequence worth mil-
lions today. It was not until 1867, thirty years
after the University was established, that the State
appropriated actual funds for its support. The first
appropriation was for $15.000. Today the Univer-
sity is receiving annually from the State approxi-
mately $3,700,000 for operating expenses in addi-
tion to large appropriations for new buildings.
Michigan State College was formally opened in
.May, 1857. It w-as the first agricultural school in
the United States. Its early income was mainly
from land grants. In 1923 it received $139,461.98
from various government funds, mainly from tin.-
Morrill-Nelson fund, $750.000.00 from the State and
$44(3,589.00 from other sources, making a total of
$1,336,050.98. In addition the Agricultural Experi-
r.ient station received $30.000.00 from the Federal
government. $180,0(X).(X) from the State and $12.-
378.00 from earnings for a total of $222,378.00.
These figures are given not for the purpose of in-
troducing a mass of tabulations, but for the purpose
of bringing home the very substantial way in which
the State has supported, and is now supporting
higher education.
Yet, practical!y none of these appropriations are
available for pure research unless possibly some of
the funds for the Agricultural Experiment Station.
It is quite true that most
of the members of the
teaching staffs in the tw«.
schools are employed
with the expectation that
they will devote a portion
of their time to research.
The schedules of most are
so arranged that they can
do so. Promotions are de-
termined to a degree, up-
on research interest and
accomplishments. Such
a program is most desir-
able. Under no condi-

tions should it he superseded. Yet we may very
rightly ask ourselves the question, if it should not
be amplified, aided and ahetted by adequate finan-
cial support.
Our universities, government bureaus and var-
ious organized research agencies have shown fine
accomplishment with the limited means at their
disposal. The whole amount available for re-
search in the pure sciences has not exceeded $10,-
000,000.00 a year. Our agricultural colleges and
experiment stations, as well as our industrial labo-
latories and certain of our government bureaus
have done better in the matter of procuring funds
for applied research. These agencies are probably
today spending $200,000.00 annually.
Yet the wealth of this country has multiplied far
faster than have the funds for pure and applied
science research. The funds for these purposes are
the merest bagatelle to the funds of industry and
commerce. Scientific work is seriously impeded by
the lack of funds. The Nation is suffering an eco-
nomic loss of an untold amount.
Pure science research does not employ over 500
full time technically trained workers. Possibly this
country has 5000 pure science research workers
who devote a portion of their time to research.
Most of these men are at our universities. Ap-
plied science investigation, on the other hand, uses
the services of about 30,000 workers. Yet a total
of 35,500 workers is a niggardly number for this all
important work. Some have stated we should
spend 5 per cent of the earnings on research. If
that meant that 5 per cent of the population should
labor in this field, then in place of 35,500 workers
the field would witness 1,100,0(X) workers, assuming
a family of five for every worker.
These are interesting figures; yet, unless we are
able to create interest in pure research, unless we
can draw into this field through adequate financial
inducements those who by training and mental
qualifications are fitted for this work our fount of
pure science will dry up. This will in time result
in stagnation in the field of applied science investi-
gation, resulting in an economic loss to our nation
beyond calculation.
To date we have been largely a nation of pio-
neers. We are still to a degree in that class al-
though we are rapidly emerging from that status.
We little know or appreciate the value of research.
Only a few of our industries maintain research lab-
oratories. Some may have been so bold as to have
termed them as such, but if so designated they were
that in name only. Most laboratories in our indus-
trial companies are operated as control laborato-
ries, not as research laboratories. Possibly com-
panies are justified in maintaining only control
laboratories, but, if so, only when by act, word and
deed they are willing to assist in the advancement
of pure science, for to pure science they must look
for the advancement of the future.
How outstanding some of these changes have
been is revealed by even a most casual retrospec-
tion. The development of synthetic dyes has de-
stroyed whole industries and built up others. Far-
aday's dynamo has changed the entire life of this
and other countries. Instead of lighting our homes
with fagots, candles, kerosene lamps, or gas. we
now employ the incandescent lamp, which, in place
of the carbon filament type of the early days, is
now a tungsten filament, argon filled bulb. As a
nation this improved bulb saves us $5(X),000.000
annually. That is, if we were to get the same de-
gree of illumination from the carbon filament lamps
as we now get from the argon filament lamps, it
would cost us $500,000.(X)0 more.
Instead of running our factories with the old-
fashioned water wheels or with shafting operated
from reciprocating engines, we are placing individ-
ual motor drives on every machine. Our telephones
and telegraph have broken down the barriers of
distance. Permalloy, recently developed in tin-
laboratories of the Western Electric Company,
permits messages to be transmitted IX times faster
than formerly. The automobile is changing city
life from one of cliff dwelling to one agrarian in
character.
Science has entered into agriculture to as full, if
not a fuller degree, than it has into industry. Our
housewives are today buying lemons artificially
yellowed. The growth of pineapples in Hawaii and
elsewhere has been increased four-fold through

spraying the trees with an iron salt, seed propaga-
tion, plant nourishment, the influence of light; and
a hundred and one other subjects are receiving at-
tention.
Through the Department of Engineering Re-
search of our University a definite channel has been
established for the encouragement and propagation
of research. Manufacturers, both within and with-

cut the State, have an opportunity through it to
carry on research work virtually at actual cost.
The vast library, laboratory and equipment facili-
ties of the University are placed at the service of
industry in the interests of research. Likewise the
services of the University staff, numbering as it
does well over 500 and extending into all fields, are
available when arrangements are such as to meet
with the approval of the University persons desired.
Since the Department began it has worked on
approximately 365 projects. Most of these have
been carried to completion although the Depart-
ment is at this moment engaged on about forty
projects. These are in the fields of mechanical engi-
neering, electrical engineering, chemical engineer-
ing, engineering mechanics, physics, forestry,
chemistry and other scientfic departments. In addi-
tion, we are engaged in developing forty or fifty
tentative projects, most of which are of considerable
magnitude and scope. We do not, however, wish
to leave the impression that we expect all
of these tentative projects to materialize. One
meets with about the same degree of success in
receiving authorizations for problems as one does
in fishing, especially fly-cast fishing. Everyone
realizes that one has to cast a number of times be-
fore getting a strike. In the same way a conaider-
able number of problems come to the department's
attention before one materializes.
The following problems will be briefly touched
upon in order that you may be advised of the scop1;
of the work done to date.
Under the direction of Professor J. E. Emswilcr
a comprehensive study of natural ventilation has
been made for the Detroit Steel Products Com-
pany.
Professor B. F. Bailey of the Electrical Engineer-
ing Department has made some very substantial
contributions to our knowledge of the single phase
motor.
Professor Rich and Mr. Firestone have done some
outstanding work in the application of physics to
engineering. They have developed a machine
which measures the degree of noise of every one of
the twelve million bearings produced annually by
The Timken Roller Bearing Company. They have
developed a machine to measure the depth of case
in the rolls. They have developed a machine to de-
termine infinitesimal flaws and checks in the rolls
of the bearings, an inspection procedure which pre-
vious to the use of the machine required the em-
ployment of 200 girls.
Professor H. H. Higbie has done a most valuable
piece of work in the matter of natural illumination.
Professor A. H. White has made a vital study
relative to the nature and characteristics of gyp-
sum as a roofing material.
Professors Hoad and Decker have made an ex-
tensive study of industrial wastes in Flint for the
Flint Manufacturers' Association.
Professor E. H. Leslie has made a very extended
study of motor fuels for the White Star Refining
Company.
Professor Menefee is making a splendid study of
the characteristics of water pipe for the Water De-
partment of the City of Detroit.
THE DETECTION OF SURFACE FLAWS IN ROLLER-
BEARINGS—THE UTILIZATION OF THE PHOTO-ELEC-
TRIC PRINCIPLE.
Professor Craig is studying hard wood substi-
tutes for one of our large automobile companies.
Mr. Walter Jominy, an associate investigator in
the Department, has completed an extensive survey
of the specific characteristics of charcoal iron for
the charcoal iron research group.
Two other important studies have just recently
been received. One, for the Consumers Power
Company, deals with a case of severe corrosion
which the company has recently experienced.
The other is for one of our large paper compa-
nies.
These are but a few of the many problems on
which work has and is being done. They will
serve, however, to give some idea of the wide vari-
ety of the investigations.
Those who are shaping the policies of the De-
partment will not be satisfied until adequate finan-
cial support for abstract research is provided from
both private and public funds. These are necessary
if our universities are to hold their place in the pro-
cession of progress.
Pure science is like an advance of allied armies,
each sending forth its skirmishers, each busy ex-
tending its front, in establishing contact with others
and in consolidating ground already won. The ap-
plication of that knowledge is like the civil occu-
pation which follows the army. The progress of
the civil occupation is limited by that of the army;

A POSSIBLE SOLUTION OF BUILDING PROBLEMS*
By H. W. (JOULDTHORPE, '27 E
THE problem of finding a building material d;ite back to 50 A. D., the time of Pliny, who in his
to supplant the more costly, and in many cases Natural History treated the subject as follows:
unsatisfactory, materials used in present-day prac- "Have we not in Africa and Spain walls of earth

sideration; especially now, with the rapidly increas-
ing demand. At first it was hoped that concrete
would furnish these necessary qualities of moder-
ate building expense, durability, fine appearance
and convenience, but at its best concrete proved
little different, in the final analysis, from the meth-
ods previously employed.
These demands have led to the investigation of
"rammed earth" as a building material. Very little
is known of rammed earth in America, since, when
it was first proposed, the country was overrich in
timber lands which had to be cleared to accommo-
date the agricultural and industrial programs just
launched in the New World. In Europe and Africa,
however, rammed earth or "pise de terre," as the
French call it, is not at all uncommon. So far, it
has been used more extensively in the rural dis-
tricts than in the cities, lending itself perfectly to
the architecture of the country—the architecture
which everyone now is trying to copy.

moulded rather than built, by enclosing the earth
within a frame of boards constructed on either
side? These walls will last for centuries, are proof
against rain, frost, and fire, and are superior in
solidity to any cement. Even at this day, Spain
has watchtowers that were erected by Hannibal
with this type of construction." The towers of
which Pliny spoke were built about 150 B. C.
This connection with Rome most likely explains
the spreading of the idea to Africa and the invaded
European countries. From here it apparently came
down by usage to the present. In this country a
few of the early settlers put it to trial successfully,
The oldest house in the United States, a fortress at

island and Thirteenth avenues still stands the work,

ered the outside walls with a coating of pebble-dash.
Today the house, quite modern, is occupied as it
has been for more than a century and a half. Rec-
ords picture Thomas Jefferson as having proposed
the use of rammed earth to the colonists, but a&gt;
pointed out before they had no need for it.
Within the last two or three years a few travelers
in Europe, seeing remarkable exhibitions of this
old art, have come to appreciate its possibilities as
a material for modern house construction and have-
rather hesitatinglv reintroduccd it in this country.
One enthusiast went so far as to build a modern
home in the suburbs of Washington, and with such
success that scores of other small buildings have
gone up in various parts of the United States. Hav-
ing individually satisfied themselves by simple
weathering experiments, quite a number of people
arc now erecting houses of this construction.
Advantages of Rammed Earth
To fulfill, then, the first requisite, moder-
ate cost; in most cases the earth removed in
excavation may be used directly in the walls. Ex-
periments carried out in the testing laboratory.
University of Michigan, under the direction of Pro-
fessor F. N. Mcnefee, show that any inorganic soil
ranging in clay content from twenty to thirty-five
per cent, which well includes the average, may be
used when the tamping is done mechanically. This
assures the first double saving over ordinary meth-
ods; the building material is purchased with the
plot and the second large cost, that of transporta-
tion, is eliminated entirely. The cost of the walls
is that of the door and window casings and of the

labor to ram the earth into the moulds. The walls
produced by machine ramming resemble a plas-
tered surface except for color; this suggests the
use of a cement paint, doing away with lath and
plaster, another large expense. The exterior should
be finished with a water resisting surfacing as the
type if house calls for, stucco, cement paint, pebble-
dash, etc.
In pise construction there is no call for the skilled
i'lbor that many of the other types require. In fact,
this is known in certain parts of Russia as "se-
main," which means that the owner mav build for

E. W. Coffin, a Washington mechanical engineer,
from observations made during the erecting of Dr.
Harry B. Humphrey's rammed earth home in Glen
Echo, Maryland, has estimated the cost as less than
one-fourth the cost of brick, less than one-half the
cost of concrete, and at least two-thirds less than
that of subsided frame.
That the structure is durable, a second require-
ment, is not difficult to demonstrate by example.
The two buildings cited in our own country at St.
Augustine and Washington, defiant to wrecking
rams, show an increase in hardness of the walls
with age. The skeptic might point to the warm
southern climate as the reason, but he is immedi-
ately referred to the still more striking examples
of England which have withstood the rain for over
a century as proved by the coating of whitewash,
more than an inch and a half thick in many places;
to the exposed walls in Norway and Sweden whose
climate is even more severe than our own, or to the
"semain" cottages of the Volga in Russia. All of
these, it should be remembered, were made by the
inferior and cruder hand ramming methods, giving
walls of much less density than may be attained
by the modern air-hammer. Test cylinders pro-
duced by this latter method have been studied.
Samples of earth taken from different localities and
mixtures of these to obtain definite clay contents
have been rammed and tested. An average com-

THE AUTOMOBILE HEADLIGHTING PROBLEM
By HEMPSTEAD S. BULL, E. K.
Instructor In Electrical Engineering
AX introductory paragraph is always justified if
it indicates the scope of the article that follows,
so that the reader may choose, without undue loss
of time, the material most likely to be read with
profit. In the present instance this desideratum
may be quickly accomplished. It is intended to
present here a few features of the origin, present
status and probable trend of the so-called headlight
problem, together with some of the difficulties en-
countered in its study and some noteworthy steps
that have been taken to improve conditions.
A long drive after dark was quite an undertaking
about fifteen years ago; roads were rough, chassis
springs were ineffective and the kerosene and acety-
lene lamps of that period produced a flickering il-
lumination that did not add greatly to the driver's
comfort. The following years witnessed marked
improvements in roads, chassis design and automo-
bile lamps, but it is interesting to note that the
comfort and security of the night driver did not
increase in a like degree. In fact the physical
strain of night driving thru traffic is commonly
stated to be greater than ever before.
The chief causes of the ever-increasing com-
plexity of the problem can be easily enumerated.
1. The large number of smooth, dark-surfaced
toads. Their easy-riding characteristics are greatly
appreciated by every motorist, but in light reflect-
ing properties they are decidedly inferior to good
gravel or dirt roads. They not only absorb more
light but they reflect a greater amount ahead in the
direction of travel, whereas it is the component
which returns to the driver's eyes that is most
useful.
2. The universal adoption of electric starting
and lighting equipment on pleasure cars. Not only
were headlamp manufacturers enabled to eliminate
the flicker necessarily associated with flame lamps
but they also proceeded to reduce the dimensions
of the light source and to increase its brilliancy.
Smaller sources made it possible to project the light
rays in sharply defined beams—a distinct improve-
ment; but as the brilliancy was also increased the
confusion to approaching drivers caused by incor-
rectly tilted or poorly focused lamps became dan-
gerous.
3. Higher average driving speed. It should be
evident that this complicated and intensified the
road lighting problem; the head lights must pene-
trate to greater distances to make such speeds safe.
4. The rapid increase in traffic density. The
effect of this is so apparent that no further com-
ments will be made.
The seriousness of the situation is not so sur-
prising when the above facts are considered. What
can be said for the efforts that have been made to
improve night driving conditions? There are sev-
eral important aspects that should be considered
in a complete survey of the problem, but let us ex-
clude all but one, the headlamp itself, and study
that a little.
Has the ideal headlamp been devised? The lead-
ers in this field are pretty well agreed that the ideal
has not been found. Is it likely that a new and radic-
ally different design will be perfected? On this
the experts are not in such accord. Most of them
are quite doubtful of the likelihood of important
advances in design, and they advise ambitious re-
searchers to confine their efforts to the improve-
ment of the mechanical and optical construction of
the lamps now available.
What features does the problem of automobile
headlighting possess that make it so difficult of
solution? These can be conveniently considered
under five topics.
A. The conflict between visibility requirements
and glare.
The amount of road illumination required to suit
the average night driver is surprisingly small com-
pared to daylight conditions, after the eyes have
once adapted themselves properly. But rapid
changes in the amount of illumination have a blind-
ing or dazzling effect, and the discomfort resulting
from a strong beam suddenly directed towards one's
eyes when adapted to dim surroundings is a com-
mon experience of every driver. Conversely, if the
eyes are adapted to a bright field of view and are
suddenly directed to a dim region a similar sensa-
tion results. The first mentioned is observed much
more frequently than the second, and is commonly
known as glare.
From the standpoint of visibility requirements a
high powered headlamp beam is very desirable, for
it illuminates the road and its boundaries for a long
distance ahead of the car. From the standpoint of
the approaching driver such a beam is always un-
comfortable and may in fact be dangerous. Danger
accompanies the sensation of glare; glare results
from high intensity rays straying from their proper

path towards the approaching driver as he turns out
to pass by; the wayward rays may come from a
headlamp that is improperly designed or imper-
fectly adjusted or even from a good lamp in proper
adjustment if the road
is steeply crowned or
rough, or if the covtr
glass is spotted with
dirty water.
B. The uncertainty
as to the most desirable
beam pattern.
There is pretty good
reason to believe that the
road illumination produced by headlamps should
have the same uniformity of distribution that is pro-
vided for us by daylight. Practically all of the
headlamp manufacturers have attempted to meet
this requirement and some of them have had sur-
prising success. The matter of determining what
portion of the roadway and its boundaries shall be so
illuminated and what portions shall be left in dark-
ness remains a subject for considerable discussion.
It is obvious that some selection is necessary. Fur-
thermore it is a question whether the boundary
separating the illuminated portion from darkness
should be sharply defined or whether one portion
should blend into the other with a more gradual
change of intensity. See Figs. 1, 2 and 3.
There are still other questions bothering the en-
gineer. Should the right side of the road be
favored with a little higher illumination than the
left or should the whole road be equally lighted?
Should the lamps be mounted high or low, far
apart or close together? Should there be two
Irmps or more than two? Should their beams be
similar or different in pattern? These questions
are all being asked today and no one has accumu-
lated sufficient fundamental data to be able to
answer any of them conclusively. This is quite cer-
tain however:—there must be a high intensity por-
tion of the beam in order to illuminate the distant
stretch of road, and this intense portion must be
prevented from striking the eyes of approaching
drivers.
C. Practical difficulties of headlamp design.
In order to be successful in confining the rays
from a paraboloidal reflector to a small diameter
beam the light source must approach the dimen-
sions of a point. Unfortunately a comparatively
large filament is required to produce- the large
amount of light which a headlamp bulb must sup-
ply. This means that some of the light produced is
not properly directed by the reflector.
The most common beam pattern used today is
somewhat fan-shaped with the light spread out
across the road. The accurate placing of light rays
in a definite beam pattern requires an accurate op-
tical system. We encounter more difficulties here.
The first is the matter of accurate focusing. If the
filament is not accurately centered at the focal point
of the paraboloidal re-
f lee tor, considerable
scattering of the rays
may result. The effects
of moving the filament
ahead and behind the
focal point are illus-
trated in Fig. 4. It is
equally sensitive to
movement in other di-
rections so that there really should be three focus-
ing screws on each socket, one operating in each
dimension. The general practise is to provide an
adjusting screw for front and back motion and
trust the lamp bulb manufacturer to mount the fila-
ment symmetrically.
Another difficulty is that of obtaining the proper
curvature in the reflector. For the sake of economy
it is desirable to punch them out of thin sheet metal
and there is a considerable amount of trouble in
making a punch that will press them in such a way
that they will spring into true paraboloidal form as
soon as the punch is withdrawn. Also, there is the
matter of providing the reflector with a mirror-like
surface that will not corrode or tarnish.
The mechanical features of the headlamp present
additional troubles. The parts must be adapted to
quantity production methods, yet they must be true
and tight fitting to keep out water and dust, and the
bulb must be easily renewed and easily adjusted in
position by the most ignorant owner. Of such are
the troubles of the headlamp manufacturer.
1). The personal element of the driver.
One of the biggest obstacles to a conclusive de-
termination of the best beam pattern is the fact that
drivers differ considerably in their illumination re-
quirements. A particular arrangement or intensity
of light that just suits one will be quite objection-
able to another. Some can defend their choice with
good reason; others evidently are influenced by
long-established habit, or by their needs merely as
they imagine them. The differences in require-
ments exist, nevertheless, and must be considered.
Another personal factor is the preference of one
driver for speeds of 40 to 50 miles an hour while
another prefers the range between 20 and 30. The
illumination requirements of the first materially ex-
ceed those of the second. The mental alertness of
the driver is another variable quantity which has an
obvious bearing on his illumination needs. Even
the apparently insignificant matter of allowing the
lamp glasses and windshield to become spotted and
dirty has a definite bearing on safety and comfort

of night driving, and the attention paid to this detail
is another variable.
E. Lighting legislation.
The rapid growth of night traffic together with
the increase in accidents occurring at night stimu-
lated the passage of quantities of legislation in the
FIGURE 2. THE POINTS IN THE S. A. E. CHART, AS THE
DRIVER SEES THEM.
various states and in local communities. It is not
surprising that these should differ greatly in scope.
The unfortunate feature is that they are frequently
ambiguous, vague or contradictor}'. The enforce-
ment provisions are equally at variance. In many
cases the judgment of local officials is allowed full
sway without any detailed instructions for guid-
ance. The result can be imagined. This lack of
uniform, sensible, easily enforced regulations has
seriously hampered the manufacturer who must
make his devices legal in all states, and has often
embarrassed and annoyed the automobile owner. It
must be corrected before great improvements can
be attempted in light production and control.
Several serious attempts to provide the working
basis for a uniform headlighting code have been
made recently. A committee, appointed at the
National Conference on Street and Highway Safety
in June, 1925, drew up a Tentative Uniform Vehicle
Act. The Automotive Lighting Association (repre-
senting manufacturers of headlighting equipment)
published a pamphlet in November, 1925 in which
the portions of the Tentative Uniform Vehicle Act
pertaining to lighting regulations and equipment
were carefully criticized and several additions and
changes recommended.
The above mentioned work is the most recent
authoritative effort to remedy conditions. It is hoped
that sufficient pressure will be soon be exerted on
the various legislatures to cause them to revise the
existing codes along the lines suggested.
Now that we have summarized the difficulties of
providing road illumination by headlamps as' re-
gards (a) the conflict between visibility require-
ments and glare, (b) the best beam pattern, (c)
practical difficulties of design, (d) the driver's per-
sonal equation, (e) conflicting legislation, it is in-
teresting to examine the essential features of some
of the headlamps that have been tried in service.
Headlamp manufacturers have followed three
general lines of attack on the problem of providing
light without glare: diffusion, an accurately con-
trolled fixed beam and dimming or deflection of the
beam. The principle involved in the first scheme,
diffusion, is one that has proven successful in the
elimination of glare in interior lighting installations.
The intense beams are broken and scattered by in-
terposing various types of translucent screens. An
example is the so-called Warner lens, one of the
early devices of this sort, consisting of a cover glass,
whose surface was elaborately roughened and
pitted, placed at the mouth of the usual paraboloidal
reflector. The results were not very satisfactory.
When placed over the ordinary size of lamp this
"lens" made the driving light too dim at all points,
while attempts to overcome this by increasing the
candle power of the lamp bulb resulted in intense
glare at all angles. A more recent proposal has
several able defenders. Special high-powered lamp
bulbs, frosted all over, are installed in paraboloidal
reflectors and clear cover glasses are used. The
merits of this system are still the subject of con-
siderable contention.
The possibilities of an accurately controlled fixed
beam have appealed to many engineers. Numerous
arrangements of lenses

and reflectors have been
tried with the hope of so
directing and arranging
the light rays that a satis-
factory road illumination
is secured, with the high
intensity rays kept well
down below the eyes of
approaching drivers. One
quite successful device
consists of a plain para-
boloidal reflector cohered
with a fluted lens; the
flutes so arranged that
the beam is spread side-
ways and bent downward.
Another scheme of equal
merit utilizes a fluted
parabolic reflector, the
flutes so arranged and

bent that they produce u satisfactory spread
and depth to the beam without the aid of a
lens. A clear glass cover is used with this head-
lamp. Occasionally a manufacturer will try some-
thing unusual in design and make a successful ven-
ture. A quite recent example is afforded by a head-
lamp which has an ellipsoidal reflector with the
lamp bulb located at one of the focal points. The
light emerges from a much smaller opening than is
customarily found in parabolic lamps and an effec-
tive re-direction of a larger portion of the total
light rays is claimed by the manufacturer. The cor-
rect depth and spread is obtained by a condensing
lens in the opening. An amber translucent screen
is so placed inside the reflector that it is in the path
of all rays proceeding out in lines above the hori-
zontal, thus reducing the glare sensation for ap-
proaching drivers.
The most recent proposal that can be included in
this group has for its basis an unsymmetric beam
pattern. Two parabolic reflectors with standard
spreading lenses are used. The left-hand lamp is
assembled in the standard manner; but the right
hand lamp is made to produce a twisted beam by
rotating its lens about 15 degrees from the normal
position. The effect on this lamp alone is to de-
press the left portion of the beam and elevate the
right side. With both lamps used the beams melt
together in such a way that the left side appears
about as usual, while the right side penetrates
to approaching cars because the more penetrating
beams are well over on the right side of the road.
Headlamps employing dimming or beam deflec-
tion are now very numerous. In fact several states
require the beams to be dimmed or deflected down-
ward at a suitable angle whenever an approaching
car has come close enough to be bothered by hiph
intensity beams.
The practice of dimming without some sort of
supplementary driving light directed down and to
the right so as to be non-glaring should be ruled off
the road. It has been observed that more accidents
when passing other cars, are due to dimming than
to glare resulting from failure to dim. The illum-
ination on the road after dimming is not only in-
sufficient, but the driver's eyes are temporarily out
of adjustment due to the excessive contrast that
now exists between his field of view ahead of his
car and the lights of the approaching car. If a
properly-focused spot light is aimed at the right
side of the road, say 75 feet ahead of the car, and if
the driver keeps his eyes directed at that spot after
dimming, his vision is not seriously impaired.
A novel beam arrangement, similar to the twisted
beam described in the preceding group, can also be
used in combination with dimming. The left hand
lamp in this case is of the usual type and is so
aimed that its rays travel far down the road and
form a high intensity beam for safety at high
speeds. The right hand lamp is also the standard
FIGURE 4. A GOOD BEAM PATTERN AS IT LOOKS ON THE VERTICAL SCREEN.
farther down the road and at the same time gives
better light on the ditch and on all objects alona
the right hand side of the road. Thus, more distant
penetration is obtained without increasing the glare
construction but is aimed downward so that -i.-
bcam could not possibly be glaring under any nor-
mal circumstances. The left lamp only is placed on
the dimming circuit; when a car approaches, the

TESTING WINGS WITH AN AUTOMOBILE
By E. A. STALKER, M. S.
IT is well known in Aeronautics that the perform-
ance of any wing expressed in coefficients is
conditioned by the size of the wing itself and the
velocity at which the performance is determined.
From the theory, the performance results should
bear a definite relation to the product of the velocity
(V) and the length (L) of the wing in the direction
of the velocity. Tests on
wings are then spoken of
as being conducted at a
specified LV product.
The variations in the per-
formance with the scale
of the test are most
marked with very small
models and small wind
speeds, so that an attempt
is always made to test the
model wing in as large a
size as possible and with
as large a wind velocity
as possible.
When a wind tunnel is
used, the maximum veloc-
ity is fixed by the power
of the motor, and the size
of the model is deter-
mined by the tunnel di-
ameter. In most tunnels
the models arc from
three to six inches in chord and eighteen to thirty
inches in span; the former size is the one used in
the small wind tunnel at this University.
The effect of the small scale of the test is differ-
ent on wings of different thicknesses and cambers,
the thick wings showing in general to poorer ad-
vantage than the thin ones for the same low hV
product. However, when approaching full size
wings, the thick wing improves much more rapidly
than the thin one. This was not appreciated for a
long time by designers, and it has only been re-
cently that thick wings have appeared on airplanes.
An interest in thick high lift wings and the lack
of facilities to test large models led the writer to
try a method that in a different form had been used
by early experimenters. Several attempts were
made in the very earliest days to determine the lift
and resistance of wings in full size by mounting
them on railway cars, and in France today, at the
University of Paris Aerodynamic Laboratory at St.
Cyr, full size airplanes are being tested in this
manner.
The prevalence of smooth concrete roads near
Ann Arbor suggested the possibility of using an
automobile for the prime mover in towing wings
through the air at a considerable speed and in fairly
large sizes.
The main problem was one of mounting the
wings on a dynamometer that would suit the mo-
bile conditions of a car.
It was immediately ap-
parent that the elaborate
methods of the laboratory
were out of the question,
both from the standpoint
of delicacy and cost.
It seemed logical to
measure the moments of
the air forces, rather than
the actual forces, perpen-
dicular and parallel to the
wind direction, since
the application of the re-
sultant air force would al-
ways be at the center of
the span. By so doing,
the wing itself could be
made to form a large por-
tion of the dynamometer.
As may be seen in the
picture, the wing was
supported at a point of
the span remote from the center, creating
an unbalanced air force which could be mea-
sured by its tendency to rotate the wing up-
ward and backward. Two ball bearing hinges,
whose center lines were at right angles to each
other, broke up the air reaction moment into lift
and drag moments. These moments were mea-
sured by two spring balances, the one for the lift
being mounted on the horizontal arm shown in the
picture; the drag balance being mounted near the
driver. A cord from it ran forward and up to a
pulley on the right upright thence to an arm at-
tached to the drag axis shaft. The drag forces were
expected to be small so that this last arm was made
about one-fifth the offset of the span midpoint from
the rotation axis thus magnifying the actual balance
readings.
It was necessary to put the spring balance for the
lift on an arm which could rotate about an axis in
line with the drag axis, to avoid the possibility of a
component of the lift appearing in the drag force.

Laboratory Curiosities of Yesterday Become Commercial Products of Today
Ry SYLVESTER BOYER
SMALL pieces of aluminum and other metals
now commonly known were once displayed as
laboratory curiosities. Chemists had been able to ex-
tract them from their ores by laborious processes,
but they had no commercial applications. Not
alone was the cost of production high, but the prop-
erties of these metals were practically unknown.
Scientists did not stop with discovery, but contin-
ued their researches until they became familiar with
the properties of these metals. It was then merely
a matter of time before commercial applications
were developed and cheaper methods of production
introduced.
A number of metals now in common use were
little known in practical work even a half-century
ago, among them aluminum, magnesium, malybden-
um, manganese, palladium, iridium, osmium, vana-
dium and tungsten. Cobalt, nickel, antimony, bis-
muth, tantalum and certain other metals were
known only in a limited way. Silicon, so abund-
ant in the rocks of the earth, was practically un-
known until produced at Niagara by the electric
furnace twenty-five or thirty years ago. Other
little known elements are coming into use gradually.
on account of special properties which have pos-
sibilities. New uses are being found for even rare
elements, either as the pure metals or in alloys
oftentimes possessing unexpected and remarkable
properties.
Magnesium, first known commercially fifty or
more years ago, was an expensive metal. Produced
in the form of thin ribbon, it was burned as a source
of intense light, particularly for photography at
night. It is now readily separated from its ore
and introduced into alloys, which, though light, are
strong. Silicon, admixed with steel in the form of
ferro-silicon steel, with new properties, has espe-
cially assisted greatly in producing cores for elec-
trical transformers. Tungsten, hardly known at all
a generation ago except as a black metallic powder,
was ultimately produced as a consistent metal and
drawn into wire by the Coolidge process, after re-
markably persistent and ingenious research. It is
now the basic factor in the highly efficient incandes-
cent lamp of today.
Although clear fused quartz has been known in
small quantities for at least thirty years, produc-
tion of high-grade clear fused quartz in large quan-
tities was an achievement of the Thomson Research
Laboratory- of the General Electric Company at
Lynn, Massachusetts, only a few years ago. It is
remarkably transparent and but little affected by
temperatures at which most metals melt.
Gallium was discovered by a French scientist,
Lecoq de Boisbaudran, in 1875, and derived its
name from Gallia, the Latin for France. But little
further work was done with the element. The ex-
istence of such a chemical element had been pre-
dicted several years before. Its characteristic lines
were observed by the discoverer while examining
the spectrum of a piece of zinc blende. Known for
50 years as a rare metal, it never had any commer-
cial use until Sylvester Boyer, in the Thomson Re-
search Laboratory, recently produced the gallium
thermometer for the measurement of higher tem-
peratures than can be measured with mercury-and-
glass' thermometers.
Gallium, when liquid, is similar to mercury in
appearance, but is less than half as heavy. It melts
at about 86 degrees Fahrenheit but often may be
cooled to more than 8 degrees below zero, before
becoming solid. It does not boil (give off vapor)
under 2700 degrees Fahrenheit, its boiling point be-
ing estimated at between 1500 and 2000 degrees
Centigrade, equivalent to about 2700 to 3600 degrees
Fahrenheit. Because of certain impurities the
liquid metal formerly wetted glass and quartz, and
therefore was unsuitable for thermometers. It was
first made suitable for thermometer use by the re-
cent work of Boyer. Quantities of the metal can
now be prepared for whatever uses may be devel-
oped. By utilizing the properties just mentioned
of these two materials a convenient new high-tem-
perature thermometer became practicable. The
quartz-gallium thermometer differs little in appear-
ance from the ordinary mercury thermometer. It
could not be made sooner because the two sub-
stances, although known, were commercially un-
available.
In the United States a source of gallium was dis-
covered ten years ago in the "leady residues" left
after the distillation of zinc from certain ores.
Residues from such ores in Missouri and Oklahoma
contain considerable gallium; but since there were
no commercial uses for gallium, these residues were
sold only for the lead in them.
Science is conquering slowly or rapidly, as you
prefer to look at it. Compared with ancient times,
its conquests now proceed at express speed. From

G. S. Radford: The Control of Quality in Manu-
facturing. Ronald Press Co.
Many books have been written dealing with the
quantity production phases of industry, but few
have devoted much attention to the quality aspects
of this field. "The Control of Quality in Manufac-
turing," by G. S. Radword, constitutes a valuable
addition to the literature of Factory Management,
in that its 390 pages are devoted exclusively to a
discussion of a hitherto somewhat neglected sub-
ject.
A quotation from the preface will show the main
idea underlying the book: "It has been the inten-
tion to show that the control of quality is the cor-
rect starting point for economy—since if quality is
under positive and continuous control increase of
output follows as a by-product advantage." Hence
one of the central thoughts of the book is that in-
creased output and decreased costs are more cer-
tainly attained when manufacturing problems arc
approached with quality, instead of quantity, as
the primary guide and objective.
The twenty-three chapters of the book arc de-
voted to such subjects as: "The Approach to the
Quality Problem," "Types of Inspection," "The
Organization Phases of Inspection and their Rela-
tion to Other Departments," "Measurement and
Errors," "Working Standards and Repetition Man-
ufacturing," "Gauges," etc.

fames Mavor: Niagara in Politics.
In his introduction the author states "The scale
upon which the Hydro-Electric Commission of On-
tario has conducted its experiment in the operation
of public utilities and the propaganda with which
that commission has accompanied its proceedings
have attracted wide attention in the United States
as well as in Canada."
For many years politicians of various hues have
advocated public ownership of public utilities, and
any undertaking of this sort of any magnitude has
been carefully watched by those interested. The
history of the operation of the Hydro-Electric Com-
mission of Ontario as told by the author appears to
be typical, although the scale is rather larger than
usual. The intrusion into politics, inevitable appar-
ently in the operation of a public utility by public
ownership, has never been conducive to the sound
and efficient management to be found in the
stronger public utilities regulated by the Public
Utilities Commission common to the majority of
the States of this country. The contrast between
growth of industry on the American side of Niagara
Falls and the absence of growth on the Canadian
side is pointed to as one of the strongest arguments
for allowing full rewards to industry stimulated
and operated by private initiative and enterprise.
To anyone following the problem of public opera-
tion of public utilities this book will afford a rather
interesting, even if biased account, of one of the
largest undertakings of this1 nature.

stop-and-go regulation. It is interesting to note in
this connection that a lane of traffic under ordinary
stop-and-go regulation passes but slightly more
than one-third as many vehicles per hour as an un-
interrupted lane does.
Outside the express vehicular roadways are the
local roadways, each 20 feet wide and separated
from them by a 5 foot park strip. Openings from
the local to the express roads are so arranged that
traffic can change from one to the other at an angle
in the direction of travel and not abruptly at a
right angle. At the cross traffic streets the local
roadways are carried down to meet the intersecting
grades instead of over as in the case of rapid transit
lines and express roadways. This arrangement al-
lows traffic to enter and leave this superhighway
at the half-mile points. Space for 15-foot sidewalks
next to the property lines completes the arrange-
ment of the elements of the superhighway.
The Intersection of Two Superhighways
The arrangement of grades at street crossings
just described apply only to 86-foot and 120-foot
cross streets. Where two superhighways cross, the
arrangement is a little more complicated, due to
keeping two, instead of one, surface rapid transit
rights of way free from interference. This is ac-
complished by making the crossing a three-level
structure instead of two. The sidewalks and local
loadways of both superhighways are maintained
at natural ground level, while the rapid transit lines
and express driveways of one are carried past the
intersection in full depression and the other in full
elevation.
Pedestrian underpasses can be constructed be-
tween the half-mile points anywhere and as often
as desired, making it unnecessary for pedestrians
to travel to the vehicular crossing points.
In looking at the Master Plan one will note that
the superhighways, heading for the interior of the
city, at some point change from the 204-foot width
to 120. The reason for this is economic. The
structural saving of building a four-track rapid
transit route as a surface line compared to a four-
track tunnelway is about two-million dollars.
Where the cost of acquiring the extra eighty-four
feet becomes greater than the structural saving the
rapid transit facilities enter the ground, the 84-foot
strip disappears and the superhighway contracts to
a 120-foot thorofare, maintaining the same vehicular
and pedestrian space that the superhighways
afforded.
The superhighway idea has spread beyond the
original fifteen mile limit. On Woodward Avenue
the land has been acquired and pavement laid to
the 22-mile circle. Gratiot, Grand River, Michigan
and the Stephenson superhighways are all in
process of accomplishment beyond the fifteen mile
circle. Other lines are on the Superhighway Com-
missions' list for early attention.
THE HONOR SYSTEM
(Continued from page 10)
to a slight degree, but only so. The test of success
of an honor system never can be how many con-
victions are obtained, but rather, how widely used
is a sense of student honor? When things are
going right—and there is no reason why any ordi-
nary college in the United States cannot get them
tc going right—there is so little dishonesty that
what there is does not count; and whether the
guilty one is discovered or not, counts as little.
In the ideal state, there would be no honor system;
everyone would come with full knowledge of the
rules of the game, and public opinion would be the
only—and sufficient—penalty for violation of trust.
Just one more thought. Many faculty men on
this campus have recently said that an honor sys-
tem must arise wholly from the student body, and
be operative only from that base. If I may take
the liberty of interpreting for them, they do not
mean that the faculty can dodge all responsibility.
1 ionor systems have failed directly because of non-
co-operation on the part of recalcitrant faculty
members. A professor who has always given ex-
aminations no average student can pass without
using a pony, will make existence hard for an honor
system, if he continues the practice. The honor
system requires that the faculty at least shall as
sume the responsibility of giving reasonable assign-
ments, writing reasonable examinations, and of giv-
ing the student a fair and respectful hearing in all
cases when the student may feel discrimination.
The faculty man who has many papers turned in,
but instead of going over the papers himself, has
assistants to do it for him. may often be particularly
blameworthy. If his assistants are competent, and
furthermore, unprejudiced, and moreover, are avail-
able to the student and open to fair argument about
grades given, then things may not be so badly off;
otherwise, the student may often be entirely right
in believing that the college is not giving him .1
square deal. Every little source of friction of this
sort places the honor system in jeopardy. Xo, the
honor system cannot be wholly a thing by, of and
for the student. Everyone concerned must give
his full support.
It is perfectly evident that the smaller the col
lege, and the more closely its various students al-
ready conform to a common standard of reaction
towards honesty, the easier it will be to install the
honor system with full expectation of success. The
compact group always has the higher morale to
begin with. Conversely, the larger the college, and
the more loosely it is put together, the more diffi-

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
cult it will be to devise a good plan of operation.
Is this sufficient reason for abandoning all at-
tempts? To do so is to admit a deplorable weak-
ness'. On the other hand, the more loosely the
college is organized, the more it needs the esprit
de corps inevitably to be gained from giving the
student body a thing to work for in common and to
to protect—student honor.
o
CARBURET10N
(Continued from page 13)
The carburetor cannot be considered as a com-
plete unit in itself and must be combined with the
intake manifold at least. If possible the system
should include everything to the point of entrance
to the cylinder. If this viewpoint were more widely
accepted and the carburetor man given more free-
dom, less trouble would be encountered in properly
adapting carburetors to any engine. This policy-
would result in better engine performance and de-
crease the wastage of fuel, which is bad, not only
in unwarranted expense, but from indirect sources
causing engine trouble.
RESEARCH
(Continued from pag;e 16)
and an army marches on its stomach even though
it may fight with its brain. Ultimate state and na-
tional prosperity require an army of research. This
;vrmy to be effective must be supported in a syste-
matic orderly manner. The slipshod, haphazard
methods of previous decades will not suffice.
Germany understands. It was because she under-
stood that she held the world at bay so successfully
but a few short years ago.
Czecho-Slovakia understands. She has provided
a research institute for the beet sugar industry
alone, which, if it had been done in this country,
would have cost over $1,000,000. Yet we have not
been able thus far to arouse in this state sufficient
interest in the beet sugar industry to undertake a
program of research, though we can offer these in-
terests one of the finest laboratories for this type
of work in the country and a splendid personnel
with which to do the work.
England is beginning to understand. She has
appropriated $5,000,0(X) for cooperative research,
agreeing to match pound for pound appropriations
made by her various trade associations. Over 100
of these associations have taken advantage of this
opportunity.
In this country we are just beginning to under-
stand. In the flush of our raw materials and youth
as a manufacturing nation, we have not yet taken
our proper place in the field of industrial research
among the nations of the earth. We have turned
the corner of the road, however, and are beginning
to overtake our initial lethargy.
RAMMED EARTH
(Continued from page 18)
pressive strength is from thirty to thirty-five tons
per square foot, or in a little different form, a col-
umn could be built five hundred feet in height be-
fore failure occurred at the bottom. These values
are less than the corresponding values of ordinary
concrete but, in rammed earth construction, the
walls may be built eighteen inches or two feet thick
without materially increasing the cost.
Incidentally, this plays a double purpose; be-
sides giving walls much stronger than necessary
and much stronger than the average, it assures the
best heat insulation possible. This saving in
Northern climates is considerable. In a rammed
earth railway station at Simondium, South Africa,
during the period of observation the temperature
never went above 86° while in other houses of the
village it ranged from 100° to 105°.
The life of such houses is the life of the timbers
used in their construction.
One of the greatest points of advantage in thi&gt;
proposed material is its harm:&gt;ny with modern
trends. It fits perfectly the needs of the architect
designing the English type cottage, the Spanish
villa, the mission bungalow, for which even adobe
is being used in parts of California, as well as
many of the larger, more popular concrete houses.
Another point of architectural beauty possible
with rammed earth and impractical with ordinary
methods is the effect gained by setting the win-
dows deep into the wall. The shadows obtained
by the use of eighteen inch walls, which is average
practice, add much to the exterior.
Rammed earth should not be confused with the
adobe used in the dwellings of Central America
and Mexico. The two owe their strength to en-
tirely different causes. Adobe is made of a mixture
of straw with a clayey soil which may contain or-
ganic ingredients. After puddling with water the
mass is allowed to dry in the sun. During this
process it is cut into blocks and when all the water
has been evaporated the blocks are built into the
walls, being bonded together by a pasty mixture of
the same substance. In a measure this is a clay
brick, dried but not burned. Rammed earth, on the
other hand, is made by tamping the soil into rigid-
ly braced moulds which are to form the walls. The
moisture content of the soil used is quite an impor-
tant item where maximum strength is desired; it
varies between five and fifteen per cent, depending
on the constituency of the soil and the method used
in ramming. In this material, however, the
strength is a direct result of the tamping or ram-
ming. The structure beneath the microscope sug-
gests' the cementing or bonding action; the tiny
stones and inert particles are all surrounded with
a film of clay. The clay contained in the original


Page 29
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
mixture is forced between the inert particles by the
ram, giving the wall sufficient strength to stand
without the mold immediately; then as the water
dries from the wall, the remainder of the clay,
originally in suspension, precipitates out and the
whole forms a kind of natural cement throughout
the mass. The closer that the inert material is
driven together, the more surface is in contact with
the bonding material, hence a stronger product. A
large amount of clay, although it gives a hard,
dense material, leaves shrinkage cracks when dry-
ing.
CEMENT PAINTS MAY BE EFFECTIVELY USED IN LIEU
OF PLASTERS.
It seems there is a chance then of a repetition,
a repetition in the history of building. Pliny's fire-
lesisting, frost and rain proof walls seem to fit the
needs and demands of today, perhaps better than
anything else. Hannibal's formocean walls of 150
B. C. may soon, under the hand of the modern arch-
itect, be transformed to picturesque cottages and
villas of our own roadside—surely a sensible, prac-
tical solution; perhaps too sensible. o
HEADLIGHT ING
(Continued from puse 22)
driver simply dims his left hand lamp and still has
a safe driving light provided by the right hand lamp.
Other lamps are built in which beam deflection
is- relied on to eliminate glare. The two lamp
beams are usually symmetrical both as to pattern
and height above the road and some device is pro-
vided for deflecting both beams downward from
three to five degrees.
In the earlier lamps this was done by having the
central portion of the reflector in the form of a
hinged mirror and some arrangement was provided
for tilting this mirror forward and downward either
by a lever operated manually from the dash or by
an electro magnet back of the mirror which could
be actuated by pressing a button.
A very recent improvement of this scheme does
Away with the tilting mirror. A two-filament lamp
is mounted in a standard reflector in such a way
that one filament is exactly at the focal point while
the other is a very small distance above it. The
lower filament is used normally but when a car ap-
proaches beam deflection is produced by switching
to the upper filament. The beam from the upper
filament is the same candle power as the main beam,
but is pointed about three degrees downward.
So much for conditions as they are. What can
we say of the future? If the method of achieving
progress in other technical fields is a reliable
barometer we can feel quite safe in predicting that
the condition of automobile headlighting practice
will not be notably improved by any haphazard in-
ventions of amateurs. We must look to painstak-
ing, coordinated study by the research laboratories
of the country to produce definite improvements in
our methods and apparatus. Perhaps a word should
be said concerning the lines along which research
is now being conducted or contemplated. These
comprise studies of the fundamentals affecting vi-
sion and visual acuity, the factors having maximum
effect in producing the sensation of glare; the re-
finement of the component parts of standard head-
lamps, together with the design of simple adjust-
ment devices; road tests of various beam patterns
under all varieties of weather and over all kinds of
road surfaces; and a statistical study of headlamp
conditions on new cars as they come from the fac-
tory. The outlook is hopeful because, the need for
improvement is so great and a great need is a pow-
erful stimulus to research.
In conclusion I wish to express my thanks to
Mr. R. N. Falge and Mr. H. H. Magdsick of the
Engineering Department of the National Lamp
Works at Nela Park for their permission to use
illustrations taken from their recent articles on
headlighting.
CONCRETE TRACERY
(Continued from page 23)
the stepped back facade for skyscrapers provides
one solution; concrete tracery will give a second
one: the facade is candidly declared a plane which
is treated like a lace curtain. The many voids of
the tracery show a sufficient amount of the space
behind the wall, dark by day, light at night to give
the three dimensional impression of the house of
which the facade is professedly only one plane.
Instead of being degraded into pilasters, the por-
tico, consisting of concrete columns, is left in front
and the intercolumnar spaces are filled by grill-
work—-the concrete tracery. The actual house,
dark or light space, remains, behind this concrete
lace curtain and the conquering of space is ex-
pressed, especially when a far projecting cornice
or cresting and bold balconies are used as finishing
touches.

THE MICHIGAN T E C H NIC
The customary rectangular windows pro-
vide at best a tedious checker-hoard orna-
ment. With concrete tracery the fenestra-
tion can attain various degrees of ornamenta-
tion. The total window area can be adjusted to
meet every demand. In office buildings, where the
position of partition walls is not always decided on
beforehand, the concrete tracery would cover the
whole facade in a simple geometric design so that
wherever the partition walls are placed, each room
would have a completed window-group. In apart-
ment houses the solid part of the tracery can ex-
pand until it occupies much space and the total
glass area is equal to that of the usually employed
window. Between these two extremes is a big
range of intermediate stages. For small buildings
concrete tracerv of simple outlines, effective also
from within would be chosen. In monumental pub-
lic buildings and churches, the walls of the large
halls would depict historical scenes or a symbolic
group of figures, arranged to be viewed from within
as well as from the street (i.e., having a symmetry
plane running parallel to the facade). Classical art
would furnish inspiration for the achaic rigor of the
outlines of the concrete tracery which would be es-
sential in making it clearly understood when
viewed from the distance." the Greek
workman cared for shadow only as a dark field
wherefrom his light figure or design might be in-
telligibly detached: his attention was concentrated
on the one aim—at readableness, and clearness of
accent; and all composition, all harmony, nay, the
very vitality and energy of separate groups were,
when necessary, sacrificed to plain speaking."-
Ruskin.
We must follow the eternal principles of true art
set forth by the ancients, at the same time fully
utilizing the marvelous possibilities given to us by
reinforced concrete. May it not be that concrete
tracery is one of the essentials which modern archi-
tecture has been waiting for?
WING TESTING
(Continued from pane 21)
This would happen if the balance were fixed and
the lift balance wire were moved out of the plane
of the drag axis. Again since the balance was free
to move, its wind resistance would contribute to
the drag of the wing, unless it were accurately
balanced off by the air resistance of the flat plate.
In fact this drag could be very considerable, be-
cause it would be applied at a point on the wing
above the lift balance, a point twice as far from the
v\ing support as the point of application of the true
drag resultant force.
The center of gravity of the wing was brought
over the support by inserting lead at the tip of the
span.
Measurement of the wind speed was provided for
by the venturi and an airplane air speed gauge,
mounted near the driver.
Tests are best conducted on a level smooth pave-
n.ent, in the early morning when the air is motion-
less, but some good results have also been obtained
with the wind blowing directly along the road.
However certain precautions are necessarv. It is
important, chiefly, that the wind is along the road
axis and that it be not too gusty. Readings must
be made both with and against the wind to elimin-
ate any vertical component of the velocity. With
too strong a wind the ground velocity may be ex-
cessive for attaining the correct wind speed when
travelling with the wind. All readings should be
made on the same smooth portion of the pavement
to eliminate any possible variations in the attitude
of the apparatus.
Another vertical component is introduced by the
car itself and must be determined by testing the
wing in an inverted position. This is the chief
source of error in this method of testing and it may
assume very large values if neglected. Consider, for
instance, a case where the uptiow from the car
amounts to one and one-half degrees. If the lift
and drag coefficients arc normally 0.7 and 0.04 the}
may become 0.7 and 0.04+0.7 sin 1.5° =0.056, or the
ratio of lift to drag has changed from 17.5 to 12.5.
This is just due to resolving along a set of axes ro-
tated I'j" from the correct axes in which the drag
axis is parallel to the wind direction.
Dampening devices were considered unnecessary
at first, because the wings which are 9 ft. long by
\Yi ft. average width would weigh about 50 Ibs.
when covered with tin, and consequently would
have a large moment of inertia. This turned out to
be true of the lift forces, but the addition of an oil
filled dash pot materially improved the readings of
the drag at its low values.
High lift wings of a thickness of one-third the
chord length have been tested on this apparatus
with very good results. At forty miles per hour and
with an eighteen inch chord, the minimum drag co-
efficient of one wing was one-half that found in a
wind tunnel at one hundred and fifty miles per
hour and with a two inch chord. This would seem
to indicate that the size of the model is of more im-
portance than the velocity of the test, that is, that
L is more important than V in the LV criterion.
It was on this conception of the resistance that the
device was constructed, since LV's of only seventy-
five feet squared per second could be hoped for and
this had been attained in some European tunnels.
In some tests it may be advisable to use even
larger models and it seems entirely feasible to at
least double the chord length, which, with an aspect
ratio of five, would make the span fifteen feet. This

is not too large if placed high enough above the car.
A device of this type will undoubtedly find many
more applications than its use for testing high lift
thick wings. Complete models of airplanes which
will permit the introduction of small parts, not pos-
sible on wind tunnel models, can be used and the
changes in performance of the model will bear a
closer relation to the full sized airplane. This will
be true, because, as mentioned above, the effect of
scale is more pronounced the smaller the model, and
it varies in a different manner for bodies of differ-
ent shape, being almost negligible for very thin and
very important for thick forms. Obviously, a com-
bination of the two types of bodies, should, for this
reason, be tested in as large a model as possible,
consistent with the cost. The car test takes care
of this last factor verv well.

FumoUH Blade* of Diiniaxrux
It is hard for many people to accept the modern
developments in industry, and it is not an uncom-
mon idea among people that present day products
are inferior to those produced in earlier times. The
question is asked. "Why cannot steel be produced
today that is equal to the steel in the swords which
\-nights used to carry, with their superior elasticity
and hair splitting qualities?"
Investigation of the properties of the steel in
ancient weapons, however, shows conclusively that
tbese superior qualities are merely mythical in
( rigin. The methods of heat treatment which were
generally kept secret gave rise to superstitions con-
cerning the origin of the blades and likewise to
their superior properties. The tests conducted
show that not only is the ancient steel incapable
of the achievements! attributed to it. but the steel
of today is superior in quality in many ways. In
the tests steels of the same composition as the
swords were used, whereas other alloy steels pos-
sessing even better properties might have been
used. —Iron Trade Review.

Color Nhndoir Lighting
In nearly every city one may find a prominent
monument or monumental building. With few
exceptions, all are obliterated by nightfall. During
the day their beauty may be marred by the sur-
roundings; at night they may be set free from their
environment and made to stand out nobly as an
inspiration to their beholders. If the building is
a commercial one, as for example are the Wool-
worth tower of New York and the Wrigley tower
of Chicago, the publicity gained by courageous
flood-lighting is beyond calculation.
Color shadow lighting, when applied to similar
examples of modern architecture, provides a means
for enhancing the beauty of such architectural
accomplishments to an even greater degree than has
been made possible by the aid of the large banks
of flood-lamps as are used for the night illumina-
tion of the two structures mentioned above. Color
in itself is attractive and when intelligently used
to create brilliant splashes of color which harmo-
nize with the architectural design of the building,
some truly magnificent effects can be secured.
The use of color permits variegating the appear-
ance of a building at will to a much greater extent
than is possible with clear flux. Likewise, with col-
ored light, the amount and kind of color is under
perfect control and the amount of color decorating
can be modified or eliminated at any time, if so
desired. It lends itself particularly well to the
lighting of structures as are stepped back from the
building line progressively at certain elevations,
since such architecture creates pockets and offsets
that can be strongly splashed from points of van-
tage on the building itself. This permits the pillars
and other outstanding features of a building, to be
bathed with white light, thus sharply contrasting
them against the background of colored shadows.
It is only necessary to recall such awe-inspiring
applications of color lighting as were witnessed at
the San Francisco Exposition, to realize the many-
possibilities which may be uncovered by the re-
sourceful designer. —Journal of the A. I. E. E.

The Cost of Daylight
Advancement in the production and use of arti-
ficial light can be emphasized in no better way
than by the increasing tendency to depend upon it
even in the daytime. A score of years ago arti-
ficial light was still a poor competitor with day-
light. It was considered to be merely a feeble sub-
stitute by means of which the hours of industry or
of recreation could be extended after a fashion.
Today artificial light compares favorably with day-
light in efficiency, does not always cost more and
has many advantages in controlability and depend
ability.
Until recently the provision of ample daylight
was a matter of habit in the design of buildings.
Of course, architects knew that it cost something
to install and maintain daylight equipment, but
most persons even now are not conscious of this
ci.st. Many charges may, however, be made
against daylight and its total Cost is startling. Men
are likely to continue to use daylight where it can
be obtained readily and without excessive cost and
are likely also to install windows for the purpose
of "letting vision out." But it is interesting to note
that a growing recognition of the low cost, reli-
ability and ease of control of artificial light is
causing architects and others to scrutinize more
carefully the cost and other characteristics of day-
light.
There are a great many cases in the large cities
where daylighting equipment is not delivering the
proper amount of light while artificial lighting sys-
tems properly installed will always give the amount
of light they are designed to give. Progressive
architects are already considering these facts in con-
nection with lighting and are finding many cases
where artificial light can be used to advantage.

8uper-Conducting Copper
The production of copper that is capable of trans-
mitting 13 per cent more current than present con-
ductors has been announced by Dr. W. P. Davey
of the Research Laboratory of the General Electric
Company. These results were obtained with large-
crystals of copper, the experimental production of
which was recently accomplished in the Schenec-
tady laboratory. Use of single crystal copper is at
present not commercially possible because of the
difficulties of manufacture, but from a scientific


Page 33
THE MICHIGAN T E C H NIC
standpoint the results of these investigations are of
great interest.
The single copper crystals were made by grad-
ually heating and cooling pure copper in an electric
furnace. When the molten metal is quickly cooled,
very small crystals are formed; if the melt is cooled
slowly, the crystals are larger. Employing the
method of P. W. Bridgeman, Dr. Davey cooled the
metal so slowly that only one crystal was formed
and that included all the metal. By this method
he was able to produce single crystals seven-eighths
of an inch in diameter and six inches long, or crys-
tals of less diameter and greater length.
In a crystal, the atoms are built up in a regular
fashion. The crystals of copper, for example, are
made of very tiny cubes, with atoms of copper at
the corners and centers of the faces of each cube.
The large crystals grow in such a direction that
the atoms are arranged in columns along the length
of the crystal. It is this regular arrangement' of
the atoms which, it is believed, gives to the sin-
gle crystals their superior conductivity when com-
pared with ordinary copper in which the crystals
are small and the arrangements of the atoms more
chaotic. A. I. Ei E.
The Manufacture of Flaked (//«««
The manufacture of flaked glass, which is now
in such favor for glazing office partitions and the
like, has become a business of considerable mag-
nitude. While the process by which it is made is
of fairly modern development, a certain phase of it
is really based on what might be called a cunning
trick employed by the American Indians in fashion-
ing their flint arrowheads.
The flint was shaped by first making it very hot
and then dropping cold water on it—the sudden
contraction of only the surface causing it to fly off
in the form of thin flakes. In making flaked glass,
the glass is sandblasted, thus producing a surface
that assures the intimate adhesion of a highly tena-
cious glue that is next spread over the sheet. With
the glue in place, the glass is then subjected to slow
drying in a gas-fired oven. At this stage of the
progress great care and absolute control of the heat
are required to prevent cracking the sheet and to
make certain of the proper action on the part of
the glue. About twelve hours are required for this
treatment. When the glass comes out of the dry-
ing oven it is found that the glue in shrinking has
dragged off, so to speak, the skin of the glass in
the form of thin flakes—producing the obscuring
effect desired. —Industrial Gas.
Purer Iron Produced Electrically
1'ig iron is now the basic form from which all
types of iron and steel are produced, but it may
become obsolete and the direct manufacture of mal-
leable iron and steel from ore may follow the inven-
tion of a special electric furnace of commercial size
that has been built in the great iron works, Hag-
fors, at Stockholm, Sweden, where iron ore and coal
mixed and fused have been made to produce pure
iron containing only two per cent of carbon, and
steel that can be worked in the usual manner.
The new process is continuous and fusion ceases
temporarily when the furnace is tapped, while ab-
sence of gases and slag produces a superior product.
The United States leads the world in the num-
ber of electric steel furnaces in use, and with the
discover}- of a process of making iron and steel
directly from the ore would give a tremendous im-
petus to the use of the electric smelting furnace.

The latest extension in the General Electric weld-
ing activities is the entry into the resistance weld-
ing field. That company is now marketing two
automatic resistance welding machines, one for
straight seam work and the other for circular seams.
In resistance welding fusion is effected by heat
generated by passing an electric current through
the materials to be welded, augmented by pressure,
whereas arc welding utilizes an arc or flame to
melt the work, electrode or both. The General
Electric automatic resistance welders consist of a
framework for holding the work, a transformer for
supplying current to the electrodes, movable elec-
trode wheels and necessary controls.
These equipments were particularly designed for
welding the seams of light metal containers such
as ice cream cans, drums, etc., and are suitable only
for making lap joints with relatively thin metal.
Among the advantages are the absence of fumes
and open arcs making the use of masks unneces-
sary, and the fact that the operator requires no
special welding training.
The welding speed obtained with these equip-
ments varies from 20 to 100 inches per minute, de-
pending upon the nature and thickness of the ma-
terial to be welded. Materials up to a total thick-
ness of one-quarter inch may be accommodated.

OUR COVER DESIGN
The cover sketch for this issue is the work of
Samuel Chamberlain, Assistant Professor of Archi-
tectural Drawing, and was executed during his
travels in France in the Spring of 1925. The theme-
is the buttresses of the transcript of the cathedral
at Beauvais, France. Prof. Chamberlain's many
friends will be interested to hear that he is return-
ing to Europe for an indefinite period to continue
the excellent art work of which this etching is a
typical sample.

Architecture
The Architect's May Party, which is given an-
nually by the students of the Architectural
School, is the only large costume party given in
Ann Arbor and is one of the leading parties given
on the campus. The party is attended not only by
the students of the Architectural College but by
those whose fancy tends toward the exotic, the
bizarre. Everyone is required to be in costume,
no one being admitted in evening clothes.
In order to find the best decorative scheme for
the party, a competition was held among the stu-
dents of the Architectural School, which was won
by Howard Preston, '26A. The winning design
plans the setting of the party on the ocean bottom.
Weird deep sea fish and vegetation will circle the
3000 feet of painted surface to be placed around the
walls. Nile green gauze will be placed in front of
this and the entire will be so lighted that a realistic
effect of gliding over the ocean bottom will be
given the 600 dancers.
The ceiling is to be covered with 5000 feet of fire
proofed crepe paper. The lamps, which will be
hung from the ceiling, are being designed and made
by a special group and will represent colorful ma-
rine animals.
The entire gymnasium is to be covered in a
blaze of color by the decorations and none of the
gymnasium structure will be visible.. This repre-
sents the work of all the students in the Architect-
ural College, each working under one of the four-
teen sub-chairmen, who in turn are working under
the general chairman.
Such expensive decorations are impossible to any
other organization on the campus because of the
great amount of work required to execute the
scheme. It is well known that the Architects' party
has the most elaborate decorative scheme of any
party of a similar nature in the state because of
the talent available in the school.
Zez Confrey's Orchestra is being brought from
Chicago to provide the music. This orchestra will
play in an elaborately prepared setting representing
a sunken ship. The lighting of the ship will be
entirely concealed as will all the other lights, so
as to cast a faint glow of indirect lighting over the
dancing couples and add to the fantasy of the entire
setting.
Mr. Ben K. Wyatt will be in complete charge of
decorations and will also design the panels which
will be placed around the walls.
Mr. Chester A. Sirrine is again General Chair-
man.

The Booth Traveling Fellowship Competition
The annual George G. Booth competition in arch-
itecture for the Booth Traveling Fellowship was
given this spring in the senior drafting rooms of
the Architectural School. It covered a period of
fourteen days from April 10 through the 24th.
The winner of this competition is the recipient
of twelve hundred dollars, which at the present rate
of exchange, will allow7 a man to spend about a year
in study abroad.
This is a competition which is open to all grad-
uates of the university and in which all the men
have the same amount of time on the problems.
The preliminary sketches and finished drawings are
all done without any outside assistance whatsoever
in the form of reference books or criticism.
The problem given this year was to design a
chamber of commerce and city hall for a small town
with a population of about one thousand, and it is
pleasing to note the number of men who availed
themselves of this splendid opportunity to take part
in a competition which will give the winner a year
of study abroad.

Echoes from the Graduates
Louis CARLTON SABIN
LOUIS CARLTON SABIN was burn June 25,
1867 at Memphis, Michigan, where his early
youth was spent. He attended Ann Arbor High
School in 1884, entering the University of Michigan
in 1885. At the end of his sophomore year, he
accepted an opportunity to go to Bismarck. North
Dakota, to work on the con-
struction of a small water
works system there, later going
to Chicago with the same com-
pany engaged in bridge con-
struction work.
Despite the lure of constant
promotion and progress, he
realized the handicap he was
working under by not complet-
ing his university training. So
in 1888 he left his job and re-
turned to Ann Arbor to com-
plete the two remaining years
of his college work. His work
in the practical field of engi-
neering, which had so con-
vinced him of the practical
value of the training the uni-
versity had given him, was
even more helpful on his re-
turn to the University of Mich-
igan. He knew what he was
striving for and what is even
more important, just where to
commence when he had finished his studies in Ann
Arbor. This latter problem is one of the biggest
that face the men who go out of the university to-
day and Mr. Sabin seems to have solved it for him-
self by associating professionally with work in the
particular branch of engineering that he was pur-
suing, during the recess of his college training.
During the vacation between his junior and sen-
ior years at the university, he was employed in con-
nection with the construction of the "Merchants
Bridge" at St. Louis, Missouri, of which Mr. E. L.
Corthell, his former employer, was chief engineer.
He was in the survey and inspection party over-
LOUIS CARLTON SABIN
seeing the sinking and filling of pneumatic caisson
foundations. An incident of this employment was
a slight attack of the "bends," or caisson disease,
which served to increase his interest in this branch
of engineering. Upon the completion of his four
years of training he was sent to Sault Ste. Marie
with the Engineer Depart-
ment of the United States
Army where excavation had
been started for what was then
the largest ship lock in the
world, the Poe Lock of the
Ste. Mary's Ealls Canal. Be-
cause of his experience with
concrete construction work he
was assigned the responsibil-
ity (&lt;f testing the materials
used in the concrete and ce-
ment construction work of the
lock. He performed extensive
research and experimentation
on the effects of cement actions
due to various methods of
manipulation, variations in ex-
posure, etc., which, at the time,
was practically without prece-
dent. Later he published the
result* of his work under the
title, "Cement and Concrete."
which stands today as an au-
thority on concrete and cement
construction.
Turning from construction work upon the com-
pletion of the Poe lock, to more general civil engi-
neering, he went to Texas where he engaged in
measuring a base line with the multiple wire sys-
tem, with which he made some very precise meas-
urements, standardizing base measuring wires.
Having also had experience in river discharge meas-
urements with current meters, he returned to the
Great Lakes in 1898 and spent seven years making
hydraulic surveys, measuring river discharges with
multiple meters and working on the design for a
movable dam.


Page 37
THE MICHIGAN! T E C, H N I C
In 1905 Mr. Sahin was appointed Secretary to
the American Section of the International Water-
ways Commission, studying, in their international
aspects, the problems arising on the Great Lakes
because of the diversion of water for power and
other purposes at the Sault, Chicago and Niagara
Falls, which are still seriously affecting the water
levels of the Great Lakes.
In 190(3 he was recalled to Sault Ste. Marie to
assume the superintendence' of the ship canal. Un-
der his supervision during the next few years, two
new locks were built, the Davis Lock and the Sabin
Lock, which are the longest ship locks in the
world, being 300 feet longer than the largest locks
at Panama. Other works carried out at the Sault,
over which he had direct supervision, were the
designing and construction of two movable dams,
regulating works for Lake Superior, Channels for
Navigation and power development projects.
In 1917 he was awarded the degree of Master of
Engineering at the University of Michigan for his
valuable and extensive researches in the broad field
he had mastered. Mr. Sabin remained in head
charge of the Government navigation works at the
Sault until 1925, when he was elected Vice Presi-
dent of the Lake Carriers Association, with which
he is now associated at its Cleveland, Ohio, head
quarters.
Certainly the life of this man has something in
it for the men who are following in his steps at
Michigan today. Whether the man is nearly fin-
ished with his studies or is just starting them,
whether he is enthusiastic about, or is disgusted
v.'ith, college, there is something somewhere here
for him "to set his course by." Maybe we can all
stop a minute and think, when he tells us that
"Success is measured in one's own life by the sat-
isfaction he may feel in the extent to which he
believes he has played the game."

Selecting the Job and the Employer
As Commencement approaches, the college senior reflects on
things past and looks forward to the future. He realizes that
a man derives his greatest happiness in life from his family, his
friends, and his work. He is looking for employment with a
concern whose integrity and stability match the high quality
of its products.
Ingersoll-Rand has long stood as a leader among the manu-
facturers of compressed air machinery, pumps, condensers,'
mining and quarrying equipment, and oil engines. For fifty-
five years it has been combining the latest advances in
engineering with the most careful methods of manufacture—a
policy of progress resulting consistently in products of the
highest quality. It is continually broadening its field; and
its customers are found all over the world.
Among the major factors which have contributed to the

CORTO saves one-third the space oc-

and the boiler more responsive to tem-

-it is used in every in-
dustrial field to secure
permanently depend-
able protection to mo-

U-RE-LITE
was designed by Cutter Engineers to fill a long-
felt need in the industrial world. It is the best
and surest protection against overloads and short
circuits and the resulting damage to costly elec-
trical installations.
U-Re-Lite is, in short, the I-T-E Circuit Breaker
in the Steel Box, so designed as to be absolutely
fool-proof. It is your only positive means of per-
manently protecting electric motors and power
or lighting circuits from overloads or "shorts."
It does this automatically by opening the circuit
in the event of excessive current flow. Then a
twist of the handle on the front of the box
restores service — anyone can do it. No need for
the electrician.
U-RE-LITE
does what fused switches, overload rel ays and other protective
devices are supposed to do, but it accomplishes this accurately
and dependably—even in extreme cases. It is the only device
of its kind that has been approved by the Underwriters'
Laboratory for use without any fuses in the circuit.
U-Re-Lite will break a current at least 100 times as great as
its rated capacity.
U-Re-Lite is the only right protection for your electrical
motors. Its steel box is locked by the electrician in charge
and the mechanism cannot be tampered with by irrespon-
sible parties. You can't even hold the switch members in
against an overload or short circuit!

The Ha
Powe
The Grey Ghost haunts every power house, little or big.
He lurks menacingly in every boiler room. Workmen
despise him. Getting rid of him is a dead expense.
The Grey Ghost rides in with the jolly old Goal. You don't
see him tumbling out of the car, or in the track hoppers.
You can't locate him in the conveyors, the bins or the
weigh larries. For the Grey Ghost is a spawn of the
devil and is only waiting to be born in the fire and get
into the ash pit. The Grey Ghost is the ashes that come
from merry Old King Goal.
When you think you have him trapped in the ash pit the
trouble commences. Try to get him out of there with-
out his whirling all over the plant choking the working
men, getting into the machinery and stinking the whole
place up with brimstone.
Getting the hot wet Grey Ghost, with his corrosive sul-
phur content and abrasive ash out of the plant at the least
expense is a job for experts.
The Rex Engineers are regular Ghost-Breakers and have
the bag of tricks that are needed to lay the Grey Ghost.
A letter will set them at him in your plant.

When the class

was being grad-
uated, the name
"Pierce" meant
no more in the

R. T. PIERCE than Sweeney
or Jones. Today, however, if
you'll talk to such companies as
the Detroit Edison Company,
The Southern California Edison
Company, the Duquesne Light

that "Pierce" means a type of

The question is sometimes asked:
Where do young men get when they
enter a large industrial organization?
Have they opportunity to exercise creative
talents? Or are they forced into narrow
grooves?
This series of advertisements throws light

takes up the record of a college man who
came with the Westinghouse Company
within the last ttn years or so, after
graduation.
of Westinghouse,devised it. He
designed a system that operates
on a new and different principle,
and that has met with general
acceptance in the Central Station
field. He also was active in the
recent re-designing of the entire
Westinghouse instrument line.
It was only a few months after
Pierce had completed the grad-
uate student course at Westing-
house that he was given an assign-
ment in the instrument section
of the engineering department.
He took it merely as a "fill-in"
job. Soon he saw that instru-
ments play a vital part in every
electrical operation. As an in-
strument engineer, Pierce spent
several weeks on the U. S. S.
Tennessee and the Colorado
during their trial runs. He has
ridden in the cabs of electric
locomotives. He is in closer
touch with radio than anyone
not a radio engineer.
A design engineer comes con-
tinuously in contact with sales
negotiations, and Pierce's con-
tact with them proved so bene-
ficial that he was lately made
head of the Instrument Section
of the Sales Department, which
means that he really has charge
of the sale of all instruments to
Westinghouse customers.

A GOOD thing to remember is that expense

Bearings are specified for new equipment.
So engineers of today realize that the time to
figure on anti-friction bearings is when designs
are being considered—not wait until ordinary
bearings fail in service—then rush for a
remedy.
The cost of replacing bearings—even a very
small bearing—often runs into hundreds of
dollars. Gears must be stripped—housings re-
moved—and down-time charged for produc-
tion delays.
The ability of Hyatt bearings to withstand
severe service has been proved during the
past third century in many lines of industry.
Easy rolling motion imparted, and their sturdy
construction, enables Hyatts to outwear
ordinary bearings in like service.
Lubrication three or four times a year is the
only attention Hyatts require. This advantage
—and others proved in service—makes an
investment in Hyatts worth while.

Where dependability
is vital
IN connection with a new
pumping station at Mil-
waukee, Wisconsin, additional
feeder mains were required. It
was necessary that one of these
should carry an unusually large
proportion of the water supply,
and 54-inch pipe was decided
upon. Although pipe of mate-
rial other than cast iron had a
lower first cost, Cast Iron Pipe
was chosen because the possi-
bility of interruption to service
had to be reduced to a minimum.

Control-
Chemical control is superseding rule-of-
thumb methods in industry. When the
first du Pont powder was made nearly
a century and a quarter ago — chemistry
was not an exact science.
Today, the chemical engineer with the
vast resources of modern science at his
disposal controls production from raw
material to finished product.
To chemical control, through research
and experiment, is due that unvarying
quality which makes the "Du Pont
Oval" a symbol of excellence every-
where.
Under the du Pont name is published
a practical and authoritative work —
the "Blasters' Handbook." It is being

tions throughout the country. A copy

'I ^HE Koehring Company provided means for producing
j^ Standardized Concrete long before its importance was
generally recognized. At the same time the vital impor-
tance of operating speed and the saving of time on the job
has always been a fundamental consideration in designing
Koehring Pavers and Mixers.
One of the basic units of the standard paver, produced in
conformity with these principles, is the boom and bucket sys'
tern for delivering mixed concrete from the drum to the sub-
grade, developed and perfected by Koehring Company.
This unit because of its many automatic actions cuts down to
a minimum the time for placing the mixed concrete on the
subgrade; and because it is possible with this method to main-
tain a uniform and proper consistency of the concrete from
the drum to the subgrade without separation of aggregate,
the Koehring boom and bucket is an important factor in pro'
ducing standardized concrete of dominant strength.
Today, the Koehring boom and bucket, Koehring batch
meter, Koehring five action re-mixing principle, and the
Koehring automatic water measuring tank provide the
most positive and accurate means for producing standard'
ized concrete of unvarying uniformity yet devised.

for Economical Transportation
Always Consider wa you
get for the price you pay/
Not only, "What will the car
cost?" . . .
But, "What will I get for my
money?" . . .
This is the question of great im-
portance!
It is, for several reasons, especially
applicable in buying a car in the
low-price field. And it is one of
the reasons why Chevrolet has
become the world's largest builder
of gear-shift automobiles.
In Chevrolet, you get more for
little money than in any other
car built.
Every Car Proves Its Value
Every car in the line proves this be-
cause it is modern in construction,
beautiful in appearance—because
it provides a performance that
will .im.in- and delight you.
Chevrolet's dry-plate disc-clutch
and modern three-speed trans-
mission with its heavy steel gears,
afford gear-shifting of remarkable
ease—and the application of abun-
dant power in any of the three
forward speeds or reverse.
Chevrolet's modern bodies, all
finished in lasting Duco of beauti-
ful colors, afford ample seating
room and the full comfort of wide,
properly-pitched seats.
All closed bodies are by Fisher,
built on the principle employed on
all high-priced cars—selected hard
wood and steel.
Chevrolet's modern, semi-revers-
ible worm and gear-steering as-
sembly is handled with the utmost
ease, enabling the driver to keep
to the road under all conditions.
Chevrolet's many other modern,
quality-features provide you with
a car built sturdily, affording every
modern convenience and comfort
—quality-features that you would
look for only on cars of much
higher price.
And this year, Chevrolet is break-
ing all records of the past because
it not only possesses vital improve-
ments that bring about a remark-
able performance, but in addition
every passenger car model is offered
at a netv low price.
Ask Yourself this Question
Tens of thousands of new buyers
are turning to Chevrolet because
they ask themselves this question:
"What will I get for my money?"
and in seeking the answer they find,
more than ever before, that Chev-
rolet offers a value that is amazing.
Take a rideinthis Improved Chev-
rolet! You will find it an absolute
revelation — not only for smooth-
ness, snap and power—not only
for flexibility and riding comfort
— but also for the easy-driving,
effortless-control, made possible by
its modern design.

An Open Letter
to John P. Senior
Dear Senior:—
Your campus days are very nearly over but don't let
anyone mislead you into thinking that the "gladdest years
of life" have also passed. Tackle the job of living with a
little gumption and you'll find each succeeding year more
enjoyable and satisfying than the year that preceded it-
Your big job in the next few years is to set your stand-
ards and erect your reputation. What the world wants
to know about you is the soundness of your judgment and
the dependability of your performance. Don't take chances
on those two points. A clean reputation for solidity, trust-
worthiness and dependable performance is the goal to
aim for. (Your dollar-income at first probably won't total
very much under the best of circumstances, so be sure
your reputation-income is the biggest possible.)
Team up with the best in everything that you handle.
Stand for, advocate, fight for the best materials, the best
designs, the best construction methods. Don't let your
name come to get associated with second-bests, make-
shifts and could-have-been-better-with-a-little-more-
work- and - thought.
Build your reputation now —your fortune will come
later.
The world doesn't owe you a living but it's ready and
willing to pay you handsomely when you have justified
it. It's a great world once you have made it respect you.
I've seen a lot of it and I know.
Sincerely yours.

JVow more
Q than ever before
aracter
and
Dependability
To press the starter button of
your car and know that the
engine will respond almost
instantly—
To set out on a long trip—even
over the roughest roads—and
feel assured that the usual me-
chanical annoyances will not
delay your journey—
To buy a car and know that it
will serve you faithfully for
years without frequent costly
overhauling—
To know, too, that expensive
refinishing will be found unnec-
essary, and that when you come
to sell or exchange the car it
will bring an exceptional price—
That is dependability, as the
public has come to apply the
word to Dodge Brothers Motor
Car.
That is character built by men
into a product.
That is the expression, in terms
of steel, of an inflexible ideal—
the ideal to build well and never
to relax from a program of con-
stant and progressive better-
ment.
How well the car deserves the
tribute you will realize when
you know that more than 90 %
of all the motor cars Dodge
Brothers have built during the
past eleven years are still in
active service.
And remember that this aston-
ishing record was established
before Dodge Brothers new and
improved motor cars were re-
leased in January.
Far surpassing their past best
in sturdiness, as well as in
beauty and smooth engine oper-
ation, these new Dodge Broth-
ers Motor Cars are destined to
break their own unbroken record
for dependability and long life.

More cuts per minute
by adding
more good cutters
IN the endeavor to achieve quicker and more
economical methods in milling, the number
of cutters used in a single set-up has tended to
increase. This is particularly true of automo-
tive shops where high production is the watch-
word.
Two automotive jobs are shown. Above is a
Brown &amp; Sharpe Automatic Milling Machine which
fairly bristles with cutters. Eight Brown &amp; Sharpe
cutters—four Coarse Tooth End Mills and four
Spiral Shell End Mills—are used. Below is a view
of an operation on a Brown &amp; Sharpe No. 13B
Plain Milling Machine in which six Brown &amp; Sharpe
Coarse Tooth Side Milling Cutters and three Spiral
Shell End Mills (in back) are used.
The advantage of such operations depends large-
ly on the durability of the cutters. Too frequent
stops for sharpening or changing cutters are disas-
trous to the produc-
tion schedule. As the
best insurance of dur-
ability, long life, and
long service between
sharpenings Brown &amp;
Sharpe Cutters were
chosen for these and
many similar jobs.

Three Unusual Public Servants
These public utility power stations,
constructed by The Foundation
Company, are now contributing to
the welfare of thecommunities they
serve.
The Power Station of the Columbia Power
Company, near Cincinnati, Ohio, contains
the latest developments in steam and elec-
trical generation. It has a present capacity
of 110,000 H.P. which will be ultimately
increased to 480,000 H.P. Ground was
broken February 14, 192.4, and power was
generated December 10, 1915,—such the
record for construction.
In the heart of the Kentucky coal fields a
steam power plant has been constructed,
designed to utilize fuel near its source and
transmit electrical energy to nearby indus-
trial centers, including the mines from
which the fuel is taken. This $3,500,000
station of the Kentucky Utilities Com-
pany, near Pineville, Kentucky, is a link
in a chain of super-power stations in this
region.
At Philo, on the Muskingum River in
Ohio, is situated a power plant of the Ohio
Power Company which has become noted
for its economical operation. Located
where a navigation dam makes a consider-
able difference in level in the river, water
for condensing is taken above and dis-
charged below the dam without pumping.
Unusual efficiency is obtained with the
most modern fuel handling machinery in
both wet and dry storage.

Buckets of BdRvn for Bearings
Wherever there is a Timken Bearing in machin-
ery there is a point of hard service. That's just
why each bearing is there.
For very vital reasons Timkens are awarded tough
jobs in motorcars, trucks, tractors, machine tools,
electric motors and other mechanical devices
throughout transportation, agriculture, manufac-
ture, and all other divisions of Industry. Timken
Tapered design provides for the inevitable
side-thrust" on bearings, which best engineer-
ing dare not ignore. Timken positive roll align-
ment, exclusive, adds to bearing speed possibilities.
And only Timken, in its field, produces its own
electric bearing steeL
.
Finest material for the worst work in machinery
is assured by the complete, extremely modern
Timken steel plant which is part of the great
self-contained Timken Bearing industry.
Such resources and facilities could be reared on
nothing but the engineering success of some
150,000,000 Timken Bearings. Facing an engi-
neering career, you will be facing the universal
preference for machinery designed around
Timken Tapered Roller Bearings. It will be well
to know Timkens. The little stiff-bound Timken
book, sent gratis upon request, will tell you much.

Fighting Submarines with Elevators
When the American people answered
"War" in 1917, no matter was of more
importance than the readjustment of the
great industries to the conditions of war,
and no contribution to national defense
was more exacting than that of the Otis
Elevator Company.
It was a long way from the ordinary
operations of business buildings through-
out the country to the North Sea in war
time, yet strangely enough Otis auto-
matic leveling or micro-drive elevators
proved one of the most valuable innova-
tions in connection with naval warfare.
Up to the time the American Navy
became a factor in the World War, it
had been impossible to lay, in the North
Sea, the contemplated mine barrage,
which it was hoped could be used to pre-
vent submarines from skirting the north
end of the British Isles. This had been
impossible, because the time required
to get the mines overboard prevented
successful results. The Otis Elevator
Company cooperated with the American
Navy and provided automatic leveling
elevators for the delivery of the mines
from the hold of the mine layers to the
main deck, where they could be put
overboard at such frequent intervals
as to make the laying of the barrage a
success.
In an article published several years
ago, Captain Belknap, U.S.N., who was
in command of the mine laying squad-
ron at the time, stated that in the nine
months or more of operation, in which
sixty thousand mines were handled in
and out, as well as many more in the
course of drills, there was only one
occasion in which any one of the thirty-
two elevators was shut down. This v/as
the fault of the operator, not the elevator,
in that it was run too far up and jammed
there for a few hours, but without
causing any delay in the mine laying
operation.
In war as in peace, the Otis Elevator
has become one of the indispensable
parts of our civilization.
Otis Nficro-Drive Elevators, as developed for the mine laying ships and for the
great Army and Navy Bases at New York and Boston, are now in constant use
throughout all parts of the country in office buildings, hotels, department stores,
warehouses, terminals and factories. The automatic leveling feature eliminates
"inching"at the floors, obviates the stumbling hazard in passenger elevators, as well
as saving time in operation, and increasing the life of the apparatus. On freight
elevators it also provides an exactly level landing to facilitate the handling of freight.
