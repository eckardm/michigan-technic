Mr. Palluth is in an Ideal position to write
on the subject of light planes. Besides
being a Jr. Aero Engineering student,
he holds a private pilot's license and is a
training officer for the Civil Air Patrol.
Ever since man started to travel he has
been searching for new and better ways
to get from one place to another. He used
boats, animals, trains, cars, and finally, he
developed the airplane. Why did he de-
velop the airplane? Why did he want to
fly? The reason is well summed up in the
following anonymous quotation:
"Flying is the most flexible means
of transportation the world has ever
seen. You can travel by boat only
where there is water, by automobile
only where the highway leads,- by
train only where the tracks are. The
air is everywhere."
Man wants to travel. He wants to travel
with speed, comfort, and safety. These
factors, plus the desire to obtain them
with minimum expenditure, brought about
our present day aircraft, and will un-
doubtedly help determine the plane of the
future.

The Piper Cub J-3 Trainer was within
the price range of the average enthu-
siast.
The Wright brothers' first plane could
not boast many of these features. It was
uncomfortable, unsafe, and extremely
costly. The pilot had to lie on his stom-
ach to fly it. The homemade engine was
very inconsistent and developed only 16
horsepower. The landing gear was merely
a pair of wooden runners which often
smashed on landing. Landings were very
sudden and jerky. However, it did fly,
and it boasted a speed of 31 miles per
hour, which was unheard of in those
days. The army's first plane, built by the
Wright's in 1909, was just an improved
version of the first plane. It had a
heavier engine of 30 horsepower and flew
at 44 m.p.h. Its range was 75 miles. The

cost was $25,000. Both of these planes
were constructed of wood with fabric
covering. The cockpits were open. A
great improvement in the 1909 model was
that it could be flown from a sitting posi-
tion rather than a prone position.
In the following years, aviation made
little progress in this country. Flying was
a "richman's toy" before World War I.
Men wouldn't invest in such a risky enter-
prise. Civil aviation was non-existent.
The only money for development came
from exhibition flights, altitude, distance,

and speed records. However, with the
threat of war, aviation industry loomed.
In Great Britain new factories were subsi-
dized by the government. Goals were
set for production. The military demand-
ed (hat equipment be made to fit smaller
spaces and be more reliable, that engines
be more compact and more powerful, that
fuel consumption be decreased, that the
speed and range be increased, and that
the materials used in construction be im-
proved for greater safety. The consequent
developments during four years of war
equalled those of almost ten years of
peace.
One of the best remembered planes
developed at this time was the Curtiss
JN-4, commonly known as the famous
"Flying Jenny." It was used as an obser-
vation plane, a light bomber and a trainer.
After the war, veteran pilots that could
not stay on the ground used these planes
for carrying mail and for barnstorming
with numerous flying circuses that travel-
ed the country. The "Jenny" attained the
speed of 80 m.p.h. with a 90 horsepower
engine. A biplane with numerous struts
and guy wires for wing bracing, this air-
craft was still constructed with wood and
fabric. Of course, the landing gears had
long been changed to wheels on struts
protruding from the fuselage, but shock
absorbers had not yet been perfected.
Now there was something new. The men
that flew these planes were not rich. In
fact, many of them had no money at all
other than fees from rides and daredevil
feats. Flying was no longer just a rich-
man's toy. As the public became more
and more air minded, some of the more
adventurous wanted to buy planes. The
only thing holding them back was the still
exceedingly high cost of a plane.
In recognition of this fact, the Aeronca
Corporation was formed in 1928 to de-
velop the first real light plane. It was
small, fabric covered, and cheap enough
for the average man to buy. Its tiny en-
gine used little gas. Private flying was

now on its way. At this point, military
and private planes began to differ. Mili-
tary planes were getting heavier and faster
while private aircraft were getting lighter

SCIENTIFIC WORK
HIS
BY
PAUL M. NAGHDI, PhD
Assistant Professor of Engineering Mechanics
By the fall of 1821 (130 years ago),
most of the general theory of elasticity'
had been discovered through the research
works of Navier, Poisson and Cauchy.
For a period thereafter, the mathema-
ticians interested in the science of elasticity
busied themselves with various mathemati-
cal analyses of the theory, but until the
contributions of Barre de Saint-Venant,
without doubt one of the greatest elas-
ticians that the world has seen, no con-
sideration was given to the application of
the theory to practical problems. Unlike
many of his predecessors and contem-
poraries, the problems Saint-Venant con-
sidered were those which were physically
possible or for which the solution was of
immediate practical use. While Lame was
attempting to solve the problem of an
elastic solid in the form of a right six-
face whose surface is subjected to any
system of load, Saint-Venant instead
chose a real beam and obtained a solution
which, even if approximate is nevertheless
an approximation to reality; yet he was a
great master of analysis himself and know
how to make his analyses fruitful in prac-
tice. Saint-Venant never troubled himself
with impossible distributions of load or
physically impossible elastic bodies, but
considered problems of mechanics as they
occurred practically and solved them for
practical purposes. This tendency on his
part undoubtedly resulted from his train-
ing as an engineer.
Saint-Venant's contributions to the
theory of elasticity are of such a funda-
mental nature that they form a major por-
tion of our modern courses in that subject.
It would not be an exaggeration to say
that without his semi-inverse method and
"principle of elastic equivalents of stati-
cally equivalent systems of loads," his suc-
cessors would have been greatly hindered
in their researches. His work on torsion
and flecxure of prismatical bars opened
such an immense field that, even after a
century of exploration in elasticity, most
leading scientific journals of today include
articles either directly on the subject of

his researches or extensions of his prob-
lems. * * *
Adhemar-Jean-Claude Barree de Saint-
Venant was born on August 23, 1797 at
the chateau de Fortoiseau (Seine-et-
Marne). As a child, Saint-Venant was
remarkable at studies, especially mathe-
matics. His father, a distinguished agri-
culturist of Saint-Dominique, took an ac-
tive interest in his son's studies but un-
fortunately, died when the boy was quite
young. His mother then placed Saint-
Venant at the lycee of the Flemish city of
Bruges, then part of the French empire,
where he completed his elementary
studies. At sixteen, he entered (with an
exemption for age) the ficole polytechni-
que where he studied under Navier. He
graduated first in his class and had as a
classmate Chasles, who became one of the
most famous geometricians of that period.
Following graduation and until the year
1823, he worked as a student engineer in
bridge construction. On March 15, 1823,

terior, Saint-Venant was admitted as a stu-
dent to the Ecole des Ponts et Chaussees.
From, this time until he became Chief
Engineer in Civil Service, he had been
Professor at the Institute of Agriculture;
he had built lock-gates and improved the
gutters of Paris; he became an authority
on agricultural drainage and had investi-
gated the best form of the ploughshare;
he designed a bridge and planned a
method, afterwards adopted for drying
up the vast marshes of the Sologne. As
deputy to Coriolis at the ficole des Ponts
et Chausees in 1837, Saint-Venant early
received public recognition for his work
from Poncelet while lecturing at the Sor-
bonne (1840).
He was married in 1837 to Mile.
Rohault de Fleury, who came from a
Parisian family situated in Vendomois.
Her family name was quite distinguished
among artists and archaeologists of that
time. She bore him six children, two of
whom were sons. Both sons possessed
brilliant minds which were highly de-
veloped but they did not pursue their
father's career; however, to each one he
left a profound sense of duty. Both sons
were honorably wounded in 1870 defend-
ing France and were returned home in an
ambulance. Immediately when one of
them was able to walk, the mother sent
him back into battle.

The first contribution of our author to
the theory of elasticity was made in 1837
—his lithographed Notes 2 on topics given
to his students while at the ficole des
Ponts et Chaussees as deputy to the then
Professor of Mathematics Coriolis. At
that time, the only practical theory which
could be found in the textbooks of me-
chanics was the Bernoulli-Eulerian theory
of beams. Practical engineers, including
Saint-Venant, were disgusted with the
existing mathematical theories and advo-
cated what Saint-Venant calls in his litho-
graphed Notes, "l'appreciation par senti-
ment" (engineering judgment); and
speaking of the then existing theories, he

fortunately many, it is because the applied
science is still young and immature; with
its actual resources, it can yet render great
services, but its destiny is far away. It
offers an immense field of endeavor to
those who are willing to challenge it
and mary parts of its domain seem only
to wait for a light effort in order to pro-
duce results of great utility."
While making use of the double-suffix
notation 3 in his Notes, he defined and
introduced the notion of shear strain, he
stated for the first time the superposition
theorems of small strains as well as the
sum of the corresponding stresses, and
gave the proof of the state of pure shear
on planes of 45° of an element subjected
to tensile and compressive stresses of
equal magnitude, which proof appears in
all of our modern textbooks on Strength
of Materials. He suggested the term
'"tension" (or stress) be used instead of
"pressure," and gave for the first time
the well-known formulas of maximum
stress involving a radical.
In 1844, he submitted a series of six
m;moires on the theory of flexure of
beams and plates, and as he points out,
the object of the memoires was to com-
plete, correct and simplify several parts
of the usual theory (Bernoulli-Eulerian)
of the strength of materials used in con-
struction. These communications are to
some extent superseded by the later re-
searches of Saint-Venant, namely the
mdmoires on torsion and flexure. In subse-
quent publications, he gave the solution
to numerous practical problems such as
deflection of springs, rings subjected to
vertical forces, the problem of helix and
some problems of fluid motion.
Under '"Notices" in "Comptes ren-
dus" (Volume 17, 1844), it appears that
Saint-Venant was recommended as one of
the six candidates for a vacancy of mem-
bership in the French Academy of Science.
Although the recommending committee
bracketed him with Morin as superior to
the other four, at the ballot Morin was
elected and Saint-Venant gained only the
fourth place.
In 1845, he obtained the solution to the
problem of bending of a beam with large
deflection, in which he employed the ex-
act curvature relation. His results were
expressed in terms of elliptic functions, as
we know it today.
In 1847, he published the exact expres-
sions for finite strains in the Lagrangian
mode with a discussion of strain in the

the History of Elasticity.
neighborhood of a point. In fact, he even
offered the possible geometrical interpre-
tation of finite strains, as we find it today
in the modern books of elasticity.
The fact that our author appeared to
be rather inactive between 1850 and 1853
indicates that he must have been working
ardently during these years on his new
theory of torsion. In June 13, 1853, his
epoch-making memoir on torsion was read
to the Academy of Science. The memoir
was referred to a committee consisting of
Cauchy, Poncelet, Piobert and Lame, and
the report drawn up by Lame speaks very
highly of the memoir which wis publish-
ed later in 1855. During the next few
years, his classical memoir on flexure was
published. In Saint-Venant's theories of
torsion and flexure, the coupples and
forces applied to produce twist and bend-
ing moments across each section of the
bar were assumed to be distributed in
a definite way which seldom corresponds
with actual distribution in practice. Since
he was interested in the application of
theory to practical problems, he introduc-
ed a principle which bears his name, call-
ed the "principle of elastic equivalents of
statically equivalent systems of loads."
According to this principle, the effects
produced by deviations from the assumed
manners of loading are unimportant ex-
cept near the ends of the bent beam or
twisted bar, and near the ends they may
produce merely "local perturbations."4
Noting the difficulty of obtaining general
solutions for problems of torsion and flex-
ure, and the pressing need for practical
purposes of a theory which could be ap-
plied to the strength of structures, Saint-
Venant was led to the invention of the
semi-inverse method. In his memoir on
torsion, he first demonstrates this method
for some simple cases before considering
the torsion problem.
The methods of Navier, Poisson and
Cauchy led to equations of motion which
contained fewer elastic constants than
those published by Green and Stokes. This
discrepancy was first emphasized by Stokes
and was the subject of a long dispute be-
tween the French and the English schools
of elasticians. The questions in the dis-
pute were: 1) Is elastic anisotropy to be
characterized by 21 constants or 15? 2) Is
elastic isotropy to be characterized by
two constants or one? The two theories
are referred to by Pearson as the "multi-
constant" and the "rari-constant"
theories.
4 The condition for the validity of the results
in practice is that the length of the beam
should be much larger than the greatest diame-
ter of the cross section.
Although in his work on torsion and
flexure, Saint-Venant adopted the "multi-
constant" theory, he was a firm supporter
of the "rari-constant" elasticians, which
view he held until his death."' This may
be evidenced in his publications of 1858-
1864 and again 1870-1886.
In the later years of his life, Saint-
Venint's researches were devoted to vi-
bration of bars, propagation of waves in
elastic bars, problems of circular plates
and the subject of plasticity. At this time,
Saint-Venant was a member of the
Academy and Tresca's communications on
plasticity were referred to him. In 1870,
Saint-Venant published a series of inter-
esting memoires in "Comptes rendus"
dealing with the equations of plasticity,
in which he pointed out that the problems
of plasticity cannot be solved by kine-
matics alone but involve consideration of
stress as well as of mere continuity.
Saint-Venant treats the material in the
plastic state with no change of volume
and gives the corresponding known equa-
tion. He criticizes Tresca's and his own
previous attempt to solve problems of
plasticity by pure kinematics. He states
that for plastic deformation, the maximum
shear stress at each point must be equal
to a constant (denoted by K in Tresca's
memoirs of 1869) and treats the problem
of a hollow circular cylinder subjected to
uniform pressure.
It should be remarked that Saint-Venant
assumed that the elastic and plastic de-
formations are continuous, contrary to the
view that stress ceases to be proportional
to strain long before plastic deformation
takes place.
* * *
Saint-Venant, whose researches on elas-
ticity undoubtedly far surpass those of
Navier (his teacher) and Clebsch, was
nevertheless content to appear as their
editors. But what an editing it is! The
original text of Navier, "Lecons," * is
hidden and disappears. In his annotation
of Clebsch's "Theorie der Elastitat," the
original Clebsch contains 430 pages, the
annotated translation with a much larger
page is 932 pages. In this connection,
Pearson writes: "When will an English
elastician arise who will annotate Saint-
Venant, as Saint-Venant has annotated
Clebsch?"

There was a "trick" with cards that was
quite a nuisance when we were young.
It consisted of arranging a deck of
cards so that by a process of turning the
top card of the deck up, placing the next
on the bottom of the deck, turning the
next card up, and so on, the four suits
would be turned up in succession with
each suit arranged from ace to king in
order. We are not sure we can still do
this but we are able to arrange one suit
so that the same process will turn that suit
up in order. This sort of thing, if re-
vived, would constitute a threat to soli-
taire.
As long as we have started card tricks,
let's talk of another. Suppose we arrange
a deck of cards in stacks, the number of
cards in each stack being determined in
this manner:
The bottom card in the stack is noted
and sufficient cards are placed on it so
that the value of the bottom plus the
number of cards in the stack equal four-
teen. Choose any three of the stacks and
expose the bottom card of any two of
these. Then the value of the bottom card
of the remaining stack will always be ten
less than the difference between the num-
ber of cards not in the three stacks and
the sum of the values of the bottom cards
of the two exposed stacks. Why?
After you finish playing cards you
might try to figure out what numbers the
symbols in the following represent. It
is to be understood that each different
symbol represents a different number.

Just as a matter of curiosity we ask
the following question. If a sheet of pa-
per is presumed to be one hundredth of
an inch thick, how many miles thick would
a stack of one million pieces of paper be?
Guess at an answer and then figure it out
on paper. We were way off.
Another problem along the same line,
which we have spoken of previously, is
this. If the earth is assumed to be a
sphere of radius twenty-five thousand
miles and a string is presumed to have
been laid along the earth's equator, how
much would the string have to be length-
ened if it is to be raised to uniform height
of one foot above the earth's surface.
Here is a way to break up a card game.
Lay eight cards face up in a circular ar-
rangement as shown in the diagram.

Using a card as a starting point count
around the circle to the fourth card (from
your starting point) and turn that card
over. Repeat this process, starting any-
where you please except from a face down
card. The problem is to finish with all
the cards down except one, say the ace.
Here is a simple problem for those of
you who have had or are taking physics.
At what velocity will a bullet fired hori-
zontally from a rifle hit the ground if
the rifle is five feet from ground level?
Along the same line is this problem.
What is the simplest means you can think
of to measure or calculate the volume of
a light bulb if you have access to what-
ever materials are necessary to your
method?
If you are fairly observant, then you
should have little difficulty in answering
the following questions.
On a traffic signal is the red or green
light on top?
How many tines are there on a fork?
Would you expect to find the cold
water tap on a sink on the right or left
side?
Assuming you were facing the Engi-
neering Arch from the street side, would
you use the right or left hand entrance
to West Engineering to come out closest
to the library entrance on the second floor.
Incidentally, the Engineering Arch was
erected in honor of a former faculty mem-
ber. Who was he?
While we are around the Arch we
might inquire if you've read the plaques
that are fastened to the benches surround-
ing the concrete tree stump which has
the name of what engineering society on
it?
To wind things up consider this
teaser. Arrange three pennies and two
nickels as shown in (a) of the figure be-
low.

The problem is to wind up with the
arrangement shown in (b) subject to the
following conditions. You must move
two adjacent coins at the same time and
one of these coins must be a penny and
the other a nickle. You should be able
to accomplish the rearrangement in five
moves.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


DIALING
For and About Smokey
One quiet evening some time ago, as-
sorted members of the Technic staff
were gathered in the office discussing one
of their usual profound subjects. They
were so engrossed in the discussion that
no one noticed when a sad-eyed, lop-
eared little fellow crept in and, without
so much as a "how-do," curled up and
went sound asleep on a pile of back is-
sues.
No one knows how long he slept, but
when someone finally spied him he was
rudely awakened and smothered in an
Welcome to Smokey's land of enchant-
ment. Ease your tired old thinkers into
neutral and relax cause this here is no
technical article. It is intended to be only
an interesting introduction to something
so big that even Old Smoke is awed, Na-
tionwide Subscriber Toll Dialing (to be
referred to as NSTD).
Under NSTD any subscriber in the
U.S. or Canada could pick up his phone,
dial any other dial customer in either
country, and have the connection made
completely by automatic means. This, it
seems to me, would be the ultimate in
public telephone service, nevertheless, it
can and will become an actuality in the
ensuing years.
The operation of NSTD depends on
the presence of automatic switching and
accounting mechanism at the toll centers
and the intricate system of trunk line
facilities that will be described shortly.
At present this service is possible to a lim-
ited extent only, in a few small areas.
Numbering Plan
One of the major problems associated
with NSTD is the establishment of a
nationwide numbering plan that would
identify every Bell instrument in the U.S.
by a unique number. The following is a
description of the proposed plan.
The basic concept of the Nationwide
numbering plan is founded on creating
about 80 toll areas (we will call them
"Basic Areas") to simplify the routing
of long distance calls. The areas in many

onslaught of questions. As befits his
talents, he met the barrage of question-
ing with much aplomb and proceeded to
endear himself to such an extent that he
was promptly adopted as a mascot and
affectionately named "Smokey."
For years now we staffers have watched
the growth and development of our ward
with much pride and satisfaction. He has
been everything a mascot should be. He
has learned to chase down prospective
copy, to make up a dummy, and yes, even
to empty ash trays.
As he grew he began to acquire self-as-
surance. In fact, at present he might
cases will coincide with state areas but
some of the more densely populated
states will be divided into several areas
(see fig. no. 1). Each basic area will
be identified by a 3 digit code.
Within each are larger offices which will
be selected by codes of two or three letters
or numbers, corresponding to the name of
the exchange or office where feasible.
Smaller exchanges will be given arbitrary
3 digit codes. In all cases the codes will
be followed by 4 or 5 numerals represent-
ing the station number. Thus each sub-
scriber within a specific area may be
identified by a seven or eight dial num-
ber. This number, preceeded by the 3
digit code of the basic area, will make
possible the identification of any telephone
in the nation by a 10 or 11 digit number.
You are probably wondering if Bell
plans to distribute a nationwide telephone
directory. So did I, so I asked about it.
It seems that this is considered only a
minor problem to be solved in the final
stages of the project's development. Ac-
tually it is doubtful that they would
distribute such a directory. It seems that
there are easier ways of accomplishing the
same thing.
Routing System
Before any routing system would be
considered worthy it would have to pro-
vide enough facilities to handle not less
than 97% of all toll calls without delay,
even during the hours of maximum usage.
With the proposed plan Bell expects to
even be called "cocky." As an illustra-
tion of this characteristic he recently ex-
pressed a desire to become, of all things,
a writer. We Technicers, however, are
not the kind to suppress a budding genius,
and so, with this issue of the Technic,
Smokey makes his debut as a literary
giant. If Smokey's attitude seems to be
that of the judge of all that is good and
worthy, we beg your indulgence, for it is
only the normal development'of a blos-
somed genius.
And for you Smokey, from all the
Technic staff—Godspeed.
be able to handle all toll calls in the peak
hours with virtually no delay. This is
practically perfect service.
The big routing problem is to have as
many alternate paths for any toll call as
possible. The high efficiency expected
will be made possible by an ingenious
routing arrangement that provides a great
many alternate circuits for each call.
The operation of this plan depends
on the establishment of a sequence of
toll terminals with interconnecting trunk
lines. These toll terminals are called in
descending order of size and importance;
National Center (NC) of which there is
one, Regional Centers, of which there are
8, (RC) each connected to the National
Center, Sectional Centers (SC) of which
there are several connected to each Re-
gional Center, Primary outlets (PO), of
which there are several connected to each
Sectional Center, and Toll Centers, of
which there are a great many, each group
of them homing on the particular Primary
Outlet that they serve. These last cen-
ters (TC) would be established on the
small town level, from 10,000 to 25,000
population.
For a description of the operation of
this system let us assume a hypothetical
case. A subscriber in Owosso, Mich, de-
sires to place a call to Tucson, Arizona,
both towns being Toll Centers (TC). I

A VERTICAL HYDROGEN FURNACE
With this article, Mr. Jaycox took fourth
place in the Student Papers Contest re-
cently sponsored by A.S.M.E.
Purpose and Use
The furnace described in this paper is
being used daily in the Electron Tube
Laboratory of the University of Michigan
for the construction of experimental mag-
netron tubes and parts. It was specifically
designed for the brazing operations under
conditions outlined below.
Requirements
All parts of these tubes are held to
close tolerances, the geometry of the tubes
greatly influencing their performance.
Oxygen-free, high-conductivity (known as
OFHC) copper is used wherever copper
is required, and the high purity of this
copper and other materials used must be
maintained during construction along with
dimensional accuracy. Therefore, all heat-
ing and brazing is done in a reducing
atmosphere of hydrogen to prevent oxi-
dation, embrittlement, and contamination
by air impurities. Oxidation caused by
heating copper in air may be removed by
acid cleaning, but this destroys dimen-
sional accuracy. Typical construction of
these tubes requires as many as six braz-
ing operations on one sub-assembly, four
being shown on the anode assembly of
the FM tube in Fig. 2. Simultaneous
brazing of two or more joints is done
whenever possible, but progressive assem-
bly is required in many tubes.
To eliminate the possibility of soften-
ing or failure of previous joints during
progressive assembly, brazing is done at
several temperatures using a copper-gold
alloy solder. The alloy is 37% gold,
melting point approximately 1000°C as
compared with the melting point of cop-
per of approximately 1080°C. When one
of the parent metals of a point is copper,
and the temperature is raised above
1000°C, there is a preferential alloying
of the gold with the available parent cop-
per. This reduces the proportion of the
gold in the joint and raises the melting

The previous procedure was to place the
job in its jig or fixture on a platform in-
side the heating unit, replace the top
shields, and iron housing, flush with
hydrogen and heat the furnace to the re-
quired temperature. When the job was
brazed, the power was shut off and the
furnace allowed to cool, maintaining the
hydrogen flow until job temperature
dropped to below 150°C. Each cycle time
included a furnace heating period and a
cooling periods of the furnace.

With this restriction, brazing, exclusive
of all other operations, would run as high
as five days on some tubes.
The design and construction of the fur-
nace was carried out with the following
requirements in mind.
1. Hydrogen atmosphere, with provi-
sions for substituting nitrogen in case of
ignition of hydrogen.

Be doubly sure when you specify pipe for
mains to be laid under city pavements. Sure that it
effectively resists corrosion. Sure, also, that it has
the four strength factors, listed opposite, that pipe must
have to withstand beam stresses, external loads,
traffic shocks and severe working pressures. No pipe,
deficient in any of these strength factors, should ever be
laid in paved streets of cities, towns or villages.
Cast iron water and gas mains, laid over a century ago,
are serving in the streets of more than 30 cities in
North America. These attested service records prove
that cast iron pipe not only assures you of effective
resistance to corrosion but all of the vital strength
factors of long life and economy.
STRENGTH
is vital in pipe
for city streets
CRUSHING STRENGTH
The ability ol cast iron pipe to withstand
external loads imposed by heavy fill and un-
usual traffic loads is proved by the Ring Com-
pression Test. Standard 6-inch cast iron pipe
withstands a crushing weight of more than
14.000 lbs. per foot.
BEAM STRENGTH
When cast iron pipe is subjected to beam
stress caused by soil settlement, or disturbance
of soil by other utilities, or resting on an ob-
struction, tests prove that standard 6-inch cast
iron pipe in 10-foot span sustains a load of
15,000 lbs.
SHOCK STRENGTH
The toughness of cast iron pipe which enables
it to withstand impact and traffic shocks, as
well as the hazards in handling, is demon-
strated by the Impact Test. While under hydro-
static pressure and the heavy blows from a
50 pound hammer, standard 6-inch cast iron
pipe does not crack until the hammer Is
dropped 6 times on the same spot from pro-
gressively Increased heights of 6 inches.
BURSTING STRENGTH
In full length bursting tests standard 6-inch
cast iron pipe withstands more than 2500 lbs.
per square inch internal hydrostatic pressure,
which proves ample ability to resist water-
hammer or unusual working pressures.

New Instrument for the Measurement
of Ultrasound Intensity
The Radiological Corporation of
America has announced the availability of
a new instrument for the measurement of
ultrasound intensity. Produced by the
world famous Siemens-Reiniger organiza-
tion, this instrument, called "SONO-
TEST," should find wide application in
any research laboratory concerned with
the investigation of ultrasonic effects.
The Siemens SONOTEST indicates the
transmitted ultrasonic power on a scale
calibrated directly in watts. The average
intensity in watts cm2 is easily obtained
by dividing the integral power reading
(total watts) by the transmitting area of
the respective irradiation head (cm-). The
instrument in effect measures the mechani-
cal sound radiation pressure.
The SONOTEST can be used for
under-water measurements and will give
indications in any desired position. The
range of the meter is from 0 to 60 watts.
Readings are subject of an error of less
than ±5% within the frequency range
from 0.175 Mc/sec. to 2.4 Mc/sec.

Automatic Marine Pilot Developed
A completely automatic marine pilot
system which unerringly follows any
course it receives from a human or auto-
IN THE NEWS
(Continued from page 8)
matic source has been developed for the
U. S. Navy by engineers of the General
Electric Company at Schenectady.
Where a helmsman frequently overcon-
trols the rudder in wind, sweils, or cur-
rents, the auto-pilot follows its course
with an average variation of less than
one-half of one degree.
Because the rudder is moved less often,
some fuel savings should result from use
of this equipment.
A second advantage, according to G-E
engineers, is the almost complete lack of
maintenance required on the auto-pilot
as compared with other automatic steering
systems. Primary reason for this is the
use of magnetic amplifiers, which have
proved to be extremely capable of endur-
ing the rigors of shipboard use. Amplifiers
are used to step up a small amount of
power to a higher power level when it is
needed.
The G-E auto-pilot has several operat-
ing highlights not found in manual sys-
tems. These include:
An automatic compensator which
"trims" the ship when there is more force
or resistance on one side of the vessel than
on the other. This keeps the vessel from
taking a circular course when the majority
of the power comes from one side.
A weather adjustment which may be-
set to minimize rudder action in heavy
seas, thereby cutting down the stresses on
the hull caused by excessive rudder move-
ment.
An override which permits the helms-
man to take the ship immediately from
automatic control and place it under
manual operation in emergencies.
An automatic turn compensator which
keeps the ship from maneuvering past the
desired compass heading in completing a
turn. Frequently, helmsmen find it diffi-
cult to stop their vessels from turning
past the desired point. This overcontrol-
ling factor, and resulting power waste, has
been eliminated with the auto-pilot.
The auto-pilot, now being installed on
a Navy prototype destroyer, is capable of
being used on any type vessel, G-E engi-
neers state. They also said that the device
can be used on commercial vessels.
Large Contact Printer for
Top Quality in Photocopying
Maximum ease and flexibility in photo-
copying engineering drawings and other
large-sized originals are now assured with
its newly improved Vacuum Seal Porta-
graph, Remington Rand announced today.
A contact printer, the Vacuum Seal
Portagraph comes in two models, one
with a copy surface area of 30" x 42"
and the other with a 42" x 60" area.
Both models are finished in American
Walnut.
A principal feature of the unit is a
single set of white lamps which provide
all the varying degrees of light intensity
required in contact printing. This new
lamp lay-out, operating on a single cir-
cuit by means of a rheostat control fur-
nishes the proper type of lighting for
each individual type of reproduction.
Another innovation is a set of two
lights in the instrument panel for use
under subdued light or darkroom working
conditions. One light illuminates the
timer dial and the other is for inspecting
the vacuum gauge reading.
New latches make it easy for any oper-
ator to close and open the printing lid.
Westinghouse Develops Vaporization-
Cooled Transformer
A vapor-cooled, vapor-insulated trans-
former that is expected to be 1 /A to 1/3
lighter than liquid-immersed units of
equivalent rating and performance is be-
ing developed by the Westinghouse Elec-
tric Corporation. The new cooling techni-
que—a technique that utilizes the heat of
vaporization of liquid fluorocarbons for
cooling, and the dielectric strength of
fluorocarbon vapor for insulating—is a
joint development of the Transformer Di-
vision and the Research Laboratories.
The idea to use high-molecular-weight
fluorocarbons—a new family of synthetic
compounds—to cool a transformer by
spraying the liquid on the core and coils
originated with Dr. C. F. Hill, Manager
of the Insulation Department at the Re-
search Laboratories. Fluorocarbons show-
ed great promise for vaporization cooling
for two reasons: they have a suitable boil-
ing point and heat of vaporization, and
they have a high dielectric strength and
the impulse strength at low pressures. In
fact, the 60-cycle dielectric strength of
fluorocarbons in a reasonably uniform
field at atmospheric pressure is greater
than that of transformer oil.
Two vaporization-cooled transformers
have been constructed and operated under
the guidance of Dr. Paul Narbut of the
Transformer Division. The first experi-
mental unit was a modified standard dry-

quate cooler capacity, the unit delivered
in excess of 350 per cent of its rated
capacity, dissipating ten times more heat
than a dry-type transformer could have.
Although at this loading the losses and
impedance are much too high for practical
operations, the test results do illustrate
the possibilities of vaporization cooling.
The second experimental unit, a spec-
ially-constructed 500-kva, 2400 240-voIt

ing designed for installation on the sys-
tem of the Consolidated Edison Company
of New York. From the operation of this
unit will come valuable service experience
and the answers to many of the problems
that are still not solved.
A vaporization cooled transformer will
be as safe as or safer than liquid-im-

surfaces, it should be possible to utilize
to better advantage the temperature rise
of the copper above the ambient. In fact,
the temperature at the external coolers is
about the same as that of the coils. In
addition, the coolers can be located, when
desirable, at a reasonable distance from
the transformer.
Since the dielectric strength of the
fluorocarbon vapor is superior to that of
ordinary gases, it should be possible to
extend the voltage rating of vapor-insu-
lated transformers far beyond the present
15-kv ceiling for dry-type transformers.
Even though only a small amount of
fluid is used in the transformer (a frac-
tional amount compared to a liquid-im-
mersed unit) its present high cost may
result in a unit that actually costs more
than a liquid-immersed type. Aside from
this, the particular advantages of vapori-
zation-cooled transformers will determine
their application. Where a degree of
safety is required that is not obtainable
from liquid-immersed transformers, where
space and voltage requirements rule out
dry-type transformers, and where extreme-
ly compact installations with forced ex-
ternal cooling or a remote cooler are re-
quired, a vaporization-cooled transformer
may be expected to provide the most suit-
able and economical answer.

and had to sacrifice speed for smaller en-
gines and lower operating cost.
The 1920"s also saw the change from
fuselages of wood stringers and posts to
stronger ones of welded steel tubing. The
landing gears were greatly strengthened
and the oleo strut was introduced, mak-
ing landings safer and contributing a
great deal to the comfort of flying. For
the first time a stressed metal skin cov-

ering was used. (Thomas Morse 0-19).
However, this type of covering was far
too costly for private planes at that time.
In 1936 the Aeronca Corporation pro-
(Continued from page 13)
duced the C-3, a two place monoplane
with the new welded steel tubing con-
struction. It had a top speed of 85 mph
and a cruising speed of 75 mph. Its
range, only 200 miles, was sacrificed for a
little extra speed. Its cabin was cramped
and uncomfortable. However, the C-3
formed a good pattern for later light air-
craft.
The next ten years brought a steady
increase in speed, comfort, and safety in
personal planes. Well remembered planes
such as the Piper J-3 and the Taylorcraft
used 65 horsepower engines to attain
speeds of 80 and 85 mph respectively.
Ranges were 250 to 300 miles. Both
were priced at about $2000, within the
range of the average flying enthusiast. The
cabins were a little more roomy and fairly
comfortable.
The Ercoupe 514-C, the last notable-
plane to be developed in the prewar
period, was an excellent example of the
trend toward safer planes. Its main fea-
ture was being spinproof. The Ercoupe
couldn't even be forced into a spin. This
eliminated the danger of spin-crashes on
take-off or landing. Another feature was
the two-control system, which automati-
cally coordinated the ailerons and rudder
and eliminated the use of rudder pedals
while flying. The plane itself was ex-
tremely small and light, being made of
extruded duralumin. It employed the new
stressed skin aluminum covering. An-
other great safety feature was the tricycle
landing gear, the one wheel in front pre-
venting nosing over on quick stops and
lessening the danger of ground looping.
This plane cruised at 100 mph with a
range of 450 miles. Its landing speed was
45 mph.
Now there was a new problem in mod-.
ern aircraft. The trend toward faster air-
planes was also introducing faster landing
speeds. Military aviation was the first to
see the need for slower landing speeds
and tackle the problem, and in 1940 the
United States produced the Ryan "Drag-
onfly" equipped with Fowler landing flaps
that extended backward and downward

GRID FRAME
(actual size)
A touch of gold...
a lot of Engineering!
This is the grid frame for an electron tube
that plays a vital part in the Bell System's radio
relay network for long distance telephone calls
and television programs.
Across the centra! hole of a frame —between
dotted lines —tungsten wires .0003 of an inch in
diameter, so fine you can barely see them, must
be placed with their centers .001 of an inch apart.
How to fasten this wire securely to a frame posed
a problem that took the combined skills of many
kinds of engineers.
Electrical, Chemical and Metallurgical
Engineers decided it could best be anchored with
gold. Why gold? Because it is inert in a vacuum,
reduces grid emission, is suitable for the working
temperature of the tube and is a good electrical
conductor.
Physicists, Electrical and Mechanical Engi-
neers tackled this problem — and adapted the
machine shown, in which frames are placed—forty
at a time—on a two-level rack. Between the up-
rights of the rack are heating coils into which
short lengths of 24 karat gold wire are placed.
An air-tight cover is lowered, the chamber evacu-
ated and heaters are switched on. When vacuum
and temperature are just right, the operator
passes a carefully controlled current through the
coils and the gold vaporizes, covering the grid
frames with a coating .00002 of an inch thick.
Only about two and one-half cents worth of gold
per frame is used.
Tungsten wire is next wound around two
frames at a time. These are put into a hydrogen
atmosphere and heated until the gold melts and
brazes the wire firmly to both frames, which are
then split apart.
Industrial Engineers made thorough job cost
and time studies which show this new process is
fast and economical.
Working closely together, Western Electric
engineers of varied skills are constantly develop-
ing new, better and more economical ways to
make telephone equipment. That's how they help
the Bell System give this country the best tele-
phone service on earth at the lowest possible cost.

This unusual machine turns gold into vapor to gold-
plate little grid frames at Western Electric.

YOU COULD EXPRESS THIS PROBLEM AS
( Temperature,) X (Corrosion)x(Fabricafion)
Cost-
The day after VJ-Day, engineers from a lead-
ing appliance manufacturer showed us plans
for their postwar refrigerator with a great
new feature—a king-size freeze chest. But the
size increase threatened prohibitive costs.
And no combination of metals so far had
satisfied the requirements: Fast heat trans-
fer; corrosion resistance; ease of fabrication.
They asked, "Can we do it economically in
aluminum?"
Now the freezer is simply a sheet metal
box with passageways around it to conduct
the refrigerant. Knowing that aluminum is
an excellent conductor of heat, we suggested
that the evaporator be made by brazing
aluminum tubing to aluminum sheet. "Sounds
good," they said and together we started
designs.
Aluminum Research Laboratories found
the answer to the first important question:
Aluminum is compatible with most com-
monly used refrigerants.
Alcoa's Process Development Shops sug-
gested an amazingly simple fabrication
process, "Place the tubing on fiat brazing
sheet and furnace braze the assembly. Then
form the unit into box shape." The first 25
units were made in this manner—a process
so practical and economical that it hasn!t
changed since. You'll find aluminum freezers,
formed by this method, in a great many re-
frigerators today.
This case is typical of the problems Alcoa
men undertake and solve. Throughout the
Alcoa organization, similar challenging jobs
are in progress and others are waiting ior
the men with the imagineering ability to
solve them.

The quartz disc is removable for cleaning
or replacement if necessary.
The furnace is guided by two pairs of
flanged sheaves riding between vertical
rails as shown in Fig. 6. The weight of
the furnace is supported by a cable run-
ning through ball bearing sheaves to a
counter-weight suspended within the track
framework. Suitable cushioned stops at
top and bottom of the track prevent over-
running. Friction of the various parts
allows the furnace to be set at any point
without clamping although it is easily
moved manually.
Contained in the housing are the three
main units. The upper section contains
the heating unit and the heat shield as-
sembly and a water cooled radiator is in
the bottom section.

The heating unit is a wire-wound
Norton Alundum ceramic form, 7 inches
inside diameter and 18 inches long. Two
windings of Chromel "A" resistance wire-
in parallel with four wires in each lead
provide approximately one ohm of resis-
tance. The leads are permanently silver-
soldered to stainless steel terminals which
pass through gas-tight asbestos gasketed
ceramic insulators. Windings are covered
with approximately 5 16 inch coating of
an Aluminum high temperature cement
secured by a monel metal jacket.
The radiation heat shields are used in
preference to insulation to reduce heat
retention of the assembly. Four monel
metal shields, in the form of open ended
cylinders, reduce radiation to the sides of
the furnace. A four plate top shield of
(Continued from page 18)
stainless steel is assembled between the
heating unit and the cover, while radiation
to the cooling unit is reduced by a stain-
less steel shield under the heating unit.
The cooling unit is a water-filled, cylin-
drical tank, 7 inches inside diameter, 14
inches outside diameter, and 14 inches
long. This unit is made of stainless steel
sheet with gas-welded and brazed seams
and is mounted 12 inches below the heat-
ing unit.
Fig. 10 shows the work platform, a six
inch diameter stainless steel plate, ad-
justable in height by sliding the rod up
or down inside a pipe fastened rigidly to
the floor. It is positioned by,a pin placed
through one of several holes in the rod
and two thumbscrews through the pipe
serve as clamps on the rod. The height
adjustment allows work of varying heights
to be centered in the heating and cooling
units without adjusting the position of
the furnace. Auxiliary heat shields arc
also mounted on the work stand and its
support. This method of placing the
work on a rigid and stationary plate
minimizes misalignment due to shifting
of jigs and parts.
Power is supplied from a 220 volt AC
line through a 7.5 KVA General Electric
transformer and a 100 ampere Transtat
variac. Leads to the furnace are double,
flexible, stranded copper wire, 6 gage,
with an insulation of a heat resistant as-
bestos compound. The variac is controll-
ed manually and current is metered using
a current transformer to the ammeter
shown.
Hydrogen is fed into a manifold from
tanks, through a conventional pressure
gage and valve, then through a second
valve and flow gage and finally into the
furnace through a flexible hose. Suitable
flashback filters are installed in the line.
An auxiliary nitrogen system is available
to be valved into the furnace should the
hydrogen be ignited, permitting the fur-
nace to be flushed out without shutting
down or allowing air to reach an already
hot assembly.
Calibrated Chromel-AIumel thermo-
couples installed through the work stand,
and adjustable to any part of the jig or
assembly, are used to measure the tem-
perature of the work.
Operation
The preheating of the furnace takes
from 45 to 65 minutes depending on the
initial temperature required. The furnace
is first flushed with hydrogen and then
when power is turned on, the flow is ad-
justed to approximately 20 cubic feet per
minute. Current flow is limited to 40
amperes for an initial warm-up period
of 5 to 10 minutes and then is boosted to
the maximum which is about 90 amperes
with present equipment. Initial runs of
the furnace have experimentally deter-
mined the temperature level that can be
maintained for specific combinations of
current and gas flow.
Loading is done by placing assemblies
in fixtures on the proper adjusted work

stand and lowering the furnace to the
bottom stop. When the work has reach-
ed the desired temperature, as determined
by a thermocouple, and maintained until
the brazing solder has flowed into the
joint, the furrace is raised to a point
which positions the cooling unit centrally
around the work, and then is lifted off
when the temperature of the work has
dropped to below 150°C. The furnace is
not shut down during unloading or cool-
ing, permitting the immediate loading of
another job into the hot furnace. Be-
cause of the turbulence caused by the
relative movements of the workstand and
the furnace, the hydrogen flow is stepped
up to 50-60 cfm during all furnace move-
ments. This flushing action reduces the
danger of ignition or explosion of the

putting it—but I am an engineer
(Marquette 1941, Electrical Engineering)
and a great many men do pass through
the Employment Department to oppor-

same thing myself.
During my last two years at Marquette
in Milwaukee I worked as a cooperative

ments on both design and application
work, and in the shops. When I graduated,
I continued in the Graduate Training

now the Employe Relations Department.
After six months—opportunity came
around to look me up. The Company
officer in charge of Industrial Relations
talked to me about personnel work and
asked if I'd like to go on with it as a
career.
Liked Working With People
By that time I'd seen a lot of the Company,
both product design and manufacturing,
and I knew I liked working with people
better than with machines, so it was just
the break I wanted. During the war I was

from the wings. It also had adjustable
wing slots. The two together could
change the airfoil in flight and reduce
the speed required to sustain the plane in
flight. The landing speed was only 28
mph, while the top speed was still 135
mph. In 1939 the Nazis developed the
Fieseler Storch, also with wide flaps and
movable slots, which could cruise at 100
mph and land at less than 20 mph. No
other conventional plane has equalled this
record yet.
Present day aircraft continue to show
demands for speed, comfort, and safety.
Many are just improved prewar models
while others are entirely new designs in-
corporating many developments of World
War II. The production figures, 2,400
two-place and 3,600 four-place planes in
1949, show an increased demand for
more room and passenger capacity. In
order to see the continuation of these
trends we must look at the aircraft of to-
day.
Among the most popular postwar air-
craft the two-place, all metal, Cessna 140
is a good example of present day per-
sonal planes. It has an 85 or 90 horse-
power engine giving it a speed of 105
mph. Its cabin is roomy and comfortable
with upholstery equalling that of most
present day cars. Its price is $3,345.
A new plane, the Piper Clipper, has a
cruising speed of 112 mph. It's engine
delivers 115 horsepower. The Clipper
was until recently made by Piper Aircraft,
known the world over for low priced
planes. It was the world's cheapest four-
place aircraft, selling for $2995. The low
price widens the sales field, but in order
to keep the price down, something has to
be sacrificed. In this case the sacrifice is
a durable metal covering. The plane is
entirely fabric covered, except for the
metal engine cowling. At present, the
Clipper seems to come the closest to being
the ideal fast, safe, and comfortable plane
in the cheaper class.
The favorite plane in the more expen-
sive class seems to be the four-place
Beechcraft A-3 5 Bonanza. The Bonanza
utilizes the "Butterfly tail" system de-
veloped during the war, and the plane is
spin resistant. The top speed is 184 mph
and the cruising speed is 170 mph. The
landing speed is 56 mph with flaps. The
plane is constructed of aluminum alloy
with metal covering. For added passen-
ger safety the windows and cabin are
(Continued from page 28)
reinforced with aluminum formers. The
windowscreen employs a new material,
moulded lucite. The tricycle landing gear
is retractable to permit greater speed. Full
radio and navigational equipment is
standard on all Bonanzas. This plane
would be almost ideal except for its ex-
tremely fast landing speed and high price
($10,975). Planes such as this are be-
yond the means of the average private
pilot.
The Bonanza gives a good example of
the increasing landing speed of present
day aircraft. Although special planes like
the Helioplane (27 mph landing speeds)
have been developed to prevent this, none
has gone so far as the helicopter which
has reduced the landing speed to virtually
zero mph. Helicopters for private use are
still only in the experimental stage and
are far too costly for the average pilot.
Take for example the JOV-3 two-seat
helicopter manufactured by the Helicopter
Engineering Research Corporation. The
JOV-3 uses a 125 horsepower engine to
drive two rotor blades. The top speed is
100 mph, as fast as many light planes,
and range is 138 miles. The landing
speed is zero mph, thereby permitting
safe landings in extremely small fields
or even on buildings. Of course, until the
cost is greatly reduced, by mass produc-
tion, this type of aircraft' cannot be con-
sidered for the average private flier.

The Piper Clipper came the closest to
being the ideal fourplace private plane.
One of the big discomforts of flying is
the problem of transportation into town
after landing at the airport, and this is
what brought about a third type of air-
craft, the roadable airplane. One of these
is the Fulton Airphibian, designed in
1946. This plane has a detachable for-
ward fuselage, which, when detached, be-
comes a four wheel car using the same
engine to furnish power. Its airspeed is
110 mph, and its ground speed is 45 mph.
The landing speed is 55 mph. The Air-
phibian is constructed largely of wood
and fabric. It carries two people.
Another roadable plane, the Hall
"Planemobile," is actually a car with a
separate engine, attached to a wing, en-
gine, and tail assembly for flying. This
one is four-place, and cruises at 100 mph
in the air, 67 mph on the ground. The
car utilizes a new plastic body, latex
foam seats and upholstery for comfort,
and safety glass windows. The car is at-
tached to the flying part at three points,
and the engine will not start until all of
these points are locked in place and the
controls are functioning properly. Both of
these roadable planes are detachable from
the flying part in less than five minutes.
The price of these crafts, if placed on pro-
duction, is not yet determined, but will
probably be too high for the average pilot
at first. This is one of the major problems
of the roadable plane industry.
We have followed briefly the trends
of personal aircraft design from the first
airplane to the plane of today. But what
about the plane of tomorrow—Actually,
it would be quite rash to forecast the fu-
ture in the aircraft industry. In 1910,
when the pleasure automobile was a rich
man's luxury, who could have known that
in the short space of forty years there
would be one car for every 3-1 persons in
the United States? Who can predict to-
day what forty more years will bring for
the private flier? Designs are changing
rapidly with the application of new en-
gines, fuels, metals, and plastics now be-
ing developed. However, if the plane
of the future is anything like what the
private pilots would like to have now, it
will have a landing speed under 30 mph
and cruise at speeds approximating those
of present day airliners. It will have a
tricycle landing gear or possibly even four
wheels if the plane is one of the roadable
types. It will seat four comfortably. It
will be stall resistant and spinproof, prob-
ably incorporating the two control sys-
tem of the Ercoupe or Bonanza. It will
have an all metal or glass laminated
plastic wing and fuselage and may be
equipped with a gas turbine engine with
high horsepower, light weight, and small
fuel consumption. Although prices are al-
ways flexible along with economic condi-
tions, low cost will always be desired.
These factors will change as the years go
by, but we can be fairly certain that the
present trends of speed, comfort, and
safety will still govern the production of
personal aircraft.

a laboratory
technician
If you checked "toolmaker"^ you
know your way around in a machine
shop. He's grinding the contour of a car-
bide-tipped flat form tool on an optical-
type precision grinder equipped with a
Norton Diamond Wheel.
Facts You Should Know
One of the reasons for the industrial
edge the United States has over other
countries is its leadership in the use of
cemented tungsten carbide tools. With
them, American industry has speeded up
mass production.
Cemented carbide tools are so hard
that they cannot be machined in their
ultimate form by any known metal tool.
So, they must be shaped by grinding
with abrasive wheels.
Diamond wheels have become the
accepted type of abrasive wheel for pre-
cision grinding operations on cemented
carbides. Their exceptionally fast and
cool cutting action and extremely low
rate of wear result in economically low
grinding costs.
Norton Diamond Wheels
Norton Company pioneered in the
development of diamond wheels in this
country, bringing out the first Hesinoid
Bonded Diamond Wheel in 1934. This
was followed 5 years later by the durable
Metal Bonded Diamond Wheel. And in
1945, came the Vitrified Bonded Dia-
mond Wheel, a development of the
Norton research laboratories.
Today, the Norton price list for Dia-
mond Wheels and Hones contains about
1000 items, ranging in list price from
$17.70 to $2,877.35, depending on the size
of the wheel and the diamond content.

Think It Over!
Because Norton Company is dedi-
cated to "making better products to
make other products better," Norton
Research is always looking ahead. To the
young technical man, such a progressive
attitude promises an interesting future.

But today we are expanding rapidly
in new fields of petrochemicals and
high polymers, fields which offer
unique opportunities for ambitious
engineers and chemists.
For example, we need the widest
variety of engineering talent to
operate the largest furnace type
carbon black plant in the world.
We require technical men of high
competence to carry on research
and production in the fields of ni-
trogen fertilizers, synthetic rubber,
sulfur chemicals and materials for

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


WORKHORSE OF INDUSTRY. . .
Its granddaddy was a ponderous bi-polar Per-
cheron that weighed hundreds of pounds . . . and
cost hundreds of dollars more for the same horse-
power. Yet this little miracle of efficiency runs
for years without attention . . . has only one
moving part. Today, motors are being built that
operate safely in dusty, dirty, even explosive
atmospheres.
Many nimble minds gave their ingenious best
to make these improvements possible. Physicists,
chemists, metallurgists, electrical and production
engineers, designers, machinists . . . these and a
thousand others contributed to the breeding of
this alert little workhorse of industry.
AMERICA WORKS LIKE THAT...
Pulling together toward a worth-while goal is a
work method uniquely American. Here, every
art, every science, every human skill has the in-
centive and the opportunity to add its bit of
invention or insight to the greater whole.
America can work like that because it has an
all-seeing, all-hearing and reporting Inter-Com-
munications System.
THE AMERICAN INTER-COM SYSTEM ...
Complete communications is the function, is the
unique contribution of the American business
press ... a great company of specially edited
magazines devoted to the specialized work areas
of men who want to manage better, design
better, manufacture better, research better, sell
better.
WHY WE HAPPEN TO KNOW.. .
The McGraw-Hill business publications are a
part of this American Inter-Com System.
As publishers, we know the consuming insist-
ence of editors on analyzing, interpreting, report-
ing ... on making sure that every worth-while idea
reaches interested people quickly and regularly.
As publishers, we know that people subscribe
to business publications to keep abreast of what's
new in ideas, methods and processes as reported
by the editors and in products, materials and

DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF
HYDROGEN FURNACE
(Continued from page 34)
hydrogen caused by air mixing with the
gas and reaching the hot section of the
furnace.
Modifications
During preliminary operation of this
furnice several modifications were sug-
gested and considered. These may be
incorporated into a second furnace of this
type when built.
Temperature control circuits should be
constructed to allow more precise control.
Along with this, it would be necessary to
develop some type of thermocouple or
other temperature indicator which would
not require recalibration after each heat.
Chromel-Alumel thermocouples, although
they withstand temperature up to 1300°C
without physical deterioration, have to be
corrected by up to 7 degrees for each heat
in hydrogen atmosphere.
Shorter preheats and greater efficiency
may be obtained if the various baffles and
heat shields around the heating unit are
arranged so as to direct the incoming
hydrogen between each set of baffles suc-
cessively towards the center, rather than
having a general downward flow as the
present arrangement allows. This would
operate in the manner of a counterflow
heat exchanger and would provide maxi-
mum preheating of the gas before it
reaches the work area in the center of the
unit.
A newly developed heating unit con-
sisting of a single resistance element in
the form of a thin open ended cylinder,
may be tested for use in a furnace of this
type. Another system using "hairpin" or
U-shaped molybdenum elements at low
voltage may also be tested. Both the
above would have the advantage of very
fast heating and low heat retention.
Using a hydraulic or pneumatic cylin-
der for lifting and lowering of the furnace
would reduce the amount of overhead
frame construction required and would
provide smoother control of furnace
movements.

M.E.'s AT DU PONT
Diversity of chemical products spells
opportunity for the mechanical engineer
Students of mechanical engineering
sometimes assume there is little op-
portunity for them in the chemical
industry. In fields where products are
made in more or less standardized
equipment, this may be so.
But in a company like Du Pont
which operates in many fields of in-
dustrial chemistry—where products
are made at pressures over 15,000
pounds per square inch as well as in
vacua low as two millimeters of mer-
cury—mechanical engineers are in
heavy demand.
What jobs do they fill at Du Pont?
Literally hundreds, not including the
normal run of mechanical engineer-
ing work such as design of standard
equipment, scaling up from blue-
prints, etc.
For example, here are some of the
problems encountered in the manu-
facture of nylon yarn alone:
1. Nylon polymer, a poor thermal
conductor, is melted by a contact sur-

The compression stages of these 50 ton/day
hypercompressors (15,000 p.s.i.) for nitrogen,
hydrogen, etc., were designed by Du Pont me-
chanical engineers.
face grid at 550°F. The polymer de-
composes slowly at this temperature,
and there is a major heat-transfer
problem. Many types of melting grids
had to be designed before one proved
satisfactory.
2. The molten polymer is pumped to
spinnerets under pressures over 1000
pounds per square inch. With nylon
as the only lubricant, the pumps must
operate continuously at 550°F. Spe-
cialized problems in sealing, gasket-
ing and materials of construction are
inherent in this operation.
3. The melt is forced through mul-
tiple holes (diameters of 7 to 22 thou-
sandths of an inch) in a special alloy
disc. They must be made to conform
to "jeweler's specifications."
4. The emerging fibers are cooled in a
specially designed "air conditioned"
chimney. Precise control is essential
in this critical operation.
5. The fibers are wound on spools at
surface speeds around 1000 yards per
minute. Design calls for constant
change in speed so that there is no
localized stretching or relaxation of
the fiber.
6. Finally, the fiber is drawn about
400% and wound on spools traveling
at 5000 feet per minute. Bearing lu-
brication and dynamic balance pre-
sented important design problems.
These are but a small part of the
mechanical engineering problems
arising in the manufacture of a single
product by only one of Du Pont's ten
manufacturing departments. Literally
hundreds of other products, ranging
all the way from cellulose sponges to
metals like titanium, present similar
challenges. So long as new processes
continue to be sought and old proc-
esses improved, there will be impor-
tant work for the hand and mind of
the mechanical engineer.

PROBLEM—You are designing an electric clock for auto-
mobiles. The clock itself is completed. To set the clock,
the spindle which turns the hands must be pushed in against
a spring pressure and then turned—and, of course, when
the clock is installed, this spindle is back Under the dash-
board. You want to provide a means for pushing and
turning the spindle from a point that is easy to get at.
How would you do it?
THE SIMPLE ANSWER—Use an S.S.White flexible shaft
The illustrations show how one manufacturer does it. Re-
gardless of where the clock is mounted, the flexible shaft,
available in any length, makes it possible to put the hand-
set knob in the most convenient spots.

The Hidden Radio
"// was spooky down in the cellar.
"The wife had taken over the upstairs radio
for her pet soap opera. And the kids had
their eyes glued to the western on the TV.
So I had to dig up the old portable, hidden
away in the basement storeroom.
"When the newscast was over, I clicked off
the set and just sat there, thinking about
other men in cellars of communist-domi-
nated countries. Men listening at the risk of
their lives to broadcasts from beyond the
Iron Curtain. To words of Freedom.
"The Great Red Father doesn't like hidden
radios! I don't wonder he cracks down, be-
cause Freedom and dictatorship don't mix.
We took hold of our Freedoms back in 1776
and, through wars and depressions, we've
hung onto them mighty hard.
"Those Freedoms are all in our Bill of Rights,
and the chances of any outside enemies tak-
ing them away from us seem pretty slim to
me. But we mustn't forget the enemies in-
side our boundaries, too. The religious and
race hate-makers . . . the pint-size dictators
. . . the wild-eyed reds and the slimy parlor
pinks. The woods are full of 'em!
"And if we aim to keep our Freedom of
religion and speech and press ... if we want
to keep our jobs safe, like mine down at the
Republic mill, helping produce important
steel... then we've got to keep our eyes and
ears wide open to spot these inside enemies.
They might be miles away... or living with-
in our own community.
"In other words, we must keep informed
about what's going on today. That's why I
didn't want to miss the newscast . . . even
if I had to risk my rheumatics in that dark,
damp cellar."

Since Owosso is a small terminal it
would, in all probability, not have a direct
trunk to any point outside Michigan,
therefore, the automatic switches at
Owosso would make a connection to
Lansing, Owosso's Primary Outlet. The
trunk to Lansing would be such that there
would always be an available circuit to
that point.
Now Lansing is a much larger ter-
minal. It undoubtedly has interstate trunk
lines. From fig 2 we can see that it has a
trunk to Albuquerque, N. M. Tucson's

connection would be made and carried on

"Improving" any machine really means
increasing its productive capacity. That
means tinkering with speeds and weights
and strength—ending up with alloy steels.
Which alloy steel?—the one that meets

Molybdenum steels fill that bill. Good

them to do it.

in engineering and other professions and
businesses alike. Through its speed it can
provide movies that slow down action
which would be far too fast for eyes to
follow. Through radiography it checks
castings, welds, and assemblies without
destroying the part.
And so it goes all through the profession.

What happens to all the college graduates
General Electric hires?
About 55 per cent of the graduates of General Electric's
Business Training Course are now making their careers in
accounting and auditing work. About 17 per cent are in
marketing; 15 per cent in administrative and management;
3 per cent in advertising; 3 per cent in manufacturing;
with 7 per cent in fields ranging from purchasing to
employee relations.
Of the more than ten thousand engineers and other
specialists at General Electric, about 60 per cent are in
some phase of engineering or research, with 20 per cent in
marketing, and the other 20 per cent in manufacturing,
purchasing, etc.
Figures like these help to prove that there are no fixed
paths for college graduates at General Electric. The grad-
uate who enters a G-E training program doesn't commit
himself irrevocably to one type of work.
It's a G-E tradition to encourage the newcomer to look
around, try several different assignments on for size, find
the kind of job which he believes will be most satisfying
and to which he can make the greatest contribution.

How to buck up a bucket
To carry the tremendous load on the sheaves of this giant,
17-ton-capacity clamshell, engineers mount them on Tim-
ken" tapered roller bearings. Due to line contact between
rollers and races, Timken bearings have unusual load-
carrying capacity. And because of their tapered construc-
tion, they take radial and thrust loads in any combination.
Friction is practically eliminated. Lubrication is kept to a
minimum because Timken bearings permit effective closures
to keep dirt and water out and retain lubricants longer.
Mounting sheave bearings
The Timken bearings in this application are mount-
ed with slotted cone spacers to provide lubrication
through the shaft. The entire sheave assembly is
clamped together by means of a nut and spacers
between each bearing assembly. Felt seals are used.
Cups are mounted with a press fit in the sheave
hubs and positioned with snap rings.

"Put your Xthere/"
Ever have nightmares?
"I don't, often. But I sure had one last
night! Wasn't my usual one, being chased
by a lion and falling off a cliff. In this
dream it was Election Day. I was at the
polls, kidding with some of the boys I
knew .. . but they weren't kidding back.
They looked sort of worried or scared
or something.
"Anyway, I got my ballot, stepped into
the voting booth and pulled the curtain.
I wet the end of the pencil... to make my
X's big and black. Then the nightmare
part began.
"A tough-looking soldier stepped into
the booth. He put his finger on the ballot
and said, 'Put your X There! And THERE
... and There ...' None of the names I'd
picked, either. He had a big black gun
pointing right at me.
"That was last night. Today, all day, I've
been thinking about it. I'd known that
was how some elections got settled in
other places. But it never occurred to me
before how lucky I was to be a citizen of
this country. Here I vote according to my
conscience, not a gun. And I do other
things the way I please . . . like going to
church, or picking out my own kind of
job down at the Republic plant. Try that
where there's no freedom!
"That's it . . . Freedom! We've got all the
Freedom in the world. But,
honestly now, do we really appre-
ciate it? Do you? I admit I've done
my share of griping . . . probably never
will get over that habit.
"But, with Freedom-grabbers at work
here as well as abroad, I want to be sure
on Election Day that we're all alone in
that voting booth. With nobody to tell
us, 'Put your X There." No sir!"

CHEMICAL PROBLEM...
. . . concrete for highways that
will withstand the destructive
effects of freezing weather.
SOLUTION...
. . . cement made with Vinaol*
Resin ... a low-cost Hercules rosin
derivative. When added to Port-
land cement in minute quantities,
it makes concrete that's filled with
tiny bubbles of air. This entrained
air serves as an internal "cushion"
against alternate freezing and
thawing . . . prevents damage to
the pavement. Today, Portland
cement manufacturers use more
Vinsol for highways and structural
jobs than all other air-entraining
agents combined.

ORGANIZING SERVICE
Are we asked to detect the approach of enemy attack
through the stratosphere? Is there a commercially better method
for extracting sugar from beets? Can we help find alloys (for use
in jet planes) that may replace those made of materials now in
short supply?
Unlimited numbers of technical problems confront our gen-
eration. Among our expanding concepts of civilization and
under the pressures of a world-wide attack upon our basic free-
doms we meet the questions of "Is it possible?" and "What is
best?" and "How may the data be obtained?" at every turn.
An organization able to attack every possible problem, to
follow through the intricate maze of developments, to reconcile
interests, to administer financial requirements surely is cooperat-
ing in a field that gives maximum opportunity for service.
Though entirely conscious of the dif-
ficulties inherent in its daily routine,
the Institute nevertheless is backed by
the almost unlimited capacities of one
of the great Faculties of our day and
time and so looks forward with optim-
ism to future opportunities for solid
achievement by the University we all
must serve.

Plastic Blowers for A-C Motors
Plastic has found another use in the
electric motor field, where it now is being
used to replace critical aluminum and
bronze for blowers in small, totally-en-
closed, fan-cooled a-c motors. The plastic
blowers consist of a polyester resin rein-
forced with glass fibers. Glass fiber rein-
forcement has been found to be superior
to organic fiber reinforcement because of
increased resistance to chemical attack,
and increased strength per pound.
The plastic blower has many advan-
tages over the aluminum and bronze
blowers it replaces. It is unaffected by
the chemical agents that attack the metals.
Hence, it is desirable on motors used in
refineries, chemical plants, and process
industries where corrosive atmospheres
may be present.
The plastic blower is as much as one
third lighter in weight than its metal
counterparts. While this may be but a
matter of a few ounces, the reduction of
inertia where frequent, rapid reversals are
required is worthwhile. Preliminary tests
indicate that the plastic blower has better
resistance to abrasion than its predeces-
sors.
These advantages are obtained without
sacrifice in blower performance. The
blower has successfully passed overspeed
tests at four times normal speed. Westing-
house currently is applying these new
plastic blowers to totally-enclosed fan-
cooled Life-Line motors in NEMA frames
254 and 284 (5 and 7l/2 horsepower,
1750 rpm). They will be applied to
other motors later.
Internally Cooled Generator Coils
Increase Rating by One Half
A new method of cooling large tur-
bine generators that has been developed
by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation
will make it possible to increase ratings by
as much as one half. The new cooling
technique consists simply of blowing
hydrogen gas at high velocity through
specially-constructed hollow generator
coils. This brings the hydrogen, the cool-
ing medium, in direct contact with the
copper in which the heat is generated.
Since this cooling method reduces to
almost zero the heat flow through the coil
insulation, the temperature of the copper
coils is determined by the temperature of

Figure I
the hydrogen gas, and the heat transfer
coefficient from the copper to the hydro-
gen. Therefore, for a given maximum
temperature rise, it will be possible to
pass more current through the coils, since
the additional heat that results can be
quickly dissipated.
Internal cooling is particularly appli-
cable to units for ratings of 90,000 kw
and above. The improved cooling makes
possible the construction of ratings much
larger than now possible with conven-
tional hydrogen cooling. Ratings of 3600-
rpm single-unit generators of 250,000 to
275,000 kw now appear possible at power
factors and stability characteristics suitable
for the large electric utility systems.
The increase in copper losses due to
higher current densities is more than off-
set by the reduction in bearing losses re-
sulting from the smaller bearings re-
quired for the smaller rotors, and the re-
duction in rotor surface losses resulting
from the appreciable increase in the radial
length of the air gap and the decrease in
rotor surface area.
Under present conditions, the reduction
in physical size of generating units for a
given rating is of paramount importance
since it results in the conservation of our
nation's two most necessary critical ma-
terials—copper and steel. Higher costs
per unit weight offset any possible cost
savings resulting from the use of smaller
amounts of copper and steel. Large capac-
ity turbine generator units of this type,
even at present costs, however, should re-
sult in lower overall station capital and
operating costs without any sacrifice in
efficiency performance.
The cut-away view of a rotor and rotor
winding (Fig. 1) shows the path of the
hydrogen gas flowing through the rotor
conductors for a particular type of con-
struction. The curves in Figure 2 show
the rotor ampere conductors per slot,

men engaged in testing the effectiveness of a new
powder against plant fungi in the greenhouses at

often work in close conjunction with research proj-
ects at university centers.
AL CHECKS EFFECTS of a spray on an apple tree with

How chemistry is winning
the War on Weeds
Agricultural weed control has for a long
time presented chemistry with one of its
most interesting problems. Recent successes
in this field by petroleum scientists demon-
strate the broad scope of activity to which
research men in Standard Oil's Whiting
laboratories are daily exposed.
The story of weed control begins with
wartime manpower shortages on truck farms.
Vegetable crop failures increased because
weeding could not be done by hand. Scien-
tists discovered that certain petroleum cuts
would rid carrot crops of weeds without
harm to flavor.
This led to further experiments on the
weed-killing possibilities of petroleum frac-
tions by Dr. B. H. Grigsby and his assist-
ants at Michigan State College—cooperating
with groups of scientists at other agricultural
colleges. Great progress was made on weed-
control in the cultivation of celery, aspara-
gus, caraway, dill, parsnips, and cranberries.
Another tough weed-elimination problem
was crab grass. To do the job, it was neces-
sary to find a killing agent which would
knock out the crab grass, yet leave other
grasses unharmed. Recently, Standard Oil
has been able to announce successful test
results on the petroleum fraction which is
today's miracle crab grass killer.
These are just a few of the many problems
that give young Standard Oil research men
the satisfaction of knowing they have con-
tributed to an advance in our way of living
through new uses for petroleum and petrole-
um products.

THREE LANGUAGES REQUIRED
IN ENGINEERING

DEAN GEORGE G. BROWN
College of Engineering
University of Michigan
Language serves a dual purpose. Its conventionalized
signs or symbols, such as words or gestures, are means for
communicating feeling or thought and also play a large
role in our thinking processes. We say an individual thinks
in German, or thinks in French, indicating that the ideas in
his mind are formulated in the symbols of that particular
language. An engineer must have adequate command of
language, not only for the communication of ideas in a
quantitative and exact manner, but also as a tool for his
thinking processes.
A primitive and easily grasped means of formulating and
communicating ideas is by pictures, directly representative
of concrete objects with which we are constantly in contact.
Such pictures became symbolized as ideograms representing
ideas, and later as phonograms representing sounds in the
highly developed language of the Chinese. The Greek,
Roman and modern written languages, with which we are
familiar, are composed solely of phonograms or symbols
representing the sounds used in the spoken language.
As mankind became more concerned with abstract ideas,
abstract symbols were used in the language of mathematics.
Individuals trained and experienced in this field can and do
think as readily and fluently in the language of mathematics
as most of us do in English.
English and the language of mathematics are each rather
complex. Many years of experience are required before
fluency is attained in the effective interchange of ideas and
in formulating ideas, or thinking. We must recognize
that untruths can be stated in the language of mathematics
as readily as in any other language, and that errors and con-
fusion may result from the use of mathematics by incom-
petent or careless individuals just as readily as with other
languages.
It has been found that a common characteristic of all
successful administrators and leaders in industry and pub-
lic affairs is a high competency and vocabulary in their na-
tive language as this is the medium in which they express
their ideas and do their thinking. The fundamental, scien-
tific relationships and data required in the practice of engi-
neering are usually expressed in the language of mathe-
matics, and leaders in the technical or scientific aspects
of engineering and in the extension of scientific knowledge
must have a competence in the language of mathematics
comparable to that in English possessed by the administrative
executive. For these' reasons, the engineer must begin the
study of English and mathematics early in his career and use
these languages continuously and as extensively as is pos-
sible, both as tools and as a means of expression.
The engineer is a practitioner applying whatever scientific
principles and empirical results with which he may be fa-
miliar to the problem at hand. Many of these empirical rela-
tionships which are part of the art of engineering can best
be expressed by charts and other graphical methods. This
means of presenting data, details of construction, dimen-
sions, etc., or Engineering Drawing, is the third language
required by engineers. It is highly developed with well es-
tablished symbols and is heavily relied upon in engineering
practice. Modern engineering practice and industrial opera-
tions would be impossible without the use of Engineering
Drawing.
The beautiful ship models constructed a couple of cen-
turies ago were necessary because of the lack of engineering
drawing as a means of communicating and developing the
details of construction. The models were prepared by the
ship's designer as a means of working out the design and
as a means of conveying the dimensions and construction
of the vessel to the shipwrights and carpenters who executed
the construction. This practice was also common in the
manufacturing industry. One of my earlier experiences after
graduation was as Production Manager of a company manu-
facturing industrial sewing machines. About 150,000 dif-
ferent parts were stocked for replacement on machines in
service; but the design and construction of these parts was
recorded only in the form of models and in the minds of
the experienced foremen. There were no detailed engineer-
ing drawing of these parts, and they were described and
identified by words. I well remember the headaches caused
by this practice and my efforts to get drawings. Can you
imagine a modern automobile company or an arms manu-
facturer operating on such a basis?
Descriptive Geometry is where we learn to think in the
language of engineering drawing. For this reason, it is a
basic requirement in all engineering courses. The use of

... Yet chis Hindu Fakir is taking steps
to demonstrate a basic refractory prin-
ciple. For it is the ability of refractory
materials to withstand the effects of
high heats that makes them industrially
important as linings in kilns, furnaces
and other heating applications. Other
properties of refractories have since
made possible improved and advanced
processes in low as well as high tem-
perature ranges. Where abrasive and
corrosive action in addition to the heat
factor have caused ordinary refractories
to fail, it has been necessary to develop
Super Refractories such as those made
in our New Jersey plant.
In this line are the newest types of
refractories, some of which approach the
indestructible when correctly applied.
And as industrial progress requires them,
further developments in refactories can
be expected. That's why.. .where refrac-
tories are concerned, it is advisable to

TO THE PHYSICAL WORLD
PART I
BY
GERALD LOSEY
The prime function of mathematics is
to act as a language, a language which at-
tempts to translate and record the nature
of the physical world into universal
terms. In what follows we will try to
show how this language is applied and
how it can be applied, and what sort of
a picture of the universe it presents. In
this first article we will give a short dis-
cussion of the nature of these universal
terms of mathematics and analyze the
mathematical solution of problems in-
volving the physical world.
When man first awoke to find himself
in a world full of strange and varied
phenomena, the development of his per-
ceptiveness had not attained the point
where he had a meaning for the idea of
number. The closest to this concept that
man reached for thousands of years of
his existence was recognition of the dis-
tinction between one man and many men,
one deer and many deer, one fish and
many fish. But even this can not be con-
sidered a conception of the "number" one,
for mathematical oneness is an abstraction
independent of the referent of man, or
deer, or fish; oneness is that thing which
one man, one deer, one fish, etc., all
have in common. It was not the percep-
tion which primitive man lacked but the
essence of the perception. The first
mathematician was not the man who first
added one apple to one apple and got
two apples, but he was the man who first
abstracted number from its referent.
When this first mathematician ab-
stracted the idea of number from his sen-
sory impressions, he left the realm of the
physical world and entered that of the
mental world.
A similar phenomena occurred in the
development of geometry. Men looked at
the world around them and idealized
what they saw into points, lines, circles,
planes, cubes, etc. Such things did not
actually exist in physical reality, but there
did exist approximations to them. A star
might be considered as a point in relation-
ship to our more immediate surroundings;
We on the Technic staff felt that it
might make interesting reading to pre-
sent a somewhat broader view of some
of the general sciences involved in engi-
neering. Gerald Losey, senior mathe-
matics student, came up with the fol-
lowing article recently, and we feel that
it is a very good one with which to ini-
tiate the policy.
in fact, the star is considered as a point
in navigation, and ships seldom lose their
way. But it is certainly not true that a star
has neither length, breadth, nor depth, as
the Greek geometers defined a point. The
concept of point was the idealization and
abstraction of numerous similar phen-
omena.
In such a way the language of mathe-
matics grew. As man learned more and
more about the nature of the world about
him, he added new ideas to his mathe-
matical vocabulary. Most of these new
concepts were not things which actually
existed, but abstracted idealizations of the
phenomena which he wished to interpret.
However, it is a property of this pro-
cess of abstraction that it is, for the most
part, reversible. Take, for example, the
problem mentioned above of navigating
by the stars. In our physical problem we
have several stars of many thousands of
miles in diameter, the light beams which
they shed on the ship, the earth, and the
observer. In the formation of our men-
tal problem we consider the stars and the
observer as points, the light waves as
straight lines, and the earth as a sphere.
Then, to this problem of points, lines, and
spheres we apply the logical processes
which we have developed to deal with
them and thus we obtain an answer to the
problem. Now, by reinterpreting our re-
sults in terms of our original physical
problem we find that the answer is as ac-
curate as were our measurements, or as
nearly so as we can ascertain.
In the same way the solution of any
problem by mathematical methods re-
solves itself into three fundamental stages:
1. The translation of the interpretation
of the problem into universal terms
and/or symbols.
2. The logical analysis and synthesis of
the translation obtained in (1).
3. The reinterpretation of the results
of (2) back into the physical world.
The first step, that of translation, is per-
haps the most difficult of the three, for
some problems deal with many varied and
very loosely related phenomena. For ex-
ample in psychology and sociology, it is
because no one has yet been able to find
appropriate mathematical, universal terms
in which to express their interpretations,
that only rudimentary success has been
achieved in trying to mathematicize these
subjects.
We are all familiar with the processes
of the second step when it involves nu-
merical or geometrical concepts. We ap-
ply certain logical principles whenever
we solve a problem in differential calculus
or prove a theorem in geometry. But
when our problem is one in psychology,
different methods are required. It is in
the realm of mathematical logic to in-
vestigate these methods when our univer-
sal terms are not necessarily numerical or
geometrical concepts.
The third stage, the reinterpretation, is
the "proof of the pudding." If the inter-
pretation and translation we employed
in step one were accurate and mir-
rored the phenomena which they describe,
then what we obtain by this third step
should also agree with physical reality.
If it does not, then we know that we have
made a mistake in our original interpreta-
tion. As an example, take the case of a
particle traveling at very high velocity.
When the motion was interpreted by
Newton's laws of motion, the results ob-

MELVIN J. ANDERSON
During World War II, the need for a
rectifier that could be used at ultra-high
frequencies became obvious. A vacuum
tube rectifier built to operate in this fre-
quency range would, due to transit time
problems, incorporate extremely small
electrode spacings and hence be difficult
to manufacture. The men faced with the
problem of finding such a rectifier began
to think along different lines, and event-
ually they developed a silicon diode
which was similar to the crystal used in
the old crystal receiving set. Later on
someone wondered what would happen if
a third terminal were added to a silicon
diode. Tests and experiments were con-
ducted with the three terminal crystal and
it was found, under certain conditions, to
have properties similar to those of a triode
vacuum tube. This three terminal crystal
was called a transistor.
Two types of transistors have been de-
veloped. One is called the point-contact
and the other the junction type transistor.
It is the purpose of this article to acquaint
the reader with both types by presenting a
brief discussion of how they operate, some
of their properties, and few circuit aspects
of the transistor.
Transistors are made of silicon or ger-
manium, although any element found in
Group IV of the Periodic System could
be used. The crystal of silicon or ger-
manium has to be made as pure as pos-
sible with unwanted impurities limited
to one part in a hundred million or even
one part in one billion. The difficulty of
purifying the crystals is one of the big
problems facing manufacturers who make
transistors. Crystals of silicon or ger-
manium in a pure state are good insula-
tors. All the orbits of the atoms are com-
plete and there are no free electrons or
deficiencies of electrons within the struc-
ture of the crystal. However, with the
proper impurities present in the order of
one part in a million, the crystal becomes
a semiconductor. By adding an element
of Group V with a valance of 5 to the
germanium, conducting electrons are do-
nated and an N-type crystal is produced.
The addition of an element of Group III
with a valance of 3 accepts an electron
from the germanium lattice, leaving a
positive charge or "hole" which is free to
move through the lattice, producing a
p-type crystal.
The point-contact translator is either a
P or N-type crystal with a base and two
metallic points for connection. A rectify-
ing junction is formed between a point
and the crystal. The polarity of the junc-
tion depends on the type of semi-con-
ductor used. Fig. No. 1 shows the po-
larity used for each type of semiconduc-
tor. The same physical principles govern

n- and p-type crystals.
both types of transistors. They differ in
the signs of the emitted carrier and of
the bias voltages. The sign of the emitted
carrier for the N-type is positive and for
the P-type it is negative. Positive voltage
applied to the P-type forms the collector
bias while negative voltage is used for
biasing the collector of the N-type. The
emitters are biased with a voltage of op-
posite sign and smaller magnitude than
that used for the collector. Another way
of stating the bias conditions for either
type of transistor is that the collector is
biased in the reverse direction and the
emitter is biased in the forward direction.
The operation of the N-type transistor
may be explained on the basis that the
current which passes through the emitter
consists largely of holes which are attach-
ed to the negatively biased collector.
Point-contact transistors have the property
of passing more current out of the col-
lector than that which enters the emitter.
The emitter current is introduced at a low
impedance and the current from the col-
lector flows into a high impedance load,
resulting in a voltage and a power gain
over the input signal.
The emitter current in the P-type
transmitter consists largely of electrons
which are drawn to the positively biased
collector. The results are the same as in
the N-type transistor. For both types of
point-contact transistors the input and
output voltages for a grounded base con-
nection as shown in Fig. 1 are in phase
and the currents are 180 degrees out of
phase.

Fig. 2. Low frequency equivalent circuit
of a transistor.
Fig. 2 shows the low-frequency equiva-
lent circuit of a transistor in which r0 is
the emitter resistance, r,, the base resis-
tance, and r,. the collector resistance. The
internal generator is rluie which corre-
sponds to eg used in vacuum tube circuit
theory. The current amplification factor
of a transistor is called alpha which is ap-
proximately equal to the ratio of rm to
r„. For point-contact transistors, alpha has
a value between 2 and 3. In terms of the
physical operation of a transistor, a value
alpha greater than one means that for
a given change in emitter current, a larger
change in collector current takes place.
Some typical values of r,., r„, r,., and r,„
for a point-contact transistor are 120 ohms,
75 ohms, 15000 ohms, and 37500 ohms
respectively. The actual values of resis-
tance vary from one transistor to another.
The sizes of these resistances are due to
the way in which the transistor is biased.
Under conditions of forward bias, the
resistance is low and with reversed bias,
the resistance is high. Manufacturers list
the values of the different resistances for
a given bias. These values are used in the
design of transistor circuits. The opera-
tion frequency for a P-type transistor is
limited to about 15 megacycles which is
12
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


off frequency is due to the dispersion in
transit times of emitted carriers which
means that for the P-type, electrons cor-
responding to a particular part of the in-
put signal do not all arrive at the collector
simultaneously. At frequencies where the
difference in transit time amounts to an
appreciable part of the cycle, the electrons
tend to cancel the effects of each other
and the frequency is low because holes
do not move as fast through germanium
as electrons and therefore the transit
time is longer.
Recently a new type of transistor has
been developed which is called the junc-
tion type or n-p-n transistor. The junc-
tion type is a single crystal of germanium
which consists of a thin layer of P-type
between regions of N-type. The thickness
of the P-type layer is of the order of one-
thousandth of an inch. Leads are welded
to the crystal to make the emitter, collec-
tor, and base terminals; the P-type layer
being the base and the regions of N-type,
the emitter and collector. The crystal is
enclosed in a hand plastic head. This re-
sults in a small, rugged unit which is
relatively free of microphonic noise.
All transistors have the bad feature of
being noisy. In the point-contact transis-
tor, the noise figure is of the order of
35 db at 1000 cps. This figure has been
improved to about 10 db in the n-p-n
transistor. Tests on the n-p-n transistor
indicate that the noise figure decreases
with increasing frequency and decreasing
thickness of the P-type layer. The hope
of reducing the noise figure in the future
is not very bright. The thickness of the
P-type layer is already less than one
thousandths of an inch. The cutoff fre-
quency of an n-p-n is about 60 megacycles
without much of a chance of being in-
creased.
Junction type transistors have been built
to have a power dissipation up to 2 watts
as compared with .2 watts for a point-
contact transistor. An n-p-n transistor
with a power dissipation of the order of
50 milliwatts would be about 3/16 of an
inch in diameter. The larger the area, the
more power dissipation possible. In the
future it is believed that transistors will be
built to handle more power. The effi-
ciencies for class-A, class-B and class-C
of pn n-p-n transistor are high. Class-A
efficiencies of 48 or 49 out of a possible
50 percent can be realized because of
nearly ideal static characteristics. This is
something that vacuum tubes do not even
approach. An efficiency of 50 percent
for a class-A means that if the power sup-
plied by the battery to the collector is 4
watts, the power output cannot exceed 2
watts. To realize high efficiency with low
distortion, it is necessary to drive the
emitter from a high impedance source.
The reason for this is that the collector
circuit is very sensitive to changes in
emitter voltage. A small change in emit-
ter voltage will produce enormous changes
in collector voltage if the collector cur-
rent is held constant.
The most remarkable feature of the
n-p-n transistor is its exceedingly small
power consumption. The ordinary re-
ceiving-type vacuum tube requires a mil-
lion or more microwatts to heat the
cathode as compared with .6 microwatts
which has been used to operate an audio
ocillator built with a transistor. For small
signal applications, the power required to
bias the collector into the operating range
is only of the order of 10 to 100 micro-
watts. (One can see the advantage in us-
ing transistors in equipment which em-
ploys thousands of vacuum tubes such as
the high speed digital computer or by com-
panies which operate thousands of ampli-
fiers throughout the country such as the
Bell Telephone Co.) Because of the lower
power dissipation and smaller size of
transistor, units can be made small, and
the problem of removing heat is reduced.
Also the temperature of units using tran-
sistors can be controlled which is im-
portant because transistors are tempera-
ture dependent. The temperature has to
be kept below 80 degrees C in order; to
keep the changes in r0, r,,, and r,, from
affecting the operation of the circuit.
Transitors have a long life expectance
of the order of 70,000 hours. The ordin-
ary vacuum tube is reliable for only 2,000
to 5,000 hours, and special vacuum tubes,
like those used in digital computer are re-
liable for only as high as 10,000 hours.
The initial high cost of transistors at pres-
ent is partly offset by their long life; but
because of their simple construction, it is
believed that the initial cost will come
down in the future.
The n-p-n transistor has the same
equivalent circuit as the point-contact type,
but the range of values for re, rh, r,., and
alpha are different. Some typical values
are: rr = 26 ohms, r,, = 240 ohms, rr —-
13 megohms, and alpha slightly less
than one. Because alpha is less than one,
a gj-eat deal of freedom in circuit design
is made possible. The n-p-n transistor is
unconditionally stable with all termina-
tions where as with the point-contact tran-
sistor, circuits have the tendency to oscil-
late. By connecting the transistor as a
grounded-emitter, grounded-base, or
grounded-collector stage, a variety of in-
put and output impedances is possible.
In the grounded-base stage the input
impedence may be of the order of a hun-
dred ohms and the output impedance of
one or more megohms. The voltage am-
plification may be very large without a
phase reversal, and the current amplifica-
tion is always less than one. The power
gains are of the order of 40 to 50 db for
this type of stage. An interstage step-
down coupling transformer must be used
if these stages are placed in cascade due
to the current amplification being less
than unity. The grounded-base stage is
similar to the grounded-grid stage used in
vacuum tube circuits. Fig. 3 shows a cir-
cuit that can be used as a grounded-base
amplifier.

Fig. 3. Circuit of a grounded-base stage.
The power gains are higher for the
grounded-emitter connection, and it is
more desirable than either of the other
two connections. The input impedance is
of the order of a few hundred ohms, and
the output impedance is of the order of
a few hundred thousand ohms. Voltage
and current amplification are both pro-
duced with a phase reversal. Gains of the
order of 50 db can be obtained when in-
terstage coupling transformers are used,
but they are not necessary. Without"
coupling transformers, the gain is of the
order of 30 db. Fig. 4 shows a circuit for
an amplifier consisting of two grounded-
emitter stages connected in cascade.
A high input impedance and a low out-
put impedance may be obtained by con-
necting a n-p-n transistor as a grounded-
collector stage. The input impedance may
be several megohms, and the output im-
pedence may be of the order of 25 ohms
with the proper load and source impe-
dances. With a high impedance load, the
input impedance is high, and with a mod-
erately low impedance source, the output
impedance is low. The power gain for the
grounded-collector stage is only of the
order of 15 or 20 db. Fig. 5 shows a
grounded-collector amplifier circuit.
A transistor may be used to perform
any of the functions of a vacuum tube

In mathematics and its applications the
representation of functions by infinite
series of trigonometric functions ranks
next in importance to the representation
of functions by series in powers of the
variable. The terms of the trigonometric
series are products of constants by sines
and cosines of multiples of the variable.
These series are called Fourier series.
Quite arbitrarily defined functions can
be represented by their Fourier series at
all points on a prescribed interval; quite
arbitrary periodic functions, functions
whose values repeat themselves periodi-
cally, can be so represented for all values
of the variable. In the latter case the in-
dividual terms are called the harmonics of
the periodic function. The fundamental
and higher harmonics of musical notes are
special examples, in which case the func-
tion may represent the displacements of
points on a vibrating string, wire or col-
umn of air as a function of time.
The harmonic analysis of periodic elec-
trical signals in electrical engineering and
of vibrations in mechanical engineering
are examples of direct practical applica-
tions of Fourier series. The application of
these series in solving boundary value
problems in partial differential equations,
problems that make up a substantial part
of theoretical physics and engineering, is
of primary importance. These series were
introduced originally by d'Alembert Eu-
ler, D. Bernoulli, Lagrange and others in
their attempts to derive formulas for the
displacements of the points of vibrating
strings and in other investigations in the
field of elasticity. During the years of
Fourier's boyhood, about 160 years ago,
those men were engaged in an extended
controversy over the question of whether
such series could represent general func-
tions or only functions of very particular
types.
Fourier developed his famous mathe-
matical theory of the conduction of heat
in the early years of the nineteenth cen-
tury. In solving the boundary value prob-
lems resulting from that theory he was
confronted with the question of represent-
ing arbitrary functions by trigonometric
series. Although his own mathematical
development of the series was no sounder
than the work of some of his predecessors,
BY
R. V. CHURCHILL, Ph.D.
Professor of Mathematics
by making geometrical interpretations of
the integrals involved in the formulas for
the coefficients in the series, and by care-
fully examining the series corresponding
to many special functions, he produced
convincing evidence that such series can
represent quite arbitrary functions. In
his publications on heat conduction and
elasticity he established methods of solv-
ing boundary value problems that are now
fundamental tools of scientists.
It was during the last few years of
Fourier's life that Dirichlet produced the
first sound proof that all functions of a
certain broad class are actually represented
by their Fourier series. Generalizations
and refinements of the theory of these
series and of Fourier's methods of solving
boundary value problems are active fields
in mathematical research at the present
time.
Jean Babtiste Joseph Fourier was born
in Auxerre, about a hundred miles south
of Paris, in the year 1768. This was a
year before the birth of Napoleon Bona-
parte and about twenty years before the
beginning of the French Revolution. His
father was a tailor. At the age of eight
he was left an orphan. He was recom-
mended to a local military college run by
the Benedictines where he received his
early training and studied mathematics on
his own. The beginning of the Revolution
found him serving as professor of mathe-
matics in that college, and establishing
himself as an exceptionally fine teacher.
He also established a reputation as a
mathematician during this period by mak-
ing substantial contributions to the theory
of the distribution of roots of equations.
He was an active proponent of the Revo-
lution and he narrowly escaped imprison-
ment and execution on more than one oc-
casion.
Napoleon created the Ecole Normale in
Paris in 1894 at the end of the Reign of
Terror, as an attempt to restock France
with teachers, and Fourier was given the
chair of mathematics there. He also taught
at the Ecole Polytechnique. Four years
later he accompanied Monge and Napo-
leon on the conquest of Egypt. Monge,
the inventor of descriptive geometry and
one of the most accomplished scientists of
his time, was probably Napoleon's most
constant friend and valuable adviser.
Monge, Fourier and the chemist Berthol-
let were to set up educational institutions
in the conquered territory, where Napo-
leon wished to spread European culture.
But the three scientists served also as ad-
ministrators, historians and general ad-
visors to Napoleon, who even felt them
out on the question of inhabited planets
apparently with an idea of extending his
conquests.
Upon his return in 1801 Fourier was
appointed prefect of a department in
southern France with headquarters at
Grenoble, a position he held until Napo-
leon's escape from Elba in 1915. It was
during this period that Fourier developed
his mathematical theory of heat conduc-
tion, which established his fame and as-
sociated his name with trigonometric
series.
After Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo in
1815 Fourier fared poorly for a time;
but he soon became Secretary of the Acad-
emy of Science and he succeeded Laplace
as President of the Council of the Ecole
Polytechnic in 1827. Some years after his
death in 1830 at the age of 63 most of his
mathematical works were collected and
published in two large volumes. Copies
of these Oeuvres de Fourier and of his
books on conduction of heat and theory
of equations are on the shelves of our
University Library.
An interesting account of Fourier's
scientific and political career is given in
the chapter entitled "Friends of an Em-
peror" in E. T. Bell's book Men of Mathe-
matics. A good account of the historical
development of Fourier series, written by
R. E. Langer, will be found in the 1947
volume of the American Mathematical
Monthly.
Until his later years Fourier retained
his exceptional ability to understand and
assist those who associated with him in
either scientific or political affairs. Con-
sidering the fact that his professional life
was nearly equally divided between politi-
cal and scientific appointments and that
his career was so intimately geared to the
Revolution and to Napoleon, his advance-
ment of the frontiers of mathematical
science was quite remarkable.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


VITAL TO AN ENGINEER?
BY
AL LANG, 52IM
Regardless of what is inferred by the
full page comic strip advertisements tell-
ing the success story of business, Ameri-
can companies are in business to make a
profit on the dollars invested. An engi-
neer is only valuable to a company when
he ran contribute to this end. The engi-
neer works with the physical aspects of a
manufacturing concern; he takes care of
product design, production, inspection,
plant research and development, and
some other things too. What the engineer
works with has no direct meaning to the
management. His activities must be con-
verted into dollars before they can be
judged acceptable or not. This converting
into dollars is not done by the engineer
but rather by the accountant. The ac-
countant is concerned with compiling and
interpreting; the management and the
stockholders, the financial result of opera-
tion.1
The engineer is faced with the problem
of not being able to describe his work to
management in engineering terms but
must translate those terms into dollars
and cents; cost, savings, and profit. To
view this dilemma more closely let us
examine some of the fields of work in
engineering.
The academic idea of a good design
engineer includes the ability to design a
complete machine, to make an improve-
ment on an old machine, or to design only
one part. To achieve success he learns his
fundamentals and relies on a great deal
of experience. A design is not accepted
or rejected by management on its engi-
neering features alone. The total cost is
also an important consideration. Cost of
manufacture, cost of operation, rate of
production, and length of service are the
deciding factors. Thus if a designer is
working for acceptability rather than for
strict engineering proficiency he must rely
on the cost accountant to translate his
ideas in the finished form or alter his
ideas in their embryonic stage by cost
consideration. Rather than designing and
realizing rejection because of uneconomi-
cal operation, the cost conscious designer

knows enough accounting technique to
predict cost before he proceeds with an
idea. Roger Boltz, associate editor of
Machine Design, has several points that
might be kept in mind.
1. Design for maximum simplicity of
functional parts.
2. Design for economical production,
checking limitations of accuracy,
quality, scrap, speed, etc.
3. Select material to suit production
method as well as design require-
ments.
4. Specify the minimum number of
operations.
5. Design for ease of set-up.
6. Do not specify finish or accuracy
greater than the machine available.
Not all engineers are design people.
Some go into research and development.
Ironically enough, those who know the
least about research determine the extent
of this activity. Management usually sets
aside a percentage of net earnings, say
five percent, for a research budget. Even
after this arbitrary selection the research
engineer is not given a free hand. He
must be able to estimate cost of projects,
determine cost sunk into projects and the
value of completed projects. This is not
engineering but cost accounting. The engi-
neer must think for himself regarding
these cost considerations or his advanced
planning will have no meaning. Another
concern of research is cost reduction or
elimination. Before an engineer can elim-
inate a cost he must know where it exists.
Cost centers can be determined by the
accountant but unless the engineer knows
the derivation of these figures they have
no meaning.
Some fast action engineers are going
into production engineering. Here the
newly hired engineer is usually not given
the opportunity of laying out a line or
shop. Rather he must work with existing
equipment. He will not be able to effect
a change unless he can show a saving
through a better product or decreased
cost. Here again he cannot change cost
unless he knows where costs are incurred.
A supervisor may feel that when every-
body is busy he is doing a good job. The
cost accountant can tell better whether the
worker is effective or not. Efficiency is
best checked by the use of standard costs.
Here is how standard costs are used as
a means of managerial control. The ac-
countant and the engineer decide on what
the labor and material should cost in the
manufacture of an item. Predicted over-
head cost is also added. At the end of an
accounting period actual costs incurred
are compared with predicted costs and any
variation is noted. Management, without
ever venturing outside the office, can tell
whether scrap is excessive, whether the
labor force is being utilized, whether the
machines are being utilized properly.
For the areas of concern of an indus-
trial engineer try to separate cost consid-
eration from engineering.
1. Material handling equipment
2. Line production over job shop
3. New job estimates of cost
4. Time study and machine utilization
5. Balance of line and inventories
6. New equipment vs. Down time
The man who feels that the drafting
board is enslavement can always go into
sales engineering. But here, too, he must
justify his price. If a man could sell in a
market where cost seems to be no object,
like selling to the government, he could
rely on pure engineering in his argument.
However, most companies are interested
in profits so the sales engineer must show
where his product will aid in this objec-
tive. Here, as everywhere else, engineering

temperatures maintained the same for the
two types of construction. The lower
curve is for the conventional rotor design,
in which hydrogen gas comes in contact
with only the outer surface of the genera-
tor coils, and shows that further increase
in hydrogen pressure will offer very little
increase of rotor ampere conductors. On
the other hand, the benefit with internal
cooling is tremendously higher. The in-
crease is extremely high for the higher
gas pressures.
These remarks have applied only to
rotor cooling. At present, the develop-
ment of the inner-cooled stator coil has
not been carried to the same stage as for
the rotor, and it therefore may be advis-

—the first for the rotor alone, and the
second for the stator. The curves of Fig-
ure 3 show what can be expected of inter-
nally cooled rotor windings, and both
rotor and stator windings as compared
with conventional designs.
The development of internal cooling
with high-pressure hydrogen gas opens
up a new era in the design and construc-
tion of turbine generators without too
great a departure from present practice
and experience. Two generators with in-
ternally-cooled rotors and rated 175,000
and 200,000 kw are to be completed in
1954, and a 90,000-kw 3600-rpm unit
with both rotor and stator internally cool-
ed is now being designed and is expected
to be available for testing late in 1952.
C-124 Globemaster
Two of the largest industrial organiza-
tions in their field united forces in the in-
terests of national defense to accelerate
production of the giant C-124 Globe-
master II Air Force transport.
This was made public in an announce-
ment by Douglas Aircraft company that
it had signed multi-million dollar con-
tracts with the Plymouth Division of
Chrysler Corporation to assemble the en-
tire tail section and major wing sections
of this large airplane.
Chrysler has assigned the production
to part of the 880,000 square foot addi-
tion being built to its Los Angeles plant.
Sections to be produced by Chrysler are
currently being manufactured at the
Douglas Santa Monica plant for the Long
Beach plant, which is the prime contrac-
tor.
Santa Monica Division will continue
production of the C-124 sub-assemblies
until the Chrysler plant has been tooled
up and producing in sufficient volume to
meet the final assembly schedule at Long
Beach. The change-over is expected to
be completed during January, 1953,
Douglas said.
When assembled, tail sections of the
Globemaster measure more than 30 feet
from top to bottom and 45 feet from top
to tip of the horizontal stabilizers. The
outer wing panels to be produced by
Chrysler are 35 feet long and measure
12 feet 8 inches at the widest point.
Chrysler also will make the center wing
flap assemblies.
The Chrysler sub-contract is one of
several awarded by Douglas during recent
months to broaden the base of military
aircraft production facilities.
Two separate multi-million dollar sub-
contracts have been awarded to Texas
Engineering and Manufacturing Com-
pany, of Dallas, for production of major
sub-assemblies of the A2D Skyshark at-
tack plane for the U. S. Navy. Douglas
also has awarded a $2.5 million contract
to Nevada Air Products company of Reno
to manufacture spare parts and another
contract to Interstate Engineering cor-
poration of El Segundo to manufacture
fuselage sub-assemblies for the AD-4 Sky-
raider attack plane.
Westinghouse Starts Production of
Pylons for Jet Fighters
Production of pylons for use on the F-
84 Thunderjet, made for the U. S. Air
Force by Republic Aviation Corporation,
is now underway at the Westinghouse
Electric Appliance Division plant Mans-
field, Ohio, according to J. H. Ashbaugh,
vice-president.
Contract negotiations were completed
last March and the first pylon sample was
delivered to Republic for inspection and
testing in mid-summer. Quantity produc-
tion of pylons has already begun.
The pylon, a streamlined structure sus-
pended beneath each wing of the Thun-
derjet airplane, is used for carrying a
bomb-shackle fuel tank or armament such
as a selection of bombs, high velocity air-
plane rockets or napalm tanks. Each
pylon is a highly mechanized device in-
16

tems for jettisoning either fuel tanks or
armament and, if needed, the pylon itself.
The pylon fabrication calls for a one-
thirty-second of an inch contour toler-
ance and its closest tolerance is one-
thousandth of an inch; that is, the com-
pleted job must be as close as those fig-
ures to meet the blueprint specifications.
Special gauges are used to check the
accuracy of the workmanship and each
pylon must pass rigid inspection not only
for tolerance but for workmanship as
well.
Titanium for Airplanes
Airplanes now on the drawing boards
will streak through the "air so fast they
must be built of new materials to with-
stand the external and internal heat gen-
crated by high speed.
Titanium has the characteristics requir-
ed to overcome this threatened "heat bar-
rier," O. A. Wheelon, production design
engineer for the Douglas Aircraft com-
pany Santa Monica Division today told
the National Aeronautical Meeting of the
Society of Automotive Engineers at the
Biltmore Hotel.
Wheelon described Douglas research
and development experience with the so-
called "wonder metal" in a paper titled
"Design and Manufacturing Techniques
with Titanium."
Principal value of titanium in aircraft
building, he pointed out, is that it pro-
vides the strength of steel at nearly half
the weight.
Titanium is the fourth most plentiful
structural metal in the earth's crust, ex-
ceeding the quantity of nickel, copper or
lead. But its high cost of $1.25 per ounce
rises from the difficulty in reducing the
natural ores, a difficulty now being over-
come by improvements in metallurgical
techniques.
Wheelon discussed the importance of
"aerodynamic heating" in modern air-
plane design. He said that the heat creat-
ed by friction of the airplane skin with
the air could become critical, especially
when added to the heat of structure ex-
posed to the high temperature of jet and
rocket engines.
Aluminum loses strength as tempera-
tures rise, but is safe for most purposes up
to 300 degrees Fahrenheit. Between 300
and 800 degrees, titanium and its alloys
have considerable strength-weight ad-
vantages over the stainless steels formerly
used in this temperature range.
"We recently found," Wheelon said,
"that a limited application of commer-
daily pure titanium would make possible
a saving of approximately five per cent
of the structural weight of an airplane.
Despite its high cost of $20 a pound,
this use represented the most economical
method of saving this critical weight."
"I believe many fail to appreciate how
much the commercially pure titanium has
to offer in airframe structures. While the
engine builders primarily are interested
in the newer alloys, I do not believe we
have to wait for them ki structures where
gage for gage substitution of stainless
steel is possible."
Because of its high melting point,
Wheelon added, titanium also makes a
suitable fire shield up to 2000 degrees
Fahrenheit.
RCA Tests Compatible Color
Television
Extending field tests of the RCA com-
patible, all-electronic color television sys-
tem, the Radio Corporation of America
began a series of experimental New York-
to-Washington transmissions for viewing
in both color and black-and-white.
These transmissions, which originated
in the National Broadcasting Company
studios in New York and Palisades
Amusement Park, across the Hudson from
Manhattan, had the double aim of test-
ing the compatibility of the RCA color
system with the help of television set
owners in the Washington area and test-
ing the ability of the system to pass with
excellent results over microwave radio
relay and coaxial cable.
Coinciding with the beginning by RCA
of tests for public viewing in New York,
these transmissions continued for ten
days, for observation of the tests in color
by Washington press representatives and
by government officials, including mem-
bers of the Cabinet, of Congress, of the
Federal Communications Commission,
engineers and other interested groups.
RCA invited Washington's 300,000
television set owners to assist in the tests
by reporting how these color broadcasts
appear in black-and-white on receivers in
the different sections of the Nation's
capital. The compatibility feature of the
RCA system means that when a color pic-
ture is transmitted it can be received in
black-and-white without any change what-
ever in present sets.
Viewing these tests in color, Washing-
ton press representatives were assembled
before experimental color television re-
ceivers in the NBC studios at the Trans-
Lux Building. The program came to
them on Channel 4, over the facilities of
station WNBW in the northwest sector
of the Capital, and consisted of scenes
and action selected to provide a wide
range of color and studio techniques.
During this series of tests, there were
three experimental transmissions from
New York daily. The first each day, ex-
cept Saturday and Sunday, went on the air
at 10 o'clock for viewing throughout the
Washington area. Color programs in the
afternoon, for presentation at 2:15 and
4 o'clock, were transmitted to the Trans-
Lux Building by closed circuit, since
authorization for the tests permitted on-
the-air broadcasts only during periods out-
side of regular broadcast hours.
For the viewing of the tests at the
Trans-Lux Building, RCA provided three
experimental-model color television re-
ceivers, featuring the RCA tri-color pic-
ture tube which has eliminated all me-
chanical gadgets and moving parts in
color television reception. Two of the
color television sets are equipped with
16-inch tricolor tubes, and the third has
a 21-inch tri-color tube. Also there, to
test compatibility, were two standard
black-and-white television receivers.
R6D Liftmaster
The Navy is now able to fly high prior-
ity cargo and personnel to any point on
the globe in a pressurized transport at
more than 300 miles per hour..
This improvement in the speed and ef-
ficiency of fleet logistic support became
possible with delivery of the first big,
four-engined Douglas R6D-1 transport to
the Naval Air Station at Moffett Field,
California.
The R6D Liftmaster, military troop
and cargo-carrying version of the DC-6B
luxury airliner, will enter service initially
with Air Transport Squadron Five of the
Fleet Logistic Air Wing, Pacific. Subse-
quent deliveries will be made to Air
Transport Squadron Three, U. S. Navy,
which operates as a component of Contin-
ental Division, Military Air Transport
Service.
Addition of the Liftmasters to the pres-
ent fleet of Douglas R5D transports
strengthens considerably the Navy's air-
lift potential. Because of its higher speed,
greater payload and longer range, each
R6D develops an airlift equivalent to two
R5Ds, the Douglas announcement said.
The new Navy transports are powered
by Pratt &amp; Whitney R2800-CB17 engines
which develop 2500 take-off horsepower
and 1900 maximum continuous power
each. With the high activity Hamilton

Two men were flying East in a passen-
ger plane, making the first air trips of
their lives. The plane touched down at
St. Louis, and a little red truck sped out
to its side, to refuel it. The plane land-
ed again at Cleveland, and again a little
red truck dashed up to it. The third stop
was Albany, and the same thing hap-
pened.
The first of the two men looked at his
watch and turned to his companion.
"This plane," he said, "makes wonder-
ful time."
"Yep," said the other, "and that little
red truck ain't doin' bad either."
A man boarded a pullman and gave the
porter $5 to wake him up when the train
reached Podunk at 4 a.m. "Now, porter,
I'm a very heavy sleeper, so you may have
to drag me out of the berth, put my
clothes on me, and carry me out to the
platform. And no matter how much I
resist, don't pay any attention."
Next morning the man awoke to find
himself in New York. Boiling mad, he
sought out the porter and roundly cussed
him out.
The porter shook his head in admira-
tion. "Boss, you sho' has got a temper,
but it ain't nothin' compared to the
gent'man's that I put off the train this
mornin' at Podunk.
The guest of the house was watching
with amazement the contractor's small boy
who was amusing himself by driving nails
into the furniture. He said to the host:
"Joe, isn't that an expensive hobby your
son has?"
"Oh, it's not so bad," answered the
contractor. "I get the nails wholesale."
Pop: "Well, I received a note from
your teacher today."
Son: "Honest, Pop? Give me a quarter
and I won't breath a word about it."

New Clerk: "What do you do when a
customer forgets his change.
Manager: "You tap on the counter
with a dollar bill."
* * *
Woman on crowded bus: "I wish that
good looking man would give me his
seat."
Five engineers got up.
You ought to laugh at these jokes, your
grandfather did.
A married man returned home one
night at a late hour and, finding difficulty
with his equilibrium, made considerable
noise in the hallway. Suddenly there was
a sound of crashing glass which awakened
his wife.
"John," she called, "what's the mat-
ter?"
From downstairs came a low mumble,
"I'll teach those goldfish to snap at me."
Two stuttering blacksmiths had heated
a piece of iron and one placed it on the
anvil.
"H-h-h-h-h-h-hi-t-t-t it," one of them
said to the other.
"Wh-wh-wh-wh-h-ere?" asked the
other.
"Ah hell, w-w-w-w-e'll have to heat it
again now," replied the other blacksmith.
"Oh, what a strange-looking cow!" ex-
claimed the young model from Chicago
while visiting on the farm. "But why
doesn't she have any horns?'"
"Well, you see," replied the farmer,
"some cows is born without any horns
and never had any, and others shed theirs,
and some we dehorn, and some breeds
ain't supposed to have horns at all.
There's a lot of reasons why some cows
ain't got horns, but the reason why that
cow ain't got horns is because she's a
horse."
* * *
The landlady brought in a plateful of
extremely thin slices of bread. "Did you
cut these, Mrs. Brown?" asked a boarder.
"Yes, I cut them," came the stern reply.
"All right," said the boarder, "I'll
deal."
* * *
"John, dear, I'm to be in amateur the-
atricals. What will people say when I
wear tights."
"They'll probably say I married you for
your money."
* * *
An airman had to parachute to safety
owing to engine trouble. On his way
down through space he met an old lady
floating up.
"Hey!" he shouted. "Have you noticed
a Spitfire going down?"
"No," replied the old lady. "Have you
seen a gas stove going up?"
* * *
They had new neighbors and the
wife was much interested in them. In
a few days she reported:
"They seem a most devoted couple,
John. He kisses her every time he goes
out, and even waves kisses to her from
the sidewalk. Why don't you do that?"
"Why don't I?" replied John. "Good
heavens! I don't even know her yet."

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


A MIGHTY CHALLENGE
It had Bell Telephone engineers scratching
their heads.
A new kind of electron tube was needed for
coast-to-coast SftatUo-&amp;tela^. It had to amplify a wide
band of super-high-frequency signals. It had to relay
them, without distortion, every thirty miles across
the country.
That meant splitting hairs. For the working ele-
ments of the new tube would have to be five times
closer together than in any other tube. And that's
mighty close — 6/10 mil between grid and cathode;
grid wires 1/3 mil thick, and wound a thousand to
an inch.
What's more, the tube had to be designed for
assembly-line production, then installed and main-
tained, and its performance on the job analyzed.

Quantity production of the (416A) tube was a job for
Western Electric, the manufacturing unit of the Bell System.
Work had to be done under microscopes. Western's engineers
designed new equipment, worked out details of assembly,
devised ways to develop skillful workers, simplify operations,
keep assembly areas surgically clean.

The walnut-size midget was developed and the first samples
were made by scientists in the Bell Telephone Laboratories.
It was a joint project, involving electrical, mechanical and
chemical engineers, and skilled ceramic, metallurgical and
other technicians.

Engineers in the operating companies and A. T. &amp; T.'s Long
Lines Department continually study the performance of the
"Mighty Midget" as it plays its part in speeding telephone
calls and television programs across the nation. From their
studies will come more challenging problems for—and more
solutions from —Bell System engineers.

engines give the R6Ds a normal cruising
speed in the neighborhood of 300 miles
per hour.
At a take-off gross weight of 103,000
pounds, the Liftmasters have a fuel ca-
pacity of 5400 gallons and a payload of
26,400 pounds for medium ranges.
The R6D has a wingspan of 117 feet
6 inches and overall height of 28 feet 5
inches, identical to the basic DC-6 trans-
port which has been in global service for
more than four years. The fuselage length
of 105 feet 7 inches is five feet longer
than standard DC-6's but identical to the
DC-6B airliners now entering service.
Principal difference between the pas-
senger and military versions is in the in-
terior cabin arrangement and in the doors.
The Navy transports have a long, unob-
structed cabin of 5000 cubic feet and two
exceptionally large doors suitable for
handling and hauling bulky cargo.
The aft cargo door provides an opening
78 inches high and 124 inches wide and
the forward door an opening 67 inches
high and 94 inches wide. Both doors are
hinged at the top and swing upward by
hydraulic mechanism to be clear of load-
ing equipment.
Interiors have structural provision for
passenger seats or litter and cargo tie-
down rings in a 20-inch grid pattern on
the floor. Crew provisions include stations
for pilot, co-pilot, flight engineer, navi-
gator and radio operator with bunks for
relief crewman.
Like commercial DC-6s, the R6Ds are
equipped with automatically controlled
cabin pressurization and airconditioning
systems for efficient and comfortable high
altitude flight. These improvements are
especially important for air evacuation of
the sick and wounded. Leading edges of
wing and tail surfaces have the same
thermal anti-icing systems as DC-6s in
commercial operation.
The R6D-1 Liftmasters are being pro-
duced in quantity for the Navy by the
Santa Monica Division of Douglas Air-
craft company.
Photography of Radioactive Materials
Deadly radioactive materials, hidden be-
hind a thick concrete wall, can now be
safely studied and photographed under a
microscope by atomic scientists, using a
new instrument jointly announced by
American Optical Company's Instrument
Division, at Buffalo, N. Y.. who built the
IN THE NEWS
(Continued from page 17)
device, and the General Electric Com-
pany.
First of its kind, the instrument is be-
ing installed in the Knolls Atomic Power
Laboratory, operated by General Electric
for the Atomic Energy Commission. Ac-
cording to Dr. Kenneth H. Kingdon, tech-
nical manager of the laboratory's techni-
cal department, the instrument is expected
to make possible investigations that have
never before been accomplished on the
effects of radiation damage to materials.
The instrument is a special microscope
for examining the structure of metals,
combined with camera, periscopes and an
illuminating system, in such an arrange-
ment that light can get in and out through
the thick walls of the test chamber, but
dangerous radiations from the radioac-
tive specimens are completely blocked.
Operated by remote control, the in-
strument permits atomic researchers to
work in complete safety. Some sort of re-
motely controlled "mechanical hands,"
similar to those developed by KAPL engi-
neers and first announced in 1948, could
be used to place the specimens in position,
and to remove them after examination.
Original schematic designs and specifi-
cations for the microscope were developed
by Col. H. H. Zornig, of the KAPL staff.
Scientists and engineers of the American
Optical Co., under the direction of Jo-
seph D. Reardon, put the instrument into
practical form.
Light for illumination of the specimen
comes from an arc lamp outside the thick-
walled test chamber, and goes into the
chamber through a lens system placed in
a tubular hole through the wall. The
light is reflected from the specimen, and
comes out again through another series of
lenses, to form the magnified image.
Both lens systems are offset by means
of mirrors, which change the light path
from horizontal to vertical, and then
back to horizontal again. Radioactive ra-
diations from inside the test cell are not
reflected and cannot get around the offset.
If the tube were straight, however, they
might be able to emerge through the
opening for the lenses.
In using the microscope, which extends
into the test chamber, the specimen is put
into place on the microscope stage. Look-
ing through a single eyepiece, the opera-
tor employs the remote controls to get the
specimen adjusted and properly focused.
Then the visual eyepiece is exchanged for
a photographic one, and the camera is
swung into position to make the photo-
graph.
At the lowest power, the instrument
shows the specimen in its actual size,
without any magnification, whereas 1,000
diameters magnification may be obtained
with the highest power. These different
powers are achieved by the use of several
objective lenses for the microscope, which
are mounted on a revolving turret and
can be swung into place, again by remote
control, as desired. The objectives are so
adjusted that it is not necessary to re-
focus when changing from one -power
to another.
Polarized light, consisting of vibrations
in a single plane, as opposed to ordinary
light in which the vibrations are in many
different directions, is invaluable in the
study of metals, and may also be used.
This is made possible by a light-polariz-
ing slide in the path of light from the
illuminator. By remote control the slide
may be put in or out of position as de-
sired.
Westinghouse Builds Signaling
Searchlights for Minesweepers
"Tailor-made" signaling searchlights
for the U. S. Navy's newest-type mine-
sweepers now are in quantity production
at Westinghouse Electric Corporation's
lighting division in Cleveland.
Burt S. Burke, manager of the division
revealed that 287 of the new type search-
lights are included in the Navy order.
Forty-three of the lights will measure 24
inches in diameter, while 244 will be of
the 12-inch size.'
The searchlights will be used for day-
time signaling between Navy vessels when
radio silence must be maintained. "The
24-inch searchlight uses a carbon-arc light
to produce a beam of over 50 million
candlepower," the Westinghouse execu-
tive pointed out. The 12-inch light uses a
1000 watt incandescent lamp to produce
250 thousand candlepower. Their range
extends up to 5 miles. A Westinghouse-
developed "Venetian-blind" shutter, cap-
able of blinking 3 times a second, pro-
vides the dot-and-dash mechanism.
The searchlights will be among the
most rugged ever built, being capable of
withstanding drops up to 40 feet for the
large size. The blast of 5-inch guns 20
feet away should cause little more than a
flicker in the beam. The 24-inch size will
withstand an impact of a 900 pound

Hottest thing in the skies
Jet AND ROCKET ships top them all for high flying speeds
—and searing engine temperatures!
Zooming through the air at speeds far faster than sound,
their engines generate heat that would soften any ordinary
steel.
Special alloy steels to withstand the terrific heat and
pressure of the jet powered engines are made by adding
such alloying metals as chromium, tungsten and vanadium.
Not onlv in aviation but in almost every field alloy steels
are on the job.
Our automobiles and ships are safer and stronger be-
cause of the alloy steels used in them.The gleaming, stream-
lined trains in which we ride get their combination of
beauty, strength and lightness from steel made tough and
stainless bv the addition of chromium.
Furnishing steel makers with alloys essential to the man-
ufacture of special steels is but one of the important jobs of
the people of Union Carbide. They also provide the giant
carbon and graphite electrodes for the electric arc furnaces
which are used to make many of these fine steels.

New portable radiotelephone, of leu weight but longer range, designed and built by RCA engineers.

-far rieTate-a/onf facfapfione"
You've undoubtedly read how useful
our Armed Forces found their port-
able radiotelephones. Now this indis-
pensable military instrument has be-
come even more efficient.
At the Signal Corps' request, RCA
engineers undertook to streamline the
older, heavier model—which many a
soldier of World War II called "the
backie-breakie." Following principles of
sub-miniaturization—pioneered at RCA
Laboratories—every one of its hundreds
of parts was redesigned. Models were
built, tested, rebuilt, and finally RCA
came up with an instrument weighing
only 29 pounds. Its range is double that
of the World War II model.
Even more important, under present con-
ditions of pressing need, RCA was able to
beat the most optimistic estimate of the time
needed to design such an instrument by
nearly three months. Signal Corps engineers
have called this "A major engineering and
production achievement."

now being employed in the low frequency
range where there are low power dissipa-
tion requirements. Equipment using
transitors has distinct advantages over
those using vacuum tubes. Due to the size
of transistors, chassis and cabinets used
to house units may be made smaller, use
less material, occupy less space, and weigh
less. Also, cooling systems may be smaller
and of simpler constuction. Transistors
don"t have to be replaced as often as
vacuum tubes due to aging; and therefore,
the cost of maintenance is reduced. In
the future, equipment using transistors
should be cheaper to build, cost less to
operate and be dependable for a longer
period of time than similar equipment
employing vacuum tubes. As more is
found out about transistors through fur-
ther tests and development, more infor-
mation is going to be made available; and
transistors are going to be used more and
more.

stage.
One may get the idea that transistors
are going to replace the vacuum tube com-
pletely, but this is not the case. It is true
that in many cases the vacuum tube will
be replaced, but transistors are going to
find new applications and fields of their
own. Manufacturers of vacuum tubes will
have to make better tubes that use less
power and have higher efficiencies in
order to compete with transistors. The
conclusion is that one is going to see an
improvement in vacuum tubes along with
the development of the transistor.

How fo move mountains—non-stop
When it comes to moving mountains—or spreading the
landscape around—you can't beat bulldozers.
You can, however, beat a bulldozer if you put into it
a part that can't stand the gaff.
An example is the generator. Vibration, abrasive dust,
weather, shifting stresses and stray oils or greases are con-
stantly taking their hardest licks at it. It leads a tough life.
That's why American Bosch Corporation, makers of
dust-proof, heavy-duty generators for industrial tractors
and bulldozers, selected Synthane laminated plastics for
the insulation plate shown above.
Synthane is a material for industry. It possesses an
unusual combination of physical, mechanical, chemical
and electrical properties.
Synthane is light, strong, dense, abrasion resistant. It
is easily machined or produced in formed shapes. Dielec-
trically strong, it is a natural for electrical applications.
Synthane is corrosion and fungus resistant, chemically
inert, stable over a considerable temperature range.
If this capsule description of Synthane piques your
imagination, send for the complete Synthane catalog.

Carl C. Monrad
DR. CARL C. MONRAD, '27E,
M.S. '28, PH.D. '30
A new professorship in chemical engi-
neering has been established at Carnegie-
Institute of Technology through a grant
from the Columbia-Southern Chemical
Corporation, a subsidiary of Pittsburgh
Plate Glass Company.
Third to be established this year at
Carnegie by prominent Pittsburgh indus-
tries, the new chair is made possible by a
grant of $15,000 per year. The grant will
support research in chemical engineering
and the salary of the professor.
Holding the new professorship will be
Dr. Carl C. Monrad, professor and head
of the Department of Chemical Engineer-
ing. Dr. Monrad, who joined the Carne-
gie faculty as an associate professor of
chemical engineering in 1937, became a
full professor five years later and was
made head of his department in 1947.
Dr. Monrad graduated from the Uni-
versity of Michigan in 1927 with a bache-
lor of science in chemical engineering,
then won his master's (1928) and his
doctor's (1930) degrees also from Michi-
gan.
From 1930 to 1937, Dr. Monrad was a
research chemical engineer and group
leader for the Standard Oil Company of
Indiana in Whiting, Indiana.
The first Carnegie faculty member to
be called upon in connection with World
War II national defense, he was granted
a leave of absence in 1940-1941 to serve
on the petroleum branch of the National
Defense Advisory Commission.
He was a chemical industry consultant
for the office of Production Management
and the War Production Board during
1941-1942. From 1942 to 1944 he work-
ed on production of synthetic rubber as
chief of the Butadiene and Styrene
Branch, Office of Rubber Director. Dr.
Monrad was a member of a group visiting
Germany in 1945 to investigate synthetic
rubber developments there for the Tech-
nical Industrial Intelligence Committee.
A member of many societies and hon-
oraries, Dr. Monrad has served in a num-
ber of offices of the American Chemical
Society and American Institute of Chemi-
cal Engineers—being installed as 1950-
1951 chairman of the latter group's Pitts-
burgh section. He has written numerous
articles on heat transfer, petroleum re-
fining, distillation and synthetic rubber.
JOHN R. McWILLIAMS. 'I9E
John R. McWilliams resigned as Execu-
tive Vice-President and Director of The
Carter Oil Company, affiliate of Standard
Oil Company (New Jersey) and assumed
the post of Deputy Coordinator of the big
company's worldwide producing activities.
Mr. McWilliams has had broad experi-
ence in producing operations. After brief
service in the armed forces during World

John R. McWilliams
War I, he spent fifteen years in engineer-
ing and conservation work with oil com-
panies and state agencies and joined the
Carter organization in 1934. Two years
later he was elected Vice-President and
Director of the Standard Oil Company
(Louisiana) where for five years he was
in charge of producing operations. He
was made a Director and Manager of Car-
ter's Production Department in 1941,
with headquarters at Tulsa. His election
as Vice-President occurred in 1944, when
he went to Billings, Montana, as mana-
ger of the company expanding operations
in the Northwest Division. After a year's
leave of absence, during which he was
Director of the Production Division of
the Petroleum Administration for War,
he returned to Carter's headquarters at
Tulsa, and subsequently was made Exe-
cutive Vice-President.

of recalcitrant chemicals

Grinnell-Saunders Valves
with CHEMICALLY INERT
KEL-F * DIAPHRAGMS
KEL-F's resistance to chemical action, low cold flow,
wide range of temperature application and exceptional
flex life combine to make it the most important dia-
phragm development in years. KEL-F is chemically
inert to all organic acids and alkalies in all concentra-
tions. It withstands chlorinated aliphatic and aromatic
compounds, concentrated nitric, chromic, hydrofluoric
and sulphuric acids and most solvents which readily
attack rubber and previous synthetic diaphragm
materials.
In accelerated tests, a 2-inch valve with a KEL-F
diaphragm withstood over 80,000 closures, drop tight,
against 80 pounds of air under water with no leakage
and no visible signs of wear.
Grinnell-Saunders Diaphragm Valves with KEL-F
diaphragms are typical of the advanced developments
in piping equipment which, combined with Grinnell's
nation-wide facilities and one hundred years' experi-
ence, make it sound practice to call in Grinnell "when-
ever piping is involved".

Typical performance reports ...
1. Chlorine and HC1 gas with small
amounts of acetic acid and acetyl chlo-
ride at 302° F. for 900 hours. Very
much superior to material it replaced.
2. Mixed aromatic and ketone solvents
at 230° F. and 10 psi for three months.
No sign of deterioration.
3. Chlorinated organic chemical at 158
to 194° F. and 30 to 40 psi for nine
months. No failure, no shutdown, no
replacement.
4. Chromyl chloride at ambient tem-
perature and 15 psi. Diaphragm condi-
tion good at end of thirty days' test.
5. Liquid chloral saturated with HC1
at 158° F. for 408 hours. Well satisfied

plastic. It is produced by the M. W. Kellogg Co.

Bomber "thread a needle" from 45,000 feet

Speeding 45,000 feet above enemy terri-
tory, the B-36 makes a tough target for
anti-aircraft gunners and interceptor
pilots.
Rul — al this altitude accurate bombing
is difficult. Nearly nine miles up, the
slightest pitch, roll or yaw during the
plane's bomb run can cause the bombar-
dier to miss by hundreds of vital vards.
To help solve this critical problem,
Honeywell's Aeronautical Division engi-
neered a special adaptation of the
Honeywell Electronic Autopilot. Coupled
with the bombsight. the Autopilot flies
the plane truer than anv human pilot.
No wonder it's said the R-36 can "thread
a needle" 13.000 feet below!
That's onlv one of manv vital functions
Honeywell controls perform in the all-
important fields of aviation, guided mis-
siles and atomic energy.
Today, fabulous new control devices in
these and other fields are being developed
by (he men in our expandin.; engineering
and research sections. Manv of these
workers are keen-minded voung men only
recently graduated from the universities.
Equipped with the latest scientific
instruments, thev find their work at
Honeywell often calls for fascinating
research in the realm of pure science.
There's real opportunity for engineers
at Honevwell — for this is the age of
AutomaticControl —everywhere you turn.
And Honeywell has been the recognized
leader in controls for more than 60 years!

Work has been proceeding in order to bring to perfection the crudely
conceived idea of a machine that would not only supply inverse reactive power
for use in unilateral phase detractors, but would also be capable of automati-
cally synchronizing cardinal grammeters. Such a machine is a turbo-encabulator.
The original machine had a base plate of prefabulated amulite, sur-
mounted by a malleable logarithmic casing in such a way that the two spurving
bearings were in a direct line with the pentametric fan. The main winding was
of normal lotus-o-delta type placed in the panendermic semi-boloid slots in the
stator, every seventh conductor being connected by a non reversible tremie pipe
to the differential girdelspring on the up end of the grammeters.
Forty one manestically spaced grouting brushes were arranged to feed in
into the rotor slipstream a mixture of high S value phenylhydrobenzamine and
5 percent reminative tetryliodohexamine. Both of these liquids have specific
pericosities given by P = 2.5 CN"■' where N is the diathetical evolute of retro-
grade temperature phase disposition and C is Cholmondeley's annual grillage
coefficient. Initially N was measured with the aid of a metapolar refractive
pilfrometer, but up to the present date nothing has been found to equal the
transcendental hopper dakascope.
Undoubtedly the turbo-encabulator has now reached a very high level of
technical development. It has been successfully used in operating nofer
trunions. In addition whenever a barescent skor motion is required it may be
employed in conjunction with a drawn reciprocating dingle arm to reduce
sinusoidal depleneration.

drawing to represent the lines and consrtuction of ships was
introduced about 1790, and the highly efficient American
clipper ships introduced in the early 1800's were designed
only after Gaspard Monge developed descriptive geometry.
The importance of language in thinking and in com-
municating ideas cannot be overemphasized. The three lan-
guages, English, Mathematics and Drawing, must be mas-
tered by the Engineering student before he can appreciate
or understand the scientific background to his profession
or begin to apply these principles in the practice of Engi-
neering. Four years of English and four years of Mathe-
matics are required for admission to many Engineering col-
leges and desirable in all cases, making it possible for the
student to start Engineering courses earlier and go farther
in the four years of the college program. Similarly early
training and experience in Engineering Drawing as in high
school courses is most desirable. But skill in engineering
drawing can be developed rapidly if one has visual imagina-
tion and it is used more in the practice of Engineering
than in the scientific fields contributing to the engineer's
background. Therefore, the study of engineering drawing
can be postponed until the freshman year at college. The
extensive use of good English, accurate mathematics and
drawing should be required in all engineering courses as a
means of developing the power of the student to think and
to express his ideas efficiently.

PROBLEM — You are designing a machine which
includes a number of electrical accessories any one
of which can be turned on by means of a rotary
switch. For reasons of assembly and wiring this
switch has to be centrally located inside the machine.
Your problem is to provide a means of operating the
switch from a convenient outside point. How would
you do it?
THE SIMPLE ANSWER — Use an S.S.White re-
mote control type flexible shaft to connect the switch
to its control knob. This arrangement gives you com-
plete freedom in placing both the switch and the
control knob anywhere you want them. That's the
way one manufacturer does it in the view below of
part of the equipment with cover removed.

This is just one of hundreds of remote control and power
drive problems to which S.S.White flexible shafts provide
a simple answer. That's why every engineer should be
familiar with these "Metal Muscles"* for mechanical bodies.

tained did not agree with observation, and
thus we were able to state that the inter-
pretation afforded by Newton's laws was
not correct. As the new interpretation,
Einstein postulated his theory of relativ-
ity which, as far as we know, now agrees
with reality.
In the light of this last example, these
three steps might be thought of as a
specific case of the scientific method to be
used to check our interpretations of the
physical world; but it is more than that.
It is the means of discovering properties
of the universe which are not directly ob-
servable by us. We can not obtain by
direct observation the temperature of the
center of the sun, but by applying our
knowledge of chemistry, physics, etc. we
can find what that temperature is by set-
ting up our investigation as a "problem"
in the sense we have been discussing
them.
In the next article we will discuss what
kind of an image of the physical world
is presented to us by the language of
mathematics and its methods.
It is definitely not true that engineers

DIGEST
M.E.'s AT DU PONT [2]
Challenging variety of problems solved
by research and development engineers

As a student of mechanical engineer-
ing, do you look forward to a future
in research, development, plant en-
gineering or production supervision?
In the Digest this month, we'd Kke
to discuss the ample outlet Du Pont
offers your talents in these fields.
Let's talk about research and de-
velopment together because they often
overlap indistinguishably. Both these
fields deal with mechanisms for mak-
ing products. In some cases, original
equipment is designed for a new prod-
uct. In others, machinery used in mak-
ing existing products is improved to
provide better quality at lower cost.
This design and development work
may call for studies of the vibration of

ter), consults with D. B. Berlien, B.S.M.E.,

machine elements, equipment, struc-
tural members and structures. Or there
may be need for application of elec-
tronics, instrumentation, operation of
test equipment and testing of experi-
mental machines. In much of this ac-
tivity there is close cooperation with
other engineers, participation in group
conferences, joint analysis of data,
and issuance of recommendations.
Du Pont research and development
engineers keep informed of develop-
ments through technical, trade and
patent literature, seminars and lec-
tures. Exceptional facilities for these
are provided.
Here are some examples, specific
and general, of the problems that con-
front Du Pont research and develop-
ment engineers:
1. Develop and design high-speed slit-
ting equipment for thin films. In-
volved are unwind and wind-up ten-
sion regulation, alignment of web
travel and cutting-knife selection,
combined in a machine easy to service.
2. Design equipment to operate at
pressures up to 45,000 p.s.i. This is
insurance against the time when proc-
esses may be developed that will op-
erate in this range.
As pressures are increased, design
problems for moderate pressures are
magnified. Typical are stress-fatigue
of metals, design of vessel closures
and line joints, valves and packing for
reciprocating compressors and centrif-
ugal pumps, packing glands for stirred
autoclaves, etc.
3. Design, installation and testing of
large air-conditioning systems neces-
sary in the manufacture of certain
products. In one plant, water is used
at the rate of 50 million gallons daily,
current at 25,000 kw. per hour, and
air at 5.5 million C.F.M.
These three examples, selected from
Albert Rand, B.S.M.E., M.I.T. '50 (right),
and Bane Curl, M.I.T. '51 (summer worker),
develop controls for chemical equipment.

literally hundreds, can only hint at the
breadth and variety of the problems that
are constantly arising.
One of the strongest pieces of evidence
that mechanical engineering is of major
significance in the Du Pont Company is
the existence of the Wilmington Shops.
They represent an investment of over
$3,500,000 and cover an area of 300,000
sq. ft., including a foundry and pattern
shop. They employ over 800 men and
have a potential output in volume of
work in excess of $6,000,000 a year.
The size and diversity of this operation
are justified only because the work of
mechanical engineers is an important
factor in Du Pont operations.
NEXT MONTH—Opportunities in plant en-
gineering and product supervision will be
discussed in the third article in this series,
"M.E.'s at Du Pont." Watch for it!

is not an end in itself but merely a means
to an end.
Aside from the strictly engineering as-
pects of business there are related activi-
ties in which many engineers are finding
themselves engaged. These are supervi-
sion and management. For the figures of
the accounting department to be mean-
ingful, the manager must understand
them. What is net profit, the difference
between amortization and depreciation;
what is the quick rater, a position state-
ment, a debit, a credit, the current rate,
the enterprise earning rate, a burden, in-
direct labor, an asset, and equity? Last
but not least in the field of engineering
concern is corporation structure. How
are bond and stock issues handled? What
is the difference between the two? How
can funds be raised for special expansion
or long term expansion? More than likely
an engineer will also be a stockholder or
investor. Knowing corporation financial
analysis means enlightened investment.
Regardless of an engineering field of
specialization he will not be isolated from
cost considerations. Accounting is the
determination and interpretation of these
costs. To understand this accounting pro-
cedure is to more fully understand your
job as an engineer. I would suggest that
the accounting being taught in the School
of Business Administration be investi-
gated.

Problems in guidance and control, aerodynamics, and structures are solved by the elec-
tronic differential analyzer of the Department of Aeronautical Engineering. Shown above is
a view of the analyzer connected to solve an aerodynamic problem in flow stability. The
electronic differential analyzer is used for both research and instruction in courses, and it has

Soon many thousands of engineering graduates from engi-
neering colleges the country over will be taken into the folds
of industry. Their graduation certifies them to be likely candi-
dates for the engineering profession. Note the use of the word
candiddle and its inferences. These graduates have endured the
many hours spent in gaining a degree of knowledge of the
mathematical and physical sciences and in getting a grasp of
engineering principles; and many of these graduates will argue
that this alone justifies their calling themselves engineers. But
are they able to assume the responsibilities and problems pecu-
liar to the engineering profession? Probably not.
The individual will spend the following few years on a job
training program, and, perhaps, at the termination of this period
he will have acquired sufficient proficiency in some field of
specialization to warrant recognition as a competent practicing
engineer by his immediate associates. Yet, he will not have
demonstrated this facility for handling all the aspects of an
engineering problem—social, economic, and technical—to the
large body of the engineering profession beyond the extent that
recommendations from his foimer employers will allow. In this
position he may not qualify to give his expert opinion on engi-
neering matters in many courts of the land. He may be ex-
cluded from a job that has social implications such as public
service operations. So arises the need of a basis for universsl
recognition of the professional engineer, a recognition based
on legislation.
Since Wyoming initiated a state law providing a legal basis
for engineering registration in 1907, the several states, acting
independently, have enacted engineering registracion laws.
These laws are intended primarily to regulate the practice of
those persons whose activities affect the life, health, rights, and
property of the citizenry. Similar laws help to maintain high
standards of ethical conduct in the major professions responsible
for the public life, health, rights, and property—Law and
Medicine—by excluding incompetents and quacks, thereby pro-
tecting the public against malpractice and its dire possibilities.
Other comparatively minor, but significant, outgrowths of pro-
fessional registration of engineers are the effective and construc-
tive participation in civic problems, equitable compensation
for engineers, and a place in the public consciousness similar to
that held by the other major professions. This legal registration
of the engineering profession is an exercise of the police powers
vested in the state government for protection of health and
public safety.
In recent years there has been a movement among the indi-
vidual state chapters of registered engineers to band together
on a nation-wide scale. This movement is manifest in the
National Society of Professional Engineers. This organization
strives to bring about a uniformity of qualifications as given by
each member state law, to promote relationships between both
technical and professional societies allied with engineering, to
guide educational standards for colleges and industries sup-
porting job training programs, and to advise on all legal mat-
ters as they apply to engineering.
If the profession's desire to maintain high standards is to be
realized, every serious minded engineer should become regis-
tered. By going through the simple and inexpensive process of
registration, the engineer gains two important benefits. First,
he receives authority to practice his profession in the public
service; and second, he receives a professional standing on the
basis of legal requirements.
The first step towards registration is the writing of an exam-
ination to attest to the applicant's basic knowledge of engi-
neering sciences and principles. This test, because of its aca-
demic nature, is best taken just before or shortly after gradua-
tion while the requisite technical subjects are still in mind.
Successful completion of this exam establishes the engineering
graduate as a "registered engineer-in-training." After the engi-
neer-in-training has acquired the experience deemed necessary
under state law, he need only demonstrate through oral and
written tests that he is worthy of the title of a registered pro-
fessional engineer. At this time he is presented with a legal
document so stating his professional status.
Registration will not come to the engineer automatically as
the result of his excellence in the field. He must, of his own
volition, take the necessary steps to that end. For the engineer-
ing graduate this means examination of his state's registration
requirements and according action. Most states, however, pro-
vide for the status of engineer-in-training contingent on the
passage of a theoretical practice examination preferably given
sometime near the end of the senior year in college.
Every senior would do well to get the low-down on profes-
sional registration in his own state, and ACT ACCORDINGLY.
Remember, the best time to begin registration proceedings is
now, SENIORS!

YOUR BEARING NOTEBOOK

How to help a plug
keep plugging
Pulp for paper making is chewed up inside this Jordan
engine by a cone-shaped plug that forces the pulp
against knife edges in the shell. Clearance between
plug and shell must be held extremely close, so the de-
signers mounted the plug shaft on Timken® bearings.
Timken bearings take radial and thrust loads in any
combination, keep shafts in positive alignment. De-
flection and end movement are eliminated.
Mounting plug shaft bearings
The application shown here uses four single-row Timken
tapered roller bearings mounted in pairs for the thrust
and floating ends of the plug shaft. They are mounted
directly on tapered sleeves and adjusted by means of
shims between the cup follower and bearing housing.
The right hand or thrust end bearing assembly carries
the thrust load and is clamped on the shaft by means of
an end cap and cap screws. A nut next to the tapered
sleeve facilitates removal of the bearing assembly.
Both thrust and floating ends are free to move laterally
as the plug and shell are adjusted for clearance. Closures
are of the piston-ring type.

it was set to work more than a generation ago. The universality
of the fields covered must appeal to every thinking person inter-
ested in Michigan and its mission.
Fourteen schools of the University currently are engaged in the
various fields of research and they add up to a total activity al-
most as broad as civilization and learning themselves.
For all America has become conscious of the impact and need of
scientific and aggressive work in nearly all fields of investigation.
Not only for military security, but for the sake of finding the better

DIGEST
M.E.'s AT DU PONT [3]
Plant engineering and production supervision
offer interesting careers for science graduates
In the past two issues of the Digest
you've read of the broad opportuni-
ties that are offered mechanical en-
gineers in research and development
work at Du Pont.
This month let's look at oppor-
tunities for men interested in any
of the branches of plant engineering
—such as maintenance, power, design
and construction—or in production
supervision.
Efficient maintenance is an impor-
tant cost factor in the continuous
processes of a modern chemical in-
dustry. The M.E. is called upon to
diagnose troubles, work out correc-
tive measures, and supervise repairs.
Frequently he increases produc-
tion by developing preventive main-
tenance measures. So vital is this
work that in one division of the Com-
pany, 500 men of all crafts, along
with a routine maintenance group,
spend almost all their time on it.
One example of the problems fac-
ing Du Pont engineers is the main-

bustion of pulverized coal. Blown into furnace
through pipes, it burns at 2500°F.
tenance of pumps made to tolerances
of 0.0001" and operating at pressures
up to 6000 p.s.i.
In power work, also, problems re-
quiring application of mechanical en-
gineering principles arise. For in-
stance, a metal required in one chem-
ical process is melted at 800°F. by
immersion heaters fired by butane,
which is expensive. Conversion to
fuel oil presented the problem of
complete combustion in the immer-
sion chamber. Du Pont M.E.'s re-
designed the heaters so combustion

could be complete and the hot gases
recycled in water to use all the avail-
able heat.
In design and construction of
chemical plants, mechanical engi-
neering again is of major importance
because of the wide variety of plants
built and intricacy of their equip-
ment. Engineers collect basic data,
design and select equipment. They
also supervise many steps of con-
struction until the plant is operating.

F. E. spellman, jr., B.S.M.E., M.M.E., Ohio
State '51, and D. A. Smith, B.S.M.E., Pur-
due '40, discuss a change in feed wheel design
of nylon spinning machine.
Production supervision attracts many
mechanical engineers. Men who have
the ability and interest usually move
into it by one or two routes: they ac-
quire background on all stages of a
plant's operations by helping design
the plant, or by operating on the job.

a methanol valve to minimize production loss.
Sometimes students of mechanical en-
gineering feel that in a chemical com-
pany they will be overshadowed by
chemical personnel. This is not the case
at Du Pont. Here, hundreds of adminis-
trators and supervisors, up to the rank
of vice-president, started as M.E.'s.

The 1951 Student Legislature elections
saw two seniors and a sophomore elevated
to three top posts in Engine School. Since
the offices of senior president, senior sec-
retary, and sophomore president were
open, it was necessary for the engineers to
select men for these posts.
Seizing the top senior spot, Harvey
Neumann was elected president. Harvey,
who hails from Detroit, is an M.E. First
interested in the office by a friend, he de-
cided that, since he has a light schedule,
he wished to spend more of his time in
Engineering activities. His aim as presi-
dent is to attempt to organize his class
into one coordinate group, an unification
that is all too often lacking among engi-
neers.

Harvey Neumann
Harvey, who came to U. of M. from
Denby High in Detroit, is a member of
Triangle fraternity. In Engine School, he-
is a member of the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers and participated in
the 1951 Engineering Open House as
A.S.M.E. representative.
The office of senior secretary fell to
Harry Hillman, an Engineering mathe-
matics major. Harry's home is in Pent-
water, Michigan; but Oak Park High in
Oak Park, Illinois, is his alma mater. Be-
cause of his experience as president of
his freshman class and as present Mem-
ber-at-Large of the Engineering Council,
Harry feels that he is capable of serving
his class in student government. Harry, a

Harry Hillman
Sig Ep, has taken part in many activities
around the University. Besides his fresh-
man class officership and his Engine
Council participation, which includes the
chairmanship of a committee investigat-
ing the possibility of an all-Engineering
convocation; he is a member of Vulcans,
senior Engineering honorary, and of Scab-
bard and Blade, ROTC honorary. Shoot-
ing and flying, in the Rifle and the Soar-
ing Clubs, claim some of Harry's time,
also. At the present time, Harry is a
teaching fellow in the wood technology
department and is doing research work on
protective coating, in conjunction with
Dr. Carrick.
Chosen from among three candidates
for the lone sophomore office open, Chuck

Chuck Clarke
Clarke stepped into the presidency. Chuck,
a student in the E.E. department, was first
interested in the office by his friends,
as was the senior president. He feels that
Engineering students have little interest
in their class as a group, their class offi-
cers, or their Engineering societies. His
aim is to attempt to remedy the situation
by arousing interest among his classmates.
Chuck, who claims Coleman, Michigan, as
his home town, is a member of Phi Kappa
Tau on campus. He is treasurer of Sigma
Theta Epsilon, Methodist service club,
and was secretary of the West Quad
Radio Club for a year.
As a member organization of the Engi-
neering Council, may the Technic wel-

"...provide for the common defense,
promote the general welfare..."
KJlh helps in the practical realization of
these words from our nation's Constitution.
America's machine power, once again strain-
ing to meet both civilian and military
demand, depends on the skill of trained
technical men to avoid costly shutdowns, to
keep continuously on the job.
Throughout the history of machines, cor-
rosion has been one of their deadliest ene-
mies. Standard Oil has always endeavored
to improve its industrial oils, to make them
not just better lubricants but more effective
rust inhibitors as well.
Our industrial oils contain newly devel-
oped additives that prevent much of the
trouble caused by corrosion in bearings and
moving parts. These oils have the ability to
form protective surfaces on areas subject to
corrosive forces. They cut down lost time
that robs machinery of its ability to produce.
Yes, there's more to "oil" than just oil.
Standard Oil research, which looks to
America's engineering colleges for new
blood, is constantly facing and solving prob-
lems so as to increase efficiency and pack
more hours and days into each year of
machine operation—at a time when even
minutes count.

Dwight F. Benton, '23E
Following his graduation from the Uni-
versity, Dwight F. Benton went to Whit-
ing, Indiana, to the newly-established
sales engineering school of the Standard
Oil Company (Indiana). Thus he began
a 28-year long career in the petroleum in-
dustry. Last month he was elected by
the board of directors as Vice-President
in charge of sales, Standard's top sales
post. Born in 1899 in Washburn, Wis-
consin, he helped to work his way through
the University by operating a taxi com-
pany during the academic year and sell-
ing automobiles during summer vaca-
tions. Following graduation from Michi-
gan and then from Standard's first sales
engineering school at its Whiting refinery,
he became a salesman at Duluth, Minne-
sota, in 1924. Five years later he was
transferred to the Midwest Refining Com-
pany, where he served as a sales promo-
ter at Denver. In 1931 he was advanced
to assistant manager for Standard at Den-
ver, where he became manager in 1934.
Four years later he became manager of the
Rocky Mountain sales division, and in
1946 he was promoted to assistant gen-
eral manager of the Rocky Mountain di-
vision, with headquarters at Denver. Later
that year he became assistant general
manager of the lubricating and sales tech-
nical service departments in Standard's
general office at Chicago and in 1947 was
advanced to general manager of those
departments. A year later he took over
the responsibilities of President of Root
Petroleum Company of Shreveport, Louis-
iana, and in 1949, when Pan American
Petroleum Corporation of New Orleans,
a Standard subsidiary, and Root, a Pan
American subsidiary, merged to form
Pan-Am Southern Corporation, he was
advanced to general manager of sales of
Standard Oil Company (Indiana) and
also became a director of Standard. He
is a member of the Chicago Association
of Commerce, the Westmorland Country
Club, and two committees of the Ameri-
can Petroleum Institute. He lives in
Skokie, a suburb of Chicago.
Dr. Frank H. Spedding, "25, M.S. "26
Dr. Frank H. Spedding, director of the
Institute for Atomic Research at Iowa
State College and one of the nation's fore-
most nuclear chemists, has been awarded
the 1952 William H. Nichols Medal of

Dr. F. H. Spedding
the American Chemical Society's New
York Section, it is announced by Profes-
sor Hans T. Clarke of the Columbia Uni-
versity College of Physicians and Sur-
geons, chairman of the jury of award.
Dr. Spedding was cited for his "out-
standing contributions in the constitution,
properties and chemistry of the rare earth
and actinide elements." Studies of the
rare earth series of elements, which had
been known for many years, proved high-
ly valuable in predicting the properties of
plutonium and the other new trans-
uranium elements which are regarded as
members of a comparable group—the acti-
nide series.
The Nichols Medal, which is among
the highest honors in American chemistry,
will be presented to Dr. Spedding on
March 14 at a dinner in the Hotel Statler,
New York.
The 1952 Medalist is noted for his
wartime role in the atomic energy de-
velopment, which helped make Ames,
Iowa, an important center of nuclear re-
search. Dr. Spedding's connection with
the bomb project began in 1942 in Chi-
cago, where he organized the chemistry
division for the plutonium project and
headed all chemistry work in 1942-43.
When it was decided to set up an addi-
tional research program at Iowa State Col-
lege, Dr. Spedding divided his time be-
tween Chicago and Ames
Dr. Spedding has served on advisory
committees for declassification of atomic
energy information and for control of
atomic energy. He was an official ob-
server at the Bikini Atomic bomb tests in
1946.
In 1948, Dr. Spedding was named the
first winner of the Iowa Medal, presented
annually by the Iowa Section of the
American Chemical Society to an Iowa
chemist or chemical engineer for meri-
torious achievements in either fundamen-
tal or applied chemistry.
Dr. Spedding received the Bachelor of
Science and Master of Science degrees
from the University of Michigan in 1925
and 1926, respectively, and the Doctor of
Philosophy degree from the University of
California in 1929. He has also received
honorary degrees from Drake University
and the University of Michigan. During
1934-1935, he held a Guggenheim pro-
fessorship in England, Germany, and Rus-
sia. He was George Fisher Baker Profes-
sor at Cornell University from 1935 until
he joined the faculty of Iowa State Col-
lege in 1937. He is now head of the de-
partment of physical chemistry there.

Working within measurements of
millionths of an inch is, today, a com-
mon practice. This precision mass pro-
duction in micro-inches is possible only
because of "Jo-blocks." With their
development, accuracy in terms of pre-
cision measurement acquired a new
true meaning. These famous gauges are
made with such dimensional accuracy
that even the small amount of heat gen-
erated in handling may cause them to
expand and become inaccurate. As the
photo shows, the surfaces and tolerances
of these blocks are so finite and smooth
that they adhere firmly to each other.
Did you ever consider bow such dimensional
accuracy and finish are achieved?
You have but to look to abrasives for
your answer. Grinding wheels, coated
papers and lapping compounds (all
products by carborundum) play their
part in the production of "Jo-blocks."
The development and application of
such abrasive products is a natural for
carborundum which alone makes all
abrasives to supply the proper ones for
all industrial requirements of grinding,
sanding and finishing. This assures abra-
sive users an impartial recommendation
of the right abrasive in every case. It is
a good reason why industrial users look
to carborundum for the best answer
to their abrasive problems.
While the carborundum brand enjoys
leading recognition in the field of abra-
sives, other products by carborundum
are no less important industrially.
Among these are super refractories,
widely used in both high and low tem-
perature applications, ceramic heating
elements and resistors, and deoxidizers.

In a world that is becoming more and
more mechanized, experts have been
watching with concern the world's dwind-
ling petroleum resources. One of the
prime points of contention between na-
tions today is the possession of oil fields
and refineries. Oil and gasoline are vital
to almost every nation on the face of the
globe.
Estimates of the potentiality of the
known and as yet undiscovered petroleum
reserves of the earth indicate that they
will not always be adequate to meet the
demand for fuel. With continuing petro-
leum production thus uncertain, other
sources of oil and gasoline must be-
sought. Two possible sources are being
investigated. These are oil shale and
coal. The petroleum fields and oil shale
beds are estimated to be capable of yield-
ing only a small percent of the possible
petroleum yield of our vast coal reserves.
It is clear then, why, since 1913, the
theory of coal to oil conversion has come
into the international spotlight. Actually,
two theories have been expounded, the
Fischer-Tropsch Theory of Gas-synthesis
and the Bergius-Farben Theory of Hydro-
genation.


"Here, in the distillation area, oil prod

paste preparation units in left background."
In the United States, the Bureau of
Mines Demonstration Plant at Louisiana,
Missouri, is foremost in conducting re-
search on both of these theories. Cen-
trally situated with respect to the nation's
major coal fields, the demonstration plant
is located in a wartime synthetic am-
monia plant which has ideal facilities for
synthetic fuels production. Much of the
equipment in the plant was brought over
from Germany at the close of World War
II, as German technology in this field
was far more advanced than our own. In
addition to the equipment itself, place-
ment diagrams and German technicians
were brought to this country.
Chemically, coal contains less than half
as much hydrogen as does crude petro-
leum. Thus, to convert coal to oil and
gasoline, extra hydrogen must be com-
bined with the existing hydrogen and the
carbon in coal. The theory of gas-synthesis
is that water gas (CH2 -f- H2) may be
converted by hydrocarbon synthesis to
petroleum products. The actual gas-syn-
thesis process involves pulverizing and

World's Largest Jet Plant
Jet engines for Navy and Air Force
fighter planes are coming off the final
assembly line at the Westinghouse turbo-
jet plant at Kansas City, Mo., only hours
apart. The 85-acre plant, whose main
production aisles are almost a quarter of
mile long, is the largest and most complete
jet engine production facility in the
world.

Primarily a production facility for the
Westinghouse Aviation Gas Turbine Di-
vision at South Philadelphia, Pa., the
Kansas City works, Manager S. S. Stine
pointed out, is "one of the most com-
pletely integrated engine production
plants in the world."
Westinghouse jets are built almost en-
tirely of stainless steel, aluminum, and
magnesium, in order to produce the com-
binations of strength, heat-resistance, and
light weight so vital to high-performance
aircraft engines.
A tour of the processing, fabricating,
machining, assembly, and testing opera-
tions, Mr. Stine said, reveals that the
building of jet engines "involves just
about all the metal-working skills that our
mass-production economy has devised."
Most material enters the plant, he said,
in the form of stainless steel sheets; and
stainless steel, aluminum, and magnesium
castings and forgings. The plant also has
extensive casting and forging facilities
of its own.
Mr. Stine pointed out, however, that
production of Westinghouse jets is ac-
complished "with the aid of a very wide-
spread group of subcontractors," operat-
ing plants representing a great many dif-
ferent skills. These subcontractors also
range "from industrial giants to virtually
'one-man shops." Because the mass pro-
duction of jet engines is so new, many of
these subcontractors must be specially
schooled in the production methods used
and in ways to handle the new and exact-
ing materials, Mr. Stine said.
Engineering, development, design func-
tions, and prototype production for the
Westinghouse Aviation Gas Turbine Di-
vision are performed at division headquar-
ters at the South Philadelphia works. The
Kansas City plant concentrates on the
quantity production of service-proved en-
gine types, Mr. Stine explained.
A battery of huge concrete test cells
provides the facilities for block-testing
each engine as it comes off the assembly
line, and to test it again after its "green
run" tear-down and inspection.
Production in the huge plant is organ-
ized on the flow system, with raw ma-
terials entering by truck or freight car
(the plant's roofed railroad siding ac-
commodates 20 loaded freight cars at a
time) at one end, and flowing out the
other as completed engines, ready either
for immediate installation in fighting
planes or for shipment and storage as
"spares" at forward military areas or
aboard carriers of the fleet.
Multiple-processing lines—for shear-
ing, bending, stamping, welding, mach-
ining, fitting, and sub-assembling—flank
the quarter-mile-long row of production
offices, tool cribs, and tool- and pattern-
makers' shops down the center of the
main manufacturing center. A complete
forge shop for the fashioning of com-
pressor blades, and mass production facili-
ties for the "lost wax" precision casting
of turbine blades, feed their output to the
final assembly section.
Test cells help assure the service re-
liability of Westinghouse turbojets. Built
to accommodate future engines of almost
any foreseeable size, each cell is controlled
from a completely instrumented room. To
simplify handling, the engines are tested
in their final-assembly dollies. Each engine
comes into the test cell twice—once for
its "green" run after first assembly, and
again for a final check following a com-
plete tear-down, inspection, and re-as-
sembly. The engine draws air into the cell
from an open shaft through the grille at
the top front of the picture and exhausts
it back outdoors through the duct shown
at the rear of the engine. Here a tech-
nician checks final connections to ready an
engine for its green run. The bell-shaped
duct at the front of the engine measures
and funnels air to the compressor inlet
while the engine is in the cell.

Devise Step Wedge for
Electron Microscopy
A new device which simplifies study of
photographic emulsions used in electron
microscopes was revealed by an Eastman
Kodak Company scientist at a meeting of
the Electron Microscope Society of Amer-
ica in Philadelphia.
The tiny object, called a "microscopic
step wedge," is used in measuring sensi-
tivity of the special photographic emul-
sions used in the microscope.
The wedge compares electron exposures
in somewhat the same manner as a pro-
jection print scale helps select correct ex-
posures in ordinary photographic enlarg-
ing. The microscopic wedge is composed
of overlapping layers, or "steps," of very
thin metal which have been coated in a
high vacuum chamber.
G.E. Trains Non-Engineers for Sales
Faced with a shortage of engineers, the

commercial vice president and general
manager of the division, the program will
prepare liberal arts or business administra-
tion college graduates for a career in sales
of electrical apparatus products. Mr.
O'Brien said that graduates of the new
program will complement the apparatus
sales force presently staffed with engi-
neers.
The program consists of a nine-week
intensified course in basic electricity, a 12-
month assignment on the company's Test
Course, and two years of specialized sales
training. Called "Industrial Sales Train-
ing," the new program closely follows the
training given to engineers in the sales
field, with the exception of the intensive
course in basic electricity.
Trainees under the program attend
classes eight hours a day for nine weeks
during which they study magnetism, in-
struments, D.C. motors and generators,
transformers, alternators, induction mo-
tors and A.C. controls. Laboratory work
complements the classroom study.
Upon completion of this schooling,
the trainees enter the company's Test
Course for several three-month assign-
ments, during which they run tests on
various apparatus products of the com-
pany. Following this, they receive special-
ized sales training in one of the com-
pany's product or industrial sales organi-
zations, and then go to General Electric
apparatus sales offices throughout the
country.
RCA Color Tube Research
Disclosing the vast scope of its research
and engineering in developing electronic
picture tubes for color television, the
Radio Corporation of America announced
that it has built at least five types of tri-
color tubes, each one capable of operation
on all known television systems, including
the RCA compatible all-electronic system,
as well as the field sequential method and
standard black-and-white.
The announcement coincided with pub-
lication of eleven technical papers by
RCA scientists and engineers, making
public their work on various aspects of
color television tube design.
The five types of color television tubes
illustrate basic designs covering a wide
range of principles, according to Dr.
E. W. Engstrom, Vice President in charge
of RCA Laboratories Division. He said
that RCA research scientists have studied
and investigated many ideas and concepts
of color picture tubes.
Dr. Engstrom pointed out that the five

"RCA scientists examine tri-color television tubes."
prototypes of tubes developed by RCA
include those employing viewing screens
formed of color phosphors arranged in
patterns of dots, lines and checkerboard.
Although the dot structure has been
adopted for the tri-color tube now used
experimentally in the RCA compatible
color television system, other designs, he
said, can incorporate any one of the sev-
eral screen textures or a variation of them,
without affecting the system.
The scope of the effort involved in the
development of the tri-color tubes is in-
dicated by the fact that several hundred
people, recruited from many different
Divisions of the Corporation, were in-
volved in the project.
Engineering details for the tri-color
tube RCA is using in current field tests
were turned over to the television indus-
try in July, 1951, together with actual
working models.
The tri-color tube now in pilot-plant
production at the RCA tube plant in Lan-
caster, Pa., is described in detail in an
article by H. B. Law, of the Research
Center. This is a three-gun tube for
either simultaneous presentation of the
three primary colors—green, red and
blue—as in the RCA system, or sequential
presentation of the same colors.
This tube comprises a glass plate and a
metal shadow mask. On the plate are
600,000 small, closely-spaced phosphor
dots, each .014 inch in diameter, arranged
in triangular groups. Each group con-
sists of three dots which glow in the
three primary colors—red, green, blue—

when hit by the scanning electron beam.
Behind the phosphor dot plate is the
shadow mask. This is a thin metal sheet
perforated with 200,000 tiny holes, and
acts as a mask so that each electron beam
as it scans can "see" only one dot of each
color group. In the neck of the picture
tube are three electron guns. These gen-
erate the beams of electrons which "paint"
the color pictures on the phosphor plate.
The other four tri-color picture tubes
described in the papers are basically simi-
lar in that the color is created by the ac-
tion of electron beams on color phosphors.
The eleven papers, which are expected
to become of major importance as a basis
for future developments in color tele-
vision, are being reprinted as a separate
section of the Fall issue of RCA Review,
technical publication of RCA Labora-
tories.

TO THE PHYSICAL WORLD
PART II
In the first of these articles we dis-
cussed the language of mathematics and
generalized on the mathematical solution
to problems in the physical world. It was
pointed out that the solution to a problem
went through three stages:
1) The translation of the physical sit-
uation into proper mathematical
language.
2) The analysis and synthesis of this
translation by specially developed
logical methods.
3) The reinterpretation of the results
of (2) back into the physical
world.
The problem we wish to consider now
is one which might naturally be brought
up in connection with step 1. Is there
more than one translation of a physical
situation? And what do we mean by
"proper" mathematical language? In a
sense these questions are the same, for
as we shall see the proper mathematical
language is intimately connected with the
way in which we translate the situation.
Therefore, let us deal now with the pos-
sibility of varieties of translations and
treat the matter of language as it arises.
Much of the work done in mathematics
in the past 50 years has been in trying to
axiomaticize the various branches of
mathematics; that is, trying to set up for
each branch a system of axioms which
permit all subsequent knowledge to be
proved as theorems on the basis of these
axioms, just as Euclid set up in his system
for his geometry 2200 years ago.
However, more recent investigators
BY
Gerald Losey
discovered that there was nothing
sacred about the axioms in any particu-
lar consistent system composed of inde-
pendent axioms.* Any axiom in such a
system may be replaced by its denial
and the resulting system will be
just as consistent and just as independent
as the original. This is precisely what
Lobachevski (1793-1856), Bolyai (1802-
1860), and Riemann (1826-1866) did in
the case of Euclidean geometry. They
took Euclid's fifth postulate (axiom):
"Through a point not on a fixed line only
one parallel can be drawn to the line,"
and they contradicted it. Lobachevski and
Bolyai said that there exist two parallels
through a point to a line. Riemann stated
that no parallel to a given line exists. The
geometries based on these changes in the
parallel postulate are known as non-Eucli-
dean geometry and are now generally ac-
cepted as being valid and useful.
Thus, in the same way, for any axio-
matic system we set up, whether for a
geometry, an algebra, or an abstract theory
of elasticity, we can always give alternate
sets of axioms by the denial of an axiom,
or axioms in the original system.
This brings us face to face with the
problem of alternate translations. For if
we are presented with two equally con-
sistent and independent axiom systems,
how arc we to choose into which system
we are to interpret our physical situation.
* An axiom system is consistant if no two
of the theorems of the system contradict each
other. The axioms of a system are independent
if no axiom of the system can be proved as a
theorem on the basis of the other axioms.
For example, should we translate a geom-
etrical problem into Euclidean geometry
or into Riemannian non-Euclidean
geometry? In the first case we might in-
terpret some quantities as parallel lines;
however, in the latter parallelism does not
exist and has no meaning. And here we
meet our other problem, the matter of the
"proper" language. We now see that this
depends upon the system; in the Euclidean
system "parallel" is the proper term to be
applied in some entities; however, in the
Riemannian system we must describe the
character of these same entities by a dif-
ferent term which is proper in its own
system.
But we still have the unsolved problem
of deciding, in cases where we have al-
ternate systems, which system will give us
the "right" interpretation of the physical
situation. We may immediately rule out
all of the systems which lead to results
which are in direct contradition to observ-
able phenomena. But there still exists the
possibility that we may have two, or three,
as in the case of the Euclidean and non-
Euclidean geometries, or more systems of
axioms which satisfy a certain physical
situation and none of which we are able
as yet to prove true or false by observing
contradictions between the theorems of
the system and the actual physical world.
We are here at an impasse which can
only be conquered by time and physical
research. Until the time when we know
enough about the universe around us, we
must accept all the alternate possibilities
and use as our basis of translation the
system which is best suited to our purpose.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


BY
Jesse Ormondroyd, Professor of Engineering Mechanics
Since the Greeks made science into a
profession, there have been thousands of
great scientists. Their recorded thoughts
have had enormous influence on the lives
we lead. Though the names of only a few
of these men are familiar even to educated
people, one man whose name and works
are almost universally known is Sir Isaac
Newton (1642-1727). Much of modern
engineering is based on his laws.
Newton was a quiet, retiring man who
had the great fortune to live in a time
of great intellectual and political excite-
ment. About one hundred years before
Newton was born Copernicus had started
the modern outlook in science by publish-
ing "The Revolutions of the Heavenly
Bodies." In that hundred years, Kepler,
Galileo, Bacon, Descartes, Huygens, and
many others of lesser fame had lived.
Newton gained his great name by tying
together and completing the scientific
work of these men. He created a great
synthesis of the physical knowledge of
his time just as Aristotle had synthesized
Greek science in the fourth century before
Christ, and as Einstein synthesized nine-
teenth-century physics in our own day.
Newton was not an orignator. He was a
finisher. His work digested, enlarged and,
in a sense, completed the work of all his
predecessors.
The first fifty years of Newton's life
were lived in the most turbulent period of
English history that occurred between
1066 and 1914. In a quiet way Newton
took part in that political turbulence,
much to his social and economic benefit.
Newton's fame rests on his accom-
plishments in physics and mathematics.
But he was interested in other subjects.
He was a lifelong student of chemistry,
being interested in that very ancient and
very modern subject, the transmutations
of elements. In this he was nearer to the
alchemist than to his modern successor,
the atomic physicist. Like all intellectuals
of his time he was deeply interested in
religion and theology. Corrolary to this
were his prolonged studies in ancient his-
tory. Finally he was a politician in a mod-
est way and a financial wizard in a big
way. Before outlining the work in physics
and mathematics which made him famous
it will be well to give an outline of his
life.
Newton was born in Woolsthorpe,
Lincolnshire, England on Christmas day
in 1642. Galileo was only recently dead
in the same year. In that same year King
Charles the First of England was be-
ginning to have trouble with Parliament.
The youthful years of Newton were lived
in the midst of violent scenes. When he
was seven years old the English com-
mitted the unprecedented act of chopping
off King Charles' head. Cromwell, that
earliest of modern dictators, ruled England
for ten years. Charles the Second came to
the throne in 1659 when Newton was
seventeen years old. In those seventeen
years the farm on which Newton was
born must have been raided by wandering
troops many times. But during this time
Newton managed to get a good educa-
tion in local private schools. This indi-
cates that he came from a more than
respectable family, since most boys of his
time grew up without benefit of any
schooling at all. In 1661 Newton entered
Cambridge University. As a student New-
ton earned part of his expenses by being a
subsizar—a student assistant to his tutor.
His work as a student was so good that he
got a scholarship in his senior year. He-
was graduated by Cambridge in 1665.
Actually, Newton only spent three and
one half years studying between matricu-
lation and graduation. In this three years,
under Isaac Barrow, one of England's
great mathematicians, he studied mathe-
matics and physics—rather a strange
course of study in a university dominated
by theological interests. We have no rec-
ords of Newton's ability or standing as a
student but we do know that his course of
study was very effective in arousing the
dominant interests of his life.
In 1665 and 1666 all England was de-
vastated by the plague and Newton re-
tired to his farm to avoid contagion. In
these two years of retirement, around the
age of 24, Newton started all the scien-
tific work which later made him famous.
In these years he started and nearly finish-
ed his work in algebra, series and calcu-
lus. In these years he saw the famous
apple fall and found the more famous law
of gravitation. And in these years he
bought his first prism to study the "cele-
brated phenomenon of colours," as he
phrased it.
Newton returned to Cambridge as a
graduate student and in 1667 was made a
Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. As
a Fellow he got his living quarters free, a
weekly allowance for food and drinks
and a yearly allowance for clothing. To
retain the Fellowship he had to remain
unmarried. Newton never married and,
in fact, kept his fellowship until 1701—
a period of thirty-four years. Newton re-
ceived his degree of master of arts in
1668. In 1669—at the age of 27—New-
ton was made second Lucasian Professor
of Mathematics in Trinity College. Isaac
Barrow, his teacher and predecessor in this
chair, retired to devote himself to the
more important study of theology. As
professor of mathematics he received a
salary of one hundred pounds per annum
It has been estimated that Newton's total
income from his estate, his fellowship and
his professorship ran around 250 pounds
per annum. Considering the value of
money in 1670 this was equivalent to an
income of about $10,000 per year in
1951 values—as near as such equivalence
is possible.
A consideration of Newton's profes-
sional duties makes a modern professor
drool with envy. He could lecture on any
subject in the field of mathematics and
natural philosophy (physics) that he
chose. He gave these lectures once a week
in the fall term only. When he did lec-
ture, the lecture was only thirty minutes
long. He also was to hold himself open
for two conferences a week with any stu-
dent who wished to consult him. These
duties, light as they seem, were even less
onerous in practice. Most of the time no
students came to his lectures and there is
no record of any student in the college
ever consulting him on anything. Perhaps
time has obliterated all traces of his ac-
tual contact with students. It must be re-
membered that the educational practice at
Cambridge then was quite different from
that practice in modern American colleges
and universities. Students were not re-
quired to attend any lectures—they only
studied, sought advice from tutors and
proved their competence in examinations
at the end of the entire career in the col-
lege. If the modern American student
contemplates this state of affairs with envy

Here is a "proof" that any number is
greater than itself.
Suppose x and y to be positive and sup-
pose
x &gt; y
We can multiply both sides by y, pre-
serving the inequality sign, obtaining
xy &gt;y2
Subtracting x2 from both sides we have
xy — x2 &gt; y2 — x-
and factoring
x(y - x) &gt; (y - x) (y + x)
Since y — x is not zero, we may divide
both sides by this quantity to obtain
x &gt; y + x
Hence x is not only greater than itself,
it is greater than any number. That
doesn't sound right. Guess we made a
mistake somewhere.
Here is an interesting argument which
was sent to us some time ago. It is not
reasonable to suppose that the better of
two clocks is the one which tells the cor-
rect time most often? Then suppose we
were offered a choice of two clocks, one
of which loses a minute a day while the
other does not run at all. If we are to
use as our criterion of choice the keeping
of correct time most often, then we are
forced to choose the clock which does not
run at all. For the clock which loses a
minute a day, once properly set, must
lose twelve hours or seven hundred and
twenty minutes before it again tells the
correct time. Since it loses only one min-
ute a day, this will take seven hundred
and twenty days or, in other words, this
clock will tell the correct time about every
two years. On the other hand the clock
that does not run at all will tell correct
time twice a day!
Here is something that became a mat-
ter of discussion between some embryo
engineers a short while back. Consider a
plank resting on a couple of rollers as
shown in the figure.


push the plank forward, taking care that
it does not slip on the rollers, so that the
rollers make just one revolution. How far
forward will we have pushed the plank?
Take your time; the answer is not one
foot.
We have received some interesting let-
ters in connection with some division
problems which were proposed in the past
months. We have another problem of the
same type but before we present it we will
work out another problem to illustrate the
principles used in solving these types of
problems.
Suppose we are given
54
CE
BE
HEP
HI
EP
EP
Now the cylindrical rollers each have a
circumference of one foot. Suppose we
where each different letter stands for a
different number and we are asked to de-
termine what number each letter replaces.
In this particular problem there are
several starting points. Suppose we con-
sider, to begin with, the fact that
E- I = E
as is evidenced in the first subtraction per-
formed. This tells us that
1 = 0
But if I = O, then C times E is a product
involving a five and so either C or E is
five. Let us suppose that E is the five.
But we see that E times E does not result
in a number ending in five (twenty-five)
but instead ends in P. This is contradic-
tory and so C and not E is five.
The fact that five times E results in a
number ending in zero requires E to be
either two, four, six, or eight. Further-
more we note that E times E results in a
number ending in P and so if E is two
or eight, P is four; if E is four, P is six.
(We can eliminate the case where E is six
since then P is six and E and P must be
different.)
Let us suppose E is four and hence P is
six. Therefore we have
B4
H46
HO
46
46
Now looking at the last multiplication
we see that we can find no integral B such
that 4 X B4 = 46
Hence the combination of E and P we
chose is incorrect.
We can by similar procedure eliminate
the case where E is eight and P is four.
Thus we find by process of elimination,
that E is equal to two and P is equal to
four. Thus
52
B2
H24
HO

and so we see that B must be one and H
must be six.

mind try this one for size:

This is an engine-starting method test-
ed successfully in Korea for emergency
use at advance bases where external power
units are unavailable and the plane's own
battery system is inoperative. The North
American fighters are powered by General
Electric J-47 turbojet engines, identical to
those which were started in Korea by uti-
lizing the exhaust blast from a plane
ahead, to provide the necessary engine
starting rotation. Even under normal con-
ditions, jet aircraft usually rely upon field
power units for starting, rather than their
own electrical systems, because of the large
amount of power required.
In "artificial respiration," the air inlet
of the turbojet to be started must be
aligned directly, and at some distance, be-
hind the "starter" plane, according to
T. J. Mclntyre, G-E service engineer in
Korea, who reported the novel starting
method for emergency use.
Electric Eye Controls High Temperatures
A machine which "sees" heat is help-
ing produce electronic tubes for vital de-
fense uses in the General Electric Com-
pany's Industrial and Transmitting Tube
plant at Schenectady, N. Y.
The device, a G-E electric eye unit, is
IN THE NEWS

trained on small graphite crucibles used
for fusing together small tube parts.
When a crucible is heated to a tempera-
ture of 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit, fusing
the parts together, its color changes from
a cherry red to a glowing white, too in-
tense to be safely observed by the human
eye.
The electric eye, however, will detect
minute changes in color and intensity at
high temperatures. As the crucible's color
reaches a glowing white, the electric eye
sends an electrical impulse to a relay
which instantly cuts down the heat of the
crucible by shutting off the current flow-
ing through it.
The fused parts form the starting me-
chanism in ignition tubes used in air-
craft welding units and in the produc-
tion of aluminum and magnesium from
crude ores.
Tube engineers explained that other
methods proposed to keep the crucible
temperatures from rising past the desired
fusing point were either less convenient,
or less accurate.
The electric eye unit can be used to
control temperatures ranging upward
from 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, with only
a 15 degree leeway in accuracy by ad-
justing it to register graduations in color
from a dull red through the "hot color"
spectrum to the brightest white.
Carbide "Welding" Rods
The possibility of being able to 'coat'
metal parts with a relatively thin "skin"
of ultra-hard, wear resisting, tungsten
carbide has been forecast.
Carboloy Department of General Elec-
tric Company announced that it has com-
pleted basic laboratory development on a
'weldable' tungsten carbide. It can be
flowed onto metal surfaces, using con-
ventional shielded arc welding equipment,
available today in most of the larger and
even many smaller metal working plants.
It is made in experimental production
at present in conventional welding rod
form and sizes ranging from 1/16" to
1/4" diameter.
When flowed on to a metallic surface
such as steel or iron, it fuses and blends
with the base metal and results in a sur-
face coating containing approximately
70% of wear-resisting tungsten carbide.
Wear tests conducted so far indicate
that such a surface has a wear-resisting
ability of approximately 80% that of 'un-
diluted' tungsten carbide—and about 15
to 20 times that of the best chilled cast
irons of 43 to 67 Rockwell.
The process of skin coating (1/16" to
1/4" thick skin) appears to be most
suitable where it is desired to wear-proof
parts for which the use of solid carbide
sections is inconvenient.
Radiation Lampshade
Although it resembles an ordinary
lampshade, this one has been developed
with the aid of General Electric engineers
for the grim task of determining the po-
sition of an atomic bomb blast.

"Radiation Lampshade."
A number of these would be mounted
out-of-doors around a possible target
area. In the event of an A-bomb blast,
heat radiation would scorch the paint on
the inside of the lampshade. Brass rod,
shown in center, would block radiation,
however, and cause a shadow or image
of itself on scorched region.
By means of numbered and lettered
grid lines, the shadow would automati-
cally plot information, from which could
be computed quickly the height of the
blast and "ground zero," the point di-
rectly beneath the blast.
Power Generator for New Atomic

specially designed to power the two bil-
lion electron-volt Cosmotron has success-
fully passed its first tests at the Brook-
haven National Laboratory, Upton, N.Y.
This was disclosed with the announce-

magnet—key component of the accelera-
tor—has been tested at its full power of
40,000 kilowatts. Other elements are
now being added and the complete ma-
chine should be ready for trial runs early
next year.
Called the "Cosmotron" because it will
give atomic particles energies equal to
some cosmic rays, the giant machine is
designed to accelerate protons to energies
exceeding two billion electron-volts, five
times greater than those provided by the
largest existing cyclotron.
C. S. Hague, Westinghouse engineer,
said the electrical equipment will feed
power to the ring-shaped iron magnet,
which measures 65 feet in diameter and
which contains an acceleration chamber
for the protons.
"The energy is supplied by a large mo-
tor-generator set, equipped with a 45-
ton flywheel, that delivers alternating cur-
rent to a battery of 24 ignitron rectifiers,"
Mr. Hague explained. "These rectifiers
convert the alternating current into 40,000
kw direct-current pulses. Twelve pulses
per minute are sent into the Cosmotron
magnet to guide the sub-atomic particles
around the acceleration chamber."
Better Metals Needed To Increase
Turbine Efficiency
The gas turbine, most modern power
plant for aircraft, locomotives, and other
machinery, could be made nearly one-third
more powerful with the same fuel con-
sumption by relatively small improve-
ments in certain metals, says Dr. C. G.
Suits, vice president of the General Elec-
tric Company and director of research.
Dr. Suits cites this as an example of in-
centive to metallurgical research and says
that a major portion of the G. E. Research
Laboratory's activities is devoted to such
research.
Present gas turbines operate at a tur-
bine bucket temperature of 1500 degrees
Fahrenheit. When this temperature can be
increased a mere 100 degrees (by de-
veloping metals able to withstand such
increase in temperature), turbine effi-
ciency will increase 15 per cent, and more
important, the net power output will in-
crease 30 per cent.
Inaudible Sound Cleans Shavers

being used for what is believed to be the

tric Company's General Engineering Lab-
oratory, Schenectady, N. Y., directs
sound waves through a cleaning solvent to
remove oil, grease, lapping compound
and metal particles from tiny openings
and corners of electric shaver heads.
Officials of Schick Incorporated, manu-
facturers of electric shavers here, report
that the new machine does a more thor-
ough cleaning than any method yet de-
vised. Action of the sound waves is said
to increase greatly the effects of the
cleaning solvent, resulting in greater pene-
tration into corners and crevices where
cleaning solvent alone would be ineffec-
tive.
Brooklyn Bridge Renovated to
Serve Today's Traffic
The old joke about buying the Brook-
lyn bridge is due for a revival. The 68-
year-old structure will be a better bargain
come spring, when it will have been
renovated to meet today's traffic needs.
Exacting construction work has been
necessary since the new part of the struc-
ture had to match the 19th century archi-
tecture of the rest of the bridge, says En-
gineering News-Record, McGraw-Hill
publication.
The Roeblings' 68-year old East River
bridge formerly carried two street car and
two elevated tracks and about 3,000 ve-
hicles a day. But the subway has replaced
the L, buses have replaced trolleys, and
motor traffic of all kinds has increased.
Objectives of the reconstruction was
to provide two three-lane roadways, which
would carry nothing but vehicles—6,000
a day. To do this an existing interme-
diate stiffening truss had to be eliminated.
The cheapest method would have been to
put in a completely new, deep outer truss,
fabricated of rolled sections.
But New York's Fine Arts Commis-
sion, which passes on modifications of the
city's historic landmarks, said such a
change would be inconsistent with the
bridge's architecture and destroy its 19th
century charm.
So it has been necessary to revive the
truss by using the same structural ele-
ments originally used: small latticed and
boxed members for compression and eye-
bars for tension.
Work began in 1950 and the south
roadway is now complete. All six lanes
will be usable by spring.
R-F Induction Heating Hardens
Shuttle Tips
Radio-frequency induction heating is
hardening several million textile shuttle
tips per year at the Charles A. Richard-
son Company, West Mansfield, Mass. It's
doing a better job than the old oil-fired
furnaces—increasing production and de-
creasing rejects, floor space required,
smoke and fumes.
With r-f heating, it is possible to "selec-
tive"-harden the shuttle tips—24 different
sizes of them—at production rates of up
to 3000 per hour. Selective hardening,
by means of exact and automaric process
control, produces a high degree of hard-
ness at the point where maximum wear
occurs, and relative softness for toughness
at the points of maximum stress.

Perhaps you've noticed that lamp bases, tradi-
tionally made of brass, now are being made of
aluminum. There's a story behind this change and
it tells a lot about the kind of jobs going on at
Alcoa.
It started several years ago when engineers of
two leading lamp manufacturers agreed with our
suggestion that bases of aluminum would cost less.
"But will they be as good . . . will we have to
revise our methods?" they asked.
The potential savings, a few mills per lamp times
the 830 million sold each year, made finding the
answers worth-while. Together we started two
long-range research projects. One, to test aluminum
alloys in the weather, fumes and years of standing
idle that lamps must endure. The other, to find the
alloy that would take five progressive draws, then
thread rolling and finally, the high temperature of
the red-hot glass that is poured in the base.
adds up to Millions
We tested samples, changed alloys, varied
tempers, rolled different thicknesses. Lamp manu-
facturers tried each, until one met all requirements.
Our development men worked long hours to get
the right solder and flux to join the side wire to the
base. Adapted them to the high-speed, lamp-
making machines.
All this time, the manufacturers had aluminum
bases installed in seacoast and industrial atmos-
pheres. Our laboratories ran other tests on lit and
unlit lamps under corrosive conditions. After VA
years the reports came in: Aluminum bases
measured up in every respect: conductivity, cor-
rosion resistance, ease of installation and removal.
This is typical of the research and development
jobs now underway at Alcoa. And others are wait-
ing for the men with the skill and imagination to
tackle them. Aluminum Company of America,

designed for exceptional talents only—to
mass education it might be fatal.
Newton chose optics for his first series
of lectures. Newton was a masterful ex-
perimentalist and a good mechanic. He
designed and made all of his own ex-
perimental apparatus. During the 1670's
Newton published his first papers—all in
the field of optics—and these papers made
him famous in scientific circles. The
papers were all published in the trans-
actions of the Royal Society in London
and he was elected a Fellow in that So-
ciety in 1672. Newton very seldom visited
London in these years since the journey
from Cambridge to London could only
be done on foot or by horseback over bad
roads infested with highway men. It is on
record that he did spend some time in
London in 1675—at which time he at-
tended his first meeting of the Royal So-
ciety.
Around 1680 a great discussion arose
among the members of the Royal Society
concerning the "law of nature" which
would "explain" the motions of the bodies
in the solar system. The inverse square
law of attraction had already been guess-
ed by many people and Kepler's famous
three laws of planetary motion had been
known for three generations. The ques-
tion was whether the suspected general
law could be connected with Kepler's ob-
servational findings. Hooke, Wren, and
Halley busied themselves with the prob-
lem for many weary months without com-
ing to any useful conclusions. They didn't
know the general laws of motion nor
were any of them good enough mathe-
maticians to solve this problem. But at
this very time Newton was lecturing on
the general laws of motion at Cambridge.
In fact, he had already formulated the
three laws that every school boy today
tries to remember. And, although he had
never published any of his mathematical
discoveries, he was known to be the best
mathematician in England. So Halley
finally suggested that they ask Newton
about this problem. When Halley visited
Cambridge and put the question to New-
ton, he was amazed to find that Newton
had already worked out most of the an-
swers. After much persuasion, Newton
finally wrote out the answers in what is
perhaps the most famous single work of
science ever written, The Principles of
Natural Philosophy—known universally
from its Latin title, as the "Principia."
SIR ISAAC NEWTON
(Continued from page 11)
This was published in 1687 by the Royal
Society. The language used in this book
was Latin. With the publication of this
book modern science was finally com-
pletely launched on its triumphant career
of observation, experiment, hypothesis
and mathematical calculation.
Meanwhile, England's King James II
was again having trouble with his people
and his Parliament. The bone of conten-
tion was religion this time. Cambridge
and Newton were in the middle of this
fight. Newton was elected to Parliament
as a Whig (modern rough equivalent,
Democrat) )for a term in 1688 and 1689.
During this time James II fled from his
throne and England, and the official re-
ligion of England was nailed down tight-
ly as Protestant by this third revolution
in thirty years. In reaction to this violent
event the Tories (modern rough equiva-
lent, Republicans) came back into power
and Newton's Parliamentary career was
over. Newton's part in this revolution
was not on the floor of Parliament, but
behind the scenes. In fact, tradition states
that Newton's only utterance in the House
of Commons was to ask an attendant to
close a window. But in 1696 the Whigs,
and Newton's political friends, came back
into power and the new prime minister,
an old pupil of Newton's at Cambridge,
secured for Newton the job of Warden of
the Mint. Newton's professorship at Cam-
bridge after almost 30 years of tenure
came to an abrupt ending and Newton
finished the rest of his life in London.
In 1699 Newton was made Master of
the Mint with an increase of about two
thousand pounds per annum. In modern
terms roughly $50,000 per year—and no
income tax. The currency of England was
in a terrible state after nearly fifty years
of political turmoil and Newton, as War-
den and Master of the Mint, was the chief
technical expert in the process of straight-
ening out the financial affairs of England.
Chit of this reform the Bank of England
was founded and England's currency be-
came as firm as the Rock of Gibraltar for
the next 230 years.
In 1703 Newton, laden heavily with
scientific and political honors, was made
President of the Royal Society—a post he
held for 24 years until his death. In 1704
all his optical experiments were sum-
marized and published in English. As an
appendix to this book his mathematical
work, completed almost 40 years before,
was published for the first time. In 1705
Queen Anne knighted Newton in cere-
monies carried out in Trinity College in
Cambridge. The Knighthood was in
recognition of his scientific and political
successes. Newton lived 22 more years,
dying at the ripe old age of 85 in 1727.
Newton's Scientific Work
Newton never published anything con-
cerning his lifelong experiments in al-
chemy for the simple reason that he never
got any results worth publishing. In
chemistry he was on the wrong track. His
learned works in theology and ancient
history are buried in their Latin original
where only experts on Newton can read
them. For Newton's reputation this is
very fortunate since what he wrote on
these subjects now appears as foolishness
to us. His abiding fame rests on his
work in mathematics, optics and me-
chanics. In these fields what Newton did
has now become the foundation of every
modern student's course in mathematics
and physics.
Mathematics
Newton's work in this field lay in the
theory of convergent infinite series, in the
foundation of calculus, and in the theory
of limits. Newton's interest in these sub-
jects stemmed completely from the desire
to find the lengths of curves, the area un-
der curves, and the volumes of solids. He
invented the famous Binomial Theorem,
fr**r- i'+ir

3.1 a
and showed that this expansion held for
positive and negative integer or fractional
values of a and b, for positive and nega-
tive integer values of n and for positive
and negative fractional values of n.
When n is a positive integer, the series
contains only a finite number of terms—
n 4- 1 terms, to be exact. For fractional
and negative values of n the series be-
comes an infinite converging series.
Newton gave the graphical definition
of the tangent (differential) of a curve
as the limit of a secant and the graphical
definition of the integral as an area under
a curve. He called his differentials
"fluxions" and his integrals "fluents" and
invented the symbols still used in mod-

two types of converters. One consists of a
non-volatile coolant oil circulated through
a bed of catalyst granules. The second
consists of a powdered catalyst suspended
in a coolant oil. The liquid product is
then purified to obtain crude oil. This
crude oil is refined by fractional distilla-
tion to produce usable oil and gasoline,
plus other petroleum components; i.e.,
waxes, tars, and propane.
The Bergius-Farben Theory of
Hydrogenation is that coal may be liqui-
fied by combination with hydrogen to
form petroleum. The preliminary treat-
ment of the coal for hydrogenation in-
cludes pulverizing and drying, a.c in the
gasification process. The coal powder is
mixed with approximately an equal
amount of heavy oil with a small amount
of a catalyst—iron, cobalt, or nickel com-
pounds—added. The coal-oil paste is pre-
heated to a fluid state and passed into the
liquid-phase converters. These converters
are huge steel cylinders enclosed on three
sides by reinforced concrete, as shown

Bureau of Mine! Pholo
"This large reinforced concrete structure is partitioned into stalls to enclose
on three sides the high-pressure and -temperature vessels in which coal is
converted to oil."
from both sides in the first two pictures.
In these converters, hydrogen is reacted
with the fluid coal-oil mixture to form oil
and gasoline. The temperature in these
converters is maintained at nine hundred
degrees Fahrenheit; the pressure, at

"Motor and turbine-driven hydrogen recycle compressors,
pressure valves and piping."
Bureau of Mines Pholo
Note the high-
10,300 pounds per square inch. After a
period of one hour in the converter,
ninety-five percent of the coal is converted
to gaseous and liquid products. The heavy
oil, light oil, and gases are separated; and
the heavy oil is returned to be remixed
with the coal in the paste preparation.
The lighter products are preheated with
hydrogen, under 10,300 pounds per
square inch pressure, to vapor. This vapor
is, in turn, passed over a tray of catalyst
suspended in the vapor-phase converter.
After several repetitions of this last proc-
ess, the charge is almost completely con-
verted to gasoline, which is then refined
by fractional distillation. The gasoline
may be used as thus obtained (after a
soda wash to remove traces of organic
acids) in motors of low compression
ratio. For motors of high compression ra-
tios, however, it must be treated to raise
the octane; i.e., with tetraethyl lead.
The rank and type of coal determine, to
a great extent, the yield percentage of de-
sirable products. The reactivity of coals to
hydrogenation is, roughly, inversely pro-
portional to their carbon content. By ex-
perimentation, the best coals for hydro-
genation have been found to contain 80-
86% carbon. In addition to desirable
yields, the yield of undesirable organic

For engineers
who like
challenging work
Meeting this country's civilian and military
production'needs is providing an endless vari-
ety of problems to challenge the best of engi-
neering brains.
Here at Western Electric, as in all big manu-
facturing concerns, the job calls for the pooling
of special skills by mechanical, electrical, indus-
trial, chemical, metallurgical and other engi-
neers—to come up with the right answers.
The primary job at Western Electric—the
manufacturing unit of the Bell System—is to
make the thousands of kinds of telephone equip-
ment needed to keep this country's telephone
service going and growing. Many of these prod-
ucts are so tiny or so unbelievably complex—
calling for such precision—that you'd think
they could be made only by skilled technicians
working under closely controlled laboratory con-
ditions. Yet Western Electric engineers devise
machines and techniques which enable workers,
after a short training period, to turn these
things out under factory conditions. There's a
real kick in doing work like that!
And, because of the specialized experience
gained in our regular telephone job, Western
Electric is also working on many important
communications and electronic equipment proj-
ects for the Armed Forces. Such things as radar
fire control systems for the Navy's biggest guns
and for anti-aircraft guns—radar bombing sys-
tems for America's largest planes—multi-chan-
nel radio sets for all types of military aircraft—
electronic marvels to launch, guide, and explode
the latest guided missiles—provide opportuni-
ties galore for creative production planning.
Both of Western Electric's jobs—telephone
and military—are vital to this country's present
and future strength. Both are filled with chal-
lenges for the best engineers of today and
tomorrow.

magnification
of what
abrasive
material?

The answer "Fused Aluminum Oxide"
gives you a passing mark. But, it's not
just ordinary fused alumina. It's Norton
32 ALUNDUM* abrasive in a single
crystal, containing more than 99% pure
fused alumina — hailed as the "greatest
abrasive contribution to increased grind-
ing production in more than 40 years."
How It's Made
When bauxite is submitted to an ex-
tremely high temperature in an electric
furnace by an ingenious Norton Process,
grains of 32 ALUNDUM abrasive form
in a fluid matrix where each grain grows
into a single, complete crystal — strong
in shape and with many sharp points on
all sides. The matrix not only contrib-
utes to 32 ALUNDUM abrasive's
unique crystalline structure but also
absorbs impurities from the melt. This
accounts for the better than 99% purity.
The matrix is then dissolved away by
a complicated chemical process and the
released grains are washed and screened
to size. No crushing is necessary.
Amazingly Versatile!
The extra sharpness and crystalline
form of Norton 32 ALUNDUM abra-
sive enables it to grind cast iron, alu-
minum, bronze, brass, soft steel, high-
speed steel and cast alloy tool materials.
Its versatility is further borne out by a
typical report. In one prominent plant,
Norton 32 ALUNDUM wheels, replac-
ing other wheels, accounted for over-all
time savings, floor to floor, of: surface
grinding — 26.3%; internal grinding —

13.1%; tool grinding — 13.2%; cylin-
drical grinding — 25%.
Worth Remembering
This example of "making better prod-
ucts to make other products better"
promises an interesting future to young
engineers who want to contribute to new
developments. Norton Research is well
worth investigating.

Cast Iron Pipe... has
STAMINA!
Trekking long distances in the
frozen North, on a trapline or behind
a dogsled, demands stamina!
And, just as surely, pipe must have
stamina to serve for a century or
more as cast iron water and
gas mains are doing in more than
30 cities in the United States and Canada.
In the generations since these gallant
old mains were installed, horse-drawn
vehicles have given way to
multi-ton trucks and buses.
Under the streets crowded utility services
have been constructed. Yet cast iron pipe has
withstood the resultant traffic-shock and
beam-stresses because of its shock-strength,
beam-strength and crushing-strength.
No pipe, deficient in any of these
strength-factors of long life,
should ever be laid in
paved streets of cities,
towns and villages.

Germans — including thousands who
slipped through the Iron Curtain to
see Western progress at work.
Behind this is another story: How RCA
engineers and technicians broke all rec-
ords in setting up these Berlin facilities.
The project called for a TV station and
studio, a lofty batwing antenna, and the
installation of 110 television receivers at
strategic points. Such a program would
normally take several months to com-
plete. It was installed and put to work
by RCA in a record-breaking 85 hours!
Programs witnessed by Berliners included
live talent shows, sports events, news com-
mentaries, and dramatizations of the Mar-
shall Plan. Observers pronounced reception
fully up to American standards — another im-

Dragonfly eye for a war plane-
blown of optical glass
At any naturalist can tell you, the dragon-
fly has one of the best eyes there is for seeing.
His eye is a button, set well out from his
head. It lets the dragonfly see in all directions
without craning his neck.
Now war-plane pilots aloft have just such
a convenient eye to see with—the glass bub-
ble shown above. Set in the skin of a plane—
and fitted with an optical system—it gives a
clear, horizon-sweeping view.
This new kind of eye for war planes marks
the first lime in the history of glass-making
that perfect optical glass has been mass-pro-
duced by blowing. And because the blowing
is so accurate, the bubble needs a minimum
of grinding and polishing to meet exact opti-
cal specifications.
Before such a bubble could be blown,
Coming had first to develop ways of forming
optical glass shapes directly from the molten
glass. This was accomplished during World
War II, when Corning devised a method of
manufacturing lens blanks of perfect optical
glass by machinery.
Today, shaping optical glass by blowing
greatly extends the usefulness of optical glass
for industry as well as the Armed forces.
Making optical glass more useful is just
one way that Corning, in a full century of
glass-making, has helped glass become one
of today's most versatile engineering materi-
als. Corning has developed more than 50,000
formulas for making glass, and they arc be-
ing added lo, day by day.
Throughout industry. Corning means re-
search in glass—research that is constantly
turning up new ways to make glass do count-
less jobs better than they've ever been done
before.
So after you're out of college and are
planning new products or improved
processes, it will pay you to call on Corning
before you reach the blueprint stage Coming

residues must be calculated. Coal from
the beds in the western United States have
been found to be good in both respects—
high petroleum yield and low organic
residue.
The petrographic analysis of the coal
indicates the probable petroleum yield.
The constituents considered here are those
formed by different types of organic mat-
ter. The main constituents are: (1) an-
thraxylon, (2) translucent attritus, (3)
opaque attritus, and (4) fusian. Anthra-
xylon and translucent attritus, the most
easily hydrogenated, are composed of
trees and plant roots partly preserved in
the peat stage. Opaque attritus and
fusian, virtually inert to hydrogenation,
are composed of fine debris—spores, pol-
len, algae, and other organic material—
formed in a peat bog. It is upon the pre-
diction made by the petrographic analysis
that the yield expectations are based.
The nature of the catalyst employed in
the hydrogenation process is another vital
factor in the final petroleum yield. The
most widely used are compounds of iron,
cobalt, nickel, molybdenum, tungsten, or
tin. The compounds are of three types—
halogens, sulfides, and uncombined and
finely divided metals themselves.
Considering the upward trend in the
use of petroleum and petroleum prod-
ucts, production of synthetic fuels is be-
coming increasingly important. The
Demonstration plant at Louisiana is only
a beginning. From this, government re-
search will start processing plants on an
industrial scale that will provide the
United States and the world with vital
petroleum for many years to come.

Skyraider Bomber
A new model of the Navy carrier-
based Skyraider series, the Douglas
AD-5, embodying revolutionary advances
in design techniques, has been revealed
by the Navy Department's Bureau of
Aeronautics.
The first "multiplex" airplane ever to
be built, the AD-5 Skyraider was designed
by Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc., for easy
conversion aboard Navy carriers into
more than a dozen combat types.
This "12-in-l" utility is accomplished
through packaged conversion kits sup-
plied as equipment with each airplane.
Basic structure of each airplane is a uni-
versal "chassis" designed for quick and
easy interchangeability.
The Douglas-developed attack bomber
can be swiftly transformed into a passen-
ger transport, or by conversion kit be-
comes an aerial ambulance with litters.
For emergency evacuation or combat as-
sault, it can carry troops and equipment.
Despite the bomber's multiplex adapt-
ability, there is no compromise to its effec-

tiveness as a hard-hitting attack craft offi-
cials stated.
The AD-5 is capable of chameleon-like
transitions into day and night attack types
or anti-submarine hunter-killer combina-
tions.
It may be converted into an airborne
early warning or radar counter-measures
plane, a tow target or photographic plane;
a passenger transport, ambulance, or
troop-carrying evacuation plane—and into
other special purpose types.
Earlier models in the famed Skyraider
line—AD-1, -2, -3, -4 required actual
structural changes to multiply their usages
(-Q, -N, -W, -S versions.) The new
AD-5 can be switched from one model to
another in simple "erector set" fashion.
A unified cockpit in the new model per-
mits direct communication between crew
members and complete interchangeability
of stations. Free access to installations is
provided so adjustments may be made
during flight.
Basically, the Skyraider is a single-
place attack type with a single Wright R-
3350 26W engine driving a \iy2 ft.
General Motors Aero Products steel pro-
pellor.
In Korea the Skyraider bomber struck
on July 3, 1950 from the carrier Valley
Forge, in support of U. N. land actions.
It has been attacking almost daily since
that time with as much as 8,000 pounds
of bombs, rockets and torpedoes per
plane.
"The new convertible AD-5 opens an
entirely new field of usefulness for car-
rier based aircraft," Navy officials stated.
It assures ready availability of the kind
of airplane needed in the changing re-
quirements of war."
"'Single chassis' standardization as
practiced in automotive manufacture can
now be accomplished with the AD-5,"
Douglas spokesmen said. "This will mean
extra attack airplanes for the defense
dollar."
Model AD-4 Skyraiders are being de-
livered to the Fleet from Douglas' El
Segundo, Calif. Division factory until
AD-5's can be placed into line produc-
tion.

the integral of z. Two of the examples
in his original text will sound familiar to
all engineering students:
"Let the quantity x flow (vary) uni-
formly, and let it be proposed to find the
fluxion (differential) of x"." In this
problem he used the analytical equivalent
of his graphical definitions and his Bi-
nomial Theorem. "When x by flowing

matics have used it—all higher powers

zero and the ratio ° S * t; ^x1'"' in

Newton's first example of how this

ing the area under an arc of a circle. His
example ends in this way (in modern

Most of our modern calculus symbolism
such as dy/dx, d'-y/dyC-Jy dx, etc., came
from Leibniz, the rival claimant to the
honor of having invented the calculus.
Today we give both men the credit for
having done the job independently. The
invention was "in the air" in the seven-

teenth century. Someone would have
done it even if Newton and Leibniz had
never existed.
Optics
It was known before Newton's work
that light rays were bent when passing
from one translucent medium to another.
Reading glasses were already in long use
and the refracting telescope was almost a
hundred years old in 1670. The rainbow
of colors produced by passing sunlight
through a prism of glass of triangular
cross section was also well known. In
fact, Newton bought his first prism at a
county fair where it was offered for sale
as a toy. Newton, early in his optical ex-
periments, tried to grind and figure an
objective lens for a refracting telescope.
He noticed rings of colors in the focal
plane of his telescope—the phenomenon
now known as chromatic aberration. This
led to quantitative experiments with the
prism and rays of sunlight. In this ex-
periment Newton noticed that a ray of
sunlight of circular cross-section gave an
elongated image cf all colors from red to
violet. His great discovery was that while-
light from the sun was composed of a
combination of different rays of different
colors, each ray of distinct color having
different refracting angles in the glass of
the prism. This meant that in an ordinary
refracting lens the rays of different colors
had different focal lengths—and no clear
and distinct image could be obtained in a
single fdcal length. This next led New-
ton to invent the reflecting telescope—in
which the light is collected and focused by
reflection from a parabolic mirror in
which light rays of all colors are reflected
in the same way. Newton, with his chemi-
cal and metallurgical knowledge, pro-
duced a shiny reflecting metal now called
speculum metal for his mirrors. Newton
made the first experiments in interfer-
ence of light beams by measuring the
colors formed in thin translucent films.
He also made some of the first measure-
ments of diffraction of light—the bending
of light rays when they pass by surfaces,
particularly sharp knife edges. Newton
thought that light rays consisted of small
high-speed particles and considered that
the phenomenon of diffraction was caused
by a species of gravitational attraction be-
tween the particles and the surface they
passed near. His rival in this field was

PLANNING

General Machinery Division, allis-chalmers manufacturing company {Graduate Training Course 1939)

H. V. FULLER
Planning is an important part of man-
ufacturing machinery—and of build-
ing a career, too. This planning, however,
must be based on information and ex-
perience. You don't always have all the
facts about industry that you need at the
time you leave engineering school and
start planning your own future. At least,
that's the way it was with me when I got
my degree in Mechanical Engineering at
University of Wisconsin in 1936.
engineering drawings and material specifi-
cations. And from this data we plan the
sequence of manufacturing operations—
determine the equipment and tooling
required, and set up time standards for
each operation.
You can get some idea of the volume
of work from the fact that our West Allis
Machinery Division shops ship an aver-
age of eight million pounds of finished
machinery per month—representing a

New 30-ft. boring mill now operating in Allis-Chalmers' West Allis shops. It supplements
older, slower 40 ft. mill, and greatly increases capacity on big, heavy work. Both mills are
scheduled practically around the clock, seven days a week.
I took a job with a big manufacturer,
but within a year the work I was doing
ended, and my employers referred me to
the Allis-Chalmers Graduate Training
Course. I enrolled in 1937—and then my
knowledge of industry really began to
grow. There was the usual round of the
plant—shops, offices, various departments
—where I saw a wide range of work at
first hand. I worked with steam turbines,
pump testing, and on the electrical test
floor. About half way through the two-
year course I got really interested in the
manufacturing side of the business. After
four months of plant layout work I went
to the Time Study and Planning Depart-
ment, and finished out my course there in
1939. In 1945 I became Superintendent.
range of products from small V-belt
sheaves to massive crushers, steam and
hydraulic turbo-generating units, cement
kilns, sewage pumps, motors, flour mills,
and power transformers.
Look Before You Decide
As a Graduate Training Course engineer
here you may become interested in manu-
facturing. There's a great need for trained
engineers in this work. Or, you may find
your interest lies in some other field—
designing, research, sales, personnel, ser-
vice anderection. Inanycase.theGraduatc
Training Course gives you a chance to
look them all over, gain practical first-
hand experience, plan your career on a
sound basis of knowledge.
Do Your Own Planning
The course is flexible—you help plan it
yourself and can change it as new interests
or opportunities develop. There's no other
spot in industry that offers such a wide
range of experience—so many choices for
a career.
If you want to get further details as to
qualifications, salary and operation of
the course, get in touch with any Allis-
Chalmers district office. Probably the
manager was a G T C himself. Or, write
for literature.
This Is the Starting Point

PROBLEM—You are designing a cabinet-type oil
heater. The oil and air metering valve has to be
placed at the bottom. You now want to provide a
manual control for the valve located on the cabinet
front where it is easy to see and to operate. How
would you do it?
THE SIMPLE ANSWER—Use an S.S.White remote
control flexible shaft to connect the dial to the valve
or to a rod running to the valve. The latter method
was used in the heater illustrated below. The flexible
shaft will provide smooth, sensitive control and will
allow you to put the dial anywhere you want it.
This is just one of hun-
dreds of power drive and
remote control problems
to which S.S.White flex-
ible shafts are the simple
answer. That's why every

miliar with the range and

Huygens, the Dutch physicist, who con-
sidered light rays to be vibratory waves
transmitted through translucent media.
Curiously enough, physicists now consider
that both men were right—depending on
the kind of questions one asks about
light. In his optical work Newton was a
pure experimental physicist. His papers
and his one book on the subject are all
concerned with the quantitative descrip-
tion of what he measured in his various
experiments. No mathematical equations
appear in his Optics.
Mechanics
The crowning glory of Newton's work
is the Principia. His widespread public
fame rests on this work alone. In this
work he brought to a definitive close a
problem which had been studied for six
thousand years—the problem of the mo-
tion of the bodies in the solar system.
The three laws of particle mechanics,
first completely stated by Newton in this
book, plus the assumption of a force of
attraction acting between all particles in
the universe in the form of
were adequate to describe accurately all
the measured motion of the planets and
their satellites. In this work Newton
was a brilliant mathematical physicist—
deducing geometrically all the types of
planetary motion from the three principles
of particle mechanics and the one as-
sumed type of force. The book also con-
tains records of many experiments in im-
pact, pendulum motion, and flow of
water. In this book he outlines for the
first time all the empirical laws of friction
which have been used since then by
physicists and engineers. It was a stu-
pendous job—written in a geometrical
language which has been so thoroughly
superseded by analytical methods, devel-
oped, in part, by Newton himself, that
most modern physicists are unable to fol-
low many of his proofs with complete
understanding.
Newton's experimental methods and
mathematical analyses set the pattern
which all modern physicists follow to this
day. His work was the inspiration for
all of his successors, including Einstein in
our own time. His dynamics form the
basis of large sectors of modern engi-
neering.
A young man whose father had been
hanged was filling out a college applica-
tion. After the usual hereditary questions
there was one asking the cause of the
death of his parents. He thought awhile
and finally put down this answer:
"Mother died of pneumonia. Father was
taking part in a public ceremony when
the platform gave way."

A drunk was walking down the street
one nite. He bumped into a telephone
pole and said "Pardon me, Mister." He
kept walking and then bumped into a fire
plug and said, "'Scuse me, little boy."
As he walked on, he kept on bumping
into light and telephone poles, and every-
thing in his way, but he always excused
himself politely. Finally, with a disgust-
ed look on his face, he sat down on the
curb and said, "I'll just wait here 'til the
crowd passes."

performance tests. The Automotive Laboratory houses automotive, aircraft and Diesel type engines, together
with the necessary dynamometers and instruments for experimental work. The Mechanical Laboratory con-
tains steam engines, turbines and turbo-generators, boilers, air compressors, fans, hydraulic equipment, a
refrigeration plant and stationary Diesel engines. A Motion and Time Study Laboratory is well equipped
with projectors, films and other necessary equipment for detailed studies in the industrial field.

7*0 IfUccA, yaactivitty
Many of the extra-curricular activities in our engineering
college are now floundering due to dwindling membership.
The reason for this is not the result of reduced enrollment,
but rather it is the result of lack of interest and active
participation of the body of students. This apathy towards
outside activities has brought considerable comment from
both the faculty and the students themselves. It is common-
ly explained by the average engine student's intense pre-
occupation with his studies. The individual student places
too much emphasis on the sterling academic record as evi-
denced by a healthy grade point. This very individual will
hasten to agree on the great value of extra-curricular activi-
ties in helping the graduate to obtain employment. Yet far
too many are content to go their idle way, justifying their so-
called goof-off periods by saying they are entitled to this
relaxation time after a tough stint with their books. The
idea of this relaxation is valid in itself, but I do believe the
idea is being overextended. Any readers, who at this point
scoff at this writer's ideas on the merit of extra-curricular
activities would do well to look over the college records of
the men of might in industry today, the very men who will
be hiring the graduates from Michigan in '52. You will
very likely discover that many of these men took an active
part in activities that were divorced from the planned tech-
nical curricula.
Much has been written and much more has been said of
the narrowness and cultural ineptness of the engineering
student in our college. These criticisms are recognized as an
unavoidable outgrowth of the technical concentration that
every student engineer must complete for his degree. This
general criticism fails to include another inadequacy that
the student engineer suffers. This inadequacy is what might
be termed engineering character. The engineering graduate
not only must be able to perform the very same functions
that a cloistered theoretical physicist performs, that is the
rational solution of the basic scientific problems such as we
all get in our physics, thermo, and math courses, but also
he must be able to apply these scientific uncoverings towards
the effective betterment of mankind. It is this very ability
to make practical use of natural laws and phonomena that
spells the difference between the engineer and the scientist.
This end is brought about by the engineers' direction of
the nation's industry. The engineer must assume the respon-
sibility in the direction of people's efforts, and at the same
time he must work harmoniously with these people. These
qualities of leadership, responsibility, and personality are
seeded into the engineering student while he is still in col-
lege only through active participation in activities that are
separate from the printed page.
The employer in the market for engineering graduates
has several guideposts to direct him in his search. Foremost
among these are the scholastic record to indicate the stu-
dent's technical prowess and the activities record to indi-
cate the student's fitness for the leadership and responsi-
bility demands of industry.
Recognizing the fact that the person with the type of
mind that is needed to solve the scientific problems of in-
dustry is inherently an introvert, the engineering student
must redouble his efforts to establish himself with groups of
other people, which he surely must do if he is to stand
apart from the theoretical physicists and specialized tech-
nicians. Extra-curricular activities offer an excellent chance
to do just this.
Participation in these activities will mean manifold job
opportunities upon graduation. The time has come for the
average engineering student to get out of the goof-off dol-
drums and into the activities circle. Incidentally, the
Technic, with its many and diverse departments, is per-
haps the best bet for you students who are now looking for
the way out of the text book lethargia.

SHOWS STRESSES AND STRAINS VISUALLY. By photographing
the patterns developed by polarized light as it passes through
a plastic model of a part, the engineer can have visible evi-
dence of the points of stress within the part.
In the engineering laboratory—on the production line—
photography is today an important tool. It searches metal
structure through electron micrography, x-ray diffraction,
and micro-radiography. It makes swift mechanical motions
seeable by showing them at a snail's pace with high speed
movies. Or it can halt an instant of an instrument's fleeting
trace and record it for study.

How to keep a
color press in the pink
Long-lasting precision and speed are necessary requirements
in single color offset press lithography. To meet these re-
quirements, engineers mount vital cylinder shafts and main
drive shafts of presses on Timken® tapered roller bearings.
Due to tapered construction, Timken bearings carry any
combination of radial and thrust loads—hold shafts in proper
alignment. And Timken bearings eliminate all speed restric-
tions due to bearings, permitting more impressions per hour.
How to mount
press cylinders
Type TNA Timken bearings are used at each end
of this press cylinder. The bearing at the left is
fixed by clamping the double cup while the other
bearing is permitted to float. The bearing cones
are clamped on the shaft by means of an end plate
and cap screws which are locked by wiring the
heads. The double cup for both bearings has a
groove and oil holes through which the lubricant
is supplied.

To you as a student chemical engi-
neer, what does this statement bring
to mind:
Nearly two-thirds of Du Pont's cur-
rent sales are in products entirely
or virtually unknown in 1930.
Likely it suggests years of solving
intriguing engineering problems, the
designing of unique equipment, the
carrying out of reactions under ex-
traordinary conditions.
But it should also suggest the op-
portunities that will come to chemi-
cal engineers in the future. For at
Du Pont, new and better products
are continually being developed.
From today's extended program of
fundamental research you can expect
more neoprenes, more nylons, more
plastics like "Teflon" tetrafluoro-
ethylene resin.
As these products come out of the
laboratory, they will bring with them
a succession of interesting and chal-
lenging problems for the chemical
engineer. Problems that will arise
out of their very newness.
For instance, take nylon, the first
wholly synthetic organic fiber. In
working out techniques for its com-
mercial manufacture, there was
practically nothing to go on. The
compounds of which it was made,
hexamethylenediamine and adipic
acid, were essentially laboratory
chemicals. Processes had to be de-
vised to make them from cheap raw
materials—benzene, hydrogen, air
and ammonia. Large-scale prepara-
tion of nylon salt from amine and
acid required going beyond the clas-
sical unit operations.
Here for the first time it was pro-
posed to extrude a fiber with extreme
accuracy from a melted polymer at
290°C. At this temperature the poly-
mer decomposes slowly. It had to be
melted, pumped at 5000 p.s.i. pres-
sure through microscopic holes and
cooled in a hurry. Otherwise the fiber
would emerge discolored.
The Du Pont chemical and me-
chanical engineers and other men
and women who worked with them
ran into one difficulty after another.
More than once they thought that the
project would have to be abandoned.
However, it is basic in Du Pont
people's philosophy not only to take
on difficult pioneering problems, but
to see them through. With nylon,
this persistence paid off handsomely.
Is this the kind of problem you'd
like to attack, the kind of people
you'd like to work with?
NEXT MONTH —Opportunities for
chemical engineers in research and de-
velopment will be discussed in the sec-
ond article in this series. Watch for it!

RALPH HANSEN of Green Bay, Wisconsin, a Standard Oil lubrication engineer,
consults with the operator of a midwest machine shop. His recommendation
lengthened by 50% the life of the cutting tools used in the automatic screw
machines. '1 he longer period between shutdowns meant higher production levels.
How lubrication engineers help
save industry's costliest commodity
tn today's race for greater production,
-*• time has become one of industry's costli-
est commodities. Save time and you save
real money. The right cutting oil enables
tools to hold their edge longer, and also lets
them cut faster while they are at work.
These savings in time are a significant con-
tribution to American industry's race with
civilian and preparedness requirements.
Such was the contribution made by Ralph
Hansen. And it is justoneexample. Standard
Oil's lubrication engineers daily help main-
tain production capacity in many industries.
They are college-trained men with advanced
study in Standard Oil's own lubrication en-
gineering school. So, they are equipped to
help solve a great variety of problems—in-
volving not only machine tools but also
diesels, turbines, gear drives, electrical ma-
chinery—just about everything. They deal
with equipment working under extreme
heat, cold, moisture. They help select cut-
ting oils, drawing compounds, and temper-
ing oils.
New machines and new operations create
new lubrication problems. Ways must also
be found to keep old machines at peak per-
formance. Here is a real challenge to lubri-
cation engineering know-how.
Standard Oil lubrication engineers take
real pride in their training and experience
which enable them to make countless con-
tributions to the smooth running of the
national economy.

ORGANIZING SERVICE
Are we asked to detect the approach of enemy attack
through the stratosphere? Is there a commercially better method
for extracting sugar from beets? Can we help find alloys (for use
in jet planes) that may replace those made of materials now in
short supply?
Unlimited numbers of technical problems confront our gen-
eration. Among our expanding concepts of civilization and
under the pressures of a world-wide attack upon our basic free-
doms we meet the questions of "Is it possible?" and "What is
best?" and "How may the data be obtained?" at every turn.
An organization able to attack every possible problem, to
follow through the intricate maze of developments, to reconcile
interests, to administer financial requirements surely is cooperat-
ing in a field that gives maximum opportunity for service.
Though entirely conscious of the dif-
ficulties inherent in its daily routine,
the Institute nevertheless is backed by
the almost unlimited capacities of one
of the great Faculties of our day and
time and so looks forward with optim-
ism to future opportunities for solid
achievement by the University we all
must serve

Westinghouse Network Calculator
The a-c network calculator at the East
Pittsburgh plant of Westinghouse Electric
Corporation has been in almost constant
use during 1951 by utility customers.
Here engineers from the Duquesne Light
Company work with Westinghouse engi-
neers in making a complex system study
that would require literally man-years of
hand calculation. Electrical representation
of a utility system on the calculator makes
it possible to impose any conditions de-
sired and study the effects throughout the
system. Results are recorded on the plot-
ting board (foreground), metering is
controlled from the control desk (behind
plotting board), and generator and sys-
tem characteristics are set on the board
(right and background). Westinghouse
has built 19 such calculators, and has two
on order.
Precombustion Reactions
in Engines Studied
When a motorist meanders through
city traffic the air-fuel mixture in his auto-
mobile engine rises to approximately 100
to 150 degrees Fahrenheit before it goes
into the cylinders to explode in the power
stroke of a piston.
This mixture heating is standard auto-
motive practice, designed to distribute
gasoline equally from the fuel tank to all
the engine cylinders.
What effect this heat has on the chemi-
cal reactions of the air-fuel mixture—
whether it robs the engine of performance
and miles-per-gallon—was discussed by
Walter Cornelius and John D. Caplan
of General Motors Research Laboratories.
Recently, they said, research had shown
that if too much heat is added to the mix-
ture before it enters the engine, chemical
reactions cause release of some of the
fuel's energy before it explodes in the
power stroke.
In a technical paper before I he Society
of Automotive Engineers, the two GM
Research men described how they delib-
erately heated the mixture to 300 degrees
to find out whether pressures resulting
from these chemical reactions snuffed out
some of the engine's power.
They found that whatever power is lost
is insignificant at normal driving tempera-
tures. But when the mixture heat was
boosted to the 300-degree level, the power
loss from so-called precombusfion reac-

tions was noticeable.
Primarily, the work of Mr. Cornelius
and Mr. Caplan was another step in a 30-
year study by GM Research Laboratories
seeking the cause and prevention of knock
in automotive and aircraft engines.
Their findings were based on a series of
single-cylinder engine studies in which
engine firing conditions were directly ob-
served and recorded on supersensitive in-
struments through a transparent quartz
"window" in the engine cylinder head.
By deliberately retarding the engine
spark and heating the air-fuel mixture,
the two GM Research men were able to
approximate conditions prevailing just
prior to knock.
They duplicate in the laboratory what
would happen in a popular GM passen-
ger car at 20 miles an hour with the driv-
er's foot tromping the accelerator to the
floorboard.
Mr. Cornelius and Mr. Caplan ob-
served in the few ten thousandths of a •
second when the piston is in its compres-
sion or upstroke, with the mixture going
in at 300 degrees, that one and sometimes
two pale blue "cool" flames occurred,
just before the spark plug ignited the air-
fuel mixture in a "normal flame."
Presence of the second cool flame was
previously undetected in an automotive
engine, although earlier investigators had
noted the first cool flame.
The GM Research team found that
when the antiknock agent, tetraethyllead,
was added to fuels in their tests, intensity
of the first cool flame was dampened. The
second cool flame apparently was elimin-
ated.
They concluded this indicated how
tetraethyllead may be affecting knock. But
they admitted the unanswered question is:
What chemical effect does tetraethyllead
have in the process?
Likewise, they learned that molecular
structure of various hydrocarbons (fuels)
affected the precombustion reaction just
before the spark ignited the air-fuel mix-
ture.
Their results confirmed that fuels with
so-called closely packed molecules per-
form better in an engine than fuels with
long or "stringy" molecule structure. Al-
though this was known by fuel and en-
gine researchers, the Cornelius-Caplan re-
port offered visible confirmation of how
various fuels and fuel blends behave in
the critical precombustion process.

What you and I produce
THERE IS ONE RULE OF NATURE that all the
governments, laws, unions and contracts cannot
change: a man can be paid only out of what he pro-
duces, and the more he produces the more he can earn.
And, that line "Factory wage per man-hour,"
shown in the chart at right, has gone up and up
only as American business has put better and better
machines to team up with American workers.
Machines help the worker produce more and so
earn more.
And machines can come only from the savings of
investors—the savings made out of investor profits.
So—profits plus machines plus workers who use
them well, equal constantly rising savings and
standard of living. Whoever attacks profits is attack-
ing you, and your family. Never forget it.

Electronic Eyes Measure
Red-Hot Steel Strips
A "look" from a pair of electronic
eyes is all that it will soon take to meas-
ure the width of red-hot steel strips mov-
ing through rolling mills.
The eyes are the principal part of a new
device, which for the first time will auto-
matically and continuously measure the
width of red-hot steel strips without phys-
ically contacting the metal. The device,
developed in the General Electric Com-
pany's General Engineering Laboratory
at Schenectady, N. Y., was described at
the National Electronics Conference by
Ernest S. Sampson of the G-E laboratory.
Sampson said preliminary tests indicate
that use of the gage will result in in-
creased production of finished steel with
less scrap loss. He described the new de-
vice as an electronic width gage for hot-
strip steel rolling mills.
"Closer tolerance expected from use of
the new gage, calculated to be accurate
within plus or minus one-eighth of an
inch, will save much time and scrap
waste by eliminating excessive edge trim-
ming," the G-E engineer said.
The new non-contacting gage can con-
tinuously measure, indicate and record
steel strip width by means of two elec-
tronic detectors mounted about 15 feet
above the rolling-mill table.
The electronic detectors, filling the role
of eyes, "gaze" at edges of steel strips as
they move under the gage. An optical
lens, mounted in each detector, reflects
the image of each edge of the strip.
Necessary illumination for the reflecting
image is furnished from the glowing
strip.
The detector system converts the image
of each strip edge into an electrical pulse
signal. Both pulse signals are then auto-
matically added together and can be re-
corded. Resultant chart readings can then
give a continuous width record of all steel
strips rolled. Any deviation from a preset
desired width immediately shows on a
"deviation indicator," according to
Sampson.
Vertical or sideways motion of the strip
has little effect on accuracy of the gage.
The G-E engineer explained that if the
steel strips shift on the rolling-mill table,

"Million-Volt Corona Motor."
Courtesy Westinghouse
pulse signals from the other detector be-
come shorter. The sum of the signals,
automatically added, will remain the same.
Currently-used width measuring meth-
ods require manual spot-checking which
does not provide a continuous check of
width. A steel worker, shielding himself
from the intense heat, periodically meas-
ures the red-hot moving strips with a pair
of calipers. This usually makes it neces-
sary to stop the moving strips.
Sampson said that the new gage will
save time and insure width accuracy by
continuous measurement while the roll-
ing mill is in operation.
He added that easy installation and low
upkeep costs of the gage make it adapt-
able to existing mills without modifica-
tion of the mill equipment.
Million-Volt "Corona Motor"
Engineers at the Westinghouse Electric
Corporation's high voltage laboratory at
Trafford, Pa., created this pinwheel ef-
fect while demonstrating the phenomenon
of corona, the leakage of power at high
voltages. The "corona motor" is simply
three "L"-shaped rods connected to a hub
that rotates atop a vertical rod project-
ing from an insulator. When one million
volts is applied, the "jet" action of the
corona discharge from the trailing tips of
the bent rods causes the assembly to ro-
tate. Test facilities at the lab make pos-
sible high voltage tests on such equipment
as the newly-developed "watch-case" cir-
cuit breaker in the background, assuring
more reliable power apparatus.

Bearing. This efficient anti-friction
unit can carry a greater radial load
than any other bearing of compar-
able outside diameter due to the
large number of rollers. The small
cross section of the bearing allows a
large shaft which permits a rigid de-
sign with minimum shaft deflection.
Efficient Lubrication
The method of lubrication is an-
other feature of the Torrington
Needle Bearing. The retaining shell
with its turned-in lips provides a
natural reservoir for the lubricant.
Thus the needle rollers turn in an
oil or grease bath and continually
bring up a fresh film of lubricant—
insuring rotation of all moving
members on a fluid film.
Low Cost
The size of the Torrington Needle
Bearing, coupled with the simplicity
of its construction, makes it a com-
paratively inexpensive anti-friction
unit. Its compact size encourages
simplified design which requires less
material in surrounding compon-
ents. This also contributes to further
cost reductions.
The shaft serves as the inner race
in the majority of Needle Bearing
applications and therefore should
be hardened and ground to proper
dimensions. However, where it is de-
sirable to use an unhardened shaft,
an inner race can be supplied.
For Modern Design
Where the efficiency of anti-friction
operation is desired, and where
space, weight and cost are vitally
important considerations, Needle
Bearings provide a logical answer.
That's why you will find them
used in an ever-growing list of
applications.
This is one of a series of adver-
tisements designed to give you the
latest engineering information on
Needle Bearings. Should you have
occasion to work with bearing de-
sign or wish more information, write

METAL SPRAYING PROCESS
BY
P. D. DAYKIN, '52E
Statement of the Problem:
The purpose of this article is to
furnish a description of the metal spray-
ing process, a short background history,
and analysis of metal spraying from a
metallurgical standpoint, and some ex-
amples of important applications of metal-
lizing.
While this process has been used very
successfully in a wide range of applica-
tions, it must be emphasized that it is by
no means a "cure-all" and an effort will
be made to indicate its limitations. It is
hoped that this study will provide the
reader with a basic understanding of what
metal spraying is, how it works, and
what it can do.
Work Performed:
The work involved in preparing this
report consisted mainly of library research
and organizing the various material col-
lected on the subject. The author also had
the privilege of inspecting a metallizing
installation at the Wilson Metal Products
Co. in Cleveland, Ohio, from which valu-
able information was obtained. For this,
the author is indebted to Mr. Fred Becker
and Mr. George Bancroft of that com-
pany.
The coating of articles with films of
metals has intrigued mankind since Bibli-
cal days. It is recorded in the Bible (I
Kings, vi) that the majority of the fabric
in King Solomon's temple was overlaid
with gold, and mention of metallic coat-
ings also occurs in the Leyden Papyrus.
In the Middle Ages in Nuremberg
powdered metals were prepared for the
basis of metallic paints by beating the
metals into thin sheets followed by
powdering them by stamping. However,
it was the work of Dr. M. U. Schoop of
Zurich who made possible the spraying of
metals as we know it today. It is said
that Dr. Schoop received the inspiration
for his invention while playing with his
small son as he shot lead pellets against
the wall with a top cannon. His first
writing on the subject of metal spraying
occurred in 1917 in collaboration with
C. H. Doeschle in their book Das Schoop-

"P. D. DAYKIN"
sche Metallspritzierfahreii. The results
of Schoop's first efforts consisted of a
bulky and rather inefficient device which
involved pouring a stream of molten metal
into a jet of gas issuing at high pressure.
From this the modern molten-metal spray-
ing gun was developed, although its use is
presently restricted to the lower melting
point metals. Schoop and his workers also
experimented with the possibilities of
spraying both powdered metals and metals
in wire form. Both of these processes
were later developed for commercial use.
While the powdered metal process does
offer one particular advantage over the
wire spraying process in that it can
handle some materials which cannot be
drawn into wire such as cast iron, high-
tin bronzes, high-zinc brasses, and high-
magnesium-aluminum alloys, we will con-
cern ourselves primarily with the wire
spraying process, as it is presently the
most widely used in this country. It
should be noted at this point that the
term metallizing is used synonomously in
referring to the wire spraying process.
Metallizing consists of spraying a coat-
ing of metal particles onto a surface either
metallic or non-metallic for the purpose
of building up worn machine parts, ap-
plying thin coatings of metal to dis-similar
base metals for corrosion prevention,
and occasionally for purely decorative ef-
fects on such materials as wood, plaster,
or paper. This is accomplished in the
wire-spraying gun. In addition to the
gun, a reel to hold the wire, a regulated
oxygen and fuel supply equipped with
moisture filters, and a compressed air sup-
ply are required. The wire is fed out thru
the spray nozzle by a pair of rollers with-
in the gun driven by an air turbine oper-
ated from the compressed air supply Since
turbine speeds in excess of 25,000 r.p.m.
are common in these units, a system of re-
duction gears is necessary between the
turbine and drive rollers. The speed of
the turbine is controlled by means of a
brake on the turbine shaft. The fuel
(usually acetylene or propane) and oxy-
gen mixture is used only for melting the
wire and does not serve in the actual
spraying of the metal. As the flame melts
the wire, a stream of compressed air sur-
rounding the flame disintegrates the film
of molten metal as it is formed on the
end of the wire and carries from it the
nozzle of the gun to the surface being
sprayed.
Although the exact nature of the bond
between the sprayed and base metal has
long been a matter of debate, the latest
research indicates that it is due to a com-
bination of physical interlocking and
oxide cementation. The metal leaves the
gun in the form of molten globules cov-
ered by a thin oxide film. About 90% of
the particles are still molten when they
land and due to heat and velocity flatten
out. In flattening out, the surface area of
the particles is greatly increased and the
oxide films are ruptured exposing pure
metal which bonds firmly to the oxide
coated particles which landed previously.
The resulting structure consists of metal
particles surrounded by thin oxide films
and actual voids due to lack of bond.
Since the bonding of the sprayed metal
does not involve actual fusion to the base
metal it is necessary that the base metal
be sufficiently rough to allow the metal
particles to lock themselves into crevices
and irregularities as the spray strikes the
surface. Further, it is essential that the
surface be free from dust, dirt, moisture,
oil ind oxides in order to attain a strong
bond. The surface may be prepared by

JESSE ORMONDROYD
Professor of Engineering Mechanics
The entire body of existing science can
be classified under three broad points of
view—the mechanical, the chemical and
the electrical. The mechanical view point
is the oldest of the three and it still dom-
inates a large share of our practical in-
terests. The science which outlines the
distilled essence of mechanical experi-
ence is called Mechanics. The various
branches of mechanics, in the historical
order of their development are: Kine-
matics, Statics, Dynamics, Acoustics, Elas-
ticity, Plasticity, Hydrodynamics, Areo-
dynamics, Thermodynamics, and Statisti-
cal Mechanics. The first systematic scien-
tific study ever made by man concerned
the motions of the stars, the planets, the
sun and the moon. Early astronomical
interest was purely kinematic in nature.
It began when civilization began some six
or seven thousand years ago. The last
great creations of systematic knowledge
under the mechanical outlook were Ther-
modynamics and Statistical Mechanics.
These were developed during the 19th
century, and Josiah Willard Gibbs
brought that phase of physical theory to a
close in 1902 by the publication of his
treatise on the "Elementary Principles
in Statistical Mechanics." Gibbs was
the last of the great classical physicists
and the only American in that company
of famous scientists.
Gibbs was a mathematical physicist. He
never made any experiments. His writ-
ings are so formal and so compactly logi-
cal that few people have ever read them
with complete comprehension. Although
his work was finished fifty years ago it is
just beginning to obtain general recogni-
tion. In spite of the formidable barriers
to the comprehension of his work, it has
had an enormous practical effect in the
realm of engineering. When the engi-
neer uses Temperature-Entropy charts,
Entropy-Volume charts, the phase rule
for heterogeneous substances, chemical po-
tentials or vector analysis, he is indebted
to Gibbs whether he knows it or not.
While Gibbs wrote enough separate
works to fill three fat volumes, his fame
actually stems from five of these works—
a group of three papers written at the be-
ginning of his scientific career between
1873 and 1879, and two complete treat-

"JOSIAH WILLARD GIBBS" (1839-1903)
ises which were published just before his
death in 1903. The first of his famous
papers entitled "Graphical Methods in
the Thermodynamics of Fluids" appeared
as 33 printed pages in the Transactions
of the Connecticut Academy of Science in
1873. In this paper Gibbs examined the
possibility of representing the properties
of bodies as they enter the work and heat
relationships of various processes by
means of diagrams in a plane. There are
five properties of a given body in any
state—volume, pressure, absolute tem-
perature, energy and entropy. These are
related to the work done by the body and
the heat received by the body. The rela-
tionships between any two of these seven
quantities can be shown graphically as a
plane diagram. The relationship between
any three of these quantities can be shown
in a family of plane curves. Gibbs dis-
cusses six such possible diagrams. One
of these diagrams was already old. The
pressure-volume diagram—the indicator
card—had been invented by Watt late in
the 18th century and was already in com-
mon use by physicists and engineers in
1873. But Gibbs invented five more plane
diagrams which were not then in use.
Two of these five have survived in mod-
ern engineering practice—the tempera-
ture-entropy chart, dear to the hearts ol
all heat engineers, and the entropy-vol-
ume chart.
Gibbs' second famous paper was a
natural extension of the first paper. It is
entitled "A Method of Geometrical Rep-
resentation of Thermodynamic Properties
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


This paper is 23 pages long. It appeared
in the same journal in the same year as
the first paper. This paper shows how
relationship between any three of the ther-
modynamic quantities can be represented
by iiolid, three-dimensional models. For
instance, the entropy-volume-energy solid
for water can be used to illustrate clearly
the conditions under which that substance
appears in its solid, liquid or vapor phases
or in combinations of these states.
Gibbs' third great paper, "On the
Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Sub-
stances," is in actuality a full length treat-
ise of 300 pages. It was published in
1878 by the Connecticut Academy. This
paper is of enormous engineering im-
portance in the vast chemical industries.
In this paper Gibbs' celebrated phase rule
is defined and the idea of chemical poten-
tials is developed.
In 1901, E. B. Wilson, one of Gibbs'
students, published Gibbs' treatise on
"Vector Analysis." Gibbs was busy on his
last great work at the time and his vector
analysis would never have been published
except in abbreviated form if Wilson had
not carried out the work of assembling
and supplementing Gibbs' lectures on the
subject. Every graduate student who
studies vector analysis in any university
of the world studies this subject in the
form and with the nomenclature given to
it by Gibbs.
In the last year of Gibbs' life his treat-
ise on the "Elementary Theory of Statisti-
cal Mechanics" was published. This treat-
ise is the last word that has been said
concerning the mechanical hypothesis of
matter. It furnishes the best logical foun-
dation for the general study of thermo-
dynamics.
Gibbs, by strong preference, led a
quieted, sheltered and uneventful life.
His whole life was intimately integrated
with Yale University. He was born in
New Haven, he died in New Haven. His
father was a professor at Yale. Gibbs
was undergraduate and postgraduate stu-
dent at Yale. Finally he was an instructor
and professor at Yale. All his work was
done in New Haven. Except for three
years spent in European universities,
Gibbs seldom left New Haven. Most of
the honors conferred on Gibbs by other
institutions of learning and scientific so-
cieties were bestowed on him "in absen-
tia," so strong was his attachment to his
familiar surroundings. The Academy
which published his early scientific papers
was a sort of scientific "company union"
for Yale University. Gibbs was so tight-
ly bound to New Haven and Yale that he
served as professor of mathematical
physics for ten years without salary. He
achieved a salary of $2000 per year only
after the new-born Johns Hopkins Uni-
versity offered him a position at $3000
per year. Gibbs played no part in the
Civil War, although he was twenty-two
years old when that great conflict started.
He never married—but lived with his sis-
ters in the house in which he spent his
childhood days. He never was completely
understood by his colleagues and students.
The public—even the educated public—
was almost unaware of his existence.
There is far more interest in Gibbs today
than there was during his lifetime. In
the thirty-two years of his professorship he
lectured only to graduate students. It is
estimated that less than 100 students at-
tended his lectures in the course of his
whole professorship—and only about a
dozen of these took their doctoral work
directly under his supervision. Yet he was
a very sociable man within the self-re-
stricted orbit of his life. While he was
unknown to the multitude, he was well
known to the great physicists of his day.
He sent hundreds of reprints of his papers
to those he considered capable of appre-
ciating them. This group included some
four or five professors at the University
of Michigan.
A few dates will place Gibbs in his
proper historical setting. He was born on
February 11, 1839- He went to private
schools in New Haven and entered Yale
in 1854—at the age of fifteen. His under-
graduate work was completed in 1858.
After five years of graduate study in the
newly named Sheffield Scientific School he
received the first Ph.D. in engineering
ever granted in the United States, in 1863.
From 1863 to 1866 Gibbs was a tutor at
Yale. In 1866 Gibbs embarked on the
only adventure of his life—a three-year
visit to France and Germany, where he
studied under the most famous physicists
and mathematicians in the Sorbonne in
Paris, the University of Berlin and Hei-
delberg. He returned to the United States
in 1869. In 1871 he was appointed Pro-
fessor of Mathematical Physics in Yale—-
with no salary. In lieu of salary he was
given the freedom to lecture on any sub-
ject he might choose. He lectured to grad-
uate students only. This happy arrange-
ment endured to 1880 when the offer
from Johns Hopkins—which he almost
accepted—induced Yale to give him an
annual salary of $2000. His papers on
thermodynamics were written in the de-
cade between 1870 and 1880. During the
next decade Gibbs developed modern
vector analysis. In the "gay nineties,"
Gibbs devised his theory of statistical me-
chanics. In 1901 E. B. Wilson published
Gibbs' vector analysis. About the same
time his work on statistical mechanics was
published. Gibbs died, at the age of 64,
in 1903. He was the last of the great
physicists with the "classical" outlook and
the only American in that distinguished
company.
While Gibbs' work was severely mathe-
matical in form and content it was all
done with practical application at least in
the background. Gibbs started life with
an engineering outlook and never quite
lost it. His Ph.D. thesis was on the geo-
metrical shape of teeth in spur gears.
While he was a tutor he made two tech-
nical inventions; one, a center vent hy-
draulic turbine and the other, an inertia
type brake for railway cars. This latter
invention was made just prior to the in-
vention of the air brake by George West-
inghouse. During the two years between
his return from Europe and his appoint-
ment to the professorship at Yale he made
a third invention, a very stable and very
sensitive fly ball governor. None of these
inventions was ever put to practical use.
After his life was over engineers incor-
porated more and more of his scientific
results into practical use.
Gibbs' scientific works have been
collected and issued in three volumes (if
E. B. Wilson's vector analysis is includ-
ed) by Yale University. A two-volume
commentary on Gibbs' work written by
students and disciples of Gibbs has also
been issued by Yale University. Three
full-length biographies of Gibbs have ap-
peared—the latest, most accurate and most
complete being by Lynde Phelps Wheeler.
This is also a publication of the Yale
University Press. Yale is justifiably proud
of her greatest son. And all Americans
share this pride with Yale.
Walking with a friend one day, a pro-
fessor passed a large fish shop where a
fine catch of codfish with mouths open
and eyes staring were arranged in a row.
The prof suddenly stopped, looked at
them, and clutching his friend by the arm,
exclaimed: "Heavens! That reminds me,
I have a class in EE this hour."

MORT FLEISHMAN, '54E
In the last few years, a new interest in
guided missiles has developed. It devel-
oped at the close of World War II be-
cause of the activity of the German V-l
and V-2 missiles. People were attracted to
the idea that a plane or rocket ship
could be remotely controlled. To average
people, it almost seemed like magic when
they heard of such a feat. They began
speaking of "push button" wars and
rockets to the moon. To them, it was all
a fascinating new idea to discuss and
think about.
However, though the idea may be fas-
cinating, it was not new. Any scientist or
engineer will tell you that it is almost
impossible to develop anything radically
new in time of war. The fact may first
come to public knowledge during the
war, but the idea does not necessarily
originate then. The idea of guided miss-
iles did not originate during World War
II or in Germany for that matter. It is
known that the ancient Chinese used
rockets whose paths were crudely calcu-
lated, and Francis Scott Key, in the Star
Spangled Banner, describes rockets which
were fired from a British rocket ship. No,
guided missiles development was a tedi-
ous process involving much time and
energy over a long period.
The study of guided missiles was not
concentrated in just one field. It involved
activity in many fields. Some investigat-
ors did research in propulsion, others in
automatic control and guidance, and still
others in aerodynamics. All these fields
contributed to the development of the
guided missiles of today.
When thinking of guided missiles,
most people picture a sort of winged
bomb shooting across the sky. Actually,
this is only one type of guided missile.
There are missiles in development today
which are capable of being launched from
a piloted aircraft, shooting down to the
ocean, and then diving beneath the waters
and attacking an enemy submarine. There
are guided missiles which are like tor-
pedos but are capable of being directed
to their target. Finally, there are guided
missiles which travel entirely above the
surface of the earth. It is upon this latter
group of guided missiles, or robot bombs,
that this paper will concentrate.
Before gettting into the subject at hand,

"MORT FLEISHMAN"
it may be well to give an accurate defini-
tion of what an airborne guided missile
is. A definition which most missile ex-
perts agree upon is as follows: "A guid-
ed missile is an unmanned vehicle mov-
ing above the earth's surface, whose
trajectory or flight path is capable of be-
ing altered by a mechanism within the
vehicle." Such a missile is completely
expendable and is used only for destruc-
tion, thus it is not required to make a
return trip. In keeping with the definition
just given, a missile usually carries with-
in its body three major groups of equip-
ment: power, control, and guidance,
which may vary however for different
types of missiles.
A robot bomb gets its power, or pro-
pulsion, from either a rocket motor, a
jet power plant, or sometimes even a con-
ventional propeller-driven motor, though
the first two mentioned are in greater
use. The rocket engine is a very compli-
cated piece of apparatus. It consists mainly
of an intricate system of tubes running
from fuel tanks and a pump assembly
into a fire chamber where superheated
gases are produced and expelled rearward
at a tremendously high speed. The gases
are expelled through a funnel-shaped
affair called a "venturi tube". It has a
greater diameter at one end than at the
other, thus causing the gases to be con-
stricted as they pass through. This con-
striction of the gases cause them to leave
the rocket at a greater velocity than if
the tube had been symmetrical.
When the motor is started, there is a
tremendous roar with a high pitched
scream, and a long stiff roaring flame
stands out from the tailpipe. When push-
ing a missile, the rocket motor, which is
capable of attaining speeds over five
thousand miles per hour, causes it to
vanish in seconds leaving just a vapor
trail behind.
The second main type of propulsion
unit used is the jet engine, and the ram
jet is the one most often used. The ram-
jet engine consists of nothing more than
a tube with no moving parts and with an
interior of varying diameters. The only
other parts associated with it are an
igniter and fuel nozzles for spraying the
gasoline into the combustion chamber.
Physically, it is the simplest of all the
power plants, but its operation is ex-
tremely complicated. It requires a starting
speed of at least two hundred miles per
hour before beginning to operate. It is
therefore launched with a rocket booster
or from a piloted aircraft. It is capable
of speeds far in excess of the speed of
sound.
At this point, a brief analysis of the
various types of launching apparatus may
be in order. Launching equipment is very
important in many forms of missiles. It
may be mobile or stationary, and con-
structed in either a vertical or angular
position. The lengths of these "take-off"
ramps vary from zero to one hundred or
more feet. Some ramps have special de-
vices built into the structure for provid-
ing a missile with necessary take-off
thrust. These ramps are called catapault
launchers.
When no catapault is used, the missile
is started on its flight by means of a
rocket booster, and rides on rails until it
clears the take-off tower. Since it takes
time foi a rocket motor or ram-jet engine
to gain speed, a booster is used which
gets the missile moving fast enough for
the tail fins to grip the air, and also to
start the ram-jet. A booster usually con-
tains a solid propellant (a slow burning
explosive) that gives enormous push for
a second or so. When the booster burns
out, it falls to earth with a wickering
scream and the regular motor then takes
over. (Continued on page 34)

LOUIS A. BAIER
Professor of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering
Professor Baier, Chairman of the
Department of Naval Architecture
and Marine Engineering, has an ex-
tensive background in the design
and construction of ships. His ac-
tivities during the past few years
with the Great Lakes fleet in the
attainment of higher speeds and
efficiency have resulted in a sub-
stantial gain in the movement of
ore and bulk cargo tonnage.
The economical design of a lake
freighter calls for the maximum displace-
ment practical within given dimensions.
On the other hand the present level of
of operating costs demands high speeds.
These two requirements are incompatible
from a viewpoint of pure hydraulics and
the consequence frequently is severe vibra-
tion ot "shaking" of the after end. At-
tention to this problem was accelerated
last year due to the vibration experienced
on the "Wilfred Sykes." The current
construction of several other high pow-
ered vessels and the repowering of many
older boats necessitated an early solution
of :his familiar problem in single screw
ships. Professor L. A. Baier, chairman of
the Department of Naval Architecture
and Marine Engineering at the Univer-
sity of Michigan, assisted by Professor J.
Ormondroyd, well known vibration expert
of the same institution, recently com-
pleted a year's research leading to a suc-
cessful solution. This work was encour-
aged and sponsored by the Pittsburgh
Steamship Company, The Bradley Trans-
portation Company, Inland Steel Com-
pany, and the American Shipbuilding
Company. Models were tested at the U.
of M. Naval Tank, the U. S. Navy Tank
at Carderock, Md., and by Dr. Troost in
the large tank at Wageningen, Holland.
As a result of these tests, for the first
time the initiation of this vigorous vibra-
tion was discovered to be caused by a
strong downdraft of water flow ahead of
and above the propeller. This disturbance
to the required flow of water to the wheel
caused hull cavitation or periodic exces-
sive blade loading as the upper blade pass-
ed through the high wake region. Under-
water pictures were recorded of the water
flow and further study led to a simple
control. Horizontal fins extending about
4 feet out from the hull and covering the
propeller aperture, dying away into the
shell about 15 to 20 feet head of the
wheel, were proposed and designed by
Professor Baier as a problem cure.
Mr. Irvin Clymer, President of the
Bradley Transportation Company, made
available their Steamer "Carl D. Bradley,"
turbo-electric drive of about 5000 horse-
power, which has long experienced exces-
sive fantail shaking, for the purpose of
full scale tests. The proposed fins were
fitted to the vessel at the South Chicago
yards of the American Shipbuilding Com-
pany early in August.
Professor Ormondroyd recorded the
amplitudes of vibration before and after
the installation of the fins. At the load
draft of 23 feet the occasional maximum
amplitures were reduced to 1/5 and the
average recorded values to about 1/10. All
the familiar physical consequences from
heavy vibration were eliminated. In load
condition dishes would "walk" off the
dining room table; chairs would slide over
the deck; pots had to be held in position
on the range; articles on shelves rattled
violently; the steward and cook had diffi-
culty in understanding conversation in the
galley; and safety meetings could not be
held in the dining room underway due to
background noise. Considerable chatter-
ing and rumbling existed at the rudder
post and quadrant. In the engine room
the Charbourne vibrated violently as, of
course, did rails and piping. All these
annoying troubles disappeared and the re-
maining vibrations were much smaller
than those even at light draft.
Steering and backing characteristics of
the vessel were unaffected and it seems
probable that some gain in speed may be
realized. As shown by the photograph,
the fins are no handicap to docking or
tugs, and it is hoped they will not be vul-
nerable to ice damage. These fins can be
installed without drydocking, and for the
first time provide a simple non-technical
device for the suppression of uncom-
fortable and often damaging fantail vibra-
tion.

Since the end of World War II, engi-
neers have turned their attention to the
practical problems concerning supersonic
flow. New materials, better design, and
great improvement in available power
plants, especially in aircraft, have necessi-
tated a closer analysis of the high speed
flow problems. The swept wing airplane,
for example, is of such clean design that
the extremely low drag enables supersonic
speeds to be attained during maneuvers.
The emphasis on guided missiles for scien-
tific research called for a detailed investi-
gation of supersonic flow.
Recognizing the need for facilities to
gather information on this problem, the
University of Michigan under an Air
Force contract began building the super-
sonic wind tunnel at Willow Run early in
1946. The facilities were put into initial
operation in June, 1947. Active test pro-
grams were begun in July of the follow-
ing year.
The tunnel is of the intermittent vac-
uum type, one of the first of its kind
built in this country. The basic idea
originated in Germany in the early days
of the last war. The main parts
of che tunnel consist of the nozzle
section, the test section, the vacuum
tank which is a group of reinforced
steel tank cars, and the storage bag,
an inverted surplus barrage balloon. The
storage bag is necessary in order to have
clean dry air. The dirt and dust particles
present would rapidly pit the model while
any moisture would condense in the test
section causing enough disturbance in the
flow to invalidate the data. Operating po-
tential is established by evacuating the
13,000 cubic foot vacuum tank and utiliz-
ing the pressure differential between the
atmospheric air storage bag and the tank
to establish supersonic flow in the test
section. The speed of the flow established
is-a function of the pressure maintained
in the vacuum tank and the shape of the
nozzle section.
The unique feature of this wind tunnel
is the closed return circuit employed to
reduce the problem of drying and clean-
ing the air. In the return circuit the air
pumped from the vacuum tank is re-
turned to the storage bag through a surge
chamber and an electronic dust collector.
In addition, a secondary circuit exists for

/
"ESTHER MALKOUN"
air drying equipment. During operation,
a blower circulates air from the storage
bag through two activated alumina driers,
through a dust filter, and back to stor-
age. Therefore, the air drying equipment
is minimized to that necessary for initial-
ly charging the storage bag and overcom-
ing air and water leakage into the circuit.
When the tunnel is in operation, the
air passes from the storage bag through
three turbulence screens into the nozzle
section. At the throat of the nozzle sec-
tion the air reaches sonic speed and ex-
pands, producing the desired speed at the
test section. The flow goes out through
the diffuser into the vacuum tank.
A phenomenon of transonic and su-
personic flow is the formation of a shock
wave at the leading edge of the body. A
shock wave is an actual discontinuity in
the flow pattern indicating a change in
the velocity, density, and pressure pre-
ceding and following the shock. The in-
crease in the pressure within the vacuum
tank causes the diffuser shock to move
upstream to the rear of the test section
thus terminating the test. The normal
test lasts from five to twenty seconds.
Fifteen minutes of vacuum pump opera-
tion is necessary before the next run can
be made.
The test section itself is thirteen inches
high and eight inches wide and is sur-
rounded by a pressure box which encloses
the original balance system. Models can
be mounted on the floor or in the wall.
The tunnel operates from Mach 1.4 to
Mach 4. Mach number refers to the ratio
of the actual speed of the body at given
conditions of pressure, temperature, and
density to the speed of sound at the same
conditions. The variation in Mach num-
ber is controlled by changing the nozzle
sections. These sections are machined
from solid aluminum billets held to an
accuracy of one-thousandth of an inch.
The length of the run has been improved
for higher Mach numbers by the addition
of a movable "spike" in the diffuser sec-
tion to vary the shape of the cross section
and delay the upstream motion of the
shock. The "spike" is operated by a
pneumatic piston from the control panel.
Due to the short time of a test, prob-
lems arise in the recording of data. An
intermittent tunnel such as this one with
this Mach variation has a considerable
range of physical quantities to be meas-
ured and also a wide variation in the re-
quired accuracy of measurement. The sys-
tem is difficult to stabilize in the short
period of operation and the presence of
large transient responses of the system
make the interpretation more complicated.
Three types of measurement techniques
are employed: pressure measurement with
a manometer bank or electronic pressure-
capsule; optical technique with Schlieren
and shadowgraph pictures; and measure-
ment of the aerodynamic loads by means
of a balance system.
Pressure measurements are made with a
four bank, 100 tube, five foot vertical
manometer. Back lighting is used for
photographic recording. In order to aid
in stabilizing the system the pressure tub-
ing is closed off by a guillotine clamp
prior to shutdown thus preserving the
manometer pattern and eliminating most
of the lag due to the inertia of the mer-
cury columns for the next run. When the
pattern appears to have stabilized, a
photograph is taken.
The optical equipment consists of a
Schlieren system which may be used for
visual observation or intermittently with a
two to four microsecond flash for photo-
graphic purposes. A high speed motion
picture camera is used in the Schlieren
system at speeds up to 5000 frames per
second in order to observe the dynamic
characteristics of the flow. All of this

A friend of ours who works in a stock-
yard came up with this problem. He
had nine pigs which he wished to place
in four pens. He was required to place
an odd number of pigs in each pen. It
was further stipulated that each pen had
to contain more than one pig After
some thought our friend finally solved this
problem. How did he do it?
While we were at the service station
having a new battery put in our car, we
saw a poor mechanic struggling with this
one. The mechanic had an eight gallon
container filled with oil. He also had two
empty measures, one a three gallon and
the other a five gallon container. He
wanted to measure out exactly four gallons
of oil and had only three containers in
which to do it. Since this was on a Fri-
day, we were feeling good after somehow
managing to survive the week, so we de-
cided to help him out. We found that we
could measure the required four gallons
of oil by two different methods. How
would you have done it?
Here is one that most of you should
find relatively easy. Three salesmen, who
were traveling from New York to San
Francisco, decided to spend the night in a
hotel for a change. As they had all com-
pleted some pretty big transactions before
starting on the trip, they went to a classy
looking hotel, where they were informed
by the clerk at the desk that a room for
the three of them would cost thirty dol-
lars. They took the room and each paid
the clerk ten dollars. A short time later
the clerk discovered that he had charged
the men five dollars too much, since the
room they occupied cost only twenty-five
dollars. The clerk motioned for the bell-
hop, told him the situation, and sent him
up to the room with the five dollar refund.
The bell-hop, being a little dishonest,
kept two dollars for himself and gave
each man one dollar in refund. As a
result each man had paid nine dollars al-
together and the bell-hop had two dollars.
This makes a total of twenty-nine dollars.
But we started with thirty. What hap-
pened to the other dollar?
While visiting a friend of ours who
lives in the International Center, we no-
ticed a few of the papers on his desk.
All of these, of course, were written in
his native language, Turkish. One par-
ticular problem aroused our curiosity.
Since we are not familiar with the Turkish
numbers, we copied down the problem re-
placing each different symbol with a letter
of fhe English alphabet. Here is what
the problem looked like then.

Last week one of the boys across the
hall told us of a question which was on a
math bluebook of his. (At least he claims
it was.) If there are more trees in the
world than there are leaves on any one
tree, prove that there are at least two
trees somewhere in the world which have
the same number of leaves. The answer
was so obvious that we almost didn't see
it.
A naval architecture student from the
third floor dropped down to our room re-
cently and presented us with this pet
problem of one of his professors. It goes
this way. A tramp steamer was sailing
across the Atlantic from Philadelphia to
Liverpool. Hanging from the stern was
a rope ladder with twelve rungs. At the
time in question the steamer was still
950 miles from Liverpool and was travel-
ing at a rate of fifteen miles per hour.
If the rungs of the ladder are thirteen
inches apart and the water is rising at the
rate of eleven inches per hour, how far
from Liverpool will the steamer be when
the water reaches the top of the ladder?
Let's try a quicky now. Some time ago
while we were sitting in a night club,
we happened to overhear this problem
being discussed at the next table. It seems
that they had two glasses of equal volume,
one filled with water and the other filled
with wine. First they took a teaspoonful
of water and transferred it to the wine
glass and mixed it thoroughly with the
wine. Then they took a teaspoonful of
this mixture and transferred it to the
water glass, again mixing it thoroughly.
Each time, of course, the composition of
the contents of each glass was changed
somewhat. The question upon which
they could not agree was this: "After an
even number of such transfers, what is the
ratio of the amount of water carried to
the wine glass to the amount of wine car-
ried to the water glass?"
We are reminded by a recent newspaper
article of the farmer whose two sons were
both very proud of their horses. The
farmer eventually got very tired of their
continual bragging. When he died, it was
discovered that he had made his will out
such that the son with the slower horse
would inherit all the property. Who had
the slower horse was to be decided by a
race to a nearby town and back. On the
way into town both sons rode their horses
just about as slowly as was possible. Upon
reaching town they stopped in at the bar
for a drink before starting back. While
there they told the bartender the situa-
tion. He thought for several minutes be-
fore whispering something in their ears.
Immediately both men rose, raced for the
horses, and galloped toward the farm at
top speed. We are wondering what it
was that the bartender told them.
Susie Co-ed: "Darling, if I didn't wear
these nice clothes, would you still think
I'm beautiful?"
Chem. Eng.: "Let's decide that ques-
tion right now."

before?"

More Powerful G.E. Jet
The General Electric Company has an-
nounced a new turbojet engine which is
far more powerful than the company's
present battle-tested jets, although the
same frame size.
Destined for advanced military air-
craft, the engine was described as "an
important step in the world race for jet
supremacy."
The turbojet was introduced at the
annual convention of the Aviation Writ-
ers Association in New York. The com-
pany said it incorporates all the best fea-
tures of the famed J-47 engine as proved
in thousands of hours of service, plus the
results of imaginative engineering think-
ing supported by advanced research and
testing. The current J-47 is the power-
plant for such top Air Force planes as the
North American F-86 "Sabre" fighter
and the six-jet Boeing B-47 "Stratojet"
bomber.
Although its power could not be re-
vealed, it puts out far more thrust than the
present J-47 which is rated in excess of
5,200 pounds. (Turbojet power is rated
in pounds of thrust, or driving force, ex-
erted.)
General Electric Vice President C. H.
Lang cited the engine "as an outstanding
example of the progress of the turbojet
art."
"It is an important step in the world
race for jet supremacy," Mr. Lang said.
"Only three years ago, in this same place
and before this same group, we first
showed our J-47 engine. We come to you
now with an engine the same frame size
as the J-47 but with a thrust output so
much greater that it isn't even in the
same class. Research, engineering and
manufacturing achievements since then
have made the difference."
Designated the J-47-GE-21, the turbojet
is the first of the company's "Advanced
J-47" series to be announced.
Neil Burgess, Jr., assistant manager of
engineering of the G-E Aircraft Gas Tur-
bine Divisions, said the "21" is an "all
weather" engine with anti-icing features
and high altitude starting characteristics.
It may be equipped for either water alco-
hol injection or afterburning for greatly
added thrust power for short periods. A
tailpipe variable jet nozzle may be added
to obtain maximum efficiency.
Burgess described the Advanced J-47
as "a product of engineering, forward-
looking development and research."

"New GE Jet Engine."

"These are the three basic tools which
gave us more thrust than we have achieved
previously in a given amount of space,
plus the added benefit of lower fuel con-
sumption," Burgess noted.
He said the company is also working
on other new engines including the XJ-53
which cannot be further identified.
Burgess told the writers that the Ad-
vanced J-47:
1. Was developed in record time—18
months from the time drawings were
under way until 50-hour tests were com-
pleted.
2. Was designed for best performance
compatible with simplicity, reliability and
producibility.
3. Combines new designs with battle-
tested features of the present J-47.
4. Has a low rate of fuel consumption.
The engine has a so-called "cannular"
type combustion system consisting of a
single combustion space containing in-
dividual "cans." Some accessories, housed
in the nose in current production engines,
have been placed underneath to provide
a greater air inlet area to the compressor.
The compressor—which forces air in great
quantities to the combustion chambers—
combines high air flow, high pressure ra-
tios and high efficiency with a minimum
number of stages.
The company considered development

What's cooking in the seething, roaring fire of this electric
arc furnace?
The fingers? No! They represent what's doing the
cooking.
WHITE-HOT INFERNO-In the actual furnace the fingers
are giant rods of carbon or graphite, called electrodes, that
carrv the heat-creating electricity. Carbon and graphite are
the onlv materials that can do this and stand up under the
terrific temperatures of 6,000 degrees or more.
In carbon arc furnaces, allov metals used in producing
stainless steel are separated from their ores. Similar fur-
naces are used to make other tough and hard varieties of
fine steels for automobiles, airplanes and many other famil-
iar products.
SERVES YOU MANY WAYS-But steel making is only
one important wav in which carbon and graphite serve you.
Motion picture screens are illuminated by the brilliant light
of the carbon arc. Calcium carbide, the source of many
modern plastics, textiles and chemicals is an electric fur-
nace product. Without carbon we wouldn't have depend-
able, long-life dry batteries for flashlights, radios and hear-
ing aids.

This picture of the installation shows the main parts of the tunnel. They are, from
left to right, the storage bag, the turbulence screens, the nozzle section,
the diffuser, and the vacuum tank. The control panel is at the right.
equipment is electrically operated from the
control panel. At the present time a re-
movable light tube is used to enclose the
entire light beam, in order to improve the
quality of the higher Mach number
Schlieren pictures.
The original balance system consisting
essentially of cantilevered beams with
electric strain gages mounted near the
base proved to have inherent difficulties.
A balanced diaphragm seal was developed
and installed in the windshield which
with other changes, made the pressure box
unnecessary. The system was supplement-
ed with an internal balance system which
consists of the measurement of normal
forces and moments by strain gages
mounted in the model sting. The rear
portion of the sting is ball bearing mount-
ed in a track which allows freedom of
motion in the axial direction only. Axial
force is measured by strain gages mounted
on a compression ring which restrains the
axial motion. The internal system is
used almost exclusively now.
With advanced experimentation and
further development of supersonic
theories, various changes in the tunnel
will be made. One practical change will
be rhe replacement of the storage bag by
a permanent structure, thus eliminating
the problem of having a permeable con-
tainer for the air supply. A four inch by
four ir.ch tunnel will be added to test a
new nozzle design in the next year.
The present facilities are used for test
programs by the Air Force and private
concerns as well as for university research
projects. Test program costs range from
three hundred to eight hundred dollars
per day depending upon the number and
type of tests run and the model set-up re-
quired. Considering the present value of
the wind tunnel, it is interesting to note
that the initial cost of the entire project
was comparatively small due chiefly to the
use of surplus materials and ingenious de-
sign. One of the most valuable contribu-
tions of an installation of this type is the
supersonic flow problems in all fields of
engineering can be solved economically
with greater ease and accuracy.

CONFERENCE IN THE CLOUDS

Among the undergraduates on anv college campus, vou'll find
the talk reaching up to the clouds. And once in a while —in a class-
room, around a study table, or even in a bull session — a really big
idea is born.
Big ideas come, too, from the men and women in laboratories,
business offices, shops. But often these professionals are exploring
a path first glimpsed in college.
How do we know? Because of the many college people who
have come into the Bell System, where bis ideas and a lot of dreams
have taken their place in progress. 1 he human voice, carried along
a wire, first across a town, then a state, a nation, and now the world.
Music and pictures and things happening delivered into cities and
hamlets all across the land by radio and television networks.
We're always looking for the men and women who get big
ideas — whether they're about people, or machines, or ways of doing
things. It's the only way the Bell System can keep on giving this
country the best telephone service in the world.

sand or grit blasting, knurling or thread-
ing, electric bonding, or by surface coat-
ing with special spray-metal materials.
Blasting is used primarily in preparing
large surfaces being sprayed for corro-
sion prevention. Rough threading is the
oldest method of mechanically preparing
shafts. It is a rather unsatisfactory method
since its success depends not only on the
ability of the base material to tear up suf-
ficiently to provide good bonding, but also
upon the individual operator's conception
of the proper degree of roughness. The
Dennison Method of Shaft Preparation
offers an improvement over the latter. It
consists of cutting 60° V-threads in the
shaft followed by knurling the ropes of
the threads. This provides a series of
regularly spaced hooks anchorages which
are very receptive to the application as
sprayed metal.
Oftentimes it is not possible to prepare
the surface by any of the preceding meth-
ods, especially if the material is extremely
hard. By means of stroking these sur-
faces with electrical resistance heated
electrodes (Fuse-Bond Process), a suitable-
bonding surface can be built. As the
electrodes are applied to the base they
simultaneously explode into a foam and
fuse to the base metal. This results in an
extremely rough, porous structure com-
parable to that of frozen soapsuds.
Conventional roughening procedures
also can be eliminated thru the utilization
of a recently developed molybdenum-al-
loy sprayed under-coat. A light, fast
roughening cut or sand blast is all that is
necessary to clean the surface. Although
the cost of the metal itself is high, a coat-
ing of .0015-.002" is sufficient to provide
a good bonding surface, and it has the
compensating advantages of lessening
preparation time and in resulting in a
smoother final coating which would re-
quire less finishing.
In finishing metallized surfaces it is
essential that the machinist be familiar
with the properties of sprayed metal. Be-
cause of the lamellar structure of the coat-
ing, the tool has a tendency to tear par-
ticles loose rather than to cut or shear
them. The machinist unfamiliar with
sprayed metals will unconsciously grind
and set his tool as he would for the ma-
terial in unsprayed form. Crumbly chips
result and the surface appears very por-
ous. With a little experimentation in tool
setting and cutter clearance, however,
good results can be secured. The use of

carboloy tools is ideal 'for cutting the
abrasive sprayed metals and allows faster
machining speeds and better finishes with
many materials. Even with carboloy tools,
however, it is often very difficult to main-
tain a diameter on long cuts made on the
harder materials.
Wet grinding is recommended over dry
grinding for sprayed materials. Since all
sprayed metals tend to "load" the wheels,
a relatively coarse grained, low bond
strength wheel is recommended in order
that it can break down more easily and
counteract the "loading" tendency.
As mentioned before, the structure of
sprayed metal coatings consists of a mass
of flattened out globules somewhat like
fish scales bonded together by a combina-
tion of oxide cementation and mechanical
interlocking. This has a significant effect
upon the various properties of the metal.
Due to the oxide inclusions and the pres-
ence of voids within the structure, the
density of the sprayed metal is somewhat
lower than that of the material in un-
sprayed (wire) form. The specific gravi-
ties of metallized coatings, as compared to
the original wire, varieties from 82.5'r

aluminum. The resulting structure is
therefore rather porous. This property is
of -.onsiderable advantage in bearing ap-
plications as it allows the absorption of
oil which gives the bearing a self-lubri-
cating quality very similar to powdered
metal materials. In one laboratory test a
metallized shaft running at 261 r.p.m.
with a bearing load of 300 p.s.i. ran for
23 hours after external lubrication was re-
moved without seizing, while a hardened
steel shaft under the same conditions
seized only 3 hours after lubrication
had been removed. Porosity in bearings
has the additional advantage of provid-
ing space for metal particles dislodged in
the wearing-in period which would other-
wise possibly score the bearing journal.
In corrosion preventative coatings,
however, porosity is undesirable. Just as
the sprayed metal absorbs lubricants as in
the case of bearings it also absorbs corro-
sive liquids and gases and allows them to
attack the base metal. This disadvantage-
can be overcome by one of several meth-
ods. If a sufficent number of coatings
are applied, any pores that might occur in
a single coating will be sealed gradually.

Mr. Burrows graduated from the Uni-
versity of Michigan in 1917 in marine
engineering and naval architecture. For
the next two years he was in the naval
air service. Before joining Humble in
1921 he was with Saginaw Shipbuilding
Company, Pan American Petroleum and
Transport Company, and Standard Oil of
New Jersey. He is a member of the So-
ciety of Naval Architects and Marine
Engineers; World Trade Association; and
other groups. Mr. Burrows is the director

"Whoever told that guy he was a prof?
He just doesn't know how to teach the
stuff. Everybody hates him. Every time
he tries to explain something he digresses
so much that no one can understand what
he's talking about. I think he ought to
quit teaching and go back to the farm."
"Yeah—I flunked too."
It was a night made for love and a
pretty but prim little school teacher had
accepted a young man's invitation for a
drive in his car. Moonlight and the soft
summer breeze proved too much for her
scruples and . . . well . . . she let him kiss
her.
Instantly she was in tears on his should-
er. "Oh, Oh!" she wailed. "How can
I ever face those innocent little children
tomorrow, with two black marks against
me?"
"Whaddya mean, two black marks
asked the young man.
She snuggled closer. "Why . . .
you'ie going to kiss me again, aren't
you?"

He: "Who spilled mustard on my

She: "Oh, John! How could you? This
is lemon pie."

Ihree dots
that opened a new era!
Three dots in Morse Code—sent from
England and received by Marconi in
Newfoundland— proved that wireless
signals could span the Atlantic.
When Marconi, on December 12, 1901,
heard a "3-dot" radio signal —the letter
"S" in Morse Code —across 1,800 miles of
sea, it was an experimental triumph that
opened a new era in communications.
Before this historic event, wireless teleg-
raphy had been limited primarily to commu-
nications between the shore and ships at sea.
Marconi's success, however, was the fore-
runner of many other developments which
led eventually to RCA world-wide radio-
telegraph service that now operates more
than 80 direct circuits to 67 countries.
As radio progressed, its usefulness was ex-
panded by invention and development of the
electron tube, the harnessing of short waves
which made world-wide transmission a reality,
and the automatic transmission and reception
of messages at high speed.
Radio, with its magic of sjwkcn words and music
broadcast over the world . . . television, the miracle
of pictures in motion transmitted through the air . . ,
these mediums of modem communications have
added notable links in the chain of electronic ad-
vances first forged in 1901 from the mere sound
of three dots.

Dear Archy,
Today I fell in love with a lower lip. If that sounds pecu-
liar let me tell you about it.
I was strolling casually across the campus ,lost in a maze of
earthbound thoughts when suddenly, I was shocked into con-
sciousness as my eyes involuntarily focused upon a passing
co-ed's lower lip. Previously, the female lower lip, taken by
itself, had seemed a rather unobtrusive thing, performing all
sorts of essential functions and yet demanding no special
attention other than the application of a little colored grease
before being carried out into the world of men. This lower
lip, however, was anything but unobtrusive. Its effect on me
was somewhat like several rapid slaps across the face and a
solid boot to the sit-piece. I am afraid that before I realized
how undignified it was to be slapped around by a lower lip,
I was very guilty of the common crudity known as the gawk.
If you are wondering about my sanity, Arch, let me tell you
about this lip.
It was warmly coated in a rich hue, very near to that which
might be seen if one looked at the sun through a glass of
port wine. It was leading its owner by a considerable distance,
not charging ahead as to fulfill a mission but just gently
leading, radiating an aura of love and affection and laying
a carpet of warmth for its owner to pass over. The lip was not
large. It was, if anything, petite. It was curved ever so grace-
fully and it hung with just the right amount of gelatin-like
consistency. It was neither bobbing nor swaying but it gave
me the feeling that it could very easily move across the face
much like a small swell on a calm sea.
Have you ever noticed Arch, how well some women are
able to use their lower lips to advantage? A well co-ordinated
girl can, merely by curling and crimping it and allowing it to
sag ever so slightly at the proper time, get some fantastic effects.
With sufficient practice a really agile girl could express her-
self almost entirely with her lower lip. One very special girl
that I know that can keep me entertained all evening just by
talking slowly. I am absorbed by that wonderful lip, ebbing
and flowing, dipping and rolling, with its soft maroon coat-
ing glistening warmly all the while. It's true that at times I
have felt a strong urge to drop pennies and other small trin-
kets into it but that is merely a holdover from my childhood
squirrel-watching days.
There are those, Arch, who would stubbornly maintain that
even the most attractive lower lip is a thing to be scorned, to
be chewed, and cursed with an existence of moistening stamps
and cleaning artichoke leaves but alas, the reactionaries are
ever with us. I felt the warmth of the lower lip today and I am
sure that I am not the first. Perhaps, Arch, I have discovered
a new medium of beauty.
Your pal,
Smokey

. Knowledge is a source of power but does not in itself give
direction to its power. The Engineer has knowledge and there-
fore power, but, he, as an individual practitioner, gives direc-
tion to this power and knowledge by applying it to the prob-
lem at hand. He therefore has responsibility not only for the
solution of the immediate problem, but also for the conse-
quences of his direction of this power.
Our present knowledge evolved from the mass of learning
that was passed on from the Phoenicians, Hebrews, Greeks,
Romans and Orientals. It was scattered and almost lost during
the ages that barbarians swept across Europe, during the break-
ing up of the Mediterranean cultures. It was saved in good
part by the monks and inhabitants of monasteries who labori-
ously copied what they found, or wrote down the information
gathered from travelers coming in from other lands, so that
this culture seeped back into Europe not from the north but
from the south through Spain and Italy. Soon after began the
period of the Renaissance, beginning in the southern countries
in closest contact with Mediterranean shipping ports and
gradually spreading back to the bazaars of the Netherlands,
France and Germany. The information spread and grew in
direct proportion to the new towns. The Crusades had their
part, for it was in religious centers and church schools and
the new universities, that grew fast in this period, that the
information became available to more people. It was then evi-
dent that some system was needed to catalog and classify this
knowledge and thus was born the scientific system that we
know, its roots going back to Aristotle, Copernicus and
Descartes.
Throughout all time practitioners of little or great scientific
attainments have applied their knowledge and skills to im-
mediately practicable ends, whose results were beneficial or
detrimental to the people around them, depending upon the
direction in which this knowledge was used. Thus the dif-
ference between the scientist and the practitioner has always
been with us. The practicing engineer has a broad historical
background that began even before Roman engineers (although
perhaps not so called) left evidences of their work over
almost all the face of western Europe and North Africa before
and at the beginning of the Christian era. The scientific sys-
tem and the age of industrial revolution that took the factory
out of homes and small shops and put it into large factories
representing large investment of capital and masses of equip-
ment was a development of the practicing engineer and had
most important consequences in social change. For it was
invention of basic engineering tools and mechanical power that
created such things as the steam engine, the cotton gin, the
plane screw, and electrical equipment.
The ethical background of the engineer paralleled the his-
torical evolution of the profession. And the point of these ob-
servations is to emphasize the fact that as the complexity ot
the information, systems, and organizations increased, so in-
creased the responsibility of the engineer. The analogy of the
medical profession is a pertinent one.
The doctor like the engineer is a practitioner, a thought
directly reflected by the expression that the doctor "practices"
medicine. His badge is the black bag he carries—the badge
of the engineer is his slide rule. The doctor uses scientific
analytical knowledge along with clinical skills to alleviate pain
and save life. The engineer unfortunately does not always
have as clear-cut an objective and quite frequently the objec-
tive is destructive. For, with the addition of whole new fields
of endeavor in science comes the added opportunity of sowing
more destruction of a highly potent character and with it new
ethical problems for engineers as practitioners. Because the
responsibility is the engineer's, he applies the knowledge hand-
ed to him by the scientists and therefore must take the re-
sponsibility that comes with each new application. The scientist
has the responsibility of accurately and fully observing and
reporting the results of his search for knowledge and to sys-
tematize or correlate the available knowledge to serve as a basis
for further scientific research. The practicing medical doctor
uses the results of the scientist with his own clinical skills in
alleviating suffering and administering to the sick. His re-
sponsibility includes giving direction to the power in his
knowledge. The practicing doctor has a much more important
responsibility than being accurately informed on the medical
sciences, he is primarily responsible for the constructive ap-
plication of this knowledge to the benefit of his patient. The
recognition and acceptance of this responsibility by the medi-
cal profession is essential in the acceptance of the practicing
medical doctor as a professional man. Likewise, the engineer
has the responsibility of directing the power of knowledge
and he cannot evade this responsibility when final judgment is
rendered. His recognition and acceptance of the responsi-
bility of the consequences of his activities is essential in the
acceptance of the engineer as a professional man.
There is one important difference between the doctor and

quences of his mistake while the engineer leaves a monument
to his errors; and this monument may now be the destruction
of a whole city.

of his acts by saying he has simply done what someone else-

PROBLEM—You are designing a cabinet-type oil
heater. The oil and air metering valve has to be
placed at the bottom. You now want to provide a
manual control for the valve located on the cabinet
front where it is easy to see and to operate. How
would you do it?
THE SIMPLE ANSWER—Use an S.S.White remote
control flexible shaft to connect the dial to the valve
or to a rod running to the valve. The latter method
was used in the heater illustrated below. The flexible
shaft will provide smooth, sensitive control and will
allow you to put the dial anywhere you want it.
This is just one of hun-
dreds of power drive and
remote control problems
to which S.S.White flex-
ible shafts are the simple
answer. That's why every
engineer should be fa-
miliar with the range and
scope of these "Metal
Muscles"* for mechani-
cal bodies.

A finely atomized coating .03" thick is
usually sufficient for this purpose. It is
also possible to seal the pores by mechani-
cal working. With the softer metals, wire
brushing will do the job but the harder
metals like copper alloys and steel require
grinding and polishing. In addition to
these methods, the pores can be filled with
materials such as lacquer to prevent ab-
sorption.
A true measure of hardness of sprayed
metal coatings is difficult to obtain due to
its porosity but is, nevertheless, an im-
portant factor in bearing considerations.
When measured by Rockwell and Brinell
testers, most sprayed metals appear slightly
softer than the same metals in the cast
state, due to the crushing of the particles
into the voids. On the other hand, micro-
hardness tests measuring the hardness of
the individual particles give decidedly
higher values of hardness than in the cast
condition. The amount and nature of the
oxides formed has a considerable influence
on the hardness of the sprayed coating.
Consequently, metals which form hard,
dense, tenacious oxides during spraying
show high hardness values. In the case of
low carbon steel, for example, which has
a normal hardness of Rb 65-80, the metal
may have a hardness as high as Rb 95-100
after spraying. Variations of spray techni-
que have a definite effect on hardness, as it
does on other properties. Low velocities
resulting from low air pressures, high
acetylene-oxygen ratios, or too great a dis-
tance from gun to work will increase the
porosity of the coating and thereby lower
the hardness.
In discussing the strength of metallized
structures it is important to understand
that, because of their lamellar structures,
the coatings are from 8 to 10 times
stronger parallel to the laminations than
in a perpendicular direction. Again, the
tensile strengths of sprayed metal coatings
can vary as much as 25r/r due to differ-
ences in spraying technique. Placing the
gun too close to the work results in more
of the globules arriving at the surface in
a molten state, increases contraction, and
causes a greater tendency to crack. Con-
versely, if the gun is too far from the
piece a very brittle structure will result.
Increases in gas and air pressures seem
to increase the strength somewhat, but the
gas-oxygen ratio has little effect. Stresses
are apparently greater on work of large
diameters and sprayed materials having
a higher contraction rate because of
higher stresses resulting from more
shrinkage. Failure of metallized coatings
usually occur first in shearing of the bond
from shrinkage of the sprayed layer and
then finally fail in tension. It is therefore
ultimately important to achieve a good
bond by proper surface preparation and
assuring that the surface is absolutely free
from foreign materials before spraying.
To minimize the effects of contraction,
pre-heating of the parts followed by air
cooling is sometimes employed with good
results. Since elongation and bond
strengths of metallized coatings is rather
low, metallizing can not be used success-
fully in applications where the part is sub-
ject to direct impact in service. For the
same reason, it is not satisfactory where
rolling occurs such as with wheel rims,
rollers, and ball races.

The range of properties obtainable with
metallizing is very extensive and the va-
riety of metals that can be sprayed is un-
limited. Some materials which would be
rather brittle in wire form are available as
a powder imbedded in a flexible plastic
base so that they can be used in an ordin-
ary wire spraying gun. The plastic volati-
lizes during spraying and the metal par-
ticles combine on contact. Very brittle
materials such as stellite can be sprayed
successfully from a cast rod form. In some
instances it is desirable to employ multiple-
coatings of different materials to secure
better bonding, etc. Of course, the choice
of the best metal for a specific applica-
tion would depend upon the properties
necessary to do the job and, since the
characteristics of metals usually change
considerably after spraying, the final selec-
tion of the material or combination of
materials can best be made from experi-
ence.
The principle applications of metalliz-
ing of particular interest are in the fields
of corrosion prevention and the reclama-
tion of worn or mis-machined parts. For
corrosion prevention zinc and aluminum
are the materials most commonly used.
Both of these materials are anodic to iron
and therefore protect ferrous materials
electrochemically. Galvanizing has often
been used where paint would fail rapidly,
but the effectiveness of this method is
limited by the thickness of metal that can
be applied and by the galvanizing tank
size. Metallizing is not limited in either
of these respects. Any thickness coat-
ing can be applied and any structure can
be treated regardless of size or location.
Under many conditions pure aluminum
provides better protection than zinc. This
is especially true in heavy industrial at-
mosphere since aluminum is more resis-
tant to sulphurous gases than zinc. In
addition, aluminum provides a superior
base for paint. However, aluminum re-
quires a more thorough surface prepara-
tion and therefore is not used unless the
better properties of aluminum are needed.
All sprayed metals, incidentally, provide
an excellent base for paint due to their
porous nature. The paint can be added
either for decorative purposes or for addi-
tional protection in which case a thinner
sprayed coating can be used.
Entire steel building frames have been
metallized to prevent rusting. Such an
undertaking requires a rather high initial
investment, but is apparently found eco-
nomical in the long run by eliminating
painting cost (which requires considerable-
surface preparation), maintenance, and
the removal of the necessity of including
corrosion safety factors in design.
The Blaw-Knox Company made an in-
teresting application of metallizing in pro-
tecting the training gear shroud of the
Bofors gun they were manufacturing. Al-
though the shroud offers no particular
wear problems, it is subjected to salt
water corrosion in service. Formerly made
of bronze, a 280 pound malleable iron
casting was substituted and was sprayed
with zinc to protect against corrosion.
This saved considerable amounts of stra-
tegic materials and the shrouds were pro-
duced at a lower cost.

"Explosion Chamber"
Explosion Chamber
When engineers from the United States
Bureau of Mines seek to determine the
safety factor of electrical equipment used
in the nation's coal mines, they simply
"explode" it in an aluminum test cham-
ber. The Martian-looking gallery shown
here is installed at the Bureau's Central
Experiment Station in Pittsburgh and was
fabricated from heavy-gage Alcoa Alum-
inum sheet by the Joy Manufacturing
Company in the same city. All types of
electric motors are placed in the chamber.
Its atmosphere is highly charged with ex-
plosive gases. Then a spark plug auto-
matically sets off an explosion in the
specific part being tested.
Now if the blast is limited to the part
itself, the equipment passes with flying
colors (after ten continuously successful
tests, that is). If the explosion is general,
however, the "explosion-proof" rating is
withheld. Diaphragms on the hood re-
lease explosions without injury to tech-
nicians who peer through shatterproof
windows near the top of the chamber.

is attached to a cylinder or other similar
device which travels at high speed with the
missile throughout the length of the ramp.
The power needed to accelerate the missile
and catapult carriage may be supplied by
hydraulic means or generated by gas or
steam pressure resulting from the de-
composition of certain chemicals.
Some guided missiles need no ground
launching ramp at all, but instead are
taken into the air by a piloted aircraft,
aimed at a target and released. Still other
missiles such as the German V-2, need
no take-off apparatus other than a short
platform that can be rotated, and which
raises the missile off the ground.
The control of the robot bomb is taken
care of by a group of devices generally
called the "automatic pilot." The "auto-
matic pilot" takes care of all the flying
operations needed to get the bomb to the
target and is a very complicated piece of
equipment. Briefly, it is composed of one
or more gyroscopes, servo-motors, and
electronic devices, interconnected and
operating as one. For example, during the
steering operation, the gyroscope senses
the bombs' flying behavior. When this
isn't correct, commands are sent, by
means of the electronic unit, to the servo-
motors which move the external control
surfaces for correcting the bomb's flight
path. Thus, a robot bomb can be con-
trolled if the "automatic pilot" can be
controlled.
This brings us to the last major unit,
the guidance system itself. There are
several different guidance systems in use,
and several more in various stages of de-
velopment. They are as follows: Pre-
Set, Command, Beam-Riding, Homing,
Television and Stars.
Pre-Set guidance is perhaps the simp-
lest system. It relies almost entirely on
the function of the "automatic pilot" for
bringing the missile to a pre-selected goal.
A magnetic compass, an altimeter sensi-
tive to air pressure, and a unit for meas-
uring the distance to be flown, called an
air-log, are some auxiliary items. The air
speed, altitude, range, flight path and
other flying habits are taken care of by
the aforementioned portions of the Pre-
Set guidance equipment. These are all ad-
justed, for proper operation in flight, just
before launching.
The Command guidance system utilizes
a ground station from which the oper-
ator follows both the missile and the
GUIDED MISSILES

target by means of a combination of
higher-power telescopic devices, and radio
or radar impulses. Flight data on the
missile and the target are made available
to the operator by means of a lightning
swift computer. Radio commands based
on the computations are sent by the
operator to the missile, which, with its
"automatic pilot" changes its course as
requested in order to hit the target. An-
other form of this system eliminates the
need for optical and computer equipment.
The remote control operator may have
his radio guidance transmitter either at
a ground station or aboard a mother plane
and fly his missile from these locations.
He relies solely on his own vision for
steering it either to a particular object or
through some maneuver.
The third system, Beam-Riding, is a
new development being concentrated on
at the moment. A radar beam is flashed
heavenward and the missile automatically
rides this path to its objective. Electronic
equipment, carried within the robot
vehicle, enables it to detect any deviation
from this invisible path and together
with the "automatic pilot", keeps it on
the correct course.
The Homing guidance system is the
most automatic and probably the most
complicated of those systems mentioned.
Radar and elements highly sensitive to
heat and light emanations from a target
are the main devices. In radar, the missile
follows a path of radar impulses bounc-
ing off the target; signals which have
been sent out either from a mother plane,
a ground target, or from a radar unit in
the missile itself. Closely hooked up with
the "automatic pilot", this equipment is
capable of bringing the missile to its tar-
get regardless of any evasive actions used.
Other methods of Homing work with de-
vices which are supersensitive to heat and
light radiations. Installed in the nose of
a missile, these too can bring the missle
to its objective without any outside con-
trol assistance.
There are three kinds of missiles using
Homing. They are: passive seekers, active
seekers and hybrids (semi-active seekers.)
A passive seeker picks up emanations
issuing from the target and steers toward
it. An active seeker will send out its
own radar impulses and will steer toward
anything solid enough to bounce them
back. A hybrid will work with a little
more complexity. A ground transmitter
will illuminate the target with powerful
radio waves. These waves, reflected from
the target, will be picked up by the on-
coming missile and will guide it toward
the target.
The fifth system of guidance works by
employing in the nose of the missile, a
television camera which scans the ground
ahead. The picture passes over a micro-
wave beam to a mother plane. In the
cockpit, the bombardier can watch a screen
and see what the missile sees. If the mis-
sile is off course (determined by a map)
he can give it radio hints that will point
it toward the target.
The last kind of guidance mentioned is
Star guidance. This system is still in the
early stages of development and is very
complicated. According to this system, the
missile will fly by night and will have
little telescopes to pick out certain stars.
Photo-sensitive tubes then note the posi-
tion of the stars. This information, pro-
cessed by a complicated electronic
"brain", tells the missile the course it is
following over the earth. Then, the
missile can correct its own course by the
"automatic pilot" and arrive at its desti-
nation.
Now for a brief survey of the different
types of guided missiles. The United
States Armed Forces have classified the
airborne guided missiles into four main
groups: surface-to-surface (SSM), surface-
to-air (SAM), air-to-air (AAM), and
air-to-surface (ASM).
The surface-to-surface type of guided
missile will be the biggest of the various
types and will be launched from the
ground against some other ground target.
They will range from artillery rockets to
large intercontinental monsters which de-
signers say are in danger of "running out
of earth". They will have various guid-
ance systems. If they are directed against
a visible target they will have Command
guidance. If they are directed against an
invisible target whose position is known
on a map, they will ride a radio beam to
a point near the target and then switch to
Homing guidance. If the target is be-
yond sight, they will use Star guidance to
approach the target and then use Homing.
The surface-to-air type of guided mis-
siles will be launched from the ground and
are designed to bring down enemy air-
craft. They are intended to replace pilot-
ed interceptors and anti-aircraft artillery.
They will be relatively small, not more
than fifteen feet long, and will be launch-

ed from a kind of gunmount. They will
be guided by three different systems as
the situation demands, either Beam-Rid-
ing, Command, or Homing.
Air-to-air missiles will be launched
from one plane against another. They
will not be as large as surface-to-air mis-
siles and they will carry less fuel because
of less climbing. They will resemble con-
ventional aircraft rockets but will be
longer and of greater diameter. They
will eventually replace standard aircraft
armament and will be guided by Hom-
ing.
Air-to-surface missiles will be launch-
ed from a plane against a ground target.
They will be "airplanes" powered by
rocket motors and capable of attaining
speeds up to two thousand miles per hour.
They can be made large enough to carry
atomic bombs and therefore their ac-
curacy need not be "pinpoint." They will
be guided by the Television spstem.
There have been various types of mis-
siles developed in recent years which fall
into the four categories previously men-
tioned. An example of a surface-to-air
(Continued from page 34)
guided missile is the Navy's Viking rocket.
It is 45 feet in length but has an extreme-
ly narrow body diameter. It weighs five
tons when fully loaded with fuel and other
equipment. It is stabilized by movable
external tail fins and carbon exhaust
vanes that act on the rocket exhaust.
A surface-to-air missile is the Lark.
It has a streamlined fusilage, thicker than
a man and fourteen feet long, with four
stubby wings sticking out perpendicular
to each other. A similar cross shaped tail
is set at a 45° angle to the wings. Hinged
panels on the wings control steering;
those on the tail control climbing and
dive. Bank and roll are controlled by re-
tractable aelerons that extend from the
wings when needed. It is guided by a
Homing system placed in the nose.
The Firebird is an air-to-air guided
missile. It is 10 feet long and has two sets
of wing surfaces. The main group, located
midway between nose and tail, is in the
form of an "X". Two feet behind on the
stern end are cross shaped tail fins. Both
wing sets are made of plastic rather than
conventional aluminum-alloy sheeting.

The Firebird is carried under the belly of
a jet fighter and is guided by Homing.
It is exploded by a proximity fuse when
it nears the target.
An air-to-surface missile is the Gorgon
IV. It has a monoplane wing structure
fastened to the topside of a long slim
fuselage that is 22 feet long. The wing
span is 10 feet and the leading edges are
swept back. Movable panels ("spoilers")
are attached to the wings to provide lat-
eral stability. The tail assembly consists
merely of two small horizontal surfaces
shaped like the larger wings. It is entirely
of metal construction and is powered by
a ram-jet engine. It is guided by the Com-
mand system and by Homing.
It car. easily be seen that all these vari-
ous types of missiles are being designed
for war. They are being built to kill more
people faster and more efficiently than
would piloted aircraft. A person looking
at this situation could rightly ask, "What
is the sense of learning how to kill people
better?" The answer is that this is not the
only purpose of guided missiles. Not
many people know that guided missiles
are now being used to explore the upper
atmosphere, that there are rocket societies
founded on the idea of sending a missile
such as we now have, into outer space.
Right now there is a plan being developed
to design a missile that will circle the
earth continuously, a sort of man-made
satellite. After that, who knows what the
future will hold? Willy Ley, a well-known
rocket expert says that even now, with the
knowledge at hand, we could design a
rocket ship to the moon. No, though the
development of guided missiles may ap-
pear bad on the surface, there are a great
many important things that can result
from this work. The future history of the
world, especially in the next twenty years,
will probably be greatly affected by the
development of guided missiles.

Lionel uses Crucible Alnico in new
locomotive design
The Lionel Corporation, big name electrical toy manufacturer,
has pioneered in the design of miniature locomotives for
table-top railroading. One of the principal aims of this design
is to achieve the highest possible degree of adhesion between
the driving wheels and the track.
Lionel experimented with a conventional method of increas-
ing the traction (i.e. load up the driving axles with ballast
weights) . . . and then turned to magnetic materials.
Crucible alnico specialists were called in. Working in
close cooperation with Lionel engineers, the Lionel "Magne-
Traction" locomotive was born. As the name implies, "Magne-
Traction" utilizes magnetic attraction between powerful
Crucible alnico bar magnets placed in close proximity with
the wheels.
By varying the number and strength of the magnets,
almost any desired degree of adhesion can be obtained.
In laboratory tests a light-weight plastic "Scout" loco-
motive whose normal train load is 4 cars, was able, after
installation of proper magnets, to pull a train of 24 cars,
an improvement of 600%. A heavy miniature locomotive

pulled 28 cars instead of its usual load of 7 cars. Then
too, locomotives unable to start a normal 4 or 5 car
train on greater than 1 degree slope were able with the
special magnet assembly to pull them from a dead start
up a 5° slope, while the new twin-motor Lionel Pennsy
GG-1 scooted up a 15° slope (i.e. 37% grade) without
any apparent difficulty.
Crucible's part was twofold. Not only were Crucible
metallurgists and engineers active in the initial design,
but Crucible production experts precision cast these bar
magnets using plastic patterns. This is an innovation in
alnico magnet mass production. Commonly, alnico is
made in sand molds, and usually requires a great deal of
finishing, but with precision-cast alnico magnets expen-
sive machining is cut to a minimum.

mis-machined parts by metallizing is of
especial interest in these times of ma-
terial shortages. The Blaw-Knox Co.
utilized metal spraying in reclaiming mis-
machined Base Rings, Gears, and Stands
for ihe Bofors gun. Due to extremely
close tolerances, it frequently happened
that these parts were undercut on either
the mating or bearing surfaces. Although
repair by welding was found impossible,
these parts were successfully built up by
metallizing. By saving these parts from
the scrap heap, a saving of about $400
per piece was realized.
Chrysler engineers redesigned the Bo-
fors barrel spring recoil sleeve employing
metallizing. Original specifications called
for a 16 lb. casting of highly critical man-
ganese-bronze. In order to conserve this
material a steel sleeve sprayed with 2 lb.
of Tobin bronze was substituted which
did the job just as well and saved 14 lbs.
of bronze per gun.
Metallizing has already been used to a
considerable extent in the reclamation of
worn automotive parts. A New England
express company uses metallizing regu-
larly in the maintenance of a fleet of 400
vehicles. In addition to odd jobs, three
major repair operations including the
salvage of banjo rear axle housings, wheel
spindles and brake cams are done by
metallizing at considerable savings. They
claim a saving of approximately $250
per tear axle housing.
The Greyhound Corporation of Chi-
cago, Illinois, offers an example of the
large scale use of metallizing in automo-
tive maintenance. They utilize metal
spraying in the reclamation of some thirty
different parts of their G. M. Greyhound
buses such as pistons, crankshafts, cam-
shafts, transmission shafts, etc. An in-
teresting application is seen in their re-
clamation of a part known as the Trans-
mission Rear Case and Inserts Assembly.
Prior to metallizing they tried three other
methods of reclamation (oversized bear-
ings, new bearing inserts, and building
up by welding) without complete satis-
faction. The adoption of metallizing was
found not only to be more economical,
but the resulting part actually gave more
service than a new one. While the aver-
age life of new bearings was 120,000
miles, a large number of the metallized
bearings gave 200,000 to 300,000 miles of
service without undue wear. Briefly, the
procedure followed in metallizing the
METAL SPRAYING
(Continued rrom page 30)
cases consisted of: (1) bore out the diam-
eter l/g" oversize, (2) coarse thread the
inner surface, (3) spray the surface with
.10 Carbon steel, 3/32" thick, (4) rough
finish turn with Carboloy tool tips. The
preparation time was .9 hours, metallizing
1.3 hours, and the remachining and
finishing took 2 hours; the cost for ma-
terial and labor averaged $6.54.
During the last war a Baltimore auto-
mobile shop developed a production line
set-up for the reclamation of automotive
crankshafts. After preliminary grinding,
surface preparation was simplified by the
use of the Fuse-Bond process. The crank-
shaft was then put on a special type lathe
and the bearing surfaces were sprayed
with .80 Carbon steel. After metallizing,
the crankshaft was moved by an electric
hoist to a Van Norman grinder where it
was ground to the finished diameter. The
shafts so treated were found to hold up
as well as, if not better than, new shafts.
While only a few applications have
been mentioned, it is hoped that they are
sufficient to suggest others and provide
some conception of the latitude of the
process.
Conclusions and Recommendations:
It seems apparent that metallizing offers
a valuable tool which could be profitably
utilized in Ordnance maintenance and
manufacture of Bofors guns, but it is yet
to be used extensively in regular Ord-
nance maintenance. Metallizing particu-
larly lends itself to the field of automotive
maintenance of which several examples
have been cited.
In considering the possibility of using
metallizing for Ordnance maintenance
several limiting factors must be kept in
mind. First of all, due to the brittle and
porous nature of the material it cannot be
used successfully in places subject to di-
rect impact and shear forces such as gear
teeth, splines or for bonding two pieces
of material together. Similarly, it is un-
satisfactory for the repair of rolling sur-
faces like wheel rims and rollers. Metal-
lizing is not a cure-all and caution and
experience must be exercised in its appli-
cation. Secondly, metal spraying requires
a certain technique or "know-how" in its
application much as in the case of weld-
ing. Trained and experienced operators
are essential for consistent and successful
results. Finally, the resurfacing of worn
parts by metal spraying requires not only
skilled operators, but also some consider-
able amount of equipment. In the case of
crankshafts as noted previously, besides
the metal spraying gun with its various
accessories such as air tanks, wire stands,
pressure regulators, etc., it is also neces-
sary to be equipped with machines for
preparing the surface (lathes, Fuse-Bond)
and refinishing the sprayed part (lathes,
grinders). For the latter reason it would
probably not be feasible to incorporate
metal spraying procedures below the base
shop level. In addition to the necessary
equipment, metallizing specialists would
have to be trained and available for this
purpose.
However, besides providing a very sat-
isfactory method of reclaiming many worn
parts which would otherwise be scrapped,
repair of metallizing would be valuable in
alleviating the supply problem. Although
a quantity of equipment were once in-
stalled, as in a base shop in an overseas
theatre, it would no longer be required to
ship a replacement crankshaft or other
part from the zone of interior on every
occasion that one is needed. All that
would be needed would be a supply of
metallizing wire of the appropriate ma-
terial to recondition the part right in the
theatre of operations to equal the new
condition and in a very short time. In
addition, the manufacturing expense and
the use of critical materials and manpower
needed in the manufacture of replacement
parts would be lessened.
The application of metal spraying for
corrosion prevention also provides inter-
esting possibilities in the treatment of
Ordnance material subject to corrosive
conditions, as much as it is. Its value for
this purpose is rather obvious and the
best applications could be determined by
experimentation. Of course, this use
would probably be incorporated during
manufacture rather than in the theatre of
operations.
In any case, experimentation and de-
velopment work for specific applications
and procedures is necessary before final
adoption of metallizing as SOP. A
thorough economic analysis of the savings
involved is beyond the scope of this paper,
but its possibilities would seem to merit
further investigation.
Imagine the newspaper boy's embar-
rassment when he opened the wrong door
in the depot waiting room and yelled:
"Extra paper."

Students in the college of engineering
often are heard to say that the school
lacks unity, that there is little familiarity
among the students themselves, and that
certainly there is even less among the
students and the faculty. Some would ex-
plain this social shortcoming by citing the
immobility of the large number of stu-
dents on campus. This surely may be an
adequate explanation for the alienation of
the sixteen odd thousand that comprise the
on-campus student body, but it is in no
wise adequate for the relatively mobile
group of 1700 in our engineering school
this year. Dean Brown has urged the
engineering council to consider ways and
means to promote a more intimate atmo-
sphere within the confines of East and
West Emporiums of engineering facts.
It is to be agreed that outside numbers
are no deterrent in our case.
The engineers' dance, the Slide Rule
Ball, held each spring helps to promote
this feeling of closeness among the engi-
neering students. The dance was initiated
some years ago by the Michigan Technic.
Strange though it may seem to present-
day dance committees, the dance proceeds
in those early days helped to pay the
printing costs. That dance was actually
profitable to the extent that this added
revenue was vital to the continued opera-
tion of the magazine. But today the
worm has turned. It has been necessary
to supplement the ticket returns with al-
lotments from the surp.'us funds to finance
the dance in recent years. Last spring's
fiasco required a bit more than the normal
run on our reserve funds due to added
costs that grew out of the inspired antics
of a few upstart legal eagles. The finan-
cial success of this dance, and by this is
meant the least possible deficit, is de-
pendent upon the all-out support of the
student body.
Let's get behind this one proved and
traditional function that does promote the
elusive condition of closer personal con-
tact between students themselves and be-
tween faculty and students. Plans for this
year's dance are underway; if you have
suggestions for improvements or if you
wish to work on the dance committee,
please get in touch with the editor.

What happened to the program for the
engineering college student evaluation of
instructors and professors? Could it be
that adverse reaction and ridicule by the
faculty interred the infant plant? Or
is it due only to the failure of some group
to administer the program. If the latter is
the case, then it's about time some service
group, of which there are many perform-
ing no service at the moment, pick up the
ball and continue this plan. Even though
faculty objections to the plan because
student emotions enter into the grading
procedure may have some justification,
some constructive good must surely come
from it. Surely, the consciencious instruc-
tor should want to know if the student's
feel lie is presenting his subject effectively;
and if not, he should want to know what
steps might be taken to improve his pre-
sentation. What is more, it is heartening
to the especially good instructor to receive
commendation for his efforts. How about

HOW HAVE THEY MADE OUT IN
10 YEARS WITH GENERAL ELECTRIC?
Here are the results:
1. TRAINING. On the average, college graduates who
came with General Electric in 1941 have taken between
three and four Company-run training courses. Some have
taken as many as seven. These have included courses in
business management and accounting, in sales, manufac-
turing, and in many phases of engineering. Graduates re-
port that this training has been a big help in furthering
their careers. As one expressed it: "These courses are
essential to certain fields of endeavor—so essential I am
still signing up for additional courses."
Other comments: "These programs are not the purely
academic ones of school days. They are practical, interest-
ing, enable one to do a better job and enjoy it more."
"The G-E Sales Training Program was definitely instru-
mental in helping me find my present position." The train-
ing programs have been a very essential link between my
college training and my present work." "I wish I could
have known then how valuable these courses were going
to be later." "They confirmed my original opinion that
G.E. offered the best training for engineers."
2. EXPERIENCE. These graduates have had an average
of three different rotating assignments in various phases
of the Company's work. A typical example included assign-
ments in radio test, in motors and generators, and in the
industrial control development laboratory. Graduates ex-
press three main benefits derived from the G-E rotational
job programs:
a. They provided opportunities for deciding on a defi-
nite field of interest. Typical comment: "I didn't know
what kind of work I wanted to do. Rotating assignments
helped me make up my mind."
b. They complemented college training with practical
experience. "They helped me realize methods of manu-
facture and testing of different apparatus."
c. They provided valuable associations and contacts.
"Changing jobs five times brought me a variety of friends
and contacts I'm still grateful for."
3. PROGRESS AND ADVANCEMENT. 88 per cent
reported that they felt their progress in General Electric
has been satisfactory. Nine per cent described their progress
as "average, so-so," with three per cent reporting "un-
satisfactory."
Comments: "It's been no Horatio Alger success story,
but I feel pretty good about it." "If next 10 years have
the same trend, will be very happy." "Satisfactory and
entirely fair." "I don't know anyone on the outside who
has done any better in the same time." "Satisfactory.
I've been a G-E salesman, field engineer, and am now
group leader in a G-E design engineering department."
"I have felt like a kid in a candy story owned by his
father. There are lots of choices and his only problem is
to pick out what he likes best."

YOUR BEARING NOTEBOOK

For high-precision gear trains
TIMKEN bearings
are just the ticket
Shaft deflection or end-movement in a lathe gear train
causes inaccurate meshing of gears', excess wear and loss
of precision. So to insure shaft rigidity, leading machine
tool designers specify Timken® precision bearings for
spindles and other shafts. Due to their tapered construc-
tion, Timken tapered roller bearings carry thrust and
radial loads in any combination. Shafts are held in proper
alignment. Accurate meshing of gears is assured.
How to mount
tapered roller bearings
in a lathe head
The two single-row Timken precision bearings on the
spindle are mounted indirectly. On the spindle end, the
cones are pressed to the spindle shoulder. The bearing
on the opposite end is backed by a collar, gear and nut.
A two-row, indirectly mounted bearing is used on the
pulley end of the input shaft. The remaining Timken
bearings are directly mounted, and shim-adjusted.

[ SECOND OF A SERIES ]
Research and development work in
chemical engineering often overlap
at Du Pont, except where the re-
search is fundamental.
The chemical engineer occupied
with fundamental research is chiefly
concerned with basic studies of unit
operations and processes involving
reaction kinetics, thermodynamic
properties of fluids, high-pressure
techniques, equilibrium studies, heat
transfer and the like. Such studies
often lead to lower-cost manufactur-
ing processes. Some recent projects
in fundamental research have been:
1. A study of fluidized catalyst re-
action units including degree of fluid -
ation, temperature uniformity, cata-
lyst activity and life, and conversion
of feed gases.
2. Studies of the fundamental trans-
fer relations between phases, for in-
stance, gas and liquid, in reacting
materials.
Apart from the chemical engineers
engaged in fundamental research,
there are many groups working in
applied research and development.
In fact, this is the major part of the
chemical engineering work done at
Du Pont. Here are examples of the
literally hundreds of unusual prob-
lems they have solved:
1. Designing equipment for produc-
ing pure silicon at 1000°C. (Though
one of the starting compounds is
highly corrosive, only spectroscopic
traces of impurities can be tolerated.)
2. Developing a high-pressure liquid-
phase process to replace the stand-
ard dry method of producing sodium
azide formerly employed.
3. Designing a continuous flow, gas-
liquid reactor for use in making a
fiber intermediate under pressure.
4. Developing, from laboratory re-
search results, a process for large-
scale production of complex poly-
meric materials used in the manu-
facture of color photographic film.
These examples can only hint the
variety and originality of problems
constantly arising at Du Pont. They
indicate the challenge as well as the
broad opportunity awaiting the tal-
ents and ingenuity of the young
chemical engineer who wants a ca-
reer in research and development.

— TEN MORE
1\/T OST people around the University know that research contracts with vari-
ous governmental agencies—notably the Department of Defense—cur-
rently are being handled by University personnel in large doses. True, and all
very fine, but not the whole story by quite a long way.
Last month this Institute also contracted to begin or extend ten research
projects for various people and corporations in Industry. The scope of these in-
dustrial investigations is inspiring to read about; the eternal questions of "What
is best to do?" and "What shall we use?" and "How far shall we go?"
apparently are to be with us forever.
If YOU had a company and it faced such problems you would be tremend-
ously interested to know that there was a place for you to go for the solutions;
matters of most extreme importance depend on it.
As with all worthwhile things, the mere attempt
to solve such problems as constantly are brought
to the Institute inevitably involves responsibilities
of which we all are and must remain conscious.
Fully to realize these points is to acquire new
regard for the work in which the Institute and
the University are engaged. Our daily efforts are
important because all must contribute to the end
result.

James F. Hewson, E'05-'09
After more than thirty-four years of
service with Standard Oil Company (In-
diana), the last twelve as manager of the
purchasing department and chief purchas-
ing officer, James F. Hewson retired on
annuity.
A native of South Haven, Michigan,
Mr. Hewson studied civil engineering at
the University from 1905 to 1909 when
he entered the employ of the Pennsylvania
Railroad as an assistant in the engineering
corps of the eastern division out of Pitts-
burgh, Pennsylvania. He held this posi-
tion for one year and entered the engi-
neering department of the Pittsburgh Coal
Company, where he spent one year. He
was then employed as a bridge designer
of steel and concrete bridges for the Chi-
cago, Milwaukee, and Saint Paul railroad,
and spent about four years in this service
at Chicago. The next two years were
spent in government service as a struc-
tural engineer for the Interstate Com-
merce Commission.
Mr. Hewson began working for Stand-
ard Oil Company (Indiana) in 1917 in
the estimating branch of the engineering
department at the company's Whiting,
Indiana, refinery. Later he was trans-
ferred to the construction department. In
1920 he was transferred to the purchasing
department of the general office at Chi-
cago. In 1923 he became purchasing
agent and sixteen years later he was made
manager of the purchasing department.
Jay Bouwman, '3IE
Jay Bouwman is the new President of
the Cincinnati Chapter of the Ohio So-
ciety of Professional Engineers. He is

Division of the Warner Electric Brake
and Clutch Company of Beloit, Wiscon-
sin, to assume the position of Vice-Presi-
dent and Assistant Manager of Machinery
Electrification, Inc., of Worcester, Massa-
chusetts. During his stay at Warner, Mr.
Mason played an important part in de-
veloping the industrial type of clutch-
brake equipment which later led to the
formation of the Industrial Division at
the company. Through Mason's work
many outstanding applications of electric
clutch and brake equipment have been
made possible, and his research into the
characteristics of magnetic devices and
their related control circuits has contrib-
uted greatly toward the use of electric
clutches and brakes as power and control
devices. In the American Institute of
Electrical Engineers he is a member of the
Rotating Machinery Sub-Committee on
Electrical Couplings.

I love the TECHNIC
I think it's swell
And once each month

General Motors Makes
3-Cylinder Diesel Truck
GMC Truck and Coach Division has
announced its exclusive three-cylinder
Diesel truck, smallest and lightest Diesel
ever to be commercialized for use on
American highways.
Another Diesel "first" by GMC, the
new GMC D450-37 is a two and one-
half ton unit, with five available wheel-
bases for either truck or highway tractor
models.
Announcement of the radically new
Diesel truck was made by Roger M.
Kyes, vice president of General Motors
and general manager of the GMC Truck
&amp; Coach Division, who said the compact,
110-horsepower model would create new
horizons for cost-conscious truckers oper-
ating in the 19,500 lb., G.V.W.—35,000
lb., G.C.W. class.

3-Cylinder Diesel Engine.
"The GM 2-cycle Diesel economy is
being offered for the first time in trucks
of the medium-weight hauling class,"
Kyes said. "The GMC D450-37 enters a
market where there is no other Diesel
competition."
Previously used only by highway haul-
ers and in heavy-duty off-the-road opera-
tions, the famed GMC Diesel family has
in its newest member the adaptability for
many other different applications.
As a tractor, it meets a long-standing
demand of operators for improved operat-
ing economy, durability, and extended
service life of equipment. It is ready not
only for regular inter-city work but also
intra-city hauls of relatively high mileages.
As a truck, it is of special interest to
local and long distance wholesalers and
movers who use vans; to construction
companies hauling cement, bricks and
other building materials; to loggers and
lumber companies; to petroleum com-
panies hauling fuel; to machinery and
metal truckers and to dump truck opera-
tors with cargos of sand, gravel, coal, etc.
Even farmers who run up considerable
mileage, hauling produce every day to
market will find the new GMC Diesel
welterweight the most economical and effi-
cient truck for the job.
A maximum geared speed of 54.4 miles
per hour, with 9:00/20—10 ply tires,
offers the usual hustle of GMC Diesels
while a total gear reduction of 46.9
provides the pulling power for any cir-
cumstance.
The engine under the hood of the
D450-37 is the GM 3-71, smaller brother
of the well-proved 4-71 and 6-71 Diesels
used in GMC 650 through 980 model
series tractors. Like the larger "71"
series engines, the 3-71 employs the ex-
clusively GM 2-cycle design, direct fuel
injection and fuel modulator.
Widely acclaimed after its introduction
last Spring, the fuel modulator automati-
cally proportions fuel and air for most
economical use in the speed range below
1,600 R.P.M., eliminating "lugging" and
consequent severe bearing loads as well as
assuring a clean-burning engine.
New feature in the GMC is an electri-
cally operated shift control for the models
with two-speed axles. The axle shift con-
trol button is conveniently mounted on the
transmission gearshift lever, giving the
driver a quick, positive control indepen-
dent of vacuum or air supply systems,
which is particularly important in driving
over hilly country.
Another innovation is an air-actuated
hydraulic brake system, which combines
air actuation with the advantages of dual-
cylinder hydraulic brakes at front and
rear. The new system provides the driver
with air-braking power combined with
the brake "feel" of a pedal-controlled
hydraulic system, and fast, positive brake
actuation. Physical brake application still
is possible before air pressure builds up

"Radome"
A giant balloon known as a "radome"
provides a roof for this structure housing
radar equipment being built by the Gen-
eral Electric Company for the armed
forces at the company's Electronics Park
in Syracuse, New York.
The rubber-fabric radome being settled
into place, will protect the radar antenna
from wind, snow, and ice, without hinder-

The radome measures 167 feet around
and is 366 feet high. When inflated to
one-half pound pressure, it will with-
stand winds up to 125 miles an hour.
The aluminum framework used to raise
the balloon lowers into the floor after the
radome is inflated to l/20th of a pound
of air pressure.
Special infra-red lamps trained in the
walls will keep the radome free of ice
and snow during the winter. Entrance to
the bubble is through an air lock chamber.

Crucible special purpose steel
for type character application
The development of cold rolled special shape type steel is one
of Crucible's important contributions to the business machine
industry. A major part of the type characters used for the manu-
facture of typewriters are made from this special shape.
Here's the step-by-step process.-

®
The production of Crucible steel for this job is the result
of engineering and practical know-how combined with a
special method of manufacture to assure a homogeneous
microstructure for maximum forming properties, excel-
lent surface characteristics for good die life, and close
accuracy control for all dimensions of the shape.
The production of type steel requires the use of small
precision rolling mills equipped with shaped rolls and
operated by skilled workmen. During preliminary and
final inspection, shadowgraph equipment is constantly
used to check for size accuracy.
As a result of its outstanding quality, Crucible's special
shape type steel is constantly in demand and used by
leading typewriter manufacturers.
Shadowgraph Operation:
Since micrometer measurements are im-
practical due to the shape, the shadowgraph
is used to measure shape and size ... mini-
mum and maximum tolerances. The shad-
owgraph is a projection, greatly magnified
... on a calibrated screen... of the sample.

LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS INVOLVED
IN ARTIFICIALLY PRODUCING RAIN
The most important single natural re-
source enjoyed by the people of this coun-
try is a controlled supply of fresh, clean
water. A few decades ago more water was
available for our growing citizenry than
it could possibly use, yet today, with prac-
tically the same quantity of water moving
through the hydrologic cycle each year,
Americans are becoming acutely aware of
an accelerated increase in serious local
water shortages.
There are two reasons for this newly-
created scarcity of water: Americans are
both consuming and wasting more water
than ever before. Fresh water is so impor-
tant to American economy that our stand-
ard of living as well as our domestic, in-
dustrial and agricultural expansion are
direct functions of- its accessibility and
economic cost.
The purpose of this article is to present
the technical and economic feasibility of
artificial rain-making as well as the legal
and conservation problems inherent in
artificial weather control.
The Technique of Artificially
Producing Rain
A raindrop consists of a minute particle
of matter, such as a speck of dust, around
which a small amount of water has form-
ed. The term "nucleation" denotes the
process of generating a central mass
around which matter is to be gathered.
This process of nucleation is a necessary
step in the formation of natural rain, and
it is no less vital to produce artificial rain.
Sufficient scientific work has been done
in colloidal chemistry, meteorology, and
electronics to discover that thermody-
namicly unstable atmospheric conditions
may be prevented from producing natural
rain by means of artificially induced col-
loidal stability. On the other hand, these
same atmospheric conditions may be
stimulated to produce unusually intensive
rainfall.
It has been shown by experiments that
although water freezes at 0 C, atmo-
spheric ice crystals form at — 35°C, and

for the General Electric Co., discov-
ered in 1946 that carbon dioxide will
spontaneously generate ice nuclei in super-
cooled clouds, and later they discovered
that silver iodide serves the same func-
tion because its crystal structure and
molecular dimensions are similar to those
of "dry ice".
Therefore, modern rain-making is ac-
complished by dropping either "dry-ice"
or silver iodide crystals into clouds when
suitable atmospheric conditions prevail to
induce nucleation.
The Effect of Artificial Rain
on Weather
Because of its value, businessmen and
public agencies are willing to spend con-
siderable amounts of money, time, and
effort to gain control of a constant supply
of fresh water. In the past, enterprising
farmers, loggers, and ranchers have creat-
ed irrigation systems, splash dams or water
holes to serve their needs. Diversified as
these water-control measures are, they all
have one thing in common—a dependency
upon natural rainfall for their ultimate
source of water. The billions of dollars
which have been spent to gain access to
water by means of flood control, industrial
plant location, drainage facilities, and
waterworks have all depended on natural
precipitation. The possibility of large-
scale artificial weather control can influ-
ence not only the effectiveness of these
investments, but also the daily living
habits of the people concerned.
Many claims and counter-claims about
artificial rainmaking have been made by
persons whose interests are purely eco-
nomic. To add to the confusion, expert
meteorologists do not agree as to the
effects and future significance of artificial
weather control.
Concerning the physical nature of rain-
making, some meteorologists believe that
after rain has been produced, the weather
in the locale soon returns to its normal
course because, according to their theory,
there must be a large-scale inflow of
moist air to sustain rainfall in most cases,
and this in turn depends upon the weath-
er situation of the moment. Other
meteorologists directly challenge this
theory because they feel that by "seeding"
the atmosphere, i.e. dropping chemical
compounds into clouds to cause nucleation
and precipitation, subsequent weather may
be forced to diverge from its natural
course and produce rain throughout a
relatively large area.
Further evidence of this schism can be
cited. Speaking of recent decelopments
in the modification of weather phenom-
ena, Suits, general director of the re-
search laboratories of the General Elec-
tric Co., has said: "These modifications
are possibly as important, in terms of
benefit to mankind, as atomic energy." *
Directly contradicting him in a statement
published by the Cloud Physics Project of
the armed services and the Weather Bu-
reau:
The responsible scientists of the
project interpret the long series of
experiments to mean that recently
proposed artificial weather proce-
dures are of relatively little eco-
nomic importance.6
It remains to be seen which of these
viewpoints is correct. However, partly
because of the conflicting theories and
partly in spite of them, the artificial con-
trol of the weather has already begun to
create weighty legal problems.
The Nature of Legal Problems Created
By Artificial Weather Control
In the realm of jurisprudence there also
are differences of opinion pertaining to
the limits which should be placed upon
weather control. Representing a state

GERALD A. CONGER
of the Metal Processing Department

Ductile iron is a recent startling de-
velopment in ferrous metallurgy. Its uni-
que mechanical properties make available
a material to fill the gap between malle-
able iron and steel. Proven industrial
applications vary from castings weighing
as little as 1/3 ounce with sections of
3/32 inch to forging hammer anvils
weighing 50 tons.
In addition to the excellent mechanical
properties of ductile iron, it is character-
ized by good fluidity, castability and ma-
chinability. Favorable production costs
indicate a keen competition with steel
forgings as well as a wide variety of cast
materials.
Upon solidification, cast irons contain-
ing nominally 3.50 percent total carbon
and 2.00 percent silicon, produce free
graphite which has little or no load carry-
ing capacity. This graphite ultimately will
be imbedded in a steel-like matrix modi-
fied by alloys or heat treatment to pro-
duce ferritic, pearlitic, martensitic, austeni-
tic, or acicular structures. Ductile iron is
structurally characterized by graphite par-
ticles in the form of compact spheres as
compared to the flake shape of graphite
in gray cast iron. Figure 1 shows typical
microstructures of these two cast irons and
demonstrates the relative notch effect and
discontinuities produced by the presence
of the low strength graphite. As graphite
imparts many desirable traits to cast iron
it is not entirely objectionable. However,
maximum mechanical properties can be
obtained only when the graphite is pro-
duced in a spheroidal shape.
The production of ductile iron involves
the addition of a nodulizing agent to the
liquid metal just prior to casting. The
nodulizing materials currently available
contain between 10 and 30 percent of
magnesium and cerium either singly or 'in
combination in a suitable case alloy con-
ducive to ready solution in the molten
metal. The treatment is accompanied by
vigorous burning of the nodulizer which
necessitates some care and knowledge in
handling.
Ductile Iron Research Activities in the
University Foundry Laboratory
A series of tests have recently been
completed in the University Foundry
Laboratory through the Engineering Re-
search Institute by Dr. F. B. Rote and
G. A. Conger of the Department of
Production Engineering. The investiga-
tion was undertaken to secure data on the
influence of variations in carbon, silicon,
phosphorus contents and heat treatments
on the mechanical properties and micro-
structures of ductile iron cast in sections
from Y2 inch to six inches. Carbon con-
tents were varied from 275 to 4.10 per-
cent, silicon from 0.11 to 4.95 percent
and phosphorus from 0.04 to 0.40 per-
cent.
Microstructures developed in the mold
cooled castings contained varying propor-
tions of pearlite, ferrite and primary car-
bide. Heat treated castings were pro-
duced with tempered martensite, isotherm-
pound high frequency induction furnace
with a monolithic magnesia lining and in
a 200 pound Detroit indirect arc rocking
furnace lined with a mullite crock then
mixed in a 500 pound ladle during treat-
ment with a magnesium bearing alloy.
The treated metal was poured into "Y"
shaped core molds of varying section
thickness from y2 inch to six inches. Ten-
sile specimens were prepared from each
section size of each composition variation
in both the as-cast and fully annealed con-
dition.
A total of 50 heats were made to in-
vestigate the following variables:
1. Influence of silicon content and
section size at constant carbon con-
tent.
2. Influence of silicon content and sec-
tion size at constant carbon equiva-
lent.
3. Influence of heat treatment at two
silicon levels.
4. Influence of phosphorus content
and section size at constant carbon
and silicon contents.
Microstructures
With increasing silicon content from
1.0 to 5.0 percent, the as-cast matrix
microstructure changed from predomin-
ately pearlitic to predominately ferritic. In
addition, the 1 percent silicon heat con-
tained about 10 percent of primary car-
bide. At 4 percent silicon only a trace of
pearlite remained in a mold cooled 1 inch
section and no pearlite remained in a 6
inch section. Representative structures
are shown in Figure 2.

increased with increasing silicon from
55,000 to 90,000 psi, yield strength from
38,000 psi to 72,000 psi and BHN from
130 to 215. Over the same range silicon
content the elongation decreased from
22% to 15%. This same trend was pro-
duced in all section sizes in the annealed
condition. The change in properties with
increasing silicon content is the result of
the silico-ferrite solid solution hardening
effect, which strengthens and embrittles
the otherwise ductile ferrite.

To produce a completely ferritic struc-
ture the castings were held at 1650° F.
for a sufficient time to insure complete
decomposition of combined carbon, fur-
nace cooled to 1375° F. and held for
complete pearlite breakdown, then furnace
cooled to room temperature.
Two silicon levels, 1.50 and 2.80 per-
cent silicon, were used to compare the
properties produced by oil quenching and
tempering, isothermal transformation (hot
quench), and normalizing and tempering.
Isothermal transformation at
1200° F. and normalizing and tempering
at 1200° F. produced a partially speroid-
ized pearlitic structure, and oil quenching
and tempering at 1200° F. produced a
tempered martensitic structure.
Results of Tests
Influence of Silicon Content
To determine the influence of silicon
content on the mechanical properties of
ductile iron, a series of four heats were
made with nominally 1, 2, 3 and 4%
silicon and 3.50% carbon. The results of
tests made on 1" keel sections in the
as-cast and fully annealed condition are
shown in Figure 4a and 4b.
In the as-cast condition, increasing sili-
con content in a 1" section raised the
tensile strength, yield, elongation and
hardness, but lowered the impact tough-
ness.. At 3.30% Si, a maximum strength
of 100,000 psi was obtained with 73,000
psi yield strength, 10% elongation and
230 Brinell hardness.
The changes in properties were due to
a combination of microstructural changes
which occurred as the silicon content was
raised from 1.0 to 5.0 percent. At the

Abstract
This investigation is concerned with the
effect of low air density on increasing the
length of path of a baseball. The tra-
jectory is determined for the particular
case of a home run ball with no spin. It
was found that it is reasonable to assume
that the flow about a baseball, under prac-
tical conditions, is in the sub-critical Rey-
nolds number range. Assumption as to
the initial conditions are based on a com-
parison of existing data on golf balls and
on the small amount of data available
on baseballs. The results support these
assumptions.
The analogy between this problem and
the more technically important guided
missile is drawn.
Introduction
On June 23 of the 1950 baseball season,
an unusual game took place between the
New York Yankees and the Detroit
Tigers. It was a night game held at
Briggs Stadium in Detroit. The day had
been particularly hot; the temperature
above 95° F. Before the game, the an-
nouncer, Harry Heilman, repeatedly made
the comment, "The air is light tonight and
we can expect a lot of home runs." This
prediction was certainly borne out. There
were eleven home runs during the game.
This broke the American League record
for number of home runs during a single
game. This same night, in another city,
the National League record was also
broken. Atmospheric conditions were the
same during both games; high tempera-
ture resulting in low density.
The purpose of this investigation was
to see whether aerodynamic estimates and
the analysis used in missile problems can
account for this excess of home runs on
a hot day.
One may well ask what baseball has to
do with the rapidly developing field of
missile technology. The procedure used in
solving the baseball problem closely paral-
lels that used in missile problems. This
paper illustrates some of these procedures
as applied to the flight of a baseball.
In both cases, one must:

(b) Solve unsteady, non-linear equa-

The major difference in these procedures
lies in the fact that the force coefficient
for a baseball will vary with Reynolds
number ■ while the force coefficients for a
high speed missile will vary in a more
complicated manner with Mach number
as well as with Reynolds number.
Before proceeding with the analysis,
let us consider the differences in the atmo-
sphere on a hot day as compared to an
average baseball day.
From the weather bureau, we find that
with a temperature increase from 70° F.
to 95° F, we may expect as much as a
1.5 per cent decrease in pressure.
Standard atmospheric charts used in
aircraft performance calculations2 show
that corresponding to these changes, we
have a 9 or 10 percent decrease in density
and approximately a 15 percent increase
in kinematic viscosity, v
Where p. = coefficient of viscosity
p = density in slugs/ft *
This change in kinematic viscosity will
result in a change of approximately 13
percent in the Reynolds number, R.

Aerodynamic Forces on the Ball
Before any analysis can be made to de-
termine the trajectory of the ball, the na-
ture and magnitude of the aerodynamic
forces on it must be determined. It was
found that there is a lack of data as to
what the magnitude of these forces might
be for a baseball.•1 ■ This is rather surpris-
ing, considering the amount of research
that has been done on spheres and the in-
terest that is shown in baseball as a sport.
Drag Forces
Figure 1 presents typical experimental
data for the drag force coefficient, Q, as
it is related to the characteristic, dimen-
sionless parameter, Reynolds number.1
The drag force coefficient is defined in
Fig. 1.
The first part of this curve corresponds
to very slow velocities, termed "creeping"
motion, or to the flow of very highly
viscous fluids such as a heavy oil.1 This
region will then be of little interest in
determining the forces on a baseball.
For the range of Reynolds number
from about 200 to the point at which the
curve begins to break downward, C,( is

boundary layer is laminar and has the ve-
locity profile shown in Fig. 2a.1
As the boundary layer passes over a sur-
face, its momentum is decreased by fric-
tion with the surface.1 When the mo-
mentum of the slower inner layers is
brought to zero, separation of the flow
from the body occurs.1 For a laminar
boundary layer passing over a sphere, this
separation has been found to occur at a
point somewhat ahead of the maximum
cross section of the sphere.1 See Fig. 3a.
As a result ,a wide low pressure wake
exists behind the sphere, resulting in a
large pressure drag.
With further increases in Reynolds
number, the laminar boundary layer sud-
denly becomes unstable.1 Turbulent mix-
ing then takes place in the boundary layer.
The result of this mixing is to broaden its
velocity profile and thus to increase its
momentum.1 See Fig 2b. With the in-
crease, the greater momentum in the tur-
bulent boundary layer permits it to travel
a greater distance along the surface of
the sphere before separation occurs.1 See
Fig. 3b. The increase in skin friction drag
due to the turbulence of the boundary
layer is overshadowed by the large reduc-
tion in pressure drag because of the nar-
rower wake.1 The resulting reduction in
C,, is seen to be of the order of 4 to 1.
The Reynolds number corresponding to
the middle of the rapid drop in C,, is
called the critical Reynolds number, Rcr.
For a smooth sphere, Rcr s4xl051-4
The value of Rcr in a particular case will
depend on the initial turbulence of the
fluid and on the surface roughness of the
sphere.1-4 For atmospheric air the turbu-
lence is large scale and will have negli-
gible effect on the boundary layer.1-4 Our
problem is then to evaluate the roughness
of a baseball.
Because of the previously mentioned
lack of information on baseballs, it was
necessary to proceed by inference and
comparison of the data that was available.
Tests and analyses by Hoerner 4 lead to
the conclusion that, under practical con-

ditions, the flow tbout a baseball is in
the sub-critical Reynolds number range.
The calculation of the actual trajectories
gives later support of this conclusion.
We are thus led to the assumption of
a drag force coefficient equal to .47. For
the sub-critical range, this is a reliable
number on which there is good experi-
mental agreement,4 even for spheres so
rough that they act like sharp edged
bodies.
The dashed line in Fig. 1 represents
the value of the drag force coefficient for
extremely rough spheres.4
The drag force for a baseball will then
have a value
D = Cd '/t^'d.1-
= ■O/374/ii'1
Bodies in unsteady motion in a fluid
also experience a force due to the "vir-
tual" mass of the body.5 In the case of
accelerated motion, a thrust is experienced.
The additional force can be derived on
even the basis of perfect fluid theory."' In
this case, its existence depends only on
the fact that the fluid has mass."'

mass of the fluid displaced by the body."'
Since the mass of the baseball is large
compared with the mass of the displaced
air, the resulting additional force can
be neglected.
Lift Forces
The existence of transverse or lift
forces due to the spinning of the ball arc-
explained in terms of the familiar Magnus
effect/1 Quantitative evaluation of these
forces cannot be arrived at theoretically
even if the rotational speeds of a baseball
were known. However, it will not be
necessary to consider transverse forces
because we are seeking only relative
changes in path. Also, we are considering
only a home run ball for which case, we
can assume that the baseball will be quite
squarely hit and will have low rotational
speeds.
Initial Conditions
Before a solution of the equations of
motion can be carried out, the initial con-
ditions must be determined. With all the
interest that is shown in baseball, it is
surprising that no data are available from
which the initial velocity of a batted base-
ball might be determined.3-6 Fortunately,
an exact value of the initial velocity will
not be necessary as we are seeking relative
changes in path.
Two methods were used to estimate
the initial velocity. These methods indi-
cated that for a well hit baseball, the
initial velocity would be between 160
ft./sec. and 200 ft./sec. The initial ve-
locity was assumed to be 180 ft./sec. The
initial angle of inclination of the path
was taken as 30°. These assumptions are
supported by the results.
The first method consisted of answer-
ing the question as to how far a baseball
would go if it were in a vacuum. From
an examination of data on non-spinning
golf balls, it was found that a ball would
travel approximately twice as far in a
vacuum as in air. Considering a home

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


BY
PAUL CHENEA
Stephen Prokofievitch Timoshenko was
born on December 23, 1878, in a small
village near Kiev, Russia. His youth ap-
pears to have been uneventful until in
1889 he entered the High School at
Romni, Russia, where he studied for 5
years. He then entered the Institute of
Engineering of Ways of Communication
in St. Petersberg, from which he gradu-
ated in 1901. After graduation he served
one year in the Russian army and then re-
turned to the Institute of Engineering of
Ways of Communication as an instructor
in 1902. On March 3, 1902, he married
Alexandra M. Archangelokaja. After
teaching at the Institute for a year, he ac-
cepted a post as Assistant Professor at the
Polytechnic Institute in St. Petersberg.
During the years 1904, 1905, and 1906
he travelled in Europe, spending part of
each year studying first at Munich with
August Foppl and later at Gottingen with
Ludwig Prandtl. His first published papers
appeared in the Bulletin of the Poly-
technic Institute in St. Petersberg in 1905.
They were concerned with the vibration
and strength of shafts. While at the Poly-
technic Institute he taught Statics, Strength
of Materials, and the Theory of Structures.
In 1906 he returned to Kiev to accept
the chair of Applied Mathematics at the
Polytechnic Institute in Kiev where he re-
mained until 1911. During this time he
published eight papers on elasticity and
elastic stability and a collection of prob-
lems on strength of materials. He was
elected Dean of the School of Civil Engi-
neering in 1909; however, he did not
remain long in the good graces of the
governing powers at the Polytechnic In-
stitute. The Institute accused him of
supportnig revolutionary activities of the
students, and he was discharged two years
later in 1911. This did not dim his rapid-
ly growing fame in Engineering Ma-
chanics, however, and he was honored
shortly after his discharge from the In-
stitute by being awarded the Jouravsky
Medal for a paper entitled "On Stability
of Elastic Systems," which was published
in 1913 in the Annates des Ponts et
Chaussees.
During the period from 1911 to 1913
he did not associate himself with any
educational institution. However, he pub-
lished some nine or ten papers in Rus-

STEPHEN P. TIMOSHENKO
sian, French, and German on elasticity and
dynamics. His first book Strength of Ma-
terials was published in 1911 in Russian.
It went through 12 editions, the last in
1932. The first of a long series of papers
on thin elastic plates appeared in 1913.
In 1913 he accepted a position as Pro-
fessor of the Theory of Elasticity at the
Institute of Engineering of Way and Com-
munication and from 1914 to 1918 he
occupied the chair of the Theory of Elas-
ticity as Applied to Ships. It was during
these years that his famous Russian book
Theory of Elasticity was published.
The period from 1917 to 1920 was a
violent one in the history of Russia. The
political and social unrest caused him to
leave St. Petersberg in 1918 and return
to Kiev. In Kiev he actively participated
in the organization of the Academy of
Sciences, and perhaps this and the general
unrest occupied most of his time. In any
event he published absolutely nothing
during the years 1918, 1919, and 1920.
As the situation became worse in Russia,
Timoshenko decided to forsake his native
land and journeyed to Yugoslavia where
he accepted a chair of Applied Mathe-
matics in the Polytechnic Institute in
Zagreb. While in Zagreb, he published
his first paper in English for the Philo-
sophical Magazine, London.
N. W. Akimoff of the Vibration Spec-
ialty Company in Philadelphia prevailed
upon him to come to the United States in
1922 where he joined the firm as a con-
sulting engineer. One year later he joined
the research staff of the Westinghouse
Company in Pittsburgh, where he remain-
ed until 1927. The four years at the
Westinghouse Company were momentous
ones. At the Westinghouse Company at
this time there was a nucleus of highly
talented engineers. Timoshenko was a
powerful catalyst, an inspiring teacher,
and a brilliant analyst of engineering
problems. The result was the growth
of a group of men in applied mechanics
under his guidance which have fathered
engineering mechanics in this country
ever since. Among his colleagues and
students at Westinghouse were L. S.
Jacobsen, John M. Lessells, J.P. Den Har-
tog, C. B. Karelitz, C. W. MacGregor, A.
Nadai, J. Ormondroyd, K. E. Petersen,
C. R. Soderberg, A. M. Wahl, and others.
It seems doubtful that fate should ever
bring such a group together at one place
again. Probably this group is only rivaled
by that which centered around L. Prandtl
in Gottingen. During his stay at West-
inghouse he was very active in original
research, and he published some 20 papers
and one book in the four years. He also
became a much sought after lecturer,
giving lectures at M.I.T., Stanford, Mich-
igan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Harvard, Yale,
and Cornell Universities. He quickly re-
alized that there was a critical need for a
journal solely for papers in engineering
mechanics and he was instrumental in the
formation of the Applied Mechanics
Division of the A.S.M.E. and its Journal
of Applied Mechanics.
In spite of his freedom and the oppor-
tunities presented at the Westinghouse
Company, he became restless. He was
primarily a teacher, and he needed time
to study and write. Plans for many books
were being formulated in his mind, and
he needed leisure to complete them. This
situation led him to leave the Westing-
house Company in 1927 and accept a
position at the University of Michigan as
a Professor of Engineering Mechanics.
About this time he became a citizen of
the United States. Here at Ann Arbor
the influence of Timoshenko was even
more pronounced than at Westinghouse.

THIS MONTH'S QUESTION.
What Is Your Opinion
Of Women Engineers?

Hugh Smith, Soph.,
E.M.
It's too bad that
there aren't more of
them in our classes.

Joe Jeffries, Fresh-
man, Ch.E.
Haven't found
very many. I can
find no reason why
women shouldn't be
engineers.

Donald Pruden,
Grad, Ch.E.
I believe there is
a place for them in
industry. I have
seen them working
in industry and they
are doing a good
job.





Norm Clifford, '53,
Marine Eng.
If they are able
and like the work,
they'll make good
engineers.
Nonny Weinstock,
Jr., Marine Eng.
I wish I had a
few of them in some
of my classes.
Carl Corneliuson, Jr.
Metallurgy
They ought to
make good engineers
if they can apply
themselves.
Dick Mottern, '53,
E.E.
They don't bother
me in any engineer-
ing classes.
Art Derr, '53, Civil
They seem to be
making good engi-
neers.
AI Suggett, '53 C.E.
I think the woman's place is in the home.

Bob Pehlke, '54,
E.E.
Women are not
in any position in
our society to gain
the necessary back-
ground experience
for an engineering
career. Who ever
heard of a woman
brick layer, linewoman, foundry woman, etc&gt;
Except for chemical engineering, this man's
field is not for women.
Art Larwin, '53,
M.E.
There is definitely
a need for women
engineers.

■


George Gryka, '54,
Ch.E.
Women engineers
add a little decora-
tion to the class
room, but that's
about all.
Dale Haskin, '52,
M.E.
I believe engineer-
ing is not a woman's
profession, at least
not the mechanical
or design branch. I
wouldn't encourage
my daughter to go
to engine school.
Edward Kocinski, Feb., '52 M.E.
They probably are able to do a good job.
Because of the draft and shortage of engineers,
they're a good thing at this time. However,
they probably won't take over the engineering
profession.


Harvey Neumann,
'52, M.E.
In general they
show a lot more in-
terest in engineering
activities. If they can
break into the engi-
neering profession,
more luck to them.
Bob Bacon, '55, C.E.
I have no objec-
tion to women engi-
neers as women,
but engineering is
not in keeping with
the common idea of
a professional wom-
an.
Paul Sisko, '55,
M.E.
I think women are
very good for engi-
neers.

Frank La Bonte, '55
I think that very
few will have the
ability. The job's
too big for women
engineers.
Bill Lord, Feb., '53 Industrial Eng.
If girls are interested in engineering and
realize the problems they face because of tra-
dition, there is no reason why they shouldn't
be in engineering school.
Bob Vanderzee, '53, Industrial Mech. Eng.
I believe that women would feel out of place
in industry. They should use their time and
money to obtain an education in a profession
more suitable to women.

We hired an engineer over Berlin
"The Boeing Flying Forts came through
a wall of flak and fighters that night to
hit Berlin right on the nose. They never
Jet us down —not then or on any of the
raids to come. I was proud to fly the old
Boeings. Now I'm prouder still to he on
the great engineering team that designs
the new ones."
Boeing engineers feel that way. And
they'd be honored to have you join
them as they pioneer in dramatic new
fields of aviation.
The steady growth of Boeing's Engi-
neering Division over the past 35 years
is an index of its stability. There's great
work to be done here in all phases of
aircraft design. Boeing engineers are
now working on such truly exciting
projects as the world's hottest jet bomb-
ers, the B-47 and the B-52; on secret
guided missile programs, on the new
Boeing gas turbine engine and other
revolutionary developments.
At Boeing you'll find some of the
world's best research facilities and you'll
work with the men who have helped
establish Boeing's world leadership in
the fields of aviation research, design
and engineering.
You can live in the Pacific North-
west, at Seattle; or, if you prefer, you
can settle in the Midwest, at Boeing's
Wichita, Kansas, Division. Your in-
quiries will be referred to the plant of
your choice.
So plan now to build your career at
Boeing after graduation. Salaries are
good, and they grow as you grow. Boeing
has present and future openings for
experienced and junior aeronautical,
mechanical, electrical, civil, electronics,
acoustical, weights and tooling engi-
neers for design and research; for servo-

DEAN GEORGE GRANGER BROWN
College of Engineering
University of Michigan
The desire and realization of higher standards of living
appear to be the alternative to force and totalitarianism or a
relative industrial and economic decline. High living standards
require high productivity. High productivity and high living
standards are best evident in the U.S.A. Low productivity and
low living standards accompanied by force and totalitarianism
are clearly evident in the U.S.S.R. Great Britain has not main-
tained a high level of productivity and is suffering a relative
industrial and economic decline.
Prior to 1890 the industrial production per worker was
higher in Great Britain than in the U.S.A. and Great Britain
enjoyed a high standard of living. But productivity in the
U.S.A. has increased at approximately three per cent (com-
pound) per year while that in Great Britain has been increas-
ing at about half that rate, so that U.S. industrial production
per worker is now 2y2 times that in Great Britain. This dif-
ference in industrial development in the last sixty years is
considered by Sir Ewart Smith * to be the basic reason for the
economic imbalance between the two countries. This conclu-
sion appears to be well supported by the two countries. This
conclusion appears to be well supported by the fruitless efforts
of the late labor government to increase productivity.
Various reasons have been advanced for this relatively low
productivity in British industry. British labor unions have
been blamed, but similar charges have been leveled at unions
in the U.S.A. where productivity has steadily increased twice as
fast as in Britain. British capitalism has been monopolistic
or cartelized while American capitalism has been generally
competitive; but the productivity in German industry where
capitalism has been almost completely cartel-controlled has not
lagged. There are also regulated monopolies such as the
American Telephone and Telegraph where high productivity
has been attained. Careful consideration leads to the conclu-
sion that high productivity depends upon technical knowledge
and its application in management. This is a characteristic of
modern American industry wherein about 80% of all college-
educated executives are engineering graduates.
Engineering graduates are being used in increasing large
areas of industrial operation in the United States. Through
the years there has been a continuous increase in use of engi-
* Sir Ewart Smith, American Scientist, Apr. 51.
neers in manufacture, distribution and technical services and
top levels of management in manufacture are largely filled
by engineering graduates. The distribution of industrial pro-
duction and consumer goods is planned and directed by engi-
neering graduates. Service industries in their management and
technical operations are also manned increasingly by engi-
neering graduates. This broad extension of area of use of
engineers beyond professional operations of development and
design is one of the most important elements in the rapid
increase in our industrial power. Technical progress would
have been much slower and industrial strength of consider-
ably lower order if our technical education system had not
supplied the large volume of adequately-trained engineers for
use in the management and technical operations of an ever in-
creasing area of our industrial society.t
Sir Ewart Smith t quotes M. J. Kelley and agrees that tech-
nical skill in industry is responsible for industrial progress
and that a favorable national economic position will result from
a wider use of technical graduates in management. He shows
that United Kingdom degrees in all applied science per 10,000
of population increased from 0.16 to 0.18 during the period
when U.S. degrees in engineering ONLY grew from 0.7 to
1.05, and rightly concludes that Great Britain must greatly
expand and develop facilities for education in engineering
and applied science.
If the U.S. is to continue in its present position of leader-
ship, this is no time to coast. The handwriting on the wall is
perfectly clear. Great Britain lost her position of industrial
leadership to the U.S.A. while educating only 0.18 applied
scientists per 10,000 of population, where the U.S.A. educated
from 0.7 to 1.05 engineers for 10,000 during the same period
and used them widely in industrial management. Now the
U.S.A. is unable to supply the demand for engineers. Where
one engineer is required for normal peacetime industrial de-
velopment, five engineers are now required for government-
sponsored work in the same field. Yet, according to the best
information available, the U.S.A. has no more engineering stu-
dents enrolled in its colleges and technical schools than does
Russia and less than were enrolled ten years ago.

A friend of ours stopped in to see us
the other day. He has been stationed with
the Army in Alaska, and he told us of a
most unusual system of multiplication that
is supposed to be used by the Eskimos
who inhabit that country. The Eskimos
can only double or halve numbers, and
that only by using pebbles as counters.
Yet merely by doubling or halving, they
can multiply two numbers and arrive at
Khe correct answer. Let's say, for example,
that one of the men wants to sell 19 seal
skins at 17 apiece. How much should he
receive? Here's the process that he uses:
He sets up two columns, puts 17
in one column, 19 in the other.
He then halves the left figure and gets
81/2- Now since Eskimos know nothing
about fractions, he disregards the y2. He
doubles the right-hand figure. He con-
tinues this process until the left-hand fig-
ure is 1. His columns now look some-
thing like this:
17
19
8
38
4
76
2
152
1
304
However, the Eskimos believe that the
even numbers in the left column are evil,
so these numbers are erased, along with
their partners. Thus the Eskimo scratches
out 8 and 38, 4 and 76, etc. Now he
simply adds the right-hand column and
arrives at the proper answer: 323. Try
it for yourself with any two numbers; the
answer is always the correct one. The
Eskimo, lacking any semblance of an edu-
cation, does not know why his system
works. However, you should see imme-
diately how it works. You do, don't you?
Another friend of ours, a chess fan,
stopped in to see us the-other night, and
he brought us this interesting problem.
He had discovered, he said, that the num-
ber of possible ways of playing the first
10 moves on each side in a game of chess
is 169,518,829,100,544,000,000,000,000,-
000. On this basis, considering the popu-
lation of the world to be 2,291 millions,
he wanted us to calculate the number of
years that would be required to go
through them all, even if every human
being on the face of the globe played with-
out cessation for that period at the rate
of one game per minute, and no game
was ever repeated. If you don't let the
large numbers score you, you should have
a fairly easy time with this one. We bet
that the answer will astonish you; it did
us.
Here is an interesting problem involv-
ing the use of six coins. After first ar-
ranging the coins as pictured in the dia-
gram, we ask you to rearrange them into
two rows of four coins each by making
one and only one move. It's really not as
hard as it looks.

Smith had a watch worth $25.00, which
he pawned for $15.00 Then he sold the
pawn ticket to Jones for $15.00. Thus
Smith got $30.00 for a $25.00 watch, the
pawn broker had a $25.00 watch for
$15.00, and Jones paid only $15.00 for a
ticket for a $25.00 watch. Who lost
money?
Here's a rather different type of prob-
lem from what we have tried before. See
if you can get it.
From an old adage we take the voca-
tions of rich man, poor man, beggar man,
thief, doctor, lawyer, merchant and chief.
Let us call these men by the surnames of
Green, Smith, Thompson, Tucker, Jones,
Harrison, Jackson, and Wilson, but not
necessarily in that respective order. What
was the name and vocation of each of
these eight men, based on the following
information—
1. The poor man consulted the lawyer
about a damage suit against Green. 2.
Jackson, a witness to an auto accident
in which Smith's car hit Thompson and
Harrison, took these two injured men to
the doctor for medical care. 3. If a list of
the eight men's names were set up in
alphabetical order, the rich man's name
would appear last. 4. The doctor, who was
unmarried, treated both Mrs. Tucker and
Mrs. Green for nervous disorders. 5.
Green telephoned to the chief and report-
ed that he had been robbed by the beggar
and the thief. 6. The lawyer's name and
the beggar's name both begin with the
same letter, but the beggar was a bachelor.
7. Harrison, who was an honest man, ask-
ed the chief to give Smith a job on the
police force.
For the last one, here's a quickie. A
man drives from his home to a distant
city—a distance of 100 miles. If he drives
the first fifty miles at 30 mph, and the
second at 50 mph, what is his average
speed? Don't jump to a hasty conclu-
sion; the answer isn't forty miles per
hour.
For success in cooperative ventures as-
sociate yourself with men who have the
habit of success in all they undertake.

ANOTHER ALCOA DEVELOPMENT STORY:
One automobile manufacturer set out to improve
his fluid coupling to the Nth degree.
Torque converters had been made by machining
cast or forged blanks, or by assembling stamped
parts. But these engineers wanted better perform-
ance. This meant their converters must be stronger,
lighter, more intricate. They asked, "Can we do
it in aluminum?"
Our Research specialists saw the chance to
show the economy of a little-known process called
plaster casting. A process in which plaster, instead
of sand, is used for cores to provide more intricate
and smoother castings—castings that require no
machining of the blades. It promised results that
might even exceed the auto maker's requirements.
Final design refinements were made. Then we
cast the first samples. They came from the molds
smooth and clean—perfect in detail.
While the auto manufacturer machined them
to finished dimensions, we set up to test them for
strength at high speeds. Coating the parts with
brittle lacquer, we spun them in our whirlpit up
to 10,000 rpm—over twice their normal operating
speed. Cracks in the brittle lacquer told us where
strains concentrated. Designs were modified. New
samples cast. Tests repeated. The final castings
are smooth, faithful in detail, exceed every
strength requirement.
This is typical of the development jobs we do
at Alcoa. Others are under way now and more are
waiting for mechanical, metallurgical, electrical,
chemical and industrial engineers having the
imagineering skill to tackle them. Perhaps you
may be one of those men.

To determine the influence of phos-
phorus content on the mechanical proper-
ties of ductile iron, a series of six phos-
phorus levels of nominally 0.04, 0.08,
0.12, 0.16, 0.20 and 0.40% phosphorus,
were investigated. The composition of
the base metal was nominally 3.45 T.C.,
1.80 Si, and 0.35 Mn.
In Figures 7a and 7b the mechanical
properties are plotted vs. percent phos-
phorus on 1" keel sections in the as-cast
and annealed conditions, respectively.
All sections, from y2 inch to 6 inches, re-
vealed a similar trend. As the phosphorus
content was increased from 0.04% to
0.40% in the 1 inch keel sections, as-cast,
NODULAR IRON
(Continued from page 13)
was increased from 0.04 to 0.40% the
tensile strength increased from 60,000 to
75,000 psi, yield strength increased from
45,000 to 53,000 psi, Brinell hardness
increased from 130 to 175 BHN, and
elongation decreased from 27 to 8%.
In general, high phosphorous content is
undesirable in ductile iron, since it lowers
the strength in the as-cast condition and
embrittles annealed sections.
Influence of Section Thickness
Averaged mechanical properties of 2%
and 4% silicon ductile irons in the as-cast
condition were compared with those of
the shave iron in the annealed condition.
In the as-cast 2% silicon sections increas-

the tensile strength decreased from
105,000 ps to 75,000 pst, the yield strength
remained constant at about 65,000 psi,
brinell hardness increased from 235 to
270 BHN, and elongation decreased from
8% to 1%. It is seen that elongation de-
creased most rapidly between 0.05 and
0.10% phosphorus. These changes in
mechanical properties are the results of
solution of phosphorus in the ferrite, in
addition to the formation of increasing
quantities of phosphide eutectic at the
higher phosphorus levels.
In annealed one inch keel sections the
effects of increasing phosphorus content
were much different. The soft ductile
and relatively weak ferritic matrix was
hardened, embrittled and strengthened by
increasing quantities of phosphorus in so-
lution and the ultimate formation of
phosphide eutectic. As the phosphorus
ing thickness produced progressively
slightly lower properties, except in the
range of y2 to 1 inch. The half inch
section contained a small amount of prim-
ary carbide which lowered the proper-
ties somewhat, while heavier sections were
free of primary carbide. With increasing
thickness the matrix structures contained
larger proportions of ferrite and coarser
spheroids which lowered the properties.
At 4% silicon similar decreases in as-cast
properties occurred with increasing sec-
tion, however, the half inch section was
free of primary carbide and had the
highest strength of the sections tested.
Some pearlite occurred in the half inch
casting, while the heavier sections were
essentially free of pearlite.
The annealed sections exhibited a uni-
form straight line decrease in properties
with increasing section. The rate of which
the decrease occurred was greater in 4%
than in 2% silicon castings.
The degree to which the properties of
the ductile iron casting were lowered with
increasing section was very small in com-
parison with other cast metals. It is ob-
vious that the section sensitivity is very
slight for this material.
Properties of Oil Quenched and
Tempered Bars
The best combination of usable proper-
ties was secured in bars tempered at 1100
to 1200° F. The properties obtained in
bars from the 1.50% silicon heat were
110,000 psi tensile strength, 88,000 psi
yield strength, and 10 per cent elongation
as oil quenched from 1600° F. and tem-
pered at 1200° F. Bars from the 2.80%
silicon heat had slightly lower properties.
Properties of Hot-Quenched Bars
In general, the hot-quenched bars trans-
formed at 1100 to 1200° F. had h'gher
tensile strength and lower yield strength
than similar bars oil quenched and tem-
pered at the same temperatures. The elon-
gations were at about the same level as in
quenched and tempered bars. In the hot-
quenched bars, however, the difference in
elongation between bars transformed at
1100 and at 1200° F. was not large. The
strengths were significantly higher in
bars treated at 1100°F.
From the above it appears that the best
combination of properties would be se-
cured in casting isothermally transform-
ed at 1100° F. Under these conditions
the following could be expected; 125,000
to 140,000 psi tensile strength, 90,000
to 100,000 psi yield strength, and 7 to
10 percent elongation.
Properties of Normalized and
Tempered Bars
Since the results of tests on quenched
and tempered and on hot-quenched cast-
ings indicated the desirability of temper-
ing or transformation at 1100 to 1200°
F. to secure suitably high ductility, it fol-
lowed that similar properties might be
secured in normalized and tempered cast-
ings. Accordingly, a series of sections
from keel castings was austenitized 2
hours at 1600° F. and air-cooled. They
were then drawn at 1100, 1150, and
1200° F.
The tensile strengths of the normalized
and tempered bars were higher than those

and a former Secretary to Agriculture,
says this:
The legal possibilities are endless:
The managers of the county fair
could sue if rainfall turned on from
some floating cloud had washed out
their enterprise; the owners of a base-
ball team rained out on the conclud-
ing day of a red-hot pennant race
would have anger in their eyes if
there had been rain on their diamond.
Rainmaking has such great possibili-
ties that federal legislation now seems
imperative ... To my mind it is a
question of intelligent regulation
now or continued haphazard inter-
ference with the weather with no
central authority to channel the
course of these measures in the na-
tional interest.1
W. E. Howell, a leader in the field of
meteorological research and a representa-
tive of the purely scientific viewpoint, ad-
vocates no immediate federal controls on
artificial rain-making because he believes
there are no legal precedents to guide such
procedure and that there is no urgent
need for this kind of action. He admits,
however, that centralized agencies assign-
ed to weather control can be a great help
if they foster more scientific research for
the public benefit but he feels that they
need not necessarily be on the federal
level.2
There is no argument over whether or
not the federal government can control
the activities of rain-makers. The Con-
stitution indirectly grants it this authority
in Article I, section 8, paragraphs 1 and 3
(the power to conduct war and the power
to control interstate and foreign com-
merce. )
However, the situation at the present
time is that of a legal vacuum. There are
two classes of disputes that are likely to
arise in this vacuum, due to attempts to
modify the weather.
1. There will be claims for personal
injury and property damage alleged to
have been caused by the modification of
the weather.

RAIN MAKING
(Continued from page 11)
A case of this kind occurred in Octo-
ber, 1947, when Project Cirrus, a Depart-
ment of National Defense group was con-
ducting nucleation experiments on a hur-
ricane then located about 300 miles south-
east of Cape Hatteral, North Carolina.
During the course of the experiments the
hurricane turned and hit Savannah, Geor-
gia, causing two-million dollars worth of
damage. The federal government was
sued by disgruntled property owners but
litigation was prevented from entering the
courts because the work of the scientists
was considered to be vital to national
defense, and our political leaders thought
the experiments should not be discussed
in a lawsuit.
2. There will be claims of property
rights in the weather, or in some particu-
lar elements of weather phenomena.
For example, attempts to produce snow
in Nevada for skiing have resulted in
charges of illegal water diversion and
threats of legal action by Utah.
The only policy adopted by the Su-
preme Court in this type of case has been
to apply its rule of "equitable apportion-
ment" and urges interstate compacts and
administration concerning water rights.
Senator O'Mahoney of Wyoming has
tried to solve these legal problems by
means of federal regulations. His bill,
Senate Bill S.5, introduced into the 82nd
Congress during January, 1951, has this
purpose:
To provide for research into a demon-
stration of practical means for the eco-
nomic production, from sea or other sa-
line waters, or from the atmosphere (in-
cluding cloud formations, of water suit-
able for agricultural, industrial, munici-
pal and other beneficial consumptive uses,
and for other purposes such as . . . purify-
ing, storing, transporting, and distribut-
ing the water byproducts derived from the
operation of such facilities/'
Senator O'Mahoney further advocates
delegating authority to the Secretary of
Agriculture so that his agencies will be
permitted to:
1. Carry out field experiments on the
ground or in the air for making rain.
2. Acquire land, technical data, person-
nel, and patents to carry out necessary ex-
periments.
3. Study economically feasible methods
* O'Mahoney, W.; Senate Bill S.5, 82nd
Congress of the United States, 1st Session, Jan.
8, 1951.
for recovering and marketing water by-
products.
4. Co-operate in reciprocal agreements
with any other federal, state or municipal
agencies.
This theory of investigation prior to
regulation is also supported by Michael
Strauss, chief of the Bureau of Land
Reclamation. He has made this state-
ment about rain-making:
These operations would be great-
ly enhanced, however, if . . . com-
mercial cloud seeding organizations
could be required by Federal statutes
to install scientific measuring appara-
tus sufficient that analyses and eval-
aution of the results could be made
by impartial organizations. . . . We
should go slowly instituting con-
trols over processes about which we
do not yet have information."'
From these statements, it seems rea-
sonable to assume that some federal, state,
and local legislation plus a natural ten-
dency toward conservation on the part of
the courts will ensure proper development
of artificial weather control in this coun-
try.
Limitations of Artificial Weather
Control
Artificial weather control, if properly
developed can probably play a significant
role in conserving both our national re-
sources and personal property. It has al-
ready been demonstrated that thunder-
storms can be modified to reduce flash
floods, hurricanes sidetracked to avoid
densely populated areas, sleet and glaze
prevented, the occurrence of lightning
reduced, forest fires partially controlled by
producing rain over them, and navigation
made safer by the dispersal of fog and
clouds. It is very possible that rain-mak-
ing will develop into a nation-wide busi-
ness which will add life blood to many
enterprises dependent upon controlled
water, such as farming, ranching, and
public power utilities.
Furthermore, artificial weather con-
trol may tend to increase our conservation
of water if this new field is not too rapidly
exploited. Those areas really needing

NEW HYPERSORBER
for hydrocarbon separation
Towering high above the many pipes and towers that dot the
Midland, Michigan horizon is one of Dow's newest additions to its
vast supply of technical equipment . . . the new 207 foot, 400 ton
Hypersorber. Erected in April of 1951, it is used for the separation
of light hydrocarbon gases.
Because of its huge size, transporting it from Cartaret, New Jersey,
where it was made, to Midland was a difficult problem. Finally it
was decided to transport it in two sections, on specially built, low
slung rail cars. It was transported only in the daytime and moved
no more than 100 miles per day.
For the erection of this tall tower, special 190 foot vertical steel
columns were employed, as well as two hoisting steam engines
controlling % of a mile of cable, eight sheaved blocks and 17 one-
inch cables.
The largest single drum ever erected in one piece, the Dow Hyper-
sorber is part of the continual program of development and expan-
sion of technical and plant facilities taking place at The Dow
Chemical Company . . . expansion necessitated by growing demands
for its high quality chemicals by industries throughout the world.

they have plus that from any additional
sources, especially when artificial rain may
cost anywhere from iy2 to 12 cents per
acre per rainfall. If those sections of the
country which do not need the services of
a rainmaker, such as the Lake States, ex-
perience less annual rainfall due to signifi-
cant amounts being drained from the at-
mosphere throughout the West and South-
west, the tendency will be to make the
inhabitants of these humid regions also
more conscious of water conservation.
However, in spite of its bright prospets,
rain-making will not solve all our water
problems. In many areas throughout the
country, especially in the West and South-
west, even added rainfall will not elimi-
nate the need for irrigation. Furthermore,
rain cannot always be made to fall where
and when it is most desired, and there will
always be a need for methods of trans-
porting and storing runoff. Although ex-
periments and successful practical demon-
strations indicate that in the future we
may expect weather control to materially
augment the supply of water in local
areas, such methods can never eliminate
RAIN MAKING
(Continued from page 28)
the need for conserving water. Water is a
renewable recource, but in a practical sense
it is often expendable. In many critical
areas the demand for it exceeds the sup-
ply, and although rain periodically falls
from the sky, we are dependent upon the
vagaries of the atmosphere for its arrival.
In the sense that it is renewable. Artificial
production of rain will rob Nature of
some of her prerogative, to be sure, but
relatively a small amount. It is necessary
to make wise use of existing water sup-
plies, for we cannot produce unlimited
amounts of water by present meteorologi-
cal techniques.
Summation
Scientific research and field demonstra-
tions have proved artificial rain-making is
possible. The most effective method
known is to drop silver iodide or frozen
carbon dioxide crystals into clouds.
Because of the tremendous investments
in farms, ranches, power utilities, and
other water-using industries, the effects of
artificial rain-making on the distribution
of water throughout the nation must be
carefully studied. Unfortunately, there are
sharply conflicting opinions even among
scientists concerning these effects.
In addition to these conflicting scien-
tific theories, there are complex legal prob-
lems which have curtained research and
practical applications in the field of ar-
tificial weather control.
Furthermore, even if there were no
conflicting scientific opinions or legal
problems involved, artificial weather con-
trol would be limited in the amount of
additional water it could produce for the
use of the country.
Finally, there is a real danger that
Americans will be deluded into regarding
artificial weather control as a substitute
for the conservation of our present water
resource.

band about the bad manners of a recent

Three cables in one! That
was the solution sought, for supplying
power, operational control and com-
munication to a pumping house 4y2 miles off shore in Lake Okee-
chobee, Florida.
As usual, Okonite engineers were consulted on the problem. Their
studies showed that it was possible to combine a three-fold function
in one cable. This was accomplished by the use of Okolite high-
voltage insulation whose electrical characteristics permitted carrier
current to be superimposed on the power conductors.
The result was a single Okonite-insulated cable —steel-armored for
the 4&gt;/2 underwater miles, with a non-metallic sheath for an addi-
tional 2l/2 miles underground — which supplies not only power and
operation control, but a communication circuit as well.

of Materials, Elasticity, Elastic Stability,
Thin Plates and Shells, Vibration Analy-
sis, Advanced Dynamics, Plasticity, and
other advanced topics. Graduate students
came from all over the world to study
under Timoshenko and then to return to
spread his fame. At Michigan he con-
tinued to draw famous colleagues, and the
Summer Symposia of the Engineering Me-
chanics Department became known world
wide for their distinguished lectures. His
students of this era became the foremost
teachers of mechanics of today, and many
of them are now the guiding heads of
large research organizations.
His books were not neglected while
he was in Ann Arbor. With the help of
his students he wrote seven volumes in
an eight-year period. Most of them are
advanced books on stress analysis and
dynamics which are without an equal
today. As the number of papers written
by his distinguished students grew, he
wrote fewer himself, being content to
suggest avenues of investigation for them
and to aid them in their researches. It has
been said that Timoshenko had no stu-

dents in this era; they were all disciples.
Certainly few, if any, teachers have be-
come so respected and admired as did he.
His students and his writings, especially
his books, continually widened his circle
of friends. The impetus which he gave to
Engineering Mechanics at Michigan and
throughout the United States was tre-
mendous.
In the 1930's his wife's health began
to fail, and he accepted a Professorship
of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics at
Stanford in 1936, where the climate was
less severe. At Stanford University he
again constructed a nucleus of brilliant
colleagues and students, being aided and
abetted by his friend L. S. Jacobsen. He
continued to write books and some papers,
but not at the prodigious rate of the Ann
Arbor period. In 1938 upon the occasion
of his sixtieth birthday his colleagues and
former students published a memorial
volume in his honor. He continued to
teach a few courses and to conduct his
famous seminars during World War II.
In 1945 and 1948 he brought out two
books, Theory of Structures and Advanced
Dynamics, respectively. Shortly after the
war he began to commute to Europe regu-
larly, so that he could collect data for a
book on the history of mechanics. Occa-
sionally he stops to visit old friends in
Ann Arbor, and during the Summer Ses-
sion of 1949 he and his friend Sir Richard
Southwell offered courses and conducted
seminars in the Summer Symposium in
Engineering Mechanics. As of this writ-
ing he is busy in Switzerland, delving into
the beginning of Applied Mechanics and
the lives of the famous men who fostered
this science.
The honors which have been bestowed
upon Stephen Timoshenko are many.
They include an honorary degree from the
University of Michigan in 1938. He re-
ceived the Worcester Reed Warner Medal
from the A.S.M.E. in 1936. Perhaps his
greatest honor was to have received the
Watt Medal in 1947.
The young grad should not try to im-
press his fellow workers with the extent
of his knowledge. The truth will leak out
soon enough.

Other Extraordinary
Properties
No other refractory offers such an un-
usual combination of properties. Norton
Stabilized Zirconia has a surprisingly
low thermal conductivity. In spite of the
fact that its specific gravity is twice that
of fire clay brick, its thermal conduc-
tivity is only 6 (English Units) as com-
pared with fire clay's 12, fused alumina's
20 ± and silicon carbide's 50 + .
Even more amazing is the electrical
resistivity of Norton Fused Stabilized
Zirconia . . . ranging from 2300 ohm-
cm at 1300° F to 0.37 ohm-cm at 4000°F.
Yes, it's just the opposite to the usual
rule that resistance increases with the
temperature.
Equally valuable to processing indus-
tries is the chemical stability of Norton
Stabilized Zirconia, manifested in its
ability to resist both oxidizing and reduc-
ing atmospheres at high temperatures
and its chemical inertness in contact
with titanates.

You often hear folks remark on the clear,
undistorted TV pictures they enjoy.
"It's almost like having the entertainers

These lifelike pictures are no accident
— they call for the greatest care in pro-
ducing your TV set. For example, con-
sider how picture tubes are built. At
half a dozen manufacturing stages, a
tiny difference in temperature or vacuum
can make a big difference in picture
quality. So, many makers control their
ovens and other equipment with super-
sensitive electronic instruments built by
Honeywell's Industrial Division.
And this is just one of many important
fields where Honeywell controls play a
vital role in the modern world.
Today, for example, fabulous new
controls for aviation, guided missiles
and atomic energy are being developed
by the men in our expanding engineer-
ing and research sections. Many of these
workers are keen-minded young men
only recently graduated from college.
Equipped with the latest scientific
instruments, they find their work at
Honeywell often calls for fascinating
research in the realm of pure science.
There's real opportunity for engineers
at Honeywell —for this is the age of

Capitalist!
Johnny used to be a laborer. Brother Tim still is.
Both cut lawns. Both used to use customers'
hand mowers. Each could do one big lawn a day,
and got $2 for it.
Tim spent his $2 on movies and candy. Johnny
saved some money, borrowed some more, and
bought a power mower. Now he can cut 5 lawns
a day, and so makes $10.
He puts aside $2 a day to pay back his loan,
and $1 toward another mower when this one
wears out.
He still has seven dollars where he used to
have two, and is helping more people get their
lawns cut when they want them. Yet some enemies
of business would say that that shows Johnny is
too big; he should be limited in the number of
people he can serve.
These same strange enemies would prevent
Johnny from setting aside $ 1 a day out of his own
earnings, to buy a new mower when this one
wears out. (Of course, that means Johnny would
go back to hand labor at $2 a day, and fewer
people would be served—but these strange
people don't care about that.)
And some people say Johnny should be forced
to share his $7 with Tim so Tim can keep on
spending his $2 for movies and candy.
Sound ridiculous? Yes, but every one
of these charges and demands is
leveled at American business today.

in digital computation in a thorough man-
ner, to meet the growing needs of in-
dustry.
Up to now, automatic computing has
been mainly a military show. With re-
search problems growing beyond the grasp
of individual experimenters and consum-
ing the time of whole batteries of engi-
neers, industry claims a definite need for
calculators and trained personnel.
A simple example of the importance of
these machines is the fact that the time-
fused bombs, guided missiles and the
atom bomb would have been impossible
without them. They are just as important
in research on problems for improvement
of peace-time products. Many problems
of vibration, noise and structural strength
in automobiles, which, in the past, had
to be solved by trial and error method on
a test track may now be worked out on
this machine at a fabulous savings in man-
power and expense. The improvement
of products and the discovery of new
products will widen work opportunities
and provide a better standard of living

Use X-Ray for Inspecting Welded Ships
140,000-volt X-ray radiographic equip-
ment helps build better welded steel ships
at a large Eastern shipbuilding yard.
Radiographs taken with this Westing-
house X-ray equipment locate defects in
the hull welds. These imperfections may
serve as concentration points for stresses.
X-ray inspection aids in eliminating these
defects from critically stressed sections
of the hull, and in improving the average
weld quality.
In this shipbuilding yard, the X-ray
equipment is shock-mounted in a welded
steel enclosure. The X-ray control equip-
ment is located in the front of the cabi-
net; the high-voltage transformer is
mounted immediately behind the control
cabinet. A compartment above the trans-
former and behind the control cabinet is
used for storage of the cable and X-ray
tubehead. Lifting eyes at the top of the
cabinet permit it to be moved by crane to
any inspection site on the hull. A 50-ft
cable connecting the tubehead to the unit
permits radiographic inspection to be
made anywhere within a 50-foot radius
of the unit.
With the help of x-ray radiographic in-
spection, welded ships have proved their
efficiency, reliability, and sea-worthiness
under all types of service.

Results and Conclusions
The results of this numerical integra-
tion are presented in Figs. 6 and 7.
Figure 6 clearly shows the effect that
density can have on the trajectory of the
ball. It is seen that on the hot, low den-
sity day, the ball travels some six per-
cent farther than on the cooler, higher
density day. If a twenty foot fence were
placed so that the ball would just clear it
on the hot day, on the cold day, the ball
would land at the foot of the fence. The
length of path corresponds very closely
to that for an average home run. This cor-
respondence supports the assumptions
made for the initial conditions.
Figure 7 presents the velocity of the
ball along the path. It is interesting to
note the large initial deceleration, and
also that after the ball reaches its peak,
its velocity remains very nearly constant,
decreasing slightly on its downward flight.
This fact is not apparent without analysis.
If the ball were to travel in a vacuum, the
velocity would steadily increase on its
downward flight until, upon reaching the
ground, it would have the same velocity
that it started with.7
A fairly large number of well hit, long
balls are just short of home runs. The
results of this investigation clearly show
that the effect of decreased density on a
hot day can turn some of these long balls
into home runs.

MANY OF THE difficulties of severe operation have
been corrected or eliminated through new "heavy
duty" lubricants. "Hot engine sludge" in hard-
working equipment like this bulldozer is greatly
reduced. Buses, heavy contractors' equipment, tur-
bines, diesel locomotives, marine engines, and many
other types of engine, whether gasoline or diesel,
require fewer overhauls. These advances made since
the war have been mainly due to the work in addi-
tives by research and development people.
How Chemistry adds to Lubricants...
Multiplies "Heavy Duty" Efficiency
AUTOMOTIVE engine life and performance
XX under severe conditions have been greatly
improved in recent years both because of prog-
ress in equipment design and advances in fuels
and lubricants.
The automotive and petroleum industries have
overcome the problems of "hot engine sludge,"
or high-temperature deposits and varnishes col-
lecting on vital parts—through chemical research
that has led to both better refining methods
and development of additives that have elim-
inated these difficulties.
The new additives have a triple role. They
improve oil stability through inhibiting oxida-
tion. They prevent bearing corrosion. And,
through their detergent action, they eliminate
deposits from fuel or other sources—thus supple-
menting improved refining methods.
Many companies, both automotive and petro-
leum, have contributed to the development of
the new additives through both co-operative and
independent research and experiment. And the
research and development men of Standard Oil
have had a major share in the improvement of
lubricants for "heavy duty" service.
Intensive research to develop even better addi-
tives goes forward at our Whiting laboratories.
Here is a challenging opportunity for young men
with advanced training in chemistry and engi-
neering. In projects devoted to additives, they
can have a part in petroleum progress that will
strengthen national production and military pre-
paredness wherever severe engine service requires
"heavy duty" lubricating oils.

"She's not too bad at drawing cows or

hears a new word, she expects me to draw
it for her. She doesn't take no for an
answer ... so, for 'Freedom,' I drew her
an American Flag and she was satisfied.
"Later I thought: how else can you describe
a word like 'Freedom'? For instance . . .
"When a churchbell peals in America, it
rings Freedom. Every time we mark a
ballot, it votes for Freedom. Each pay-

drawn on Freedom. Our newspapers
have a rustle of Freedom to them.
'Freedom is a major subject in every good
American School. The auto you drive is
a deluxe Freedom model. All radio and
TV sets are tuned in to Freedom. And
every cop pounds a beat on Freedom
Street ... in America.
"Sure, we like Freedom, and some govern-
ments abroad don't. But . . . watch out
for the home-grown commies, socialists
and hate-mongers among us who are
trying to get us to turn our Freedoms
over to the 'State.' Watch out, too, for
wasteful splurging of public funds by
the government . . . federal, state and
local, alike. This is one sure shortcut to
the loss of our personal Freedoms.
"Y'know, our fathers passed along to us
a pretty wonderful country . . . with

we, in turn, handed over a socialistic,
bankrupt America to our kids?"

through is proportoinal to the voltage ap-
plied, he said.
Semi-conductors do not follow this law.
They can be arranged to conduct current
well in one direction and poorly in the
opposite direction, he said. In other ar-
rangements, the current conducted can be
increased by increasing the light falling
on the unit, or by a second and smaller
current, entering through another wire.
He said that before the war, two dif-
ferent groups of scientists made observa-
tions of another semi-conductor effect
called electro-luminescence, in which pas-
sage of an electrical current through crys-
tals of silicon carbide, or of zinc sulfide,
caused them to glow witth a cold light.

In recent years the trend of motor control has changed from open cycle to that of closed cycle
control. In most applications it is desirable to maintain motor speed or torque at some prede-
termined value. In closed cycle control the desired quantity is conitored and any change
from a desired value is detected as an error. Since the error is small, it must be amplified.
The amplified error is then returned into the system in such a manner as to produce correction.
The amplifying devices used may take on a number of forms depending upon the amplifica-
tion required and the operating power level encountered. These devices may include elec-
tronic as well as magnetic amplifiers.
Courses are offered in the Electrical Engineering Department on the principles of motor
control. In the departmental machinery laboratories, a number of applications of open and
closed cycle motor control can be found.

yield strengths were somewhat lower, and
the elongation was about the same. Opti-
mum properties were secured in bars nor-
malized and tempered at 1200° F. The
best level of properties was obtained in
the 2.79 percent silicon melt. The best
level of properties was obtained in the
2.79 percent silicon melt. These were
134,000 psi tensile strength, 91,000 psi
yield strength, and 8 percent elongation.
Discussion and Conclusion
It is apparent from the foregoing tabu-
lations and charts of properties of ductile
iron that a wide range of properties may
be secured by variations in heat treatment
and composition. High levels of prop-
erties are obtainable in heavy, as well as
light sections.
Maximum strengths can be secured in
the as-cast condition by proper balancing
of chemical composition and section thick-
ness. In general, the compositional con-
trol should be based on silicon content,
rather than carbon or phosphorus contents.
Carbon exerts little effect on the strength
or other properties of ductile iron. Phos-
phorus decreases the strength as-cast, and
should be restricted to the lowest practi-
cal level. The inter-relation of silicon con-
tent, section size and properties in as-cast
ductile iron is shown in Figures 10a-10c.
The maximum strength in all sections is
secured at 1.5-2.5 per cent silicon, with
lower strengths at higher and lower sili-
con levels. Tensile strengths in excess of
100,000 psi can be secured in 1-2 inch
sections.
Considerably higher tensile strengths
may be secured by heat treatment of duc-
tile iron. This material can be oil or water
quenched without undue danger of crack-

ing in fairly uniform sections. High
strengths in the range of 130,000 to
150,000 psi can be obtained by oil
quenching or air cooling, then tempering
at 1100-1200° F. or by isothermal trans-
formation at 1100-1200° F.
Maximum elongation is obtained by
full annealing of ductile iron to produce
a fully ferritic matrix. In this condition,
elongation in excess of 25% is obtain-
able in sections up to three inches thick.
In general, elongation decreases with both
increasing silicon content and increasing
section size, so that controlled ductility
may be secured by a proper balance of
silicon content and section size.
In the annealed section which possess
the high ductility, characteristic of ductile
iron, the tensile and yield strengths are
directly dependent on silicon content and
section size.

Influence of Silicon Content and

of Ductile Iron. (As Cast)
between both mechanical properties and
silicon content and mechanical properties
and section thickness, it seems reasonable
that approximate formulas could be writ-
ten for the calculation of certain mechani-
cal properties of ductile iron if silicon
content and section thickness are known.
It must be emphasized, however, that
these calculations will hold only for fully
annealed ferritic irons with spheroidal
graphite structures and with 3.50 T.C.,
0.30-0.40 Mn, and 1.20-1.50 Ni.
A formula which can be used to calcu-
late tensile strength with a fair degree
of accuracy, at least for the averaged
properties is:
T.S. = 50,000 -f 11,000 (% Si) —
2,000 (section thickness in inches). A

con content on section sensitivity could

Other formulas which can be applied
with fair accuracy are:

Elongation = 23 — 3 (%Si — 1)

The old engineer pulled his favorite
engine up to the water tank and briefed
the new fireman. The fireman got up on
the tender and brought the spout down all
right but somehow his foot caught in the
chain and he stepped right into the tank.
As he floundered in the water, the
engineer watched him with a jaundiced
eye.
"Just fill the tank with water, Sonny,"
he drawled. "No need to stamp the stuff

"My deah Mr. Brown," she gushed,
"fancy meeting you on the car. Am I

The sedate gent looked up at the girl

Photography...
an able helper all
through engineering

In the laboratory, in the drafting room, on
tire production line, photography has become
a most important tool. It records fleeting instru-
ment traces for study. It examines metal structure
through electron micrography, x-ray diffraction, and
microradiography.
The use of photography in engineering, business, and
industry is increasing steadily. This has led graduates in the
physical sciences and in engineering to find positions with
the Eastman Kodak Company. If you are interested, consult
your placement office about arranging an interview with
an Eastman representative, or write direct to Business and
Technical Personnel Department, Eastman Kodak Company,
Rochester 4, N. Y.
FUNCTIONAL PHOTOGRAPHY
serves industrial, commercial, and scientific progress
These traces provide helicopter engineers
with Information about blade stresses during
flight. Strain gages pick up bending at
different locations. Photography with its
perfect memory catches the whole story
as fast as it happens,



The Program includes assignments in machine operation and production functions.
Introducing
THE NEWEST MEMBER OF THE G-E TRAINING FAMILY
A Program for Developing Manufacturing Leaders
At General Electric, with its 200,000 products,
millions of dollars must be spent annually for ma-
terials alone . . . and more than 100,000 people in 119
plants comprise its manufacturing organization.
WHAT MANUFACTURING IS
Manufacturing comprises all the activities essential to
translating engineering designs into finished products.
This means that there are satisfying, rewarding careers
in manufacturing supervision and as technical specialists
in such important areas as purchasing, manufacturing
engineering, production, and wage rate work, and in the
specialized functions within each one. These include tech-
nical specialties: value analysis, materials handling, opera-
tion planning and methods analysis, inventory control, and
motion time study.
Men holding such jobs are finding them challenging
because of the skills, imagination, and understanding they
require . . . are finding them rewarding in professional
prestige and personal achievement.
AIMED AT THE NEED
To train men for such positions is the objective of the
Manufacturing Training Program, newest member of the
well-known group of comprehensive Company-wide train-
ing programs—Test, Chemistry and Metallurgy, Physics,
Business Training, and Advertising.
At the conclusion of the Program, members fit into
some phase of General Electric manufacturing, with their
on-the-job progress being carefully followed to assure the
most effective utilization of their skills. Recently, our
G-E manufacturing groups surveyed their future leader-
ship requirements. Within the next five years, their needs
for new leaders in direct supervision alone will exceed
1300 men!
OPPORTUNITY. . . AND YOU
If a career in manufacturing at General Electric interests
you—and if you have a technical education or a general
education with marked technical emphasis—talk with the
General Electric representative when he visits your
campus. Meanwhile, send for our booklet that describes
G-E manufacturing and the program in detail. Please

YOUR BEARING NOTEBOOK

How to keep a drill team
from marking time
The swivel on a drilling rig has to carry the tremendous
weight of drill pipe that's often three miles long. To carry
this load while permitting the pipe to rotate as fast as 2 50
R. P. M., oil equipment design engineers use Timken® flat
thrust bearings in the swivels. Due to line contact between
rollers and races, Timken bearings have extra load-
carrying capacity. True rolling motion and incredibly
smooth surface finish of Timken bearings practically elimi-
nate friction and wear. Costly breakdowns are prevented.
How swivels are mounted
on TIMKEN® bearings
The Timken bearing used to carry the thrust load in this
typical swivel is an on-apex thrust (type TT) bearing. A
single-row (type TS) Timken bearing is used at the top
position. Bearing adjustment is made with thin metal
shims between the cup carrier and the swivel housing.

ORGANIZING SERVICE
Are we asked to detect the approach of enemy attack through the strato-
sphere? Is there a commercially better method for extracting sugar from
beets? Can we help find alloys (for use in jet planes) that may replace those
made of materials now in short supply?
Unlimited numbers of technical problems confront our generation.
Among our expanding concepts of civilization and under the pressures of a
world-wide attack upon our basic freedoms we meet the questions of "Is it
possible?" and "What is best?" and "How may the data be obtained?" at
every turn.
An organization able to attack most problems, to follow through the in-
tricate maze of developments, to reconcile interests, is cooperating in a field
that gives maximum opportunity for service.

Low Maintenance for Jets
Jet engines give every indication of
reaching standards of dependability and
low maintenance previously unattained by
aircraft power plants, officials of the Gen-
eral Electric Company's Aircraft Gas Tur-
bine Department said.
E. S. Thompson, contracts manager,
said that combat reports from Korea show
higher utilization of jet aircraft than was
ever possible with piston-powered planes
of World War 2.
"We expected good maintenance re-
ports but, frankly, the results have ex-
ceeded our expectations," he said. "When
you consider that the jet-engine indus-
try in this country is not yet 10 years old,
we had every right to expect more serious
maintenance problems under combat con-
ditions, at first." N. F. Frischhertz, in
charge of application engineering for the
department, said total time on G-E pow-
ered aircraft has reached hundreds of
thousands of hours.
"We have engines in service that have
passed 600 hours in running time with-
out overhaul and are still going strong,"
he said.
The J-47 is the No. 1 production en-
gine for the Air Force and powers such
front-line planes as the North American
F-86, the six-jet Boeing B-47 Bomber
and the Convair B-36 Bomber, which has
four jets in addition to six piston en-
gines. Produced by G. E. at Lynn, Mass.,
and Lockland, Ohio, the J-47 also powers
the North American B-45 Bomber, the
Republic XF-91 Interceptor, the Martin
XB-51 three-jet Bomber and the Chase
XC-123A Cargo Plane.
Half of Plane's Cost Now
Goes for Electronics
A wide range of manufacturers are re-
quired to produce today's complex air-
plane because of the new accents in de-
sign and equipment. A decade ago 85%
to 90% of the cost of an airplane was
represented in the airframe, engine and
propeller. Today, only about 50% of the
design and the cost is expended on air-
frame and engine.
Today's planes have such devices as
automatic fire control systems, tracking
systems, radar systems, air refueling sys-
tems and other electronic gear which ac-
count for half the cost. A particular
compiled by JOHN BORROWMAN
1944 plane carried 1,000 pounds of elec-
tronic items; its counterpart now has
5,000 pounds.

Cold Test for Jet Accessories
A laboratory technician at the Westing-
house Aviation Gas Turbine Division at
South Philadelphia, Pa., watches as a new
fuel pump is tested at the low tempera-
tures it will encounter at high altitudes.
Jet engine accessories must function at
temperatures as low as 67 degrees below
zero, and each new design is subjected
to cold tests in this cylindrical chamber.
The fuel tank containing the alcohol
that is circulated through the fuel pump
is cooled with powdered dry ice in the
cold-chest in the foreground. Fuel lines
are insulated with crinkled aluminum foil
that is pressed in place by hand, permit-
ting quick and simple changes in the test
set-up.
Make Rectifiers of
Processed Germanium
A tiny copper-colored "bell", not much
larger than a thimble, may soon be pro-
viding the proper kind of electric power
for operation of such essential defense
equipment as radar, sonar, and intricate
computing machines.
The device, now being produced in
limited quantities here by the General
Electric Company's Lighting and Rectifier
Department, is an industrial rectifier made
of processed germanium metal.
A rectifier is a device for converting
alternating current to direct current.
The new rectifier, G-E engineers said,
performs this conversion operation more
efficiently than existing rectifiers made of
selenium and copper oxide.
The "bell-shaped" rectifiers are design-
ed for power conversion in electronic de-
vices where size and weight requirements
are at a premium.
Development of the industrial german-
ium rectifier, they pointed out, was made
possible by G-E scientists who, after years
of research, created a new process for
treating germanium metal to bring out its
"rectification" — or conversion — proper-
ties.
G-E engineers said that germanium is
"perhaps the best rectifying metal yet dis-
covered." But, they pointed out, only a
small portion of this rare metal occurs
with such excellent rectifying character-
istics in its natural state.
The new process, they said, will produce
sufficient high quality rectifying german-
ium metal to assure steadily increasing
production of the new "bell-shaped"
rectifiers.
Atom Power Plant Byproducts
Important
In addition to generating electricity,
future atomic power plants may produce
plutonium for use in atomic bombs, or as
fuel in other atomic power plants, a Gen-
eral Electric scientist has said. He also
cited radiation for sterilizing food and
drug products as another possible divi-
dend from such installations.
Dr. Kenneth H. Kingdon, technical
manager of the technical department of
the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory at
Schenectady, which G.E. operates for the
U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, said
that these by-products might go a long
way toward balancing the high cost of
atomic fuels, and making atomic power
economical.
Early estimates of the cost of producing
the enriched atomic fuel contemplated
for use in reactors for power plants are
considerably higher than the present aver-
age cost of coal to produce comparable
amount of power, he said.
"It is clear," he added, "that the infant
atomic power industry has a major job to
do in making its enriched fuel more
cheaply and in designing the cheapest pos-
sible plants for its burning. It appears
difficult but not impossible to make both
ends meet."
An atomic power plant could produce
plutonium or other atomic fuel as a by-
product of power making, and such new

DIGEST

Ch. E's at Du Pont
Work as production supervisors prepares
chemical engineers for jobs in management
The last issue of the Digest described
the broad opportunities offered
chemical engineers in research and
development at Du Pont. Now let's
look at the opportunities in produc-
tion supervision.
In this important phase of plant
operation, Ch. E.'s and others are
responsible for investment in plant
facilities, supply of raw materials,
supervision of operation and main-
tenance, cost and shipment of fin-
ished products, as well as personnel
relations, training and safety.

George B. Bradihaw, Jr., B.S.Ch.E., M.I.T.
'40, assistant superintendent, inspects a unit
used in ammonia synthesis operation.
Normally, chemical engineers en-
ter production supervision by reason
of preference and special abilities.
Their first step depends on which of
ten operating departments they work
in. For example, in one department
they follow a training program as
student operators. In another, train-
ing in a plant laboratory familiarizes
the engineers with processes and
products.
After the training period, the men
are given supervisory responsibili-
ties, usually starting as foreman. At
this level they meet problems like
these:
1. Occasionally, in a still connected
to a sulfonator by a pipe line with a
single valve, the product disappeared,
and residue increased. The supervi-
sor's study of control data showed
that small amounts of gaseous sul-
fur trioxide were venting into the
still causing decomposition of the
product. His recommended installa-
tion of a positive pressure block in
the pipe line eliminated the difficulty.
2. A high temperature batch reaction
process was revised to increase pro-
duction of a critical material. For
safety, adjacent reactors had to be
shut down as work on each unit pro-
ceeded. Thesupervisorplanned main-
tenance and batch schedules to min-
imize costly down-time and re-trained
personnel for the new process.
In solving such problems, super-
visors have an opportunity to use all
their knowledge and ingenuity.
Equally important, they acquire the

What Happened to Commercial Airships?
BY
WILLIAM PALLUTH, '53E
It was no ordinary trial, in the year
1937; it was a quick trial in which the
defendant had little chance to speak for
herself. She was convicted of murder and
laid away to rot and be forgotten. But
she was not forgotten—not by those who
knew her. New witnesses have since been
brought into the picture, and new evi-
dence which proves her innocence. Yet,
14 years later, she still awaits a new trial
—a fair trial. But why tell you these
things? Let me place the facts before you
so that you may pass judgment yourself.
The victim of this unfair trial was the
rigid airship. "What is an airship?"
I'm asked. Well, first of all, airships are
the largest by far of all aircraft, sometimes
as large as an ocean liner. They utilize as
a lifting power the difference in weight
between the volume of air displaced and
the volume of hydrogen or helium that
they carry in numerous gas cells. They
have rigid frameworks of duralumin rings
and girders which give them their shape
and an outer covering of metalized fabric
which reduces drag and reflects heat. The
engines are either suspended outside the
frame or built in with just the propellers
on the outside. In either case the engines
are accessible while in flight. The control
cabin and passenger compartments are
usually attached underneath the frame in
a streamlined nacelle. On the stern, four
large fins and control surfaces; serve to
keep the ship stable in the air. These air-
ships can carry passengers and cargo over
long distances with a great amount of
safety and .... But wait a minute! I'm
getting ahead of my story.
In order to present our case, I can think
of nothing better than to relate the true
histories of several of the most famous
and best remembered airships. I am sure
that the facts will speak for themselves.
The first commercial rigid airship to be
placed in scheduled service after World
War I was the German Bodeiisee of
1919 vintage, which could carry 30 pas-
sengers at speeds rivaling that of the air
transports of the day. After only 88 days
of operation, during which she carried
2380 passengers on 103 flights, the Bo-

William Palluth
densee was seized by the Allies and taken
to Italy where it was dismantled in 1920.
Another craft that many will remember
was the Shemvidoiib, the first American-
built rigid airship. This ship was a copy
of a 1916 German zeppelin captured in
France during the war. She was obsolete
in design and flown by an inexperienced
crew, most of whom had never even seen
an airship before. Therefore it was no
wonder that when the Shenandoah flew
into a line squall on Sept. 3, 1925, she
broke in two. A great airship authority
today, Rear Admiral C. E. Rosendahl,
then a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy, took
command of the front half and free-bal-
looned it 14 miles to set it down safely
in a clearing.
The third ship to reach fame was the
2,470,000 cubic foot ZR-3, built at Fried-
richshafen, Germany, for reparations to
the United States. From 1924 to 1932
this ship, better known as the Los An-
geles, was used as a flying laboratory and
training ship for hundreds of pilots and
crew members. In June, 1932, she was
decommissioned to economize on opera-
tions. The ship was still used in training,
however, and still flew many years later to
welcome the Hindenburg. She made 331
flights with a total of 4320 flying hours.
The Los Angeles was still in flying condi-
tion 14 years after it was delivered, truly
&lt;— USS Akron under construction showing rings and longitudinal girders.
a commendable record for the design and
structure. It was finally dismantled after
long years of service.
The year 1928 brought the famous
Graf Zeppelin, the first commercial air-
ship designed for transoceanic passenger
travel. She was 755 feet long and had a
gas capacity of 3,700,000 cubic feet. This
great ship circumnavigated the globe in
20 days, traveling 22,000 miles and
stopping only at Friedrichshafen, Tokyo,
Los Angeles, and Lakehurst. She carried
a full load of 22 passengers, mail, cargo,
and crew of 40. For six years the Graf
carried on scheduled flights between South
America, the United States, and Central
Europe, during which she carried 13,110
passengers, 100,500 lbs. of mail, and
134,800 lbs. freight for a total of
1,053,391 miles in 590 flights, 144 of
these flights ocean crossings. Imme-
diately after the Hindenburg disaster the
Graf was taken out of service until Ger-
many could obtain helium. She remained
in her hangar alongside the newly finish-
ed Graf II until the end of World War
II when both ships were destroyed by
their crews to prevent them from falling
into the hands of the Allies. The Graf II
was the sister ship to the Hindenburg. It
had never even been inflated.
The next American airship to be com-
missioned was the 6,500,000 cubic foot
Akron, finished in 1932 at a cost of
$5,358,000. On April 3, 1933, the Akron
left Lakehurst with the calibration of a
New England radio direction finder sta-
tion as its mission. Five hours later it
was at the bottom of the Atlantic. From
the stories of the survivors, the blame was
placed partly on the meager knowledge of
weather at the time and partly on the use
of an altimeter which was nothing more
than an aneroid barometer. This instru-
ment reads about 1000 feet for every drop
in pressure of only 1 inch of mercury. The
ship had flown into the central low pres-
sure area of a terrific storm; the altimeter
read about 800 feet. When she lifted her
prow to climb, her tail struck the water,
dragging the great ship into the sea. A

Introduction
The problem to be discussed in this
paper is the possibility of producing a
20 M.M. projectile by powder metallurgy.
In approaching this problem I will en-
deavor to show the advantages and disad-
vantages of using powder metallurgy over
the previous methods of production. The
comparison will be carried out from a
standpoint of production costs, essential
equipment, materials, and physical prop-
erties required. After making these com-
parisons the relative herits will be weighed
and recommendations will be made.
Discussion of Powder Metallurgy
Before entering directly into the prob-
lem at hand, a discussion of the me-
chanics of powder metallurgy shall be
made. Powder metallurgy is the forming
of metal parts from fine metal powders
compressed to shape by mechanical means
and held there by bonding of the molecu-
lar edges of the powder grains when heat-
ed. This process is accomplished in three
main steps. First, the metal powder is
mixed to achieve the desired properties
of composition as in the case of alloying.
Second, the mixed powder is compressed
in the die, between an upper and lower
punch at pressures from twenty to fifty
tons per square inch. The metal powder
is now in the form of a green briquette
which has very low strength. This bri-
quette is similar to a green sand core
used for molding purposes, and must be
handled with care. The last step is known
as sintering and is similar to the baking
of mold cores. Sintering is carried out at a
temperature below the melting point of
the main constituent in the briquette.
Sintering is also carried out in a controll-
ed atmosphere so that the desired physical
properties may be obtained.
In the above paragraph it was stated
that pressures between twenty and fifty
tons per square inch are used in forming
the green briquette. The exact pressure
to be used will depend on the size of the
briquette, the shape of the briquette, and
the density of the briquette. The size of
the briquette enters because a much higher
pressure must be used to equally compress
a large briquette relative to a small bri-
quette. Here shape also enters because a
briquette may have sections which vary in
BY
JAMES C. STREICHER, '52E
size and corresponding pressure adjust-
ment must be followed. Actually the two
factors mentioned above could be sum-
med up by the third factor, density. This
is true because the most important vari-
able in powder metal products is the uni-
formity and exactness of the density of
the composing powder. For this reason,
the pressure used, along with the compo-
sition of the powder, is to control the
density of the briquette. Density control
is also the reason that briquetting dies
have a pressing action from both top and
bottom. To illustrate this, Diagram No. 1
is a good example. If the pressure were
only applied from the top, the result
would be a briquette of greater compact-
ness at the top and lesser compactness at
the bottom. Here one can also see the
effect of varied shape in briquettes on
punch design.
One advantage of powder metallurgy
over other means of fabrication is that
it may be used to form, in a few simple
operations, a part that would otherwise
take several expensive machining, stamp-
ing, or forging operations. Powder metal-
lurgy can, in some cases, be used in
place of die casting. As an example of
what can be done with powder metals,
one could cite a spur gear. The ordinary
method of producing a spur gear would
be by taking a circular slug and machining
it down to a concentric surface and then
cutting the teeth by successive milling
operations. With powder metallurgy this
somewhat drawn out method can be elim-
inated, and the gear can be made in one
pressing operation, with possibly a small
amount of clean up grinding after sin-
tering.
Powdered metals do not have as good
properties physically as do most of the
steel alloys. The reason for this is that the
porosity of powder metals prevents them
from reaching very high tensile strength
and hardness, but tensiles up to 100,000
p.s.i. and hardness equivalent to 22.8
Rockwell "C" have been obtained. Com-
pared to this would be an S.A.E. 1040
steel, as quenched, which will have a
tensile strength of 110,000 p.s.i. and a
hardness of 26 Rockwell "C". An S.A.E.
1080 steel, however, will have a tensile
strength of 190,000 p.s.i. and a hardness
of 40 Rockwell "C" in the "as quenched"
state. Therefore, it is apparent that a
plain high carbon steel has better physical
properties than a powder metal. In the
case of alloy steels, even a greater dif-
ference in physical properties will result.
Alloy steels can, for example, have tensile
strengths up to 275,000 p.s.i. and hard-
ness up to 60 Rockwell "C". Elongation
in powder metals is proportionally less
than that of steel of equal tensile strength.
For instance, an iron powder compact
will have an elongation of 23.5% at a
tensile strength of 50,000 p.s.i., but a
1045 steel has an elongation of 23.5% at
a tensile strength as high as 93,000 p.s.i.
From these facts the conclusion can be
made that powder metals cannot compete
with steel where vary high physical prop-
erties are desired.
The Previous Method of Producing
20 M.M. Projectiles
In determining whether powder metal-
lurgy can be used in producing a 20 M.M.
projectile more economically than by the
previous method, the following facts taken
from a company who manufactured pro-
jectiles will be of considerable value. In
setting up an operation to produce 2,500
projectiles per day, the following costs
were incurred. The first operation which
consisted of machining the I.D., turning
the O.D., and threading a section of the
I.D. was performed on an automatic
screw machine. Eleven of these machines
were used at an initial cost of $22,169
each or $243,859 total. Total tooling costs
in setting up these machines was $19,250.
The second operation consisted of plunge
grinding the O.D. to size. Here four
magazine fed Cincinnati Centerless
Grinders were used at an initial cost of
$19,350 each or $77,400 total. At this
point the copper rotating band was swag-
ed on the body of the projectile. This was
performed on four B &amp; J punch presses
with a cost of $2,134 each or $8,558 total.
Here four dies at $4,400 total and four
hand trips at $320 total were used. After
swaging, the band, groove behind the
band, and face of the projectile were turn-
ed to size. Here three Economy skivers
were used at a cost of $8,123 each or
$24,369 total. Tooling on these grinders
was $180 total. The final operation con-
sisted of a 100% inspection which was

3 B&amp;J Punch Presses 8,558

Total Initial Cost .$378,336
Summing up the individual costs in
table form gives a total initial cost of
$378,336 to begin producing 1,000,000
20 M.M. projectiles per month. In figur-
ing the spread of these initial costs a total
order of 12,000,000 projectiles was used
as the basis of valuation. Therefore, the
initial cost applicable to one projectile
378,336
would be or $.0314 per
12,000,000
piece.
In the 20 M.M. projectile an F.S. 1137
steel was used. This steel has a density of
.11884 no./in3. Therefore, the weight of
each projectile would be approximately:
(27) (159) (27) (159)
Wt. = X X —
(32) (64) (32) (64)
X.05 = .485 lbs. per piece.
The cost of F.S. 1137 steel is $.1705 lb.
which will give a unit price of .07105 x
.415—$.02948 per piece. The next cost
to investigate is labor. The capacity of an
automatic screw machine was estimated
at 192 pieces per hour and at standard
wage rates this would give a cost of
$.00374 per piece. The magazine fed
Cincinnati Grinder had a capacity of 570
pieces per hour with a cost of $.00098
per piece. The B&amp;J Punch Press had a
capacity of 540 pieces per hour and a
cost of $.00206 per piece. The Economy
skiver had a capacity of 900 pieces per
hour and a cost of $.00062 per piece. An
inspector could inspect 2,700 pieces per
hour which gave an inspection cost of
$.00470. Once again these cost figures
will be put in table form and totaled for
clarity.

B&amp;J Punch Press 00206
Economy skiver 00062

Total Labor Cost ..$.01210
From the above table it is seen that the
total labor cost was $.01210 per piece. To
this $.02948 was added as steel cost per
piece. Added also was $.0314 deprecia-
tion charges on machinery and tools. This
sum of $.07298 was multiplied by 200%
for overhead costs. The resulting figure
was $.14596 per piece total cost to the
producer. A profit of 10% was figured
on this job with a resulting selling price
og $.16049 or 16.049** per projectile. The
figure of 200% of all other costs for
overhead was arrived at after considering
the other costs involved such as manage-
ment salaries, office salaries, and expenses,
selling and delivery costs, and mainten-
ance costs.
Proposed Method of Producing
20 M.M. Projectiles
It is now evident that in order to pro-
duce the 20 M.M. projectile by powder
metallurgy a total selling price of less
than 16..049^ per piece must be met. The
first thing that must be considered is the
method to be used in order to get a
powder metal which will have the desired
properties. The tensile strength of an
F.S. 1137 is approximately 85,000 p.s.i.
and the hardness is 21.7 Rockwell "C".
The outstanding feature of the F.S. 1137
steel is that the added surphur causes Mn S
and Fe S inclusions which makes this steel
very brittle after cold work. This brittle-
ness is of considerable importance in the
design of a projectile of this type be-
cause the desired effect is to have shatter
upon impact. Therefore, the main pre-
requisite in the powder to be used is brit-
tleness incorporated with shatter upon im-
pact. The powder that I have selected
is a Swedish iron powder with 20%
copper infiltrated. The physical properties
of this powder are in accord with the
properties necessary, as stated above. The
tensile strength of this powder is between
55,000 and 60,000 p.s.i. and hardness is
equivalent to 50 Rockwell "B". These
properties are lower than those of the F.S.
1137 steel, but this powder composition
is very brittle and above all will shatter
upon impact. The brittleness of this com-
position is due to the copper infiltration.
The true nature of the infiltration used in
this process is quite new and not too
many tests have been performed to tell
exactly why the compacts are brittle or
why they shatter upon impact. However,
by observing a ruptured compact of this
metal, the shatter characteristics are evi-
dent.
Due to the newness of using infiltra-
tion to control properties of powder
metals, only one manufacturer to my
knowledge uses this method at present;
the actual method of infiltration used is
not general knowledge, for competitive
security reasons. For this reason, my dis-
cussion here on how the infiltration is
carried out will be strictly my own theory
and subject to question. When the pow-
der is first pressed, it contains only Swed-
ish iron grains. The green briquette in
this form is sintered and moved to an
infiltration furnace. In this furnace, the
inclusions between the grains will be fill-
ed by molten copper which infiltrates due
to capillary action. The result will be a
powder metal with a composition of 75%
iron and 20% copper which is quite dense
and very brittle. After infiltration the
compact is resintered for binding purposes.
Having selected the powder to be used,
the next problem is to design the dies to
be used in making the projectile. The
die that I propose will be able to form
the I.D. and O.D. in one pressing opera-
tion. There are two main points to keep
in mind here. These are uniform density
of grains, the top of the piece should be
compressed 2.5 or 3 times as far as the
bottom should be compressed from be-
low, and that the die cavity must be of
such size as to allow for shrinkage in the
sintering operation due to a lessening of
intergranular distance.
In Diagram No. 2, the proposed die
design is shown. In the filled position,
the floating core rod will be toward the
top of the die. The lower punch will be
in its bottom position. As the top punch
comes into contact with the powder sur-
face, the lower punch will move upward
at a speed of 2.5 to 3 times less than the
speed of the upper punch. The reason
for this is that the ratio of compression
from the top to the compression from the
bottom should be 2.5 or 3 to 1 depend-
ing on the density desired. In this case
a ratio of 3-1 would be used because maxi-
mum density is desired. As the compres-
sion begins, the floating core rod will
move downward. This again is done so
that the ratio of compression can be
kept. The floating core rod will stop at a
point where the position for proper com-
pression of the projectile face has been
met. After the projectile has been com-
pletely compressed, the lower punch will
continue to move upward and eject the
green briquette. At this point, the projec-
tiles are put into trays and sent to the sin-
tering furnace. At this time also, an
automatic die filler will move into posi-
tion over the die cavity and admit another
charge of powder. The pressure used in
the punches, in this situation, would be
between twenty-five and thirty tons. Using
this pressure and a ratio for compression

AND POWER PROJECT
Engineering Economics and Politics
BY
F. N. MENEFEE, Professor of Engineering Mechanics
In many instances, it is not enough for
an engineer or an engineering organiza-
tion to determine that a project is engi-
neeringly feasible. It must likewise be
economically feasible or justifiable, and it
must be so set up that it falls within the
existing laws governing its locality and
type of construction. Then if the project
is a government project in many cases it
must run the gauntlet of politics. It is
these considerations that cause older engi-
neers to advise the student engineer to
acquire as much of law and accounting
and public relation knowledge as possible
in his younger days.
The St. Lawrence Seaway and Power
Project is an example in point. To begin
with many years ago, its political oppon-
ents questioned the advisability of con-
structing a high dam in a region where
now and then earth tremors occurred. The
foundation structure was questioned; the
safety of the Montreal area was made use
of to forestall progress of the idea. But
studies of earth tremors, foundations, ice
conditions and all other factors involving
the proposal finally brought forth a favor-
able verdict as to engineering feasibility.
Then the economics was attacked. The
expenditure was not justified; there would
not be enough demand for the transporta-
tion facilities and there would be no sale
for the power. These detracting charges
were brought often, and in spite of the
fact that in 1920, Hugh Cooper, a prom-
inent construction engineer offered in be-
half of clients to build and turn over to
the two governments, the navigational fea-
tures for a franchise granting his princi-
ples the right to develop the power. In
this case it may not have been feasible
politically to grant the request, but it
makes interesting contemplation to specu-
late on the benefits that would have oc-
curred to upper New York and lower
Canada from the generation of 2,000,000
horsepower of electrical energy, and to the
Great Lakes Basin had this transportation

F. N. Menefee
artery been available for the past thirty
years.
It might clarify what follows to briefly
state what the project consists of. (See
map on page 22). Note the northern
boundary of New York State just above
St. Regis; 68 miles up the river from
Montreal. From this point on to the At-
lantic ocean the river is wholly in Cana-
dian territory. From Tibbetts point to St.
Regis (the International section), it forms
the boundary between the United States
and Canada. Between Ogdensburg and
St. Regis in New York or Cornwall
across the river in Canada, the river drops
down over ninety feet in a series of rapids
known as the Long Saulte Rapids. The
1951 proposal, only slightly modified
from those of 1934 and 1941, was to
build a control dam at Ogdensburg and
an 81 foot head dam between St. Regis
and Cornwall. At this point Barnhart Is-
land divides the river into a north and a
south channel. The power house was to
be built in the north channel. The south
channel, with suitable alterations, was to
be the route taken by navigation. (See
plate 1, page 26). Since the boundary be-
tween the countries passed through the
midlength of the power house in the
north channel, the navigation channels
and locks were in the United States.
The plans have all been drawn with the
idea that the cost would be divided equal-
ly between the United States and Canada.
Preceding 1934, the various pieces of work
were estimated as to cost based on plans,
and so parcelled out that the costs were
equal. Canada drew the rebuilding of the
Welland Canal since it is in wholly Cana-
dian territory. They went to work at once
on the assumption that the United States
would ratify the treaty. They finished the
job in 1932 at a cost of $132,000,000.
In 1934, the United States Senate reject-
ed the treaty. Aside from finishing the
MacArthur Lock at Saulte Ste. Marie in
1943 at a cost of $14,000,000, the United
States has not done a great deal towards
its share of the originally proposed works.
In the meantime costs have increased
and the money to be spent by the United
States will total more than one half for
the reason that Canada got the new Wel-
land Canal done for $132,000,000 where-
as had she waited as did the United States
the cost would be nearer $200,000,000
today.
The Seaway as planned would create
a 27 foot navigation channel in the inter-
national section of the river through the
building of the necessary dams, canals,
and locks; and a channel of the same
depth in the connecting channels between
the lakes. The Welland Canal locks and
MacArthur Lock at the Soo are built to
Seaway Specifications with a minimum
of thirty-feet depth over the sills.
The main dam and power station
would be at Barnhart Island just above St.
Regis and Massena, New York, with
navigation canal and two locks.
Below the main dam and in Canadian
territory there would be a 15 mile stretch
of dredging and some bridging over the
canal at Beauharnois; and another 10

BARON RAYLEIGH
BY
JESSE ORMONDROYD, Professor of Engineering Mechanics
Our British cousins once had the quaint
custom of designating the participants in
an important cricket match either as
gentlemen or as players. The gentlemen
and the players were equally skilled in the
technique of the game, the difference be-
ing that the gentlemen were not paid to
play but the players were. In this sense
Lord Rayleigh was a "gentleman" phys-
icist. John William Strutt was born into
the aristocracy of England with hereditary
lands and title. His work in physics was
all done for the love of the game. He was
an "amateur" physicist in the true sense
of the term. He is chiefly remembered to-
day as the author of the most famous
treatise on vibration and acoustics ever
written, the Theory of Sound. This two
volume work, first published just seventy-
five years ago, is still growing in popu-
larity and use with physicists and engi-
neers. In fact, engineers are just be-
ginning to be able to read this book. The
growing number of engineers who work
in the fields of mechanical vibration and
sound must sooner or later dip into these
two volumes which are still an almost
inexhaustible mine of information. But
these volumes, important as they arc, form
only a small part of the published works
of their author. In the fifty-four years be-
tween his graduation from Cambridge and
his death Lord Rayleigh wrote, besides
the Theory of Sound, 446 papers on sub-
jects which covered almost the whole-
range of the physics of the period. This
production of papers averages between
8 and 9 a year. Anyone who has ever
written even one scientific or technical
paper of some originality will realize that
this productivity was amazing. And it
was steady, continuing at an almost uni-
form rate up to the date of his death. It
is still more amazing when it is consider-
ed that during the same period Rayleigh
found time to travel fairly extensively, to
be Cavendish Professor of Experimental
Physics at the University of Cambridge
for five years, to be Professor of Natural
Philosophy in the Royal Institution of
London for nine years, to be Secretary
of the Royal Society for eleven years, to
be President of the Royal Society for sev-

eral years, to be Chancellor of the Univer-
sity of Cambridge for eleven years and to
be President of the Society of Physical Re-
search for many years. During this time
he carried out an enormous number of
physical and psychical experiments and
found time to entertain a host of friends
at his estate and to preside over many
scientific meetings. None of this was
done to gain wealth or fame, since he had
been born to both.
John William Strutt was born in 1842.
During his youth his health was so frail
that he could not stand the life in either
Eton or Harrow, both of which he at-
tended briefly. His early schooling was
gotten in special private schools. During
the early schooling he showed an aptitude
for mathematics and took up the hobby
of photography, an art which was then
new and difficult. He entered Cambridge
at the age of 19 in 1861 and graduated
from that University in 1865. His under-
graduate period in Cambridge coincided
almost exactly with the course of the Civil
War in the then dis-United States. In the
university he specialized in mathematics
neglecting the study of the ancient class-
ics, modern languages, and literature.
In those days theoretical mechanics was
considered as a branch of mathematics.
It is interesting to note that in 1861,
ninety-one years ago, young Strutt began,
as a freshman under the tutor E. J. Routh,
to study theoretical mechanics at that level
at which only our graduate students study
it in the University of Michigan today.
This, however, cannot be considered as a
glaring example of cultural lag, since in
those days in England only the favored
few studied mechanics at all, whereas in
Michigan today every engineering stu-
dent is forced to study this subject
whether he wants to or not. In Cam-
bridge at that time were such famous pro-
fessors of mathematics and physics as
Stokes, Todhunter, and Whewell, the first
English historian of science, as well as
Routh. These names are still known to
modern students, particularly at the grad-
uate level. During his four undergraduate
years he had no training in experimental
work; there were no laboratories at Cam-
bridge then. As the son of a peer of
England he wore a distinctive academic
gown and had the privilege of eating
with the professors during his undergrad-
uate years. In 1865 he became Senior
Wrangler in his class; that is, he was
number one in the special mathematics
final examinations. He also won the
Smith's Prize in mathematics. While these
distinctions mean nothing to us now, they
then elevated their recipients to a sort of
academic Hall of Fame. As a graduate
student, young Strutt studied Maxwell's
papers and took some work in chemical
analysis, the only formal training he ever
got in laboratory techniques. He was a
self-made physical experimentalist. This
should not astonish us if we remember
that every famous creative physicist before
his time had also gained experimental
skill without previous instruction.
It is of interest to review the state of
the physical sciences in 1865. The strict-
ly mechanical construction of the uni-
verse had received strong support through
the success of the undulatory theory of
light and the foundation of thermody-
namics. The principle of conservation of
energy had only recently found general
acceptance through the work of Mayer,
Joule, and Kelvin. Kelvin, age 40, was in
the zenith of his activity and it was largely
through his efforts that the second law of

Brief History of the Disc Brake
Around 1940, or the period just prior
to World War II some of the major auto-
motive companies, automotive supplier
companies and most of the large railroads
realized that the conventional drum and
shoe type brake had reached their
maximum capacity. Many extensive ex-
periments were carried out by these
companies to obtain a brake that would
carry on where the drum brake could
no longer be utilized. The results
of these tests proved that this type of
brake has definite advantages when used
on heavy automotive vehicles and railroad
cars. Experiments also revealed that this
versatile disc brake could be used very
successfully in improving the braking
qualities of airplanes because of the limit-
ed space and weight available for brakes.
These experiments were partially
shelved due to the outbreak of World
War II; however, considerable progress
has been made in the last five years in the
perfection and use of this new type brake.
Following World War II Automobile
Specialties Company, Chrysler Corpora-
tion, The Budd Company, and the Good-
year Tire and Rubber Company continued
with the development of the disc brake
and expanded the use of this brake in a
variety of different but allied fields.
Reasons for Converting to a
Different Type of Brake
The brakes on present day automotive
vehicles have different characteristics
under different driving conditions.
Through extensive research it was found
that brakes which were fairly adequate
for city driving showed a great loss of
pedal reserve, loss of fade and erratic
driving tendencies when on mountainous
roads. Also similar troubles were exper-
ienced in high speed driving in congested
traffic which necessitated frequent slow-
downs and stops, such as would occur in
ambulances and police patrol cars.
As stated before, industry has realized
that the drum brake has reached its maxi-
mum capacity unless some radical changes
are made on them to facilitate greater dis-
sipation of heat. Much has been done in
improving the heat resistance of the brake
drum and lining; however as yet, this has
not proven to be the solution to the re-
quirements of the braking problem. There
16

are six major factors that have more or
less off-set all advancements which have
been made on the drum type of brake.
The factors are as follows:
1. Average car speeds continue to
raise. More powerful engines
coupled with modern high speed
highways have placed an ever-in-
creasing burden of heat rejection on
the braking system.
2. The trends of car and truck
weights continue to go upward.'
3. Available coasting ratios in the
new automatic transmissions do not
provide the braking effect that the

INNdR HOUSING
conventional three speed transmis-
sions have offered.
4. Tires have become larger and
wheels smaller until a twelve inch
brake diameter is the largest which
can be used within the wheel;1 furth-
ermore, the wide rimes act as an ef-
fective shield to prevent cooling air
from reaching the drum.
5. In modern day vehicles, a larg-
er portion of the weight is on the
front wheels, thus requiring the
front brakes to handle up to sixty-
two percent of the total braking.
6. There is an increasing demand

for reduced driving effort, which in-
cludes among other items further re-
duction in brake pedal effort.
It is quite probable that the drum brake
will remain for several years, especially
on smaller vehicles. Further advancement
in metallurgy, brake linings and forced
air ventilation will most likely prolong its
usefulness.
Advantages of Disc Brakes
From extensive and repeated tests, it
has been determined that the disc brake
has all of the advantages of drum brakes
in addition to the following advantages
which the drum brake does not have:
INNER PRESSURE PLATE
1. Greatly reduced mechanical de-
flection due to the structure of the
disc and housing, thus increasing po-
tential pedal reserve.
2. Thermal expansion acts princi-
pally in a direction perpendicular to
the plane of the applied forces, there-
by considerably minimizing the re-
serve which is lost by expansion in
the brake drum.
3. A large increase in braking and
in heat dissipating surface.
From these three advantages it is seen
that the disc brake is able to absorb and
dissipate much more energy with a neglig-
ible loss of braking efficiency. Therefore,

one can punish the brake much more se-
verely and still maintain excellent braking
qualities.
Operating Principles
The basic principle of the disc brake
can best be illustrated by having two
discs mounted on one shaft. One disc is
set in motion. If the two discs are then
brought together the friction between the
two will cause the rotating disc to stop.
In the disc brake two pressure plates
are utilized inside one brake housing. In
order to obtain braking, the plates arc-
moved apart and contact (fig. 1) the ro-
tating surfaces of the housing. The pres-
sure plates are flat annular rings with seg-
ments of brake lining bonded onto the
outside surfaces. When the outer plate is
rotated with respect to the inner plate
by the wheel cylinders, steel balls which
are placed between the pressure plates arc-
forced up ramps moving the plates apart.
By this method, the pressure plates make
contact with the moving surface of the
brake housing (fig. 2).
In order to have a successful automo-
tive vehicle brake, the brake must have-
some degree of self-energization. Self-
energization occurs when the rotation of
the wheel assists in applying the brake.
To accomplish this, the outer pressure
plate or disc is rotated forward by the
action of the brake cylinder push rods
and the plates are separated. During the
forward motion of the vehicle, the inner
disc is held rigid and becomes the torque
or secondary disc. As the linings contact
the housing surfaces, the outer disc is then
the only one which is free to rotate. The
friction between the lining of the outer
plate, commonly called the secondary or
energizing disc, and the housing tends to
rotate the plate further with respect to the
inner plate. As the secondary plate is
rotated, the steel balls are forced out of
the seats to a position higher on the ramps
moving the plates still further apart and
providing greater pressures between the
housing surfaces and brake lining. It
can be seen that by changing the angle
of the ramp the degree of self-energiza-
tion is the prime factor for obtaining
low pedal pressures. It is also apparent
that if a too high degree of self-energi-
zation is obtained the brakes will tend

MARJORY J. MAURER
We live in a world of light and color.
One cannot imagine a world without light,
and a world without color would be drab
beyond words. Besides the pleasing
aspects of color, however, light, through
the study of the spectrum, serves as a
tool to reveal the secrets of the universe
and to aid man in his endeavors to im-
prove his lot.
Sir Isaac Newton, in 1692, was the first
man to scientifically and intentionally dis-
perse white light into its component parts
by means of a prism. Newton's discovery
spurred many men to experiment with the
spectrum. Most notable among these were
Wollaston and Fraunhofer. Wollaston
noted that the solar spectrum was crossed
by numerous dark lines. Fraunhofer,
using a telescope to view the solar spec-
trum, counted more than seven-hundred of
these dark lines.
Between the time of Fraunhofer and
that of Bunsen and Kirchoff came many
important inventions and discoveries
which contributed much to the study of
light and color. Among these were the
absorption spectra observations, the in-
vention of the thermopile, the beginnings
of photography, the formulation of Dop-
pler's principle, the observation of the
effects of a magnetic field on a light
source, and the presentation and accept-
ance of the wave theory of light.
Later in the history of spectroscopy
came the discoveries of Bunsen and Kir-
choff. These two young scientists noted
that the bright lines appear invariably in
the same places in the spectrum when cer-
tain substances are heated to incandes-
cence. This means that a particular sub-
stance will always have the same spectral
pattern, and this spectral pattern will dif-
fer in some respect from the spectral pat-
tern of any other substance. The works
of these men also included the interpre-
tation of the Fraunhofer lines. The rec-
ord of this interpretation states: Strong-
est lines do not mark the limits of colors.
There is always the same color on both
sides of a line, and the passage from one
color into another cannot be noted. This
has important significance in that it proves
the presence of interference of some sort,
usually an absorbing vapor. It is the pat-
tern of these lines that makes it possible
to differentiate between the different ele-
ment spectra.
To facilitate scientific reading of
spectra, the spectra are measured by the
wavelength of light. These wavelengths
are measured in microns, millimicrons,
and Angstrom units. The micron equals
one-millionth of a meter. The millimicron
equals one-billionth of a meter. The Ang-
strom (named after the Swedish physicist,
A. J. Angstrom) equals one ten-billionth
of a meter. The Angstrom unit is the
most commonly used. It is evident then
that in dealing with wavelengths of light,
the primary cause of spectra, we deal with
infinitesimal numbers.
Most people are familiar with the vis-
ible spectrum, that portion between visible
violet and visible red. This is, however, a
very small part of the whole spectrum.
From visible violet at 4100 Angstrom
units to visible red at 7100 Angstrom
units is a difference in wavelength of only
3000 Angstrom units. Far shorter than
visible violet light are the shortest known
wavelengths, the gamma rays. Moving
through increasing wave-lengths we find
X-rays, untra-violet light, the visible
spectrum, infra-red light, and the longest
waves of all, radio and cosmic waves.
In addition to Fraunhofer's invaluable
contribution concerning spectral lines, his
discovery of the principles of diffraction
and his construction of a diffraction grat-
ing mark him as one of the greatest men
in the history of spectroscopy. Fraunhofer
found that a light passed through a tiny
slit will produce small spectra on each side
of the principal image. These first class
spectra, as they are called, are not suitable
for analysis. Second class spectra—those
produced by passing a beam of light
through several, tiny, equidistant slits—
are those used in spectroscopy. The third,
and relatively unimportant, class spectra
is produced by passing a monochromatic
light, light of just one wavelength,
through a grating of a few rulings.
Since Fraunhofer's initial discovery, a
more practical diffraction grating has
come into use. This grating consists of a
parabolic mirror on which are ruled dif-
fraction lines. Another type of grating,
found to be extremely accurate, is the
echelon grating. This utilizes a number
of glass plates in a stack, each plate pro-
jecting a minute distance beyond its neigh-
bor with the edges parallel.
With the gradual improvement in spec-
troscopes, it has been possible to obtain
improving results. Lines, the keys to dif-
fering spectra, have been classified as fol-
lows: Principal lines—lines of greatest
intensity. Diffuse lines—lines of inter-
mediate intensity. Sharp lines—lines of
the least intensity. By observing these
lines of varying intensity and their place-
ment in the spectrum, giant strides were
made toward the identification of ele-
ments of spectroscopy. It became more
and more obvious that both bright and
dark lines are strictly characteristic of the
different elements, that only one element
shows a certain arrangement of lines. It is
interesting to note that elements of the
same family in the periodic table show a
similarity of spectroscopic lines. Through
hard work and skillful experimentation,
scientists proved the existence of helium,
cesium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and,
very recently, technetium and promethium,
by-products of uranium fission.
As is true of any scientific work, prob-
lems and discrepancies are found. The
major problem was that of shifts, particu-
larly in the spectra and stellar matter.
Included in the work of Doppler was a
study of these shifts. Doppler found that
when the source of light is approaching
the observer, the light appears to have a
shorter wavelength, producing a violet
shift. Conversely, when the light source
is receding from the observer, the light
appears to have a longer wavelength, pro-
ducing a red shift. Air pressure in excess
of one atmosphere also produces a red
shift. One of the most fascinating aspects
of spectroscopy is that of bright and dark
lines. Bright line, or emission, spectra
are spectra of light directly from the light
source. Dark line, or absorption spectra,
are spectra of light which has passed
through an absorbing vapor. Kirchoff
stated three laws concerning this phase.
They are stated thus: An incandescent,
i.e., glowing, solid or liquid radiates a
continuous spectrum. The spectrum of a
gas which is in front of a hotter surface
of continuous radiation emits an absorp-

The exceptional load capacity of
the Needle Bearing is1 the. result of
proper selection of steels, precision
workmanship to close tolerances,
and the application of modern anti-
friction principles.
The one-piece shell, which serves
as the outer raceway and retains the
rollers, is accurately drawn from
carefully selected strip steel. After
forming, it is carburized and hard-
ened. There is no further grinding or
other operation that might destroy
the wear-resistant raceway surfaces.
The full complement of thru-hard-
ened, precision-ground rollers is re-
tained by the turned-in lips of the
one-piece shell.
As the shaft is intended to serve
as the inner race in most applica-

a density of .215 lbs. in:! and 25% inter-
granular voids. The rate of pressing these
projectiles would be approximately 850
projectiles per hour per press.
As the trays fill up with green bri-
quettes, they will be moved to the sinter-
ing furnace. In the sintering furnace
there should be a reducing atmosphere,
because any oxides which might form at
the grain boundaries would cause soft
spots in the projectile. The temperature to
be used in this operation should be ap-
proximately 1100°F. and the projectiles
should be left in the furnace forty min-
utes. The projectiles are conducted
through the furnace on a 24" wide belt.
This belt will move at a rate such that it
will take forty minutes for the projectile
to go from the entrance of the furnace to
the exit. The proposed furnace to be
used is merely a hydrogen reducing fur-
nace which would have a length of twenty
feet from entrance to exit.
After sintering, the infiltration will be-
gin. In this step, the sintered projectile
would be admitted to an infiltration fur-
nace where molten copper would be put
into contact with the projectile. This
would be performed by placing the pro-
jectiles under funnel shaped containers
which would admit the molten copper.
The rest of this operation will be carried
out by capillary action. This process will
take approximately five minutes. Upon
infiltrating, the projectiles are resintered
for twenty minutes in the same manner as
before, but using a faster furnace.
Having been resintered, the projectiles
are put into a chuck fed automatic screw
machine which will tap the thread on the
I.D., cut the rotating hand groove, cut the
shell case connection groove, and taper
the nose. This operation will take ap-
proximately three seconds. From this
point on, the operations are the same as
were previously used. First, the projectile
will be plunge ground to finish the O.D.
to size. After this, the rotation band
will be swaged to the body of the projec-
tile. It is now necessary to turn the band
to size. This will be done on an Economy
skiver, as before, but it will now only be
necessary to turn the band, because the
face was formed on pressing, and the shell
case connecting groove was cut in the
automatic screw machine. The final step is
again 100% inspection which would be
carried out with standard air and bench
gages.
POWDER METALLURGY
(Continued from page 13)
Having set up a possible processing
schedule, it will now be necessary to figure
the total costs involved, and arrive at a
selling price which is the main factor to
be considered in deciding whether to use
powder metal or not. The first factor to
be considered is the cost of the powder
to be used. The powder selected, con-
sidering the copper used in the infiltration
and the iron, will cost $.20/Ib. The
density of the infiltrated projectile is
.275 lb/in3. Therefore, the cost would
be (.20) (.275) = $.055 per in*. The
total amount of powder used per projec-
tile will be:
2.7 xnx (.8)2
Volume =
4
Volume = 1.36 — .47
Volume — .89 cubic inches.
The cost of material would be (.89)
(.055) = $.049 per projectile.
The rate at which projectiles can be
compacted is 850 per hour per machine.
Therefore, three presses would be re-
quired, assuming a production of 2,500
projectiles per hour. An operator receiv-
ing an average rate of $1.55 per hour
would be required for each machine.
Therefore, the labor cost per projectile
4.65
would be = $.00186. The two sin-
2500
tering furnaces would require one skilled
operator at an average wage of $2.00 per
2.00
hour. Thus, the cost would be =
2500
$.0008 per projectile for both sintering
operations. Another operator will be
needed for the infiltrating furnace. This
operator will have an average wage of
$1.80 per hour. Therefore, the cost of in-
1.80
filtrating will be = $.00072 per
2500
projectile. The screw machine operation
will require two automatic screw machines
which can be tended by one operator.
Therefore, the screw machine labor cost
will be, figuring an average wage of $1.78
1.78
per hour, = $.000635 per piece.
2500
The cost of plunge grinding and swaging
will be the same as in the previous method
of production or $.00098 and $.00206
respectively. Since turning the rotating
band is the only operation needed on the
Economy skiver, its capacity will be raised
to from 1200 to 1300 pieces per hour and,
consequently, only two machines and one
operator, with a rate of $1.55 per hour,
will be required. Thus the cost of the
1.55
Economy grinder operation is =
2500
$.00062 per piece. The cost of inspection
would be $.0047 per projectile as previ-
ously figured. Putting these costs in tabu-
lar form, a total labor cost of $.01237 is
shown. Therefore, it can be concluded
that labor cost will be .01237 — .01210
or $.00027 greater by using powder metal-
lurgy.

Screw Machine 00063
Plunge Grinder 00098
Swaging 00206
Economy Skiver 00062
Inspection 00470
Total labor cost $.01237
Initial equipment cost is the next factor
to be taken into account. The cost of
presses will be approximately $9,000 each
and the cost of dies will be approximately
$4,000 each. This would give a total
initial cost of 3 x 13,000 = $39,000 for
presses and dies. The cost of two sinter-
ing furnaces and an infiltrating furnace
will total $20,000 each for the sintering
furnaces and $10,000 for the infiltrating
furnace, or $50,000 total. The cost of
two automatic screw machines will be
$22,169 each or $44,338 total. Added
to this cost would be $1900 for tooling.
The cost of four Cincinnati Grinders will
be $19,350 each or $77,400 total. Thefour
B &amp; J Punch Presses will have an initial
cost of $8,558 total plus $4720 for dies
and hand trips. In this process, one less
Economy skiver is needed and the result
will be a total cost of $120 for tooling
and $16,246 for grinders or $16,366 total.
Again the initial cost of setting up an in-
spection system will not be calculated.
Tabulating the above initial costs, a total
of $242,182 is arrived at. Spreading this
total initial cost over an estimated order
for 12,000,000 projectiles will give an
242,182
initial cost of = $.019 per
12,000,000

ized many industries. From mines-to-mills-to-manufacturer,
you will find oxy-acetylene cutting, welding and metal
conditioning.
50 YEARS OF PROGRESS-The people of Union Car-
bide have produced acetylene for over half a century.
Through continuous research they have made many re-
markable acetylene discoveries important in the lives of
all of us.

Costs
The latest estimate of cost by the U.S.
Corp of Engineers was made in Febru-
ary, 1951.
United States share of cost
of remaining works $566,794,000
Canadian share of cost of
remaining works 251,269,000
Total cost of remaining
works for power and nav-
igation, to Canada and
United States $818,063,000
As planned the United States share of
the cost was to be divided as follows:
New York State share for
power project $192,493,000
U. S. Government cost for
navigation 374,301,000
Total U. S. share for power
and navigation $566,794,000
The disproportion in costs between the
United States and Canada from now on
arises from the fact that Canada went
ahead and finished parts of the work as-
signed to her under the implied contract
in the 1934 rejected treaty; and because
our share of the work will be done with
a dollar of less purchasing power.
Of the United States share of the cost,
$192,493,000 was to be chargeable to
power development which includes 50
per cent of the joint costs of dams and
dikes in the powerhouse region necessary
for navigation as well. The installed ca-
pacity of the powerhouse will be
2,200,000 horsepower or 1,881,000 kilo-
watts, one half of which or 940,500 will
belong to the United States. This amount
is reduced to 700,000 as the firm or de-
pendable capacity that could be sold at the
plant. It may be high but it could be re-
duced to 600,000 and still permit of the
(Continued from page 22)
sale of primary power at- the plant at less
than 2 mills per kilowatt, to bring in
$11,128,000 the estimated total annual
cost of the plant; as shown by the fol-
lowing:
Not all of the power could be sold at
the plant. But at 80% load factor it
could be sold within a radius of 300
miles at less than 4 mills per kilowatt
hour or enough additional income to pay
for, maintain, and amortize the neces-
sary capital investment in transmission
lines, computed in a manner similar to
the above. This four mills is less than
current prices for steam generated power
in the area under consideration.
Cost of Navigational Features
It was proposed that the navigational
features would be a jointly owned prop-
erty. The total estimated cost to Canada
and to the United States was
$433,077,000. During a five year con-
struction period the interest at 2.5% on
$433,000,000 amounts to $27,067,000
making the total capital investment to be
amortized $460,144,000.
The annual cost would be,
Interest at 2.5% $11,504,000
Sinking fund for amortization,
2.5% money for 50 years,
or 1.03% 4,739,000
Estimated maintenance and
operation costs 4,117,000
Annual cost to United States
and Canada $20,360,000
The locks throughout the Seaway have
the same tonnage passing capacity as the
MacArthur Lock at Sault Sainte Marie.
In 1943 it passed 43,000,000 tons, most
of it one way. With a better balance of
traffic it could handle 50,000,000 tons.
The 1951 proposal, rejected by the House
Committee on Public Works, would have
permitted a toll of up to $1.25 a ton on

shipping through the two locks at Corn-
wall. That would have been the extent
of the tolls. At fifty cents a ton the in-
come on say 45,000,000 tons of traffic
would amount to $2,000,000 more than
the annual charge of $20,360,000 shown
above. No one conversant with the trans-
portation of goods between Chicago and
the Atlantic coast any longer argues that
there will not be enough traffic to fully
utilize the capacity of the locks. In fact
with the need for higher grade iron ore in
the Great Lakes Basin to be mixed with
the lowering iron content ore from
Minnesota, the question has become, will
the Seaway meet the demand of trans-
portation agencies for use of the water
way?
In 1909 at the suggestion of the Hon-
orable Elihu Root, Secretary of State,
Canada agreed to a treaty in which "navi-
gation of all navigable boundary waters
shall forever continue free and open for
all purposes of commerce to the inhabi-
tants and—ships—and boats of both
countries equally, etc." It was not until
after it appeared that the United States
would never approve the Seaway that
Senator Vandenburg suggested revision
of the Treaty of 1909 to permit tolls.
Canada agreed and again the Seaway and
Power Project was put up for approval,
this time on a self supporting and self
amortizing basis. Again the plan was re-
jected by the United States. Then the state
of New York petitioned the Federal
Power Commission for a permit to go
ahead with the province of Ontario in
building the power facilities. This peti-
tion in turn has been refused. Politics be-
ing more powerful than engineering and
economics.
It is pertinent at this point to say that
for the most part the United States has
led the way in the consideration of this
project. At least the statement is true of
the beginning stages. There were many
Canadians who were appathetic toward
the proposal 20 years ago. Now the situa-
tion is reversed.
One prominent Canadian engineer ex-
pressed the prevailing sentiment among
Canada's industrial leaders in this way.
"Canada is getting fed up with the quib-
bling in Washington." They now pro-
pose to go ahead with the Seaway on their
own. In November of 1951, the Honor-
able Lionel Chevrier, Canadian Minister
of Transportation made a speech in

Tel
Microbes star on ±ClCVlS10Il
in war against disease!
Until recently, scientists found it difficult
to keep microbes alive for study—at high
magnification—in light microscopes. Dyes,
used to make them visible, killed some.
Others were destroyed by the intense
light.
RCA scientists have solved this problem
by making television a working partner of
the microscope. "Eye" of their new system
is a tiny industrial television camera built
around RCA's sensitive vidicon television
tube. No intense light is needed, since this
electron tube "sees" at extremely low light
levels. And by making the tube sensitive to
the red or violet bands of the spectrum, dyes
and stains are eliminated.
With RCA's system, research men can watch
living germs or cells — immensely magnified —
on the screen of a television set. Many are able
to watch at a time. Students can be more easily
trained. And science learns more about disease
by watching lice micro-organisms.
Improving the microscope by teaming it
with television is an example of the many
paths explored by RCA Research. You bene-
fit directly by better performance from any

Rayleigh was still in school. About the
time he entered the university Maxwell
had applied the laws of probability to the
kinetic theory of gasses for the first time
and toward the end of his university ca-
reer Maxwell published his great paper on
"A Dynamical Theory of the Electromatic
Field." The undulatory theory of light
had been placed on a sound dynamical
basis by Green and Stokes, but there were
still some skeptics left. Faraday was still
alive, though deprived of his intellectual
powers and nearing his death. On the
experimental side spectrum analysis was
the only fresh departure in physics; the
spectra of stars had only just begun to be
examined. Photography was still in its
infancy and the Bunsen burner was only
eight years old. The peculiar luminous
appearances observed when electric dis-
charges were made to pass through vac-
uum tubes had only been incompletely ob-
served; no attempt had yet been made
to bring them into relationship with other
physical phenomena. This was the gen-
eral background to Rayleigh's scientific
career.
In 1868 Rayleigh made his first experi-
ment in his own laboratory on the per-
manent deflection of a galvanometer
caused by alternating current. His first
paper, published in 1869, was entitled
"Some Electromagnetic Phenomena Con-
sidered in Connection with the Dynamical
Theory." His second paper, in 1870,
dealt with radiation of heat from a sphere.
In 1871 he read Helmholtz's great treatise
"Lehre von den Tonempfindung" for the
double purpose of learning German and
starting his work on sound. In that same
year he wrote a paper on the "Theory of
Resonance of Bounded Volumes of Air."
In 1871 Rayleigh married the sister of
Arthur Balfour. In that same year the
Cavendish Laboratory of Experimental
Physics was founded in Cambridge and
Rayleigh was seriously considered as a
possibility for the professorship in ex-
perimental physics which was created
along with the laboratory. Maxwell got •
the post. In 1872, on a delayed honey-
moon trip up the Nile in Egypt, Rayleigh
began to write the Theory of Sound, a
task which was not finished until 1877.
In 1873 his father died and he became
the third Baron Rayleigh. He was elected
Fellow of the Royal Society in the same
year. In 1879 Maxwell died at the age of
48 and Lord Rayleigh became second
JOHN WILLIAM STRUTT
(Continued from page D)
Cavendish Professor of Experimental
Physics in Cambridge. During his five-year
tenure of the post the Cavendish Labora-
tory under his direction determined the
standard ohm, the standard ampere, and
the standard volt. These standard values
are used by the electrical industry to this
very day.
Rayleigh returned to his private labora-
tory at his own estate in 1885 and began
numerous theoretical and experimental in-
vestigation in optics and acoustics. It has
been said that Rayleigh's first love was
optics and that he undertook his studies in
sound merely to get a firm grasp on the
theory of oscillations which must form the
basis for an undulatory theory of light.
In 1888 Rayleigh began his most famous
experimental work, the investigation
of Prout's hypothesis that the ele-
ments had integer atomic weights. This
involved the careful and accurate de-
terminations of the densities of hydro-
gen, oxygen, and nitrogen. His work
did not succeed in establishing the
correctness of Prout's • hypothesis, but it
did result in the discovery of a new ele-
ment, Argon, which was announced on
the last day of 1895. Rayleigh received the
Nobel Prize for Physics for this dis-
covery in 1905. The prize money, some
$40,000, he gave to the Cavendish Lab-
oratory. The discovery of Argon was the
most dramatic event in Rayleigh's scien-
tific career. But this discovery was, in
reality, only the mid-point of his activi-
ties. Between 1896 and 1919, the year in
which Rayleigh died, he published 229
papers, approximately half of his scien-
tific output.
This is no place to go into the details of
Rayleigh's work on electricity, optics,
physical chemistry, and sound. But it is a
good time to review the state of physics in
1919. By that time the mechanical view
of the universe, just firmly established at
the beginning of Rayleigh's career, had
been completely superseded by the electri-
cal view of the universe. The ether had
been dissolved out of the picture of the
universe by Michelson and Morely's
famous experiment on ether drift. The
atom had ceased to be a rigid little bil-
liard ball and had become a complicated
system of nucleus and satellite electrons in
1897. Around 1900 Planck had intro-
duced the quantum of energy. Gibbs had
reconstructed the theories of physical
chemistry and thermodynamics on entirely
new bases. Einstein had published his
paper on restricted relativity in 1905 and
his general relativity theory in 1916.
Modern quantum mechanics was to blos-
som into its full glory just after Rayleigh's
death.
Rayleigh's work had only indirect bear-
ing on this complete revolution which
took place during his life time. He had
not the ambition to initiate revolutionary
theories or to advance science by great and
sudden strides. His procedure was to
bring experiments into harmony with
existing theories, to perfect those theories,
if necessary, with the help of improved
experimental methods, either by extend-
ing the range of accuracy or by new lines
of investigation. He liked small scale, per-
sonal experimentation. He felt like a
"stranger in his own country" when con-
fronted with the work of the younger
physicists. He never used his enormous
scientific prestige to discourage the new
work as did his older contemporary, Lord
Kelvin. Kelvin believed that all physics
could be mastered by the use of mechani-
cal models and that the newer theories
were sheer nonsense. Rayleigh also be-
longed to the mechanical model school,
but he was willing to let the newer school
present its evidence, even though he
could not understand it or feel any warm
sympathy with it. Rayleigh's only attempt
to enter unexplored territory was in the
field of physical research. He was a life
long student of psychic phenomena. This
was a fashion in England of his time.
Many of his respectable scientific col-
leagues made studies in this field. Rayleigh
was never convinced that any valid prin-
ciples had been discovered in this work.
Perhaps his interest in this work was
based on his orthodox religious beliefs. At
the time of his death he held thirteen
honorary degrees from the great Euro-
pean universities. He had received the
highest honors that England, Germany,
France, and Spain could bestow and was
a member of fifty-two academies of
science.
Rayleigh was a mathematical and ex-
perimental physicist whose work lies
wholly in the realm of classical physics.
Because modern engineering consists
mainly of applications of the theories of
classical physics to the design of struc-
tures, mechanisms, and electrical circuits,
Rayleigh's work is becoming a "gold
mine" to the engineer. Rayleigh did much
to develop dimensional analysis and the

If you checked "toolmaker", you
know your way around in a machine
shop. He's grinding the contour of a car-
bide-tipped flat form tool on an optical-

Norton Diamond Wheel.
Facts You Should Know
One of the reasons for the industrial
edge the United States has over other
countries is its leadership in the use of
cemented tungsten carbide tools. With
them, American industry has speeded up
mass production.
Cemented carbide tools are so hard
that they cannot be machined in their
ultimate form by any known metal tool.
So. they must be shaped by grinding
with abrasive wheels.
Diamond wheels have become the
accepted type of abrasive wheel for pre-
cision grinding operations on cemented
carbides. Their exceptionally fast and
cool cutting action and extremely low
rate of wear result in economically low
grinding costs.
Norton Diamond Wheels
Norton Company pioneered in the
development of diamond wheels in this
country, bringing out the first Kesinoid
Bonded Diamond Wheel in 1934. This
was followed a years later by the durable
Metal Bonded Diamond Wheel. And in
1945, came the Vitrified Bonded Dia-
mond Wheel, a development of the
Norton research laboratories.
Today, the Norton price list for Dia-
mond Wheels and Hones contains about
1000 items, ranging in list price from
$17.70 to $8,877.35, depending on the size
of the wheel and the diamond content.

Think It Over!
Because Norton Company is dedi-
cated to "making better products to
make other products better," Norton
Research is always looking ahead. To the
young technical man, such a progressive
attitude promises an interesting future.

Description of Component Parts
Brake Housing: The wheel brake hous-
ing is made in two separately cast iron
halves. The two halves are securely bolted
together on the outer circumference of the
housing. To facilitate the cooling of the
brake, radial fins are cast on the outer sur-
faces of the housing. The surface, which
contacts the lining on the discs, is ma-
chined on the inside of the housing halves.
In the development of this housing ex-
tensive research was carried out by the
various companies. Bearing in mind that
the prime requisites for a brake housing
are rigidity, lightness in weight, and good
thermal conductivity, the experimental
model was made of cast aluminum with a
cast iron ring riveted to the housing. The
aluminum provided excellent thermal
characteristics and also provided for a
minimum of weight. In these tests con-
ducted by Chrysler engineers strain gages
were used to obtain a stress pattern which
greatly facilitated the design of the pro-
duction cast iron housing.
Pressure Plates: The pressure plates or
discs are made of cast aluminum with six
ball seats and ramps machined into the
surface. The ramps on the Chrysler pro-
duction model have 321/2° pressure
angles. As stated before, the pressure
angles of the ramps determine the
amount of self energization of the brake.
On the inside edge of the discs are four
slots into which fit the spider anchors.
The clearance between the inner edge of
the discs and the end of the spider anchor
is kept at a minimum to prevent the plates
from moving off center.
Onto the outside surface of the plates
are bonded six brake lining segments. The
first experimental model disc brake had a
continuous ring of lining. This arrange-
ment produced serious scoring of the
housing surface and a tremendous fade or
decrease of the coefficient of friction oc-
cured (fig. 3). The continuous ring was
replaced by the lining segment which re-
sulted in much better cooling of the
brake and thereby increasing brake effi-
ciency. It is of interest to note here that
despite the use of lining segments, on a
twevle inch disc brake there is 30% more
lining than on a conventional twelve inch
drum type brake.

js to locate and anchor the pressure plates.

The spider bolted rigidly to the steering
knuckles of the front wheels or to the
rear axle housing prevents free radial
movement of the plates as they engage the
friction surfaces of the housing.
Return Spring: There are four return
springs used in each brake assembly. The
function of these springs are the same as
the return spring on a drum and shoe
type brake. After the hydraulic pressure
is released, the springs bring the discs
back together and prevent the brake lin-
ing from making contact with the housing
surface.
Self-Adjusting Mechanisms: One of
the inherent characteristics of a disc brake
is that it lends itself very readily to be
self-adjusting. This is due to the rela-
tively low thermal and mechanical distor-
tions in the brake housing. In the drum
type brake these distortions had to be
reckoned and coupled with the lining
wear. On the disc brake the only variable
to be taken into account is the lining
Thermodynamics of Braking
Brakes under continuous use create
more of a problem in heat dissipation
than in mechanical design. Basically a
brake is a heat engine utilizing a reverse
cycle. Instead of converting heat into
kinetic energy, the brake is called upon
to convert kinetic energy into heat. An

mines the capacity of the brake. In order
to adequately meet this increase of tem-
perature of heat, the braking surface area,
radiating surface and air circulation must
be proportioned so as not to allow over-
heating of the brake.
It is seen that during a rapid stop or
deceleration coupled with heavy loads, the
brake is unable to dissipate the tremend-
ous quantities of heat that is generated;
therefore, another duty of the brake must
be to store this heat and dissipate it when
the brake is not called for further use. *
As stated before, the temperature rise
determines the capacity of the brake. It
would be possible to increase the mass of
the brake to such a proportion that the
ease of absorbing and dissipating the
generated heat would be a maximum.
Making the brake very large would result
in prohibitive costs; therefore, a happy
medium must be met between cost and
size of brake.
The rate of temperature rise greatly af-
fects the working parts of the brake.
When the brake is applied it is working
under a mechanical stress, and when the
temperature rises very rapidly, the brake
experiences a thermal stress.
The maximum safe temperature at
which a brake with composition lining can
safely operate is very near 600°F. Above
this temperature dusting of the lining will
occur. The lining composition will vola-
tilize and small wads will be formed due
to the rubbing action between the housing
surface and the brake shoes. These small
wads become hard and tend to score the
housing surface. A combination of cast

Your Future as an
Engineering School Graduate at GM

FOR many years General Motors has been recruit-
ing graduates of the country's leading engineer-
ing schools.
A high percentage of these young men, through
hard work and initiative, have made sound business
careers for themselves at GM. In fact, today many
GM divisional managers are engineering school
graduates. So are many others in top management.
GM is not only a major producer of motorcars and
trucks, but also a leading manufacturer of many
types of civilian goods from heating systems to
refrigerators, from fractional h.p. motors to Diesel
locomotives.
And, as a top defense contractor, GM is building
everything from rockets and shells to tanks and
jet and Turbo-Prop engines.
In these many operations we require the services
of all types of engineers to engage in all phases of
engineering work—from pure research to produc-
tion supervision.
This work is decentralized among GM's34 manufac-
turing divisions, operating 112 plants in 54 towns and
cities throughout the country. Each division oper-
ates as an independent unit with its own engineering
department. Yet each benefits from the resources of
GM's central research and engineering laboratories.
Thus, from the start, GM offers the engineering
graduate both the opportunities and facilities of
a large, successful organization and the friendly
working environment of a smaller company.
For further information on a GM engineering
career, we suggest you ask your College Placement
Office to arrange an interview for you with the
GM College Representative the next time he visits
your campus.

A short time ago, we received this in-
teresting problem in the mail. You are
required to draw four straight lines
through all of the dots in the accom-
panying diagram without lifting the pen-
cil from the page.
Here is a problem that is in many ways
similar to the one that appeared last
month, but we think that you might find
this one a bit more difficult.
A train is operated by three men,
Adams, Green, and White, who are Engi-
neer, Firemen, and Brakeman, but not
respectively. On the train are three pas-
sengers, Mr. Adams, Mr. Green, and Mr.
White.
1. Mr. Green lives in Qetroit.
2. The Brakeman lives halfway be-
tween Chicago and Detroit.
3. Mr. Adams earns exactly $2,000
yearly.
4. White beat the Fireman at billiards.
5. The Brakeman's nearest neighbor,
one of the passengers, earns exactly
three times as much yearly as the
Brakeman.
6. The passenger whose name is the
same as the Brakeman's lives in
Chicago.
Now, who is the Engineer?

accident en route which not only delays
the train two hours, but slows it the rest
of the journey so that he misses his con-
nection by three minutes. Had the acci-
dent occurred just six miles further on,
he would have been barely in time for the

Here's a problem for the mathematical
minded readers of this department. A
farmer goes to town to buy one hundred
head of livestock. He has one hundred
dollars with which he may purchase them.
Cows cost ten dollars; pigs cost three dol-
lars, sheep cost fifty cents. He must buy
at least one of each kind. How many of
each did he buy?
Now try this one. A little algebra will
enable you to solve it with no trouble at
all.
A husband and wife have two (2)
children. The combined age of the couple
is now nine (9) times the combined age
of the two children. Four (4) years from
now it will be five (5) times. The differ-

wife, and also between the two children
is four (4) years. How old is each one
now?

iron operating surfaces and a composition
lining, chiefly of asbestos, has been estab-
lished as the best combination. The wear-
ing properties of cast iron are excellent and
not likely to score or gall, thus maintain-
ing a smooth surface.
Cast iron has one main shortcoming
and that is its great susceptibility to ther-
mal checking. The cause of this can be
traced to its inherent lack of ductility.
Under steep temperature gradients, the
expansion of the metal is retarded by sur-
rounding cooler regions causing the hotter
areas to plastically upset. Upon cooling
the metal tends to contract, but is pro-
hibited in doing so by the same areas
which have become hot. It is in this way,
uneven contraction and expansion of the
metal, that thermal checks or cracks are
produced.
From the foregoing information, some-
method for cooling takes on paramount
importance. It is in this respect that the
disc type brake lends itself very readily.
First of all, there is more surface area
for the rejection of heat on the cast iron
housing and the brake lining compared
to the shoe type brake. In the shoe type
brake the dissipating surface of the shoe
is small; consequently, the surface tem-
perature on the line becomes exceeding-
ly great. Also, the mass of the disc
brake is somewhat greater than the con-
ventional type which is conducive to bet-
ter heat dissipation. Another means by
which the cooling can be further facilitat-
ed is by placing on the wheel a fan which
will circulate the air around the drum
housing.
Summary
In summarizing, the disc brake has
more operating advantages than the drum
type brake. These advantages are as fol-
lows:
1. Longer Lining Wear—More lining
area and uniform lining contact in-
creases the life of the lining in the
disc type brake.
2. Automatic Adjustment—A mechan-
ism which compensates for lining
wear, thus eliminating frequent ad-
justing by hand.
3. Controlled Energization—Smoother
stopping is obtained by use of con-
trolled energizing elements which
operate in a straight line function
with the foot pedal pressure.
4. Increased Pedal Reserve—Stands re-
peated violent brake application with-
out erratic action and loss of face on
pedal reserve.
5. Less Pedal Effort—Tiptoe applica-
tion sets the energizing element into
action providing for greater safety
and reduces driving fatigue.
6. Greater Braking Power—Stands up
under severe use because they
are controlled-energizing, producing
equal braking torque with equal effi-
ciency in either forward or reverse.

fuel could then be used for generating
still more electric power, he said. This
method would conserve the supply of nat-
ural atomic fuels, and help reduce costs,
but "so long as the present military and
political situation continues, plutonium
has a much greater value as bomb ma-
terial. Thus, the manufacture of bomb
plutonium offers at least transitory assis-
tance in balancing the budget," he said.
In addition, it has been proposed that
something be done with the huge quan-
tities of gamma rays, similar to X-rays,
which are produced by an atomic reactor
as a now useless by-product, he said.
Scientists in other laboratories have
demonstrated experimentally that gamma
rays may be used to sterilize drugs such
as penicillin and certain foods, with a
view to keeping them longer, according to
Dr. Kingdon.
"The extent, of the possible application
depends first on proving that the process
has no harmful effects in human consump-
tion, and then on how cheaply it can be
done; that is, on the cost of shielding and
of the remote control equipment for ex-
posing the objects to be sterilized," he
said. "It is clear that this will be easier
to do for an expensive drug like penicillin
than for a bulk food."
Dr. Kingdon said that the uranium or
other fuel used in an atomic power plant
is simply a source of heat, which can be
used to make steam to drive turbine-gen-
erators. So that the water itself does not
become dangerously radioactive, as it
would if exposed directly to the splitting
atoms, some heat-transfer medium must
be interposed to take heat from the reactor
to the boiler where water is turned into
steam.
Liquid sodium, which will melt at the
temperature of boiling water, will meet
many of the requirements for this heat-
carrying job, he said. "We have carried
out extensive investigations on sodium as
a reactor coolant at the Knolls Atomic
Power Laboratory and have learned how
to purify it, how to pump it around a
heat-transfer circuit, and how to handle
it safely in relatively large installations,"
Dr. Kingdom said.

emission spectrum.
Another factor which is in the problem
category is that of broadening of spectral
lines. There are five general theories for
broadening, each of which has sound
basis. First, broadening of lines due to
natural width. Since an atom cannot ra-
diate at one sharp frequency, spectral lines
have natural width. Second, broadening
of lines due to rotation. Rotation of a
star or glowing body broadens spectral
lines. Third, broadening of lines due to
turbulence. Due to large scale vertical
motions of large masses of radiating and
absorbing gases, widening of spectral
lines is noted. Fourth, widening of spec-
tral lines due to the Doppler effect. Since
atoms move at random in a heated vapor,
e.g., the surface and atmosphere of a
glowing body, broadening of lines is ob-
served. Fifth, broadening of spectral
lines due to the Zeeman effect. Spectral
lines are split by a powerful magnetic
field. This last theory is especially inter-
esting because the solar spectrum shows
this splitting which traces its origin to the
magnetic fields of the sunspots. Stellar
spectra do not show the Zeeman effect
since individual regions cannot be studied
separately at such enormous distances as
those which separate us from the stars.
The stars can serve us Earth-bound hu-
mans as laboratories in which conditions
unattainable on Earth may be studied by
spectroscopy. To make the classes of stars
universally the same, the stellar spectra
are typed in order of decreasing hydro-
gen lines and increasing metal lines. So
fine are the readings now that even close
binaries, systems of two stars which re-
volve around their common center of
gravity, can be resolved. Because of their
distance from the Earth, most binaries
cannot be resolved with even the most
powerful telescopes. By spectroscopic an-
alysis, however, the characteristics of each
component, their speed of rotation, and
their direction of rotation can be deter-
mined.
Spectroscopic analysis of the different
types of stars—red giants, white dwarfs,
Cepheids, novae, etc.—have aided nuclear
physicists in their search for the funda-
mental key to the universe, the struc-
ture of the atom. Not only has the spectra
of these stars proved to us that the uni-
verse is composed of the same elements
known to man on Earth, but also they
have shown physicists, by position and in-

tensity of both bright and dark lines, just
exactly what physical processes are occur-
ring in each type of star. These facts are
not abstract. They may show us how to
utilize atomic power or how long life
has been on Earth and how long the Sun
will sustain us here. By analysis of the
absorption spectra of certain parts of the
sky, we can also detect the presence and
calculate the composition of inter-stellar
matter.
With the development of large chemi-
cal and metallurgical industries, a rapid
method of analysis became imperative.
Chemical analysis was highly developed
and very accurate; however, it was un-
wieldly, both from the standpoint of time
and from that of the amount of equip-
ment necessary. In metallurgical analysis,
especially, were problems numerous. First,
a rapid analysis must be made of molten
metals while they are in the furnace. A
chemical analysis requires that the sample
be cooled, pulverized, and a density-com-
position test made. This method is often
too lengthy to be of any practical use.
Second, an enormous amount of equip-
ment is needed for the density-composi-
tion test. Besides a complete chemistry
analysis laboratory, such specialized equip-
ment is a densiometer is needed.
Spectroscopy, prior to 1912, had never
been utilized for industrial purposes.
When first spectroscopic analysis was pro-
posed, it presented a great variety of
problems. In order to employ spectro-
scopic analysis, the material to be analyzed
had to be heated to incandescense or to
vaporization, for it is the vapors of a
substance that produce its characteristic
spectrum. A method of holding the in-
candescent material had to be found.
Obviously, this last problem was a great
obstacle; however, science, with the aid
of interested industrialists, developed a
method, the spark test, which was to revo-
lutionize the metallurgical industry.
The earliest method of spectroscopic
analysis in metallurgy was a very simple
form of the spark test. A spark was gen-
erated across a narrow gap between two
electrodes of the material to be analyzed.
Photographs were made of the spectrum
of the vapor and compared with spectra of
pure elements. The analysis was then
made from the comparisons. These an-
alyses were often checked by chemical
analysis and discrepancies found, and,
although the discrepancies were slight, ex-
tensive research done to correct them. It
was found that the discrepancies had three
causes—human error in photographic
comparison, the inclusion in the sample
of unsuspected rare elements, and varia-
tions in vapor intensity.
New techniques began to replace the
early methods. To remove the factor of
vapor intensity variation, a "transverse
spark" technique was employed, particu-
larly in the analysis of steel specimens.
This technique consists of passing the
sample under a pointed silver electrode
and, simultaneously, moving a photo-
graphic plate downward at a constant rate
of descent so that a continuous record of
the vapor intensity variation is obtained.
Also, in addition to visible spectrum
spectroscopy, there came into promi-
nence three other types of spectroscopy.
These are infra-red, ultra-violet, and
Raman (monochromatic) spectra. The
infra-red spectra, scientists claim, is the
most characteristic physical property of
any chemical compound. Another inno-
vation is the "tipped electrode" method
of analysis. Placing small amounts of the
sample in the tips of two carbon elec-
trodes reduces both the amount of the
sample used and the work necessary to
prepare the electrodes for arcking.
In general, there are three principal
processes for producing spectral vapor.
First is the arc. In this process a low vol-
tage direct current is arcked across a nar-
row gap between two tipped carbon elec-
trodes. This method is used for metals.
Second is the spark. In this process a
high voltage direct or alternating current
is sparked between two carbon electrodes
with the sample placed in the spark gap.
This process is used for organic analysis
because the spark can excite the sample to
produce a spectral vapor without vola-
tilizing the material. The spark method is
also used for gas analysis by passing the
spark through a Geissler tube containing
the sample of gas. Third is the flame.
This process is used primarily for the al-
kali metals and materials of low melting
points. The process is a simple one. The
sample is merely heated to incandescence
in a bunsen flame. The flame method can
also be applied to all materials if an oxy-
acetylene flame is used.
Photography as used in spectroscopy is
now almost obsolete. Even as quickly as
developing can be done, photography is
too slow for the pace of industry. View-
ing the produced spectra directly, as on a

unless it has passed the Hydrostatic Test at the foundry.
Every- full length of cast iron pipe is subjected to this
test under water pressures considerably higher than
rated working pressures. It must pass the test or go

The Hydrostatic Test is the final one of a series of
routine tests made by pipe manufacturers to assure
that the quality of the pipe meets or exceeds the re-
quirements of standard specifications for cast iron
pressure pipe.
Few engineers realize the extent of the inspections,
analyses and tests involved in the quality-control of

ally from the ground up with the inspection, analysis
and checking of raw materials—continue with con-

resulting in a superior product. These standards, as

200 ton mass struck the water at a speed
of over a hundred miles per hour. No
man made structure could be expected to
survive a collision such as that. With the
knowledge we now have, weather is no
longer a problem. The Graf Zeppelin
and the Hindenburg often landed and
took off when all airplanes were grounded
and shipping was at a standstill. Also, we
now have a true altitude indicator based
on the radar principle which would cer-
tainly be standard equipment on any
modern airship.
The Macon, sister ship to the Akron,
built at a cost of only $2,600,000, came to
a similar end almost on the other side of
the earth. During a trip across the con-
tinent a weakness was discovered in the
girders connecting the tail fins to the
main framework. Engineers studied the
structure and found that reinforcements
were necessary. Rather than miss the
maneuvers of the Pacific Fleet, it was col-
lectively decided to go ahead after only
temporary repairs had been made and to
finish the work upon returning. The Ma-
con did an excellent job during man-
euvers, but on Feb. 12, 1935, almost 9
months after the weakness was discover-
ed, the upper fin gave way during a sharp
turn, taking with it three gas cells and
part of the empenage. The ship lost too
much helium and slowly dropped stern
first into the sea. The entire crew of 83
abandoned ship safely, although two were
lost off the life rafts. This loss was due
only to human error and lack of judgment
in making repairs.
The year 1937 saw the untimely end of
transoceanic airship travel with the de-
struction of the Hindenburg. This master-
piece of German engineering skill first
took to the air on March 4, 1936. She
carried 7,063,000 cubic feet of hydrogen
in 16 cells and had 4,400 horsepower in
four engines. She could carry up to
143,650 lbs. of fuel, a payload of 41,990
lbs., 72 passengers, and a crew of 40.
Her range at 78 m.p.h. was 8,750 miles,
greater than that of our mammouth B-36
bombers. She had individual staterooms,
a dining room, a spacious lounge—even a
grand piano. During her short but highly
successful life she carried 3,059 passeng-
ers 209,481 miles. She also carried
19,556 lbs. of mail and 21,505 lbs. of
freight. 37 of her 63 flights were trans-
oceanic. The never-to-be-forgotten date
was May 6, 1937. The Hindenburg was
making her first American landing of the
i

The mighty Akron on portable mooring mast.
season when, four minutes after the first
landing rope touched the ground, fire
broke out . . . the fire that was to spell
the end of hydrogen in airships. The fire
claimed 13 passengers and 22 crew mem-
bers out of the 97 that were on board.
Those unfortunate 13 were the first, and
only, passengers ever to be killed in the
history of commercial airships. Whether
the cause of the fire was accidental or not
is not known. (There were warnings of
sabotage at Friedrichshafen.) In reality,
the Hindenburg was the victim of its own
hydrogen, and a similar fate would be
impossible on a helium filled airship.
Such were the fates of several of the
most famous airships. Those that were
military ships went the ways of all mili-
tary equipment, because of factors which
would never occur in the case of com-
mercial ships. Of those which were com-
mercial, two were dismantled after years
of service, two were destroyed by their
own crews to avoid their being taken by
the Allies, and one was the victim of its
own hydrogen. Discounting the Shenan-
doah, which was our first pioneer experi-
ment in rigid airships, not one of them
was destroyed because of poor design or
construction. Surely the facts are not
enough to warrant the conclusion that air-
ships are unsafe; on the contrary, the facts
point strongly in the other direction.
Again we must look at the record.
Airship travel was something new.
Yet the first ship designed for trans-
oceanic travel was entirely successful and
held a perfect record of safety. Up to the
year 1937, commercial rigid airships had
carried 51,837 paying passengers without
accident. Up to the year 1947, the Good-
year Fleet of non-rigid airships carried
413,256 passengers "without the scratch
of anyone's finger." This makes a total
of 456,093 passengers carried. During
this time, 13 passengers lost their lives due
to the hydrogen fire on the Hindenburg,
impossible on an airship using inert gas
helium. How can we possibly ignore a
record such as that? The record shows
not only that the criticism of "unsafe" is
unfounded, but that probably the airship
is the safest means of transportation yet
devised by man.
The fact that a new means of trans-
portation could attain such a record can-
not be overemphasized. The steamship
has long been an accepted means of trans-
portation, yet in the 19 years following
World War I over 100 ships were lost
with the death of about 12,000 persons.'
Has the public condemned steamships as a
means of transportation? World wide
railroad accidents' over the same period
accounted for 100,000 dead and over
1,500,000 injured. Has the public con-
demned railroads as a means of trans-
portation? You have but to look at the
evidence and wonder. . . .
I have confined most of my allotted
space to a discussion of the safety of air-

cannot be presented in such a short space.
But there is one question that I feel
should not be left unanswered; that is,
are airships economical? After exhaustive
studies, the evidence shows that they are.
It can be shown that airships can be oper-

Washington strongly intimating that if
the United States would not proceed,
Canada would go alone in constructing
the Seaway. It would of course be on
Canadian soil.
In December 1951, the Parliament of
Canada passed two bills. Bill 33, creat-
ing the St. Lawrence Authority with
power to borrow $300,000,000 to con-
struct an all Canadian Seaway. Bill 34,
an act respecting construction of works
(Coitinued from page 26)
for the generation of power in the In-
ternational Rapids Section of the St.
Lawrence River. This act cannot of
course be carried out until the United
States is ready to proceed concurrently
with its one half of the power plant.
By going ahead with Canada on the
Seaway and Power Project as submitted
in 1941, the navigation locks and canal
would be on United States soil. We
would have joint control with Canada of
the Seaway, and a voice in establishing
tolls. Failing in this, the Seaways from the
Atlantic to Lake Erie will be completely
Canada's. We will pay tolls set by Can-
ada. As time goes on and should Can-
ada's industry require more than one half
the capacity of the locks, it is only rea-
sonable to expect that Canada will re-
strict shipping by nationals of the United
States. In justice she would have every
right to do so.

was developed. This analyzer consists of
multiplier photo-cells which record the
spectral analysis on dials which may be

Thus, with modern developments in
spectroscopy, the metallurgical industry
has become revolutionized. From the
lengthy process of chemical analysis to the
two minute analysis by the modern spec-
troscope and the direct analyzer is truly a
miracle of science.
Even with the tremendous strides
taken, and being taken, spectroscopy is a
young and promising field. Like most
scientific fields, only the surface has been
scratched. There is a vast amount of
work ahead for scientists—and engineers.

A family had failed to make a living on a worn-out
New England farm. Did they demand government
subsidies, checks for crops they didn't raise, high prices
for crops to be burned?
They would have scorned such things — scorned and
feared, for they knew from days under a foreign despot that
where government money goes, government control goes, too.
No, this family put everything they owned in that wagon,
and walked beside it 2,000 miles, westward. They didn't
know what was ahead, but they were determined to keep
on going until they found a place of freedom where they
could keep their self-respect.
They were English, Scotch, Dutch, Italian, French —
people from many places—all, now, Americans. They knew
that the only happiness is from self-respect, and the only
way to self-respect is to earn your own way, not whine
for something for nothing.
Their sons and grandsons started grocery stores, became
mechanics, saved their money and started factories.
American machines bought by American thrift made the
factories grow.
And that's America. Made by people willing to walk
2,000 miles beside a wagon—to find opportunity. If such
people are gone, if all we've got left are soft weaklings
who want to be taken care of, then in truth American
manliness is dead, that 2,000 mile walk was wasted, and
there is nothing left of America but a hollow shell.

due to the fact that airships use their
power only to give forward motion,
whereas the airplane uses about 50% of
its power to sustain its full load in the
air and the rest for forward motion. To
move a load of one ton the airplane needs
100 h.p. compared to the airships 20 h.p.
These comparisons were based on 4 air-

That's a good plan, but there's just one
little catch in it; sometimes it takes a
good while to find the work that's right
for you. If you're worried about that,
perhaps my own experience will point out
a practical shortcut.
I got my E. E. at the University of
Washington in 1935, and went on with
graduate work and teaching for another
other types of products and work at
Allis-Chalmers.
In 1941 I became engineer in charge of
transformer sales, and in 1947 was made
manager of the transformer section.
This field offers both challenges and
rewards. It needs and seeks men of su-
perior intelligence, imagination and crea-

tive ability—men who will strike out into
new paths of study and development.
If you think a transformer is an inert
mass of iron and copper windings in a
tank of oil—look closer. There are ad-
vanced problems in magnetostriction that
if solved, will eliminate transformer hum
and revolutionize the business. It's the
same with problems in metallurgy, insula-
tion, measurement and control of electric
field shapes and the effects of time on
materials. Perhaps some young engineer,
even during his Graduate Training Course
days here, may make important contri-
butions. The opportunity is waiting.
What Do You Want to Do?
It's the same in other departments at
Allis-Chalmers. Ore processing methods
and machinery—electronic equipment—
public works—steam turbine and genera-
tor design—hydraulics—manufacturing
—research—sales—they all hold oppor-
tunities. Here you'll have a chance, as a
Graduate Training Course engineer, to
look over the widest range of industrial
fields covered by any manufacturing firm
in the country. You can help plan your
own course, get advanced degrees. It's a
shortcut to finding the work of your choice.
Write for information and literature, or
call on the Allis-Chalmers district office
in your locality.
year. Then—into the practical business
world. That's when I found the shortcut.
I enrolled in the Allis-Chalmers Graduate
Training Course in 1936, and very soon I
got interested in the big transformers. I've
been with them ever since, and they've
given me a lot in accomplishment and
satisfaction.
Back to Stay
Of course, during two years in the Gradu-
ate Training Course I got around a good
deal in the big West Allis works. Had
some time in the shops, got acquainted
with the work of many departments, tried
my hand at design, test, sales application
work. But I came right back to trans-
formers and have always been a lot more
satisfied because I'd seen a broad range of

LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITY? LOOK AT L&amp;N!
Because instruments are basic
both to industrial and to scientific
work, the instrument field ranks
high in opportunity. As long as men
make pig iron or pills, guns or butter,
clothing or kilowatts or gasoline, in-
dustry will use more and more instru-
ments on the production line. As
long as scientists "unscrew the
inscrutable" they will need instru-
ments for laboratories, defense proj-
ects, and industrial research.
As a result, L&amp;N job opportunities
are quite varied. The openings in
sales engineering utilize technical
training in the examination of proc-
esses, and in selection and application
of correct instruments in industrial
plants. Other openings are in re-
search and still others in engineering
development of L&amp;N products. Also
beckoning are production, advertis-
ing, inspection and other operations.
We make automatic, balance-type
electrical instruments for controlling,
measuring and indicating tempera-
ture, chemical concentration, com-
bustion, frequency &amp; load, flow and
other conditions. We make heat-
treatingprocess equipment complete.
We make laboratory-type instru-
ments in forms for scientists from
freshman to Ph.D.-plus.
Our chosen portion of the auto-
matic control and instrument field
is in high-precision, high-dependa-
bility equipment. Commercially, we
are one of the leaders; we have
grown in every decade of our history,
and continue to grow. And we are
innovators; we pioneered many basic

others, and will continue to do so.

To Pump Nickel Ore Concentrate
7V2 Miles
A 71/2-mile pipeline has been complet-
ed by The International Nickel Company
of Canada, Limited, through which the
bulk concentrate from 3,650,000 tons of
nickel-copper ore is being pumped annual-
ly from its newly-built Creighton con-
centrator to its reduction plants at Copper
Cliff, Ontario. It is believed that never
before has concentrate been carried by
pipeline in such quantity over such a dis-
tance.
IN THE NEWS
(Continued from page id)
Part of International Nickel's $130,-
000,000 program of underground mine
expansion, the pipeline artery has been
integrated into an elaborate pipeline sys-
tem which also carries tailing, or waste
material, from both Creighton and Cop-
per Cliff to a disposal area midway be-
tween the two plants.
The system has '2 miles of trestle, at
some points 65 feet high to assure a slope
to and from each of the five relay pump-
ing stations so that the concentrate lines
will be self-draining in case of difficulties.
All told, 3 million board feet of lumber
and 40 miles of wooden pipe were used.
When milling 10,000 tons of nickel-
copper ore a day at Creighton, approxi-
mately 1,800 tons of concentrate and
8,200 tons of tailing are produced. Water
added to the concentrate makes a pulp
which flows through the pipeline at the
rate of 800 gallons per minute. The tail-
ing pulp flows at the rate of 2,500 gal-
lons per minute.
Despite the rigorous northern winter
weather, the complete pumping system
has been designed for trouble-free opera-
tion. Several times the temperature has
dropped to 30 degrees below zero with no
operating difficulties.
Special Electric Drive
For Giant Rolling Mill
A special electric drive, largest of its
kind, is being built by the General Elec-
tric Company for a giant rolling mill that
holds a world record for squeezing five-
ton blocks of white-hot steel into long
bars, called "blooms."
The 12,000-horsepower G-E unit will
be supplied to the Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel
Corporation for its blooming mill at Ali-
quippa, Pa. It will replace a 40-year-old
steam engine that powered the mill to a
record production of 183,728 tons of
blooms during March, 1949.
Designed to keep pace with the de-
mands of a steel-hungry defense effort,
the equipment will constitute the nation's
most powerful reversing mill drive for
converting ingots into blooms. It will in-
clude twin 6,000-horsepower motors, each
of which will drive one of the mill's two
huge pressure rolls.

we ever
run out of gas?
Running out of the crude oil that
powers and lubricates our civilization
is not an immediate danger. Scientific
methods of exploration, drilling, and
recovery keep pushing farther and
farther into the future the day when
petroleum must be supplemented by
other raw materials. When that day
comes, however, there is no danger
that the American economy will slow
down.
Standard Oil already knows how to
make high-quality gasoline from coal
or oil shale. The supply of these raw
materials is far greater than the re-
serves of petroleum. It is important
that the research and development
work in the entire field of synthetic
fuels continue so as to lower the cost
and raise quality still higher.
Work with synthetic fuels is only
one example of how Standard Oil
plans ahead to serve its customers.
By working to keep this company in
the forefront of one of America's most
competitive industries, our research-
ers and engineers are helping to keep
America itself ahead and to make life
better for every American.

Having figured the material costs,
$.049 per projectile, labor costs, $.01237
per projectile, and depreciation cost
$.019, a sum of $.08037 per projectile as
tangible costs is arrived at. In the prev-
ious method of manufacturing, an over-
head cost equal to the tangible costs was
figured. In this situation, I believe an
overhead of % of the tangible cost would
be more appropriate. My reason for this
conclusion is that one of the principle
items in overhead is maintenance and
with the powder metal process, mainten-
ance will drop considerable. This is true
because instead of eleven screw machines
to service there are now only three punch
presses and two automatic screw machines,
both of these needing less maintenance
than the complicated tooling used on the
former eleven screw machines. The
amount of maintenance needed for the
furnace would be very low, because there
are very few moving parts. Another fac-
tor which I shall somewhat erroneously
include as an overhead deduction is the
fact that the sintering furnaces would not
be used solely for this operation, and thus
POWDER METALLURGY
(Continued from page 20)
writing off their total value to this opera-
tion would be an error. The reason I
state this is that the sintering furnaces
which have a twenty foot by two foot or
forty square foot capacity, can handle
7.5 lbs. of powder per square foot. This
gives a capacity of 300 lbs. of powder
metal in the furnaces at any one time. The
maximum weight of projectiles which
would be in the furnace at any one time
20 min.
would be approximately x 2500
60 min.
x .275 x .89 = 204 lbs. in the fast or
second sintering furnace. This means that
96 lbs. of other material can be sintered
in this furnace at all times. In the first
40
or slow sintering furnace — x 2500 x
60
.215 x .89 = 302 lbs. of powder would
be in the furnace at all times and thus this
furnace could be used for no other pur-
pose. However, if you figure that
96
or 1/3 of both the labor and the de-
300
preciation on the fast furnace is applicable
to some other purpose ,the result has some
significance.
Taking the figure of $.08037 and multi-
plying by 175% gives a total cost to pro-
ducer of $.1405 per projectile and adding
10% profit gives a selling price of
$.15455 per projectile. This price is
.16049 — .15455 = $.00594 less than
the previous price. Multiplying this sav-
ing by 12,000,000 will give a total saving
on the order of $71,000 which is a con-
siderable sum of money. I believe, how-
ever, that in actual practice, if powder
metals were used, the total cost would be
very close to the cost using the previous
method.
Assuming that the costs by both prev-
ious and proposed methods should be
equal, there is another argument in favor
of power metallurgy. This is that bar
stock, which was formerly used for pro-
jectiles, is one of the most critical ma-
terials on the market today. Even those
concerns with high priority ratings can-
not fully satisfy their demand for bar
stock. Powder metal, which as yet is not
critical, could help release bar stock for
other purposes. Another factor is the
wastage of steel from cutting the I.D.
With powder metal, there is very little
wastage except in finishing. Last of all
screw machines, which are also in great
demand, could be released for other pur-
poses.
Conclusion
In conclusion, I would like to state
that although powder metallurgy has been
adopted to many uses in industry it is still
in its infancy. In the future, as new
methods of fabrication and forming are
developed, this industry should rank with
stamping, casting, and machining in im-
portance. Even today methods of making
undercuts are being tried. If a success-
ful method is found, powder metallurgy
could very possibly make casting obsolete.

iMk

The State of Michigan requested the department to act as supervising naval architect in the
design and construction of the new Highway Department car and passenger ferry which went
into service at the Straits of Mackinaw on the 13th of January, 1952.
The new vessel is 360 feet long by 75-foot beam and incorporates modern design charac-
teristics of comfort, safety, speed and economy. The power plant consists of four Nordberg
8-cylinder diesel engines delivering 2325 SHP to each propeller, giving a speed of about
16 MPH. The hull form was developed in the Naval Tank for speed and ice breaking functions.
Carrying about 130 to 150 automobiles, the latest addition to the State's ferry service will ex-
pedite traffic between the upper and lower sections of the State.

YOUR BEARING NOTEBOOK

How to help o scraper
do its level best
Bearing applications on large-capaciit scraper wheels
pose two problems to design engineers. One is the heavy
loads. The other is wear. Engineers soKe both problems
ax once by mounting scraper wheels on Timken* tapered
roller bearings. Line contact between rollers and races
of Timken bearings provides extra load-carrying capacity.
The true rolling motion and incredibly smooth surface
finish of Timken bearings practically eliminate friction
and wear within the bearing.
Mounting scraper wheels
on TIMKEN bearings
This is a standard wheel application showing indirect mounting of
Timken bearings. The bearings are adjusted by means of a nut.
Cups are mounted in the counterbored hubs. The use of Timken
bearings in this application keeps the shaft concentric with the
housing, thus the seals are more effective in keeping dirt out,
lubricant in.

The new 14-building research center of the Union Oil
Company of California is unique in many features of design.
Here, a research staff of 250 will have every modern facility
for developing products that will shape the company's
future progress.
The same future-minded attitude was maintained toward
plant operating costs by the architects and engineers
who specified equipment. To insure lasting efficiency and
maintenance economy, they chose Jenkins Valves for more
than 3,000 control points on the miles of steam, water,
sanitation, fire-control, and other pipelines essential to
operations.
Like so many of the nation's top-flight building specialists,
these men have confidence in the extra measure of efficiency
and endurance built into Jenkins Valves.
Despite this extra value, builders pay no more for Jenkins
Valves. That is why, for new installations, for all replacements,
the Jenkins Diamond is their reliable guide to lasting valve
economy. Jenkins Bros., 100 Park Avenue, New York 17;

ORGANIZING SERVICE
Art" we asked to detect the approach of enemy attack through the strato-
sphere? Is there a commercially better method for extracting sugar from
beets? Can we help find alloys (for use in jet planes) that may replace those
made of materials now in short supply?
Unlimited numbers of technical problems confront our generation.
Anions our expanding concepts of civilization and under the pressures of a
world-wide attack upon our basic freedoms we meet the questions of "Is it
possible?" and "What is best?" and "How may the data be obtained?" at
every turn.
An organization able to attack most problems, to follow through the in-
tricate maze of developments, to reconcile interests, is cooperating in a field
that gives maximum opportunity for service.

Modern Motor Plant Hums with
Automatic Efficiency
A new engine plant, recently put into
operation by an automotive company, il-
lustrates the postwar trend toward greater
efficiency and automation in manufactur-
ing processes.
The plant is packed with new develop-
ments that make all operations almost en-
tirely automatic. Everything is moved
electrically, hydraulically or mechanically.
Hard physical labor has been practically
eliminated.
The new plant occupies 328,229 square
feet and has a machining capacity of 60
engines per hour. Engine blocks are ma-
chined on fully automatic transfer ma-
chines, averaging 84 feet in length. They
perform milling, drilling, reaming, bor-
ing, topping, and all other operations on
the block. Similar machines are used on
the intake manifold, bearing caps, cylin-
der head, and chain case cover.
Machine operators scan control panels
where banks of lights inform them of the
progress of the part through the machines.
The panels are of varying length, the
largest being 26 feet long, 6 feet high,
and one foot wide. It has a total of 175
starting, timing, and relay controls.
A single transfer machine on the en-
gine block requires 10 miles of electrical
wiring. It uses 32 electric motors and
three hydraulic units.
Many of the machines, once set in
operation, do their own thinking. An ex-
ample of this is the crankshaft balancing
machine. The operator loads the machine
which automatically indicates to an at-
tached drill machine what drilling is
required. The crankshaft is moved into
the drill; drilled; removed; transferred
to a second balancer; tested; finish drilled
if necessary; and passed along to the next
machine, all automatically.
The machines perform their work
with exceptional precision. One that bores
holes in the connecting rod is held to
three ten-thousandths of an inch toler-
ance, inside dimension. This machine
bores piston pin and crankshaft bearing
holes in three connecting rods simultan-
eously. Even more accurate, however, are
the automatic electronic gages used to
check the work of the machines.
Self-Supporting Lightning Arrester
This 195-kv self-supporting lightning
arrester being readied for tests at the
Westinghouse Electric Corporation's high
voltage laboratory at Trafford, Pa., utilizes
a spiral arrangement of the arrester units
that eliminates the need for structural sup-
ports. Only half as tall as its 20-foot pre-
decessor, the new arrester design reduces
both space requirements and cost. The
short sturdy arrester assembly can be
mounted on wheels for greater utility. The
195-kv assembly is used in connection
with 230-kv lines.

Fastest Cold Steel Strip Drive
The world's fastest cold strip steel
drive, designed to furnish power to pro-
duce a continuous strip of 30-inch-wide
steel at a top speed of 79 ^ miles an
hour, is being built by the General Electric
Company.
This 21,650-horsepower drive is part
of an order for G-E equipment for the
United States Steel Company's giant, new
Fairless Works, now under construction
near Morrisville, Pa. The order is be-
lieved to be the largest ever placed for
steel mill electric apparatus, and includes
an annealing furnace three stories high
and 100 feet long that will be one of the
biggest of its kind ever built.
In the face of skyrocketing defense de-
mands for steel, the Fairless Works will
have a capacity of 1,800,000 ingot tons a
year, and will be the largest integrated
steel-making installation to be built in
less than two years time.
The record-breaking G-E drive will
power a mill which will roll strip steel to
a thickness of approximately six thous-
andths of an inch. Six motors, ranging
from 1400 to 6000 horsepower, will com-
prise the drive.
The annealing furnace will have a rated
capacity of 30 tons of annealed steel an
hour. Annealing is a system of high tem-
perature heating to remove the temper
from the steel, and prepare it for process-
ing into tinplate products. The 300-foot
annealing line, of which the furnace is a
part, also will be driven and controlled
by G-E equipment. Operating at 1000
feet a minute, it will be one of the world's
fastest.
New Automatic Jet Pilot
Called Step Toward Pushbuttons
An automatic pilot designed to relieve
U. S. Navy fliers of 90 per cent of their
"stick and rudder" work was announced
today by the General Electric Company,
which described the device as a major step
toward complete pushbutton control of
high-speed jet interceptor planes.
G-E engineers said the new autopilot
"does just about everything a human pilot
can do except actually take the plane off
the ground and land it," controls the
plane with accuracy and stability at near-
sonic speeds, and can be used in such
maneuvers as gunnery runs on enemy
aircraft.
Designated the G-3, the autopilot was
developed by the company's Aeronautic
and Ordnance Systems Division here with
the co-operation of the Navy's Bureau of
Aeronautics. It is designed for use in
such high-speed Navy jet fighters as the
Douglas F3D-2 Skyknight, the Grumman
F9F-5P Panther, and the Douglas A2D
attack plane.
"Flying, fighting and navigating high
speed aircraft has never been an easy job
for one man, and the greatly increased
speed of today's jet fighters has made the
task ever more difficult,' said W. C. Heck-

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Modern construction methods have changed walls from the
self-supporting type to a mere covering which does not sup-
port its own weight for more than one or two stories. Hence
the definition of "curtain wall":—the facing or enclosure of
the structural steel frame. This frame supports the entire
weight of modern buildings.
The need has existed for a covering that would not only
clothe the building, but be lightweight, economical and
space saving. Because these requirements are more than ade-
quately met with stainless steel curtain wall construction,
this method is becoming increasingly popular with cost and
space conscious owners, builders and architects.

ing reinforcing. Crucible 18-8 stainless as the outside face
offers excellent resistance to weather and fire while pro-
viding eternal beauty with a minimum of maintenance;
the inside face can be finished or painted to suit the re-
quirements of modern building interiors. Since 18-8 is
restricted in use, a good substitute material, type 430
stainless, now government decontrolled, offers the same
benefits as 18-8 stainless.
moisture penetration
The unique characteristics of the cellular glass insulation
stop moisture vapor migration from one face of the
panel to the other. The cellular insulation properly de-
signed and installed assures that condensation will not
take place anywhere within the sandwich.
insulation
Although less than half as thick as the usual wall con-
struction, this Crucible stainless steel panel construction
has more than twice the insulating value. The "U" value
(overall thermal conductivity) is approximately 0.15
BTU Hr./Sq.Ft./T.
fire resistance
The Crucible sandwich met the requirements of a
standard 4-hour fire test conducted in the testing
laboratories of the National Bureau of Standards.
This meets all old building codes and is double, or
better, the requirements of modern enlightened
building codes.
erection and* fabrication
Since a building frame is not precision built, the
attachment of the panel walls to the frame is done
with fastening devices that provide necessary 3-
dimensional adjustment. Panels can be made at the
building site, and a 24-hour casting-to-fastening
cycle is possible.
technical service available
Though the use of some stainless steel is now re-
stricted, Crucible metallurgists and development
personnel are continuing to investigate improved
methods of curtain wall and other construction so
that better buildings can be built when stainless
is more freely available. For more information

Engineer, Scientist, Teacher
BY
ARNOLD M. KUETHE
Department of Aeronautical Engineering
Dr. Theodor von Karman, renowned
as a scientist, engineer, and teacher oc-
cupies a unique place in engineering.
Every branch of the science has benefited
from his genius for simplifying and clari-
fying physical concepts to the point where
they can "go to work" for the engineer.
Dr. von Karman was born in Budapest,
Hungary, in 1881, the son of a Professor
of Philosophy at the University. He at-
tended first the Polytechnic Institute in
Budapest and later Gottingen University,
Germany, where he was awarded the D.Sc.
degree in 1908. At Gottingen, he was a
student of Prof L. Prandtl, the "father"
of modern aerodynamics. In 1912, Dr.
von Karman was appointed Professor and
Director of the Aerodynamics Research
Institute at the Technical University at
Aachen, Germany, which position he held
until he came to this country in 1930 to
be Director of the Guggenheim Aeronau-
tical Laboratory at the California Institute
of Technology. In 1948 he resigned his
position at Cal Tech and has become
something of a free lance Professor. Dur-
ing the current year he is a Fulbright Lec-
turer at the Sarbonne in Paris.
His many honors include honorary doc-
torates from eight universities in this
country and Europe; after the war he re-
ceived the Medal of Merit from our gov-
ernment and the French government made
him an Officer of the Legion of Honor.
He has received medals and awards from
most of the outstanding technical societies
in the world, and in 1949 was made Hon-
orary Professor at Columbia University.
At the age of 72, Dr. von Karman is
still adding to his total of around one
hundred fifty papers, two or more books,
articles in encyclopedia and lectures. His
collected works, covering some 3000
pages, will be published shortly. If any-
thing, his contributions become more
penetrating and vital as the years go by,
and it is my purpose to describe some
of the most important Advances for which
he is responsible.
Very soon after beginning a study of
his works, one is impressed by von Kar-

Arnold M. Keuthe
man's physical insight and his ability to
segregate the most important from the
least important aspects of a problem. His
intuition, born of a thorough understand-
ing of physical concepts and a feeling for
which effects are likely to dominate a par-
ticular phenomenon, first clears away the
underbrush of secondary effects;; he then
concentrates on an engineering solution
of the problem. The drive to simplify
problems just enough to permit useful an-
swers is a thread which runs through his
entire output of scientific work.
In the field of structures, his doctoral
thesis (1908) was an experimental and
theoretical study of the buckling of col-
umns; the material is still quoted in mod-
ern textbooks. Another paper (1932) con-
cerns the concept of "effective width" of
the sheet in a sheetstringer combination
when stressed beyond the buckling point
of the sheet. Approximate methods for
solving problems in elasticity and plasti-
city are taken up in a series of articles.
His greatest contributions have been in
the field of aerodynamics and fluid me-
chanics. His first important work in this
area (1911) was a detailed analysis of the
"vortex street" behind a cylindrical body;
he was able to predict the frequency with
which vortices are shed by the cylinder
and to predict the drag of the cylinder.
In 1921 he simplified the equations of
motion for flow in the boundary layer and
derived the von Karman integral relation.
This relation has been widely used ever
since to study the approximate build-up
of the boundary layer on a submerged
body.
In 1926 Prandtl introduced the "mix-
ing length" approach to the analysis of
the turbulent boundary layer. In 1930
von Karman refined the approach and in-
troduced the concept of similarity of the
turbulent fields in boundary layers, wakes,
and jets. In 1835 he extended his theory
to show approximately the effect of com-
pressibility on the turbulent boundary
layer; later more complete studies by
others have shown that von Karman's
theory is an excellent first approximation
to high speed effects.
In 1938 von Karman and Howarth
published a classical paper identifying the
"correlation tensor" for an isotropic turbu-
lent field. They derived the fundamental
equations governing the dying out or
decay of the turbulence produced when a
fluid flows through a grid or coarse
screen. The concept of isotropy had been
introduced by G. I. Taylor in 1935, and
in 1941 Kolmogoroff extended the theory
so that the analysis of von Karman and
Howarth could be applied to a limited
extent to turbulent boundary layers, wakes
and jets. Since that time, von Karman
and Lin have extended Kolmogoroff's
work to define its range of application to
engineering problems.
Much of the analytical work on super-
sonic flow over thin bodies and wings is
based on the work of von Karman and
Moore in 1932. They linearized the equa-
tions of motion for flow past axially sym-
metric bodies and were able to derive a
good approximation to the pressure dis-
tribution over thin bodies at supersonic
speeds. In the subsequent 20 years, a vast
literature has grown up using the ideas
contained in the von Karman-Moo.e
paper.

Machine Tool Engineering, a most vital
contributor to our national economy, rep-
resents only a small part of the field of
Production Engineering as will be shown
in this article. Product Design, Tool
Engineering, Parts Processing and Lay-
out are closely associated fields.
A machine tool as defined by the Na-
tional Machine Tool Builders Association
is, "a power-driven, complete metal work-
ing machine not portable by hand, used
to remove metal in the form of chips."
In simpler terms, it is a power-driven
machine used to cut or shape metal.
There are other important metal work-
ing machines, such as presses, brakes (for
bending sheets), shears, forging and
stamping machines and machines for
forming metal powders, molding plastics
and glass, and for die casting. These ma-
chines resemble machine tools in their
construction but are only "kissing kin"
of machine tools, as they do not remove
metal in the form of chips.
The machine tool is a most vital unit in
our industrial economy. Quoting from the
Encyclopedia Britannica: "Machine tools
lie at the basis of all modern industrial

production, for they are not only neces-
sary for the manufacture of every class of
engine and class of mechanism; but every
manufactured product, whether fabric or
metal goods, soap, food stuffs, building
materials, scientific instruments, etc., must
be made either on a machine tool or a
machine which is constructed with their
help."

Fig. I. A Semi Production ram-type turret lathe set up with chucking tools to
machine an air cylinder stem.
The importance of the machine tool in-
dustry can be measured by its service in
the promotion of human welfare rather
than by the dollar volume of its business,
or by the number of plants in the indus-
try, or by the number of men employed.
Compared to the giant industries, the
machine tool industry is small. It norm-
ally employs approximately fifty thousand
men. Its total investment is about one
hundred and fifty million dollars, and its
sales are currently averaging about $300
millions per year, about 2% of the coun-
try's capital goods and approximately
equal to the monthly sales of a single
large automobile manufacturer.
The demand for machine tools fluctu-
ates widely from year to year, and the
capacity of the industry varies with it. In
1942 shipments reached the astonishing
total of $1,323,000,000 or about 28% of
the total country's capital goods. January
1952 saw a new high of shipments of
266% of the average for 1945-46-47 in
spite of the critical limitation of materials
imposed on the machine tool industry.
Capacity had necessarily to expand suffi-
ciently to take care of that peak load.
Large investments in plants and equip-
ment had to be made which must be car-
ried over the dull times when most of the
plant facilities stand idle.
Because of these wide variations in de-
mand, the industry must operate on an
elastic basis, and has shown great ingenu-
ity in increasing its production rapidly on
short notice.
The industry is made up of about 250
companies. Many of these are small, some
of them make only an occasional machine
tool; so that it may be said that the pri-
mary machine tool building companies
number about 200. Some of these com-
panies are quite large, employing as many
as 5,000 men, but the average company
represents an investment of about
$800,000 and employs normally from 200
to 250 men.
Most machine tool companies are own-
er-managed. Most of them were started
by one man or a small group of men who
had been brought up in the business and
had received their training from others
who had spent their lives in it and were
thoroughly familiar with the varied

problems involved, whether in purchas-
ing, sales, design or management. I per-
sonally know a number of machine tool
plants now being operated by the second
and third generations of the founder's
families.
The first concern of the machine tool
industry is accuracy. By its very nature it
requires personnel of the finest type.
There is no industry in which designing
genius and ability to build efficiency and
sustained performance into machines are
of greater importance. Its engineering
staffs are confronted repeatedly with cru-
cial problems which demand a high order
of skill and training. The service rendered
by the machine tools of today is ample
evidence of the degree to which these
engineers and designers have fulfilled
their responsibilities.
While there is no monopoly in the ma-
chine tool industry, the tendency in gen-
eral is for each company to specialize on
one type of machine and develop it to a
high degree. A few companies still will
build a type of machine tool that the cus-
tomer wants. Such a company requires a
large group of specialists, i.e., men train-
ed in electricity, hydraulics, materials, etc.
Competition between machine tool
builders is very keen, not only between
builders of the same type of machine but
between builders of different types which
are applicable to the same kind of work,
as often a given job may be done on sev-
eral different types of machines equally
well. The purchaser s decision is almost
always based on economy in the operation
of the machine tool, the accuracy and sur-
face finish that it will produce and the
rate of production the machine will yield
under normal conditions.
James Watt patented the steam engine
in 1769. It could not be built until some
ten years later, however, until Wilkinson
developed a "precision" horizontal bor-
ing machine. The cutting tool was sup-
ported on a heavy bar extending through
the cylinder and mounted in bearings at
each end of the work. The bar was ro-
tated in the cylinder manually, through a
worm-gear reduction, while the tool was
moved along the cylinder, a slight amount
for each revolution, by a second man turn-
ing a screw. This was the first basic de-
sign of a machine tool in which the ma-
chine maintained rigidity of the cutting
tool with respect to the work. In 1800
Maudslay, a Londoner, invented the screw
cutting lathe which was manually power-
ed. The milling machine was invented by
Eli Whitney in America in 1818 and
used for the first time with jigs and fix-
tures for the mass manufacture of inter-
changeable parts for American arms. Real
impetus was given to the development of
machine tools at the time of the American
Civil War. But it wasn't until after 1900
when the individual motor drive began to
replace the belt drive, as a means of ap-
plying power to the machine tools, that
accelerated progress was made.
It was at this time that high speed
steel for cutting tools was invented by
Taylor and White in America. This tool
material permitted increased cutting
speeds of two to four times that previ-
ously used with the century old carbon
steel and the infrequently used Mushet
steel developed in I860. It wasn't until
World War I, however, that the appli-
cation of high speed steel became general,
just as the second World War made more
general the use of sintered carbides as cut-
ting speeds and required much greater
power and rigidity in the machine tools.
During both wars many of the machine
tools were not adequate to use properly,
the cutting tools then available.
There are two general types of machine
tools available today, the so-called stand-
ard types and those for special or single
purpose work. The standard types com-
prise the lathe, planer, shaper, cylindrical
and surface grinders, drilling machines,
and saws, which, with only a vise or a few
special clamps and tools, are adapted to a
wide variety of work. These machine tools
are used principally in toolrooms, tool
and die shops, repair shops and manu-
facturing plants where parts are produced
in small quantities. The special types
comprise screw machines in which rolled
or extruded bar stock is used as material
for the part, automatic screw machines,
turret lathes, Fig. 1, multiple-spindle
turning machines, broaching machines, the
centerless grinders, multiple spindle drill-

LIQUID HELIUM II
National Bureau of Standards Technical Report
Using a method analogous to that em-
ployed by 9th-century physicists to study
ordinary sound waves, Dr. J. R. Pellam
of the National Bureau of Standards has
developed a very simple yet highly accur-
ate mechanical technique for investigating
"second sound", that unique wavelike
process of heat transfer occurring only in
helium II near absolute zero. The new
technique, known as the thermal Rayleigh
disk method,1 makes use of the torque
exerted on a light disk suspended in the
path of standing waves of second sound.
It thus constitutes the first mechanical
method for detection of this phenomenon.
The NBS development not only provides
an effective means for determining the
velocity and intensity of second sound—
of basic theoretical importance in low-
temperature physics—but also appears
actually to verify the presence of a super-
fluid in helium II and to open up an en-
tirely new field of "quantum hydro-
dynamics' based on the peculiar heat-flow
characteristics of this remarkable liquid.
Helium liquefies at 4.2°K, the lowest
liquefication temperature of any substance.
Between the temperature of 4.2° and
2.19 K, liquid helium behaves as a nor-
mal fluid. In this state it is known as
helium I. At 2.19°K and below, however,
helium I changes into the liquid form
known as helium II. The characteristics
of helium II are so unlike those of helium
I or of any other fluid that it is often re-
ferred to as a fourth state of matter or as
the quantum fluid. Thus it acts as though
it has no viscosity, flowing, apparently
without friction, through virtually vac-
uum-tight openings and up the side of a
containing vessel at remarkable speed in
seeming defiance of gravity. Its direction
of flow through narrow orifices may be
controlled entirely by the introduction of
temperature differences.
One of the unusual properties of
helium II is its high thermal conductivity
—three million times that of helium I and
much greater than that of any other sub-
stance. In all other forms of matter, heat

Apparatus used in the National Bureau of Standards low temperature laboratory
to measure the torque exerted on the thermal Rayleigh disk by waves of second
sound in liquid helium II.

diffuses from point to point at a compara-
tively slow rate through the collision of
one molecule with another. In liquids
other than helium II this process is ex-
tremely slow. In helium II, on the other
hand, heat is transferred many times
faster than in other materials by means
of a kind of wave motion analogous to
sound and known as second sound.
The remarkable properties of helium II
and the phenomenon of second sound
have been explained by mathematical
theories which indicate that helium II con-
sists of two kinds of fluids. One portion
is a normal fluid, similar in nature to
helium I; the other is a superfluid, which
accounts for the unusual effects observed.
The atoms of the superfluid have had

point where thermal motion has ceased,
yet the attractive forces between them are
not great enough to produce a rigid solid.
According to current theories, the appli-
cation of heat to some part of a quantity
of helium II upsets the equilibrium be-
tween the two fluids, resulting in a migra-
tion of the superfluid atoms from cold to
hot while the normal fluid atoms move
from hot to cold. As the superfluid is
assumed to have virtually zero viscosity, a
sustained internal vibration between the
fluid components becomes possible, and
this internal convection type of wave pro-
pagation constitutes second sound.
Since second sound is basically a "con-
centration wave," consisting of a progres-
sive change in the relative proportions of
normal fluid and superfluid at any point
in the liquid, it has until now been de-
tected only by temperature-sensitive de-
vices, such as a bolometer. Neither pres-
sure nor velocity microphones could be
used because the two fluid components
oscillate exactly out of phase, and there
is no net transfer of mass or momentum.
The thermal Rayleigh disk method for
studying second sound is unique in that it
utilizes the mechanical forces produced by
the streaming of the normal and super-
fluid atoms about a disk placed in the path
of the waves. The elaborate electronic
equipment previously required for re-
search in second sound is thus eliminated.
The Rayleigh disk was originally de-
veloped by Lord Rayleigh in 1880 for de-
tecting and measuring the strength of
ordinary sound waves. Its operation de-
pends on the tendency of a disk or other
flat object when freely suspended to align
itself crosswise to the direction of fluid
flow. This tendency results from distor-
tion of the stream lines of fluid about the
disk, which causes differences in the pres-
sure exerted on the disk by the fluid at
various points. Since the torque on the
disk depends on the kinetic energy distri-
bution of the fluid about the disk—that is,
on the square of the particle velocity—

(Courtesy National Bureau of Standards)

and the properties of liquid helium II.
the direction of particle flow does not af-
fect the torque exerted on the disk, and
two opposing currents, such as are pre-
sumed to occur in second sound, do not
mutually cancel.
The principle of the Rayleigh Disk is
thus ideally suited to experimental verifi-
cation of the two-fluid theory of helium
II. If, as has been postulated, helium II
consists of a mixture of normal fluid and
superfluid, and second sound consists of
a two-way migration of superfluid and
normal fluid atoms in opposite direction,
then a light disk freely suspended in the
path of second sound should rotate to-
ward a position perpendicular to the path
of the heat flow, even though there is no
net transfer of helium II in either direc-
tion.
In the course of a continuing investiga-
tion of the low-temperature properties of
matter at NBS, a thermal Rayleigh disk
apparatus was set up to determine experi-
mentally the validity of these conclusions.
The subsequent measurement were made
by Dr. Pellam, assisted by W. B. Hanson
of the NBS staff. In this apparatus, a light-
weight mirrored disk, 0.5 inch in diam-
eter, is suspended by a thin torsion wire
at the midpoint of a horizontally oriented
cylindrical glass cavity containing helium
II. Standing waves of second sound are
set up within this cavity when heat oscil-
lations of the proper frequency are intro-
duced by means of an electrically heated
carbon resistor strip which makes up one
end wall of the cavity.
The resonant cavity, mirrored disk, and
suspension are all immersed in a dewar
of liquid helium II enclosed in a vacuum
system. The temperature of the helium is
obtained from the pressure above the
liquid as indicated by a manometer. Init-
ially the disk is placed at an angle of 45 J
to the direction of the flow of the waves
of second sound. The small deviations of
the disk from its initial equilibrium posi-
tion at various temperatures and fre-
quencies are then observed and measured
by noting the resultant deflection of a
light beam. The sharp response of the
disk as the system is tuned through re-
sonance verifies the existence of the inter-
nal mass flow of the two fluid compon-
ents and the associated kinetic energy
density. A light source projects the light
beam down the axis of the resonant cavity
onto the silvered disk, where it is reflected
to fall in focus on a galvanometer scale.
Very small deflections may thus be deter-
mined without difficulty. From these data,
together with corresponding values of tem-

The thousands of tons of nickel, cop-
per, and other strategic materials that
were recovered from shop and other in-
dustrial scrap during World War II taught
a salvage lesson that industry continued
to remember after the end of hostilities.
As a result, most plants have maintained
rigidly controlled systems of scrap segre-
gation and control, starting at the ma-
chines from which the scrap comes.
Despite even the greatest care in scrap
control, however, mixups are bound to
occur. This, obviously, emphasizes the
need for simple tests that can be made
on the spot without the need for thorough
laboratory analysis. Such spot tests are also
useful in the recovery of metals and alloys
in worn-out or obsolete machinery and
other equipment.
The Development and Research Divi-
sion of The International Nickel Com-
pany, Inc., has outlined some simple and
easily carried out tests for the identifica-
tion of nine wrought white metals and
alloys in general use in many fabricating
shops. Included are nickel, Monel, In-
coloy, 70/30 cupro-nickel, and four

Lawrence Mack
types of Stainless Steel—304, 310, 321,
and 430.
All of these are of medium density.
Both the light metals—such as aluminum
and magnesium, and the heavy metals—
such as lead and silver, of course, can be
distinguished from the other white metals
by hand weighing.
Besides the simple spot tests to the nine
metals outlined, the Division also has pub-
lished a revised edition of "Rapid Identi-
fication of Some Metals and Alloys." This
booklet contains procedures for identify-
ing more than 125 metals and alloys. In-
cluded are those for identifying both
wrought and cast-materials—from alloy
cast irons like Ni-Resist and nickel alloy
steels—to precious metals and their alloys.
All tests are qualitative. Quantitative
results require chemical or spectrographic
analysis.
Equipment and reagents for identifying
the nine materials outlined are simple and
consist of:
Reagents
10 percent hydrochloric acid
1:1 hydrochloric acid
10 percent potassium ferricyanide
Concentrated nitric acid
1:1 nitric acid
Note: The 10 percent solution of
hydrochloric acid can be made from the

four parts of distilled water.
The 1:1 solution of nitric acid can be
made from the concentrated acid by add-
ing an equal amount of distilled water.
Materials
1. Magnet
2. Small medicine dropper or glass rod
Note: Before tests are made, the speci-
men must be cleaned thoroughly to re-
move contaminants such as dirt, grease, or
corrosion products. Rubbing with emery
paper will usually be satisfactory.
Procedure
First we must obtain the basic material
grouping of the metal being tested. To
do this we add one drop of 10 percent
hydrochloric acid and allow it to react
with the unknown metal for one minute.
Then add one drop of 10 percent potas-
sium ferricyanide solution and observe at
the end of thirty seconds. If a dark green
or blue color results, the material is one
of:
Group A.
Incoloy
Stainless Steel Type 304
Stainless Steel Type 310
Stainless Steel Type 321
Stainless Steel Type 430
If there is no color or a red, green, or
yellow-brown color, the material is one
of:
Group B.
Nickel
Monel
Inconel
70 Copper-30 Nickel
To identify a material in group A we
first test it with a magnet. If the ma-
terial is definitely magnetic, it is Stainless
Steel 430. Second, add a drop of 1:1
hydrochloric acid and allow it to react
for one minute. Then add one drop of
10 percent potassium ferricyanide solu-
tion and observe at the end of thirty
seconds. If the drop is white with a black
edge, the material is Stainless Steel 310.
If the drop is green or bluish green, the
material is Incoloy, Stainless Steel 304, or
Stainless Steel 321. There are no spot
tests which will distinguish accurately
among these three alloys and the operator
must repeat the test using known ma-
terials as standards and comparing the re-
actions with those on the unknown
materials.
To identify a material in group B we
add a drop of concentrated nitric acid
and observe at the end of one minute. If
no action occurs, the material is Inconel.
If the drop is a clear, pale green color,
the material is nickel. This may be con-
firmed by testing with a magnet; nickel is
definitely magnetic. On the other hand, if
the drop is a cloudy, blue-green color, the
material is either Monel or 70 Copper-30
Nickel. To differentiate between these
two possibilities we then add one drop
of 1:1 nitric acid to a clean portion of the
specimen, which is now known to be
either Monel or 70 Copper-30 Nickel,
and obseive after five seconds. If the drop
is bright green, the material is Monel. If
there is vigorous gassing and the drop is a
pale, blue-green color, then the material
is 70 Copper-30 Nickel.
Copper and Copper Alloys
Because there is such a shortage of cop-
per at the present time, it would be well

ing 10 grams of ferric chloride in 10 ml.
of concentrated hydrochloric acid and
diluting to 100 ml. Wash this solution off
with a fine stream of water after about
thirty seconds. The presence of a dark
spot indicates either phosphorus or
arsenic. The presence of phosphorus (by
chemical analysis) identifies phosphor
copper; the presence of arsenic identifies
arsenical copper. If no dark spot appear-
ed, the specimen is either tough-pitch
copper or oxygen-free, high-conductivity
copper, depending on the presence or ab-
sence of oxygen upon chemical analysis.
If we have a bronze, we first dissolve
a small specimen in a beaker with 1:1
nitric acid and boil the solution. A finely
divided white precipitate identifies a tin-
bronze; a gelatinous mass identifies a

One of the lesser known departments
in the Engineering College is the Wood
Technology Department. This department
has one of the best equipped laboratories
on the campus and yet, I doubt if one out
of twenty people who read this have ever
heard of it. With this article I hope to
introduce the Wood Technology Depart-
ment to the public and especially to its
metal-using brethren, the metallurgists.
At first glance, the average engineer
will probably say, "Why study wood? It
is an archaic material and the supply is
rapidly depleting." Oddly enough, we
are now using more wood than we have
ever used before and are finding new
uses for it every day. The reason wood is
not used in more ways is because of our
lack of technical knowledge of it. Com-
pared with metallurgy, wood technology
is a very young science and is dealing
with a much more complex material.
Neither are we running out of wood. It
is our one renewable engineering ma-
terial. We have a 80-year supply stand-
ing now and are growing almost as much
as we are now cutting. Also, we are just
beginning to tap the valuable timber re-
sources of Central and South America and
Africa.
The main problem is using wood as
an engineering material is to recognize
its properties and limitations and design

Harry F. Hillman
accordingly. There was a case during
the war of a wooden training plane which
was designed by a man who was familiar
with metals. Several of the parts on the
plane failed in tests. The whole thing was
scrapped because it was thought that the
wood was an inferior material. Actually
on further investigation, the fault turned
out to be in the method of fastening.
While the joints of this type would have
been satisfactory for metal, they were
not of the type suitable for wood. If a
man who had studied wood had been

consulted, a perfectly satisfactory structure
would have been designed. This is an
example of one of the things handled in
one phase of wood technology.
Our lab is equipped to handle thc
teaching of all phases of wood technology.
On the first floor is a room devoted to the
study of the structure and identification
of woods—a very important field since
many of the physical properties of wood
are directly related to its structure. There
are samples of all of the commercial
woods used in North America and
samples of all the woods commercially
imported into the United States. Material
covered in the course offffered in struc-
ture and identification is also important
in the pulp industry; the other chemical
uses of wood are also considered.
Below this is the timber testing and
gluing laboratory. Some of the equipment
can be seen in Fig. 1. It includes sev-
eral testing machines, two hot presses,
mechanical glue spreader for making ply-
wood panels, and a high-frequency heat
generator.
The next room is a tool grinding shop
where methods of tool sharpening, knife
angles, and precision grinding are studied.
Behind this section of the lab is a large
two story room which contains the dry
kiln and preserving plant. The kiln is a
small version of the most modern com-
mercial type. Much research is now going
on in kiln drying as the final quality and
properties of the wood are dependent on
the skill and method by which it is dried.
Because of the great demand for wood,
we are striving to dry it faster without
sacrificing quality. The preserving plant is
also a small version of the commercial
plants used to impregnate railroad ties,
poles, and timbers.
Next comes the room where the finish-
ing courseh is taught. This room is com-
plete with a spray booth and the most
modern spray equipment. Above this lab
is the wood-working shop which contains
all of the common wood-working ma-
chines. Some of these can be seen in Fig.
2. These machines are used to acquaint
the student with the machines used in the
wood using industries and, they are also
used for the research which we are now
doing in the machining of wood.

This is the most economical rope
we've ever made for construction equipment
ROEBLING is the best known name in wire rope.
That's partly because we were the first wire rope
maker in America. But more than that, we've
always led in developing better wire and better
rope for every purpose.
Today's Roebling Preformed "Blue Center" Steel
Wire Rope is the best choice for efficiency and
long life on excavating and construction equip-

ment. This rope has extra resistance to crushing
and abrasion... stands up under rough going. It
saves time and cuts costs.
There's a Roebling wire rope of the right speci-
fication for top service on any job. And Roebling

man, general manager of the Aeronautic
and Ordnance Systems Division. "For the
pilot who must also be a navigator and
gunner simultaneously, the G-3 offers an
all-electric means of relieving him of
many of the routine duties of flying so
that he may devote his time to these other
important operations."
The G-3 will hold the plane automati-
cally at the desired barometric altitude,
heading and attitude. The pilot can put
the plane through maneuvers he wishes by
means of push buttons and a miniature
control stick which moves under finger-tip
pressure. When the human pilot wants
the autopilot to take over, he pushes a
button and the device holds the airplane
at the same heading and attitude it was
in when the button was pushed. If this
attitude is other than level flight, the auto-
matic pilot will smoothly and automatical-
ly return the airplane to level when an-
other button is pushed.
The human pilot pushes still another
button to hold the plane at the desired
barometric altitude. By means of the
miniature control stick located on the right
side of the cockpit, and using only light
pressure, he can cause the plane to turn
left or right, climb or dive in a smooth
co-ordinated motion.
In addition to providing automatic
control of the plane, the G-3 also is used
as a "yaw damper" during manual flight
to stabilize the airplane and improve its
steadiness as a gun platform.
A unique safety provision prevents the
human pilot from engaging the autopilot
if the latter is not properly synchronized
to the airplane's flight conditions.
Newly-designed, non-tumbling gyros
permit the plane to maneuver through
complete loops and rolls without dis-
abling the gyroscopes through tumbling.
The G-3 system consists of a G-2
compass, a vertical gyro and a rate gyro
which feed electric signals into an ampli-
fier. The amplified signals are then ap-
plied to one or more of three motor-
driven acutuators which move the air-
plane's control surfaces.
Heading accuracy of G-3 autopilot is
about y2 degree. The G-3 is accurate to
better than J/4 degree in roll and pitch in
smooth air.
The G-3 will return the airplane to
level flight from any attitude up to 75 de-
grees in pitch or bank.
Barometric altitude control will hold the
airplane within 25 feet of any altitude
up to 10,000 feet, with slightly higher
errors at higher autitudes.
Look! No Support for Melting Metals
No one has ever seen the Indian rope
trick, but something just as incredible has
been done—the melting of aluminum
placed between two slightly conical hori-
zontal coils of copper spaced a few inches
apart and supplied with energy at 10,000
cycles. A switch was closed and the
aluminum literally floated up into space
midway between the coils. It began to
spin furiously, bobbing slightly as though
supported on invisible soft springs. Soon
it glowed red, began to soften, and finally
turned to a bright liquid. As it did so, it
assumed the shape of a rapidly turning toy
top. The power shut off, the molten

aluminum dropped to a crucible below
where it solidified almost instantly.
This bit of levitation melting was the
outcome of efforts of Research engineers
to prepare more nearly pure metals.
When a high-temperature metal, such as
zirconium, vanadium, molybdenum, or
titanium is melted in a crucible, there is
inevitably some reaction with the re-
fractory materials. But obviously if the
metal could be melted without touching
anything, except molecules or gas—as if
done in a sufficiently good vacuum—
greater purity would be obtained. Thus a
metal could be rid of volatile impurities
without absorbing others in the process.
Also, alloying agents could be added to
the molten metal while still suspended.
The induced currents would automatically
provide thorough stirring of the molten
mass.
So far this process has been applied suc-
cessfully to laboratory melts involving
small samples, and to a very limited num-
ber of metals. Nevertheless, float melting
has been employed to advantage in re-
search for metals in lamps, electronic
tubes, and other high-temperature applica-
tions, particularly where it is not necessary
to carry the temperature of the metal be-
yond its melting point. Investigations are
being continued with the aim of sur-
mounting such problems as power require-
ments and physical forces related to the
general problem.
Germanium Expected to
Revolutionize Electronics
Dick Tracy's wrist-watch two-way radio
may become a reality in a new "era of
germanium" in the electronics industry, a
General Electric electronics expert has
declared.
I. J. Kaar, manager of engineering for
the G.-E. Electronics Division at Elec-
tronics Park, Syracuse, N. Y., said that
the development of tiny electronic com-
ponents known as transistors have brought
tiny radios like those used by the comic
strip character within the realm of possi-
bility.
Transistors and another product, the
diode, are made from a silver-like metal,
germanium, and promise to have an ef-
fect on the electronics industry comparable
to that of the vacuum tube, Mr. Kaar
said.
Mr. Kaar predicted that transistors, tiny
pellets of germanium which can be made
smaller than the head of a match, will be
used extensively as substitutes for many
vacuum tubes. He said both transistors
and diodes are smaller, more efficient,
cheaper to operate, longer-lasting, and po-
tentially less expensive than vacuum tubes.
As to the tube industry, at present a
$430,000,000 a year business, Mr. Kaar
said that it may eventually concentrate on
high-frequency tubes and picture tubes
for which germanium products are not
suitable substitutes.
"It is possible or even likely that these
two kinds of tubes may fully load all
existing tube facilities and perhaps even

THE FUTURE OF THE YOUNG ENGINEER at Western Electric is
limited only by his own ability, by his vision to see what lies ahead
and by his capacity to work for the goal he sets himself. Recent
developments such as microwave radio relay networks for tele-
phone calls and television programs — operator and customer dial-
ing of long distance calls — automatic message accounting — new
secret electronic equipment for the Armed Forces — promise an
ever widening field for him.
MANY ENGINEERING TALENTS ARE REQUIRED. Most are used in
creating plans, machines and technological methods to convert raw
materials into thousands of different precisely manufactured
articles. Here at Western, the engineer translates the stream of
new designs from Bell Telephone Laboratories into terms of prac-
tical production. It is his job — a fascinating and satisfying one
— to provide the ways and means of reproducing the laboratory
model, as economically as possible, in whatever quantity the Bell
Telephone System needs. And even after production is rolling, his
efforts are unceasing in the search for improved methods, tools
and materials which will result in a better product or a lower
unit cost.

ing machines, etc. All of these, by the use
of suitable tools, jigs and fixtures, Fig. 2,
are set up for one single job to produce a
quantity of identical parts. A single com-
ponent part may be produced in large
quantities at a high rate of production by
using various combinations of multiple
operations, combined operations and suc-
cessive operations, Fig. 3.
In the last few years there has been a
development in which a number of auto-
matic, mass production machine tools
have been grouped together so that lit-
erally hundreds of operations may be
performed on each machine in sequence
as the part is transferred automatically,
from one machine to the next. These ma-
chines are referred to as transfer ma-
chines, Fig 4. They are so designed that
each unit of the machine operates as a
definite part of the whole. Every tool is so
interlocked electrically with the others that
should any one of them fail, the whole
machine will stop and a light on the panel
board will indicate just where the trouble
is located.
The outstanding feature of all machine
tools of today is the precision with which
it can remove metal with dimensional
limits of error frequently measured in
.0001 inch. This precision makes it pos-
sible to produce dozens or thousands of
parts in succession, which are so like each
other that they may be interchanged or
substituted for each other in assembly or
in repair, without requiring hand fitting.
This is known as "the manufacture of
interchangeable parts," which has such a
great influence on the economical produc-
tion of devices that they can be sold in
large numbers at very low prices.
Machine tool builders are constantly
engaged in research, invention and de-
velopment. They are always in competi-
tion, not only with other machine tool
builders but with their own earlier de-
signs. The trend of development has been
toward the use of better materials, such
as modern alloy steels and toward greater
weight which tends to eliminate deflec-
tions and vibration, promote greater ac-
curacy of the part and give longer life to
the cutting tool. The gears and spindle
of the modern machine tools are made of
the best alloy steel. The teeth and bores
are finished, after the gear has been hard-
ened, by grinding, shaving or lapping.
These gears can carry very heavy loads at
high speeds. Shafts are practically all
mounted on anti-friction bearings, as the
operating speeds of the modern machine
tool are much greater than those of their
older brother, due to the improvements
and developments in cutting tool materials
and the application of cutting fluids. Most
running or sliding parts of these machines
are pressure lubricated automatically with
filtered oil. This requires little attention
of the operator and insures much better
service.
Most machine tools have several electric
motors. One for driving each spindle, a
second for driving the oil pumps for
hydraulic feeds and for clamping the
work, another for rapid traversing the
tools through the non cutting portion of
the stroke, and still others for driving the
cutting fluid pump to provide a generous
flow of coolant on the cutting tool to pro-
duce a higher quality of surface finish and
extended tool life. Electrical interlocking
controls are now an integral part of most
machine tools. They permit finer gradua-
tions and a wider range of cutting speeds
to meet the requirements of the work
being handled by the machine. Marked
developments are also being made in the
hydraulic units for operating the feeds of
machine tools. These furnish normal
power for rapid traverse of the tools to
the work, the engagement of the proper
cutting feed, a dwell at the end of the
stroke, if needed, and a rapid traverse
back to the starting point so the finished
part can be replaced by another to be
machined. All motions are controlled by
electrical switches and/or hydraulic valves,
which permit great flexibility in machine
operation and complete safety to the ma-
chine and operator. Each machine of this
type, is doing the work with one or two
operators, which formerly required from
5 to 30 people.
Standardization plays a great part in
reducing the cost of these highly special-
ized machine tools, so that cutters, tapers,
bushings, chucks, bearings, and many
other replacement parts manufactured by
a number of companies, are interchange-
able. Some of this standardization has
been carried out within the industry, but
many standards are those of the American
Standards Association and are used gen-
erally.
To make a machine tool operative it
must be provided with work holding de-
vices such as vises, jigs or fixtures and
cutting tools, as illustrated.
Design and manufacture of these ma-
chines and their accessories is a challeng-
ing field open to the young engineer
today.

Power at your finger tip
Nearly everything you do today is done easier, quicker and better—thanks to electricity
If you are an average American worker you use the strength
of nine horses each working hour of the day.
WHERE DO YOU GET SUCH POWER-Merely by flick-
ing a switch . . . for by that simple act you are tapping the
vast sources of electric energy that are ready to work for
all of us in the home and on the job.
Today, the use of electric power has grown to where a
single factory uses more electricity than an entire city used
a generation ago. And your home—with its electric appli-
ances, lighting and other conveniences — consumes more
power than was used in yesterday's factory.
NEW MATERIALS WERE NEED ED-This great progress
could not have been achieved without the many new and
better materials which make possible today's larger and
more efficient power generating equipment.
A JOB FOR ALLOY STEEL —Giant turbines and gener-
ators, for example, couldn't stand up under terrific heat,
pressure, wear and corrosion if it weren't for steels made
tough and enduring by alloying metals.
Improved plastics also do their part in better insulation
and protective coatings. And carbon brushes are as vital to
huge generators as they are to your vacuum cleaner motor.
FOR MORE POWER—Developing and producing alloys,
plastics, carbons and many other better materials for our
power industry are but a few of the many ways in which
the people of Union Carbide serve all of us.

mous quantities of this vital metal . . . more

WHOPPER. This 96-inch lathe in the Homestead District Works of U.S. Steel
can turn and bore a 110-ton piece of steel that's 8 feet in diameter and 66 feet
long! But to produce quality forgings, it takes fine steel and skilled craftsmen,
as well as modern machines. United States Steel has all three.

THEODOR VON KARMAN
For wings in flight at high subsonic
speeds the first approximation to the cor-
rection for the Mach number was brought
forth by Prandtl and Glauert. The second
approximation was derived by von Kar-
man and Tsien in 1939. An important by-
product of this investigation was the re-
introduction of the "hodograph method"
of analysis first used by Tchapligin in the
19th century. This method has since been
shown to be a powerful tool in the analy-
sis of high speed flows.
The flow of air over a body at transonic
speeds (speeds at which part of the flow
near the body is supersonic and part is
subsonic) is one of the most difficult
speed ranges to analyze theoretically and
to test experimentally. In 1947 von Kar-
man was able to analyze the equations to
the extent that the similarity parameters
governing the flow phenomena at tran-
sonic speeds were segregated. Experi-
ments in various laboratories have since
shown that the von Karman parameters
are indeed those which govern the flow
over bodes with different thicknesses, but
whose thickness distributions are similar.
In 1940 von Karman presented the
Willard Gibbs lecture entitled "The Engi-
neer Grapples with Non-Linear Prob-
lems" to the American Mathematical So-
ciety. This paper, comprising 70 pages
and 170 references, was a powerful stimu-
lus on the one hand to mathematicians to
intrest themselves in some of the practical
problems of engineering, and on the other
hand to engineers to apply more mathe-
matics to their own problems.
Von Karman is not only responsible for
"leading the way'" with his technical con-
tributions to the literature. He is respon-
sible for the first supersonic wind tunnel
in this country. This tunnel, constructed
at Cal Tech, in the early 1940's, was a
model of the tunnel constructed later by
the Army at Aberdeen, Maryland. He is
also responsible for the design of the 10
ft. wind tunnel at Cal Tech and of the
20 ft. wind tunnel at Wright Field. He
played a prominent part in the develop-
ment of the Grand Coulee Dam and in
the explanation of the cause for the fail-
ure of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in
Washington. As Chief Scientific Advisor
to the Chief of Staff of the U. S. Air
Force since 1944, he has been instrumen-
tal in the development of the air arm of
our national defense.
It was my good fortune to study under
von Karman for a few years in the early
thirties and I have had the benefit of his
advice and counsel in the intervening
years. An inspiring teacher, his students
and colleagues remember him as well for
his human qualities as for his ability to
focus a superb command of technical con-
cepts and methods on problems in engi-
neering. Without the perspective of his-
tory it is not possible to evaluate properly
his impact on science and engineering;
it is, however, safe to predict that his
name will be accorded a prominent place
in the history of science.
Then there was the engineer who got a
part-time job as a janitor in a sorority
house, and was given a pass-key to every
room in the place. After a week or so on
the job, he ran into the housemother.
"Aren't you ever going to stop in at the

"Yes. Five rooms and a path."

ME: "What happened to you?"

"Teacher, may I leave the room?"
"No, John, you stay here like a good
boy and fill up the inkwells."

THE STRIKING HEAD of this common kitchen
match contains sulfur. It symbolizes the host
of everyday items that would be affected by a
severe sulfur shortage. Sulfur finds its way into
almost every branch of American industry. It is
important to the production of chemicals, fer-
tilizers, petroleum products, and numberless
other materials vital to the nation's defense
program and to our normal industrial and
economic development.
How the Petroleum Industry helped
ease the Nation's Sulfur shortage
There Is a Saying, "the best index of
the level of the civilization of a country
is its production of sulfuric acid." The
U. S. would have had real cause to worry
had the critical shortage of sulfur in the
past 18 months gone unchecked.
However, since sulfur in the form of
hydrogen sulfide occurs in natural and
refinery gases, the petroleum industry
took the impending shortage as its cue to
step up its normally limited recovery
of sulfur from these sources.
Accordingly, by mid-1952 recovery
from petroleum and natural gas will have
mounted to 700,000 long tons per year.
This will provide substantial help in re-
lieving the national shortage. Since this
tonnage is considerably above the needs
of the oil industry, it will ease the situa-
tion for many other industrial users.
Standard Oil has taken the lead in the
midwest in this by-product sulfur recov-
ery program. With facilities at Whiting
and in the far west and south west, the
company will produce nearly 10% of the
sulfur obtained from petroleum sources.
Sulfur recovery and Standard Oil's part
in it is just one example of how young
men with training in chemistry and engi-
neering may apply their skills and knowl-
edge in our company—and gain deep
satisfaction in the results of their work.

To choose from many applicants for a
high salaried position, one large automo-
tive concern gave this little test. Can you
answer it correctly?
If a mathematician does not have to
wait 20 minutes for a bus, then he either
likes Mozart in the morning or whisky
at night, but not both.
If a man likes whisky at night, then he
either likes Mozart in the morning and
does not have to wait 20 minutes for a bus
or he does not like Mozart in the morning
and has to wait 20 minutes for a bus or
else he is no mathematician.
If a man likes Mozart in the morning
and does not have to wait 20 minutes for
a bus, then he likes whisky at night.
If a mathematician likes Mozart in the
morning, he either likes whisky at night
or has to wait 20 minutes for a bus; con-
versely, if he likes whisky at night and has
to wait 20 minutes for a bus, he is a
mathematician—if he likes Mozart in the
morning.

When must a mathematician wait 20

A friend of ours who had the bad for-
tune to be drafted last year was home on
leave a few weeks ago, and he presented
us with the following interesting problem.
It concerns five of our friend's officers
who are stationed at his base. They are,
respectively, a General, a Colonel, a
Major, a Captain, and a Lieutenant, and
their names (not necessarily respectively)
are Smith, Jones, Green, White, and
Brown. Each of them has one and only
one sister, and each man is married to a
sister of one of the other officers. One at
least of the brothers-in-law of Green is
superior in rank to the latter.
The following particulars of service are
available. The Captain did not serve in
Italy. Both brothers-in-law of Jones have

served in France, as have both brothers-in-

of the General. White has served in Ger-
many, as have both his brothers-in-law;
the Lieutenant has not. The Colonel has
served in Japan, as have both his brothers-
in-law. White has served in Japan; so has
his wife's brother. The General has not
served in Japan; however, he has served
with both his brothers-in-law in Italy.
Brown has not served either in Italy or
in Germany.
Taking the above mentioned facts into
consideration, our friend now asks us to
match up each name with the proper rank,
and furthermore, to determine the maiden
names of the various officers' wives.

letter-number problem than has appear-

only the meaning of Free Enterprise
Some people say we should get a new name for
it. Perhaps. But what does the name matter, so
long as we preserve the meaning. A good thing,
too, to review what it means once in a while:
It means Hope. Your boy can start a business or
hope to boss the one he's in ... In countries
without free enterprise only the government
owns and runs a business.
Free enterprise means Decency ... In so-called
"liberal" countries where "everything is for the
people," you can be thrown into a slave labor
camp to die, just on the whim of some enemy.
It means Home
to one room.
not two families "assigned"
It means Courage . . . and no need to cringe at
the words "police" or "party member".
It means Dignity . . . not sobbing out a "con-
fession" in a courtroom to avoid more torture.
It means Education. Read what you want . . . not
what some official decides for you. (And much
of your reading may be made possible, by the
way, by a Scotch immigrant boy named Carnegie
who made millions under the American free enter-
prise system, and spent them on free libraries.)
Free enterprise — Americanism — profit - and - loss
system . . . the name doesn't matter so long as
you are on the alert against the people who
are trying to change and destroy its meaning.

and silicon, it is probable that the alloy
is red brass. Caution should be observed
because alloys containing approximately
60 per cent copper, such as muntz metal,
naval brass, and manganese bronze, have
shades of color approaching that of bronze
due to the beta phase.
To test for manganese bronze dissolve
about half a gram of a fresh specimen in
a beaker with a mixture of 1:1 nitric acid
and 1:1 orthophosphoric acid, dilute to
75 to 100 ml., add a few drops of a 1
per cent solution of silver nitrate and 25
ml. of a 6 per cent solution of ammonium
persulfate. If a purple color forms when
this solution is boiled, the specimen is
manganese bronze.
If we know our metal is a brass by its
color—light yellow—we may first test
for the presence of tin by the method
described above (dissolve with 1:1 nitric
acide and boil—fine white precipitate
shows tin). If tin is present, the ma-
terial is probably either admiralty metal
or naval brass. Chemical analysis will de-

termine which it is. Each has about 1 per
cent tin. Admiralty metal has 70 copper-
29 zinc; naval brass has 60 copper-39
zinc. To test for aluminum react to com-
pletion a small sample of the material
with 2 or 3 drops of a mixture of 1:1
hydrochloric acid and 1:1 nitric acid.
Make this alkaline with 1 molar potassium
hydroxide and add 1 or 2 drops of Ali-
zarin S solution made by dissolving 0.1 g.
of Alizarin S in 100 ml. of water. Since
beryllium and copper form a red color
also, we must add a few drops of 1:1
acetic acid to dissolve them. If the red
color remains, aluminum is confirmed and
the material is aluminum brass. The ab-
sence of both tin and aluminum identifies
yellow brass.
The procedure outlined for identifying
the nine wrought white metals and alloys
—nickel, Monel, Inconel, Incoloy, 70/30
cupro-nickel, and Stainless Steels 304,
310, 321, and 430—makes use entirely of
simple, very easily obtained materials and
reagents. The reagents using in distin-
guishing among the coppers and copper
alloys, while not so everyday as those used
for the white metals, likewise do not re-
quire the services of a complete chemical
laboratory. This makes these tests valu-
able for use on the spot in identifying the
materials mentioned.

Fig. 2. Research in the machining of wood. Research projects are assigned to the
lab through the Engineering Research Institute.
The lab also contains three controlled
temperature and humidity rooms and
other specialized equipment.
Considerable research in many phases
of wood utilization is going on continually
at the laboratory. The assignment of re-
search projects is through the Engineering
Research Institute. Most of the research
that went into the Mosquito bomber, the
all-wooden British high-performance
bomber,w as done at Michigan in our
ood Technology Laboratory.
Figure 2 shows Norm Franz and Hal
Worth who have done extensive research
in the machining of wood. They have
made extensive studies of the many factors
which affect the quality of the wood sur-
face such as knife angle, knife speed,
sharpness, and power requirements. The
most recent studies include high speed

This is a new field of research and is
very important to the furniture industry.
Fig. 3 shows Associate Professor Pa-
tronsky with some of the specimens he
tested for fatigue. These specimens are
made up with a resin bonded wood waste
core. That is, the cores are compressed
waste such as shavings from some other
operation.
A new type of testing machine has re-
cently been developed by Mr. Marra of
the laboratory staff for the National Fur-
niture Manufacturers' Association. The
machine was developed to permit a manu-
facturer to test the strength properties of
his glue each day. The machine presses
together sample blocks with any desired
pressure on the glue line and also pulls
the blocks apart in test. It is simple
enough for any wood products manufac-
turer to build in his shop.
It is not my purpose to give a sales talk
on wood technology, but I do believe
there are some courses which are of inter-
est to engineers in several fields. There
are many openings in the furniture and
allied fields for mechanical and industrial
engineers. To anyone interested in this
field, I would strongly recommend one of
the courses dealing with furniture pro-
duction. There are several men who have
done this or are doing this now.
To the naval architect interested in
small boats, we offer many related courses
including structure and identification of
American and tropical woods, strength
properties of woods, seasoning, plywood
and laminated construction, wood pre-
servatives, and finishing. I know of one
student now who is planning on two
degrees, wood technology and naval archi-
tecture, with the idea of designing and
building small boats.
To the man studying structures, physi-
cal properties of wood and wood preserva-
tives should prove interesting. I would
recommend that chemical engineers inter-
ested in pulp and paper take our structure
and identification-of-woods course which
covers all cf the commercial pulp woods.
I recently talked to a representative from
a large chemical company while he was
here interviewing. He seemed very inter-
ested in a man with a chemical backgound
who had taken wood tech courses in
preservatives and pathology to work in
their wood preservatives research.

The answer "Fused Aluminum Oxide"
gives you a passing mark. But, it's not

32 ALUNDUM* abrasive in a single
crystal, containing more than 99% pure
fused alumina — hailed as the "greatest
abrasive contribution to increased grind-
ing production in more than 40 years."
How It's Made
When bauxite is submitted to an ex-
tremely high temperature in an electric
furnace by an ingenious Norton Process,
grains of 32 ALUNDUM abrasive form
in a fluid matrix where each grain grows
into a single, complete crystal — strong
in shape and with many sharp points on
all sides. The matrix not only contrib-
utes to 32 ALUNDUM abrasive's
unique crystalline structure but also
absorbs impurities from the melt. This
accounts for the better than 99% purity.
The matrix is then dissolved away by
a complicated chemical process and the
released grains are washed and screened
to size. No crushing is necessary.
Amazingly Versatile!
The extra sharpness and crystalline
form of Norton 32 ALUNDUM abra-
sive enables it to grind cast iron, alu-
minum, bronze, brass, soft steel, high-
speed steel and cast alloy tool materials.
Its versatility is further borne out by a
typical report. In one prominent plant,
Norton 32 ALUNDUM wheels, replac-
ing other wheels, accounted for over-all
time savings, floor to floor, of: surface
grinding — 20.3%; internal grinding —

13.1%; tool grinding — 13.2%; cylin-
drical grinding — 25%.
Worth Remembering
This example of "making better prod-
ucts to make other products better"
promises an interesting future to young
engineers who want to contribute to new
developments. Norton Research is well
worth investigating.

ANOTHER ALCOA DEVELOPMENT STORY:
In 1927, a chemical manufacturer asked us,
"Why must some chemicals be handled in small
drums or carboys . . . can't tank cars be built
of aluminum?"
From our years of research, we knew that we
had alloys compatible with many chemicals—and
experience in fabrication methods dictated weld-
ing. The Field was inviting, and we decided to
design and pay for the first aluminum tank
car ourselves.
Our engineers designed an 8,000-gallon tank, to
be welded together from 16 large aluminum plates.
Working with a leading tank car builder, lessons
which we had learned in other Alcoa develop-
ments enabled us to materially assist in the alloys
selected, welding techniques and structural fabri-
cation methods employed. One year later, in 1928,

the car was completed. It was then tested in
20,000 miles of road service, while hauling glacial
acetic acid—a typically tricky cargo. It weathered
3,500 recorded shocks—900 severe ones. That
aluminum car is still in service!
Together with tank car builders, we have de-
veloped improved riveted and welded car designs,
which are now "standard." Today there are over
1,300 aluminum tank cars carrying the fussy com-
pounds that formerly traveled only in small
containers.
This is typical of the development jobs we do
at Alcoa. Others are under way now and more are
waiting for mechanical, metallurgical, electrical,
chemical and industrial engineers having the
imagineering skill to tackle them. Perhaps you
may be one of those men. Aluminum Company of

perature and the geometry of the appara-
tus, the torque on the disk and the velocity
and intensity of second sound are com-
puted. Torques as small as 10—' dyne-cm
have been measured in this way.
The mirror-disk is cemented along its
vertical diameter to a thin metal rod,
which is supported in turn by a flat
(0.0015 in. thick) copper ribbon. The
metal rod hangs centrally through a small
circular hole in the resonant cavity. Above
this opening, and thus immersed in he-
lium II but outside the resonant system,
dampening vanes composed of thin mica
are cemented to the metal rod. A system
very similar to that used for galvanometer
suspensions is employed to protect the
torsion ribbon from strain or shock when
not in use. Only after the Dewar system
has been filled with liquid helium and
cooled to helium II temperatures, thus
eliminating all convection currents about
the vanes, is the disk assembly raised to
operating position.
The NBS experiments with the thermal
Rayleigh disk have significant theoretical
implications. In the first place the re-
sponse of the disk to the heat current
known as second sound provides a con-
vincing experimental verification of the
two-fluid hypothesis of helium II. That
the disk can detect these opposing currents
which do not affect a microphone lends
strong credence to the concept of the two
fluids passing through each other in re-
sponse to a difference in temperature be-
tween two points. Moreover, the amount
of the measured torque and its variation
with temperature correspond exactly with
theoretical values computed on the as-
sumption that the superfluid participates
in the same streamline flow as do ordinary
fluids.
Of even more fundamental significance
is the generalized duality which the be-
havior of the thermal Rayleigh disk im-
plies between the quantum thermome-
chanics of liquid helium II and the ordin-
ary classical hydrodynamics of other
liquids. In classical hydrodynamics, the
relationship between velocity, height, and
pressure at any point in a flowing liquid
is given by Bernoulli's law as:
1^/&gt;V2 4- pgh -j- p = constant
(where p is the density of the liquid, V
is the velocity, h is the height above a
given reference point, and p is the pres-
sure upon the liquid). A more general
expression, applicable to the two-fluid
(Continued from page 15)
counterflow of second sound in helium
II, was developed on the basis of the two-
fluid theory by Dr. Pellam shortly before
the Rayleigh disk experiments were begun
at NBS. It takes the form:
pa H2
V2/&gt;v*+p&amp;+p+y2 ■ =
ps (psry
constant
where /&gt;n and ps are the densities of the
normal fluid and superfluid, respectively,
H is the rate of heat transfer, S is the en-
tropy, and T is the absolute temperature.
Here the final additional term relates the
hydrostatic pressure of the two fluids to
the density of the heat current which con-
stitutes second sound. The generalized
Bernoulli expression has now been con-
firmed by measurements of the torque on
the disk. Thus, for every classical experi-
ment in hydrodynamics, there presumably
exists the quantum parallel in helium II
where heat flow replaces mass flow. For
example, recent experiments at NBS have
shown that a pitot tube as well as a Ray-
leigh disk responds to the heat current in
helium II. The thermal Rayleigh disk pro-
vides a means of investigating further the
hydrodynamic flow of the normal and the
superfluid.
The precision of the NBS Rayleigh disk
apparatus is such that it provides a new
quantitative method for measuring many
properties of liquid helium II. Some, like
second sound intensity, had never before
been measured. Even such thermodynamic
properties of helium II as specific heat
(cv) have been determined by the disk
technique with greater accuracy than was
previously possible. The precision of
measurement has in fact reached the point
where the thermal Rayleigh disk functions
as a calorimeter, measuring heat capacity
in an isothermal system in terms of the
small temperature fluctuations of second
sound. Such measurements by ordinary
methods are extremely difficult at tempera-
tures near absolute zero because of the
very small amounts of heat involved and
the troublesome effects of the creeping
helium film. For measurement of the
other thermodynamic properties of liquid
helium II, a semipermeable thermal Ray-
leigh disk, which responds selectively to
the two fluid components, has been intro-
duced. Work in this field is being con-
tinued at NBS, and several new ap-
proaches to the quantum hydrodynamics
of helium II are being explored.

Ch. E's at Du Pont
Plant development work is solid background
for a future in chemical engineering

FOURTH OF A SERIES
The work of production supervisors
at Du Pont, as discussed here last
month, is aimed at getting better
results from existing processes and
equipment.
In contrast, the job of plant de-
velopment groups is to find ways to
improve methods and products, and
advise management when changes
should be made for economic or tech-
nical reasons. Chemical engineers in
this work are responsible for lower-
ing process costs, adapting the prod-
uct to new uses and improving prod-
uct quality to obtain a larger share
of the existing market.
These duties provide an under-
standing of the fundamental aspects
of the business, as well as a broad
view of Company operations. The
training and experience a man gains
as a member of a plant development
group—often a first assignment at
Du Pont—is an excellent background
for any field he may move into later.
Conducting a development study
usually involves obtaining data from

laboratory, semi-works and plant-
scale experiments, estimating profits
and investments, and consulting with
sales, research and production per-
sonnel, also with auxiliary depart-
ments such as Engineering, Chemi-
cal and Purchasing, and with out-
side authorities.
Here are typical problems solved
by plant development groups:

H. E. Graham, Jr., B.S.Ch.E., Georgia I. T.
'48, and J. F. Carley.Ph.D.Ch.E., Cornell'Sl,
study a plastic compounder-extractor-extruder
for improvements in making plastics.
John Purdom, B.S.Ch.E., Ohio State '49,
and Kenneth Kehr, B.S.M.E., North Caro-
lina State '50, discuss diagram of a process for
improved recovery of a nylon intermediate.
1. Prompted by obsolescence and
wearing of equipment, experimental
studies and economic comparisons
were made on the entire process of
isolating dyes. Methods in use called
for crystallization, filter pressing and
tray drying. It was found that a
rotary vacuum filter with a continu-
ous rotary steam tube dryer, air con-
veyor and a dust collection system
reduced costs about $50,000 a year.
2. Production of sodium silicate was
to be increased substantially, but the
tank-type furnace at the heart of the
process proved a bottleneck. The
furnace design, including exit and

entry ports, was improved, and its
capacity enlarged at a small fraction
of the cost of a new furnace.
With the rapid growth of techno-
logical improvements all over the
world and increasing competition,
plant development work assumes
greater and greater status. The Ch. E.
entering such a group at Du Pont
finds a wealth of opportunity for his
skill and ingenuity.

of The Michigan Technic; in case of
duplicate correct answers, the earliest
postmark wins. We ask that you include
your method of solution, also any brain
teasers that you know which our readers
might enjoy.

The problem goes something like this:
a farmer friend of ours has a cow tied
to one side of a silo (round, you know)
20 feet in diameter. The rope with which
the cow is tied is 20 feet long. Now our
friend wants to know the area in square
feet of the cow's grazing range. Further-
more, and we don't know why, he desires
TECHNIC TEASERS
(Continued from page 50)
the answer correct to at least the third
decimal place. See if you can get it with-
out the aid of a cow and a silo.
Maybe you would like to monkey
around with this one for a while. Watch
out, it's tricky.
Over a pulley hangs a rope, each foot
of which weighs four ounces. At one end
of the rope hangs a weight. At the other
end of the rope hangs a monkey equal in
weight to the weight. The weight of the
monkey in pounds equals the age of the
monkey's mother in years.
The monkey and the monkey's mother,
together, are four years old. The monkey's
mother is now twice as old as the mon-
key was when the mother was half as old
as the monkey will be when he is three
times as old as the mother was when
she was three times as old as the mon-
key was.
The weight of the rope and the weight
of the weight is half again as much as the
difference between the weight of the
weight and the weight of the weight plus
the weight of the monkey. Now, serious-
ly, how long is the rope?
Here is one that had us baffled for
awhile; maybe you can see the answer
right off. Two balls are touching the wall
on one side of a room. The floor is rough
and no slipping can occur. The balls roll
across the room to the other side wall, the
center of each ball moving at the same
horizontal speed. One ball reaches the
opposite wall in half the time required
for the other ball to reach it. How come?
If it takes a cockroach with six legs
three minutes to crawl through a straw,
how long will it take a pink elephant to
shingle a dog house with pancakes?

There's a Future in Fuels...
THERE ARE GREAT OPPORTUNITIES waiting
for ambitious scientists and engineers in-
terested in motor fuel research and manu-
facturing. Tomorrow's faster planes and finer
automobiles can be no better than the fuels
that power them.
Providing fuel for efficient thrust in all
ranges of flight is a specialty of Phillips Petro-
leum Company. Two years ago Phillips was
supplying over 30% of the nation's require-
ment for top grade aviation gasoline, and
Phillips capacity for producing this essential
fuel is still increasing. In addition, Phillips
supplies tremendous quantities of turbo-prop
and jet fuels for U. S. military planes.

To develop these finer fuels ... to produce
the crude oil... to refine it... and to transport
the finished product. .. requires men trained
in all branches of science and engineering.
And because Phillips is known as one of the
most widely diversified oil companies, we offer
promising opportunities for the technical grad-
uate in many other fields: refining of lubri-
cants, development of chemical derivatives
from petroleum, ammonia and sulfur com-
pounds, rubber synthesis, atomic research,
geophysics and analytical techniques.
We invite you to write to our Employee
Relations Department for further information
about opportunities with our company.

A group of prohibitionists looking for evidence of the ad-

his home to get a statement. After propping him up in bed
and guiding his feeble hand along the dotted line, they heard
a violent disturbance coming from another room—furniture-

"Good Heaven's what's that," gashped a committeeman.

chobee, Florida.
As usual, Okonite engineers were consulted on the problem. Their
studies showed that it was possible to combine a three-fold function
in one cable. This was accomplished by the use of Okolite high-
voltage insulation whose electrical characteristics permitted carrier
current to be superimposed on the power conductors.
The result was a single Okonite-insulated cable — steel-armored for
the ■&lt;&gt;/&gt; underwater miles, with a non-metallic sheath for an addi-
tional 2V2 miles underground —which supplies not only power and
operation control, but a communication circuit as well.

"But something the Pastor said reminded me
of a service I'll never forget. Later, Helen told
me I'd said 'Mud!' out loud. That's why she
dug me in the ribs and said 'John, wake up!'
"I guess I was wool-gathering. I was back over-
seas, listening to a Chaplain who'd found a
spot of beauty in a grove of trees for his
services . . . right smack in the middle of a
war! The green branches made a church-like
arch. The sun filtered through the branches
like through our church windows.
"The Chaplain's pulpit? Just the hood of a
homely Army Jeep . . . splattered with mud.
No organ music . . . just the booming of big
guns far off. No pews, either . .. just mud to
sit in. But I felt just as close to God then as
I did last Sunday in our Maple Street Church.
"After Helen nudged me awake, I thought of
countries where mud is slung at pulpits.
Where men of the cloth are jailed. Where
churches are closed or burned. And where
God is disowned. I gave thanks that here we
respect all churches.

charges of corruption against public officials.

industry," Mr. Kaar said.
"The giant digital computers, or magic
brains, which at present use several thous-
and vacuum tubes and occupy a large size
room, can conceivably become small
enough and incidentally, reliable enough,
to apply to the everyday business and in-
dustrial problems as we now apply desk
calculating machines.
"In military electronics the simplicity
and ruggedness of the transistor, as well
as its small size and low-power drain, will
have a direct effect on all equipment, par-
ticularly that which is airborne.
"In the telephone business it will be-
come entirely practical to build amplifiers
for use on cables at the bottom of the
sea," Mr. Kaar said.
He described germanium as metallic in
appearance, silvery gray, and extremely
hard and brittle. It is recovered as a by-
product in the smelting and refining of
zinc ores.
"Twenty freight car loads of zinc ore
must be handled to recover one pound of
germanium," he said.
"For the devices I am describing,
astounding purity is required—less than
one part per hundred billion of some im-
purities have an observable effect.
"Germanium purified to this extent is
comparable in cost with gold. However,
in each diode or transistor so small an
amount is used that material cost is small
compared to fabrication costs."
He pointed out that the properties of
germanium that make it valuable arise
from the fact that it is a semi-conductor,
midway in its electrical properties be-
tween such metals as copper and such in-
sulators as glass.
Its ability to conduct electricity depends
strongly on certain impurities injected
into layers of the germanium, he said.
Paper Thermometers
Thermal indicators made, of paper and
capable of instantly determining tempera-
tures from 115 degrees to 500 degrees
Fahrenheit, have been developed by the
Army Quartermaster Corps.
The new series of paper thermometers
was initially designed to ascertain the
thermal radiation of atomic blast, but it is
expected that they will also be used for
other purposes such as testing the per-

formance of gasoline engines, motors,
heaters, and other appliances.
The new thermometers are inexpensive
and readily disposable. When commer-
cially produced, the cost of each thermom-
eter is not expected to exceed a few cents.
They consist of white pigment coatings
on black paper. Each coating is designed
to melt at a definite temperature.
New Bore-Hole Camera
A new bore-hole camera which will be
used in solving foundation problems in
the construction of concrete structures has
been developed under an Army Corps
of Engineers contract.
It is reported that the new development
will greatly improve exploratory tech-
niques to discover flaws that exist in all
types of bedrock. These flaws and imper-
fections may affect the stability of dam
foundations or introduce serious construc-
tion problems.
The camera, now undergoing extensive
tests, takes 360-degree photographs of a
three-inch diameter bore hole. Cylindrical
in shape, the camera is lowered into the
bore hole. It is then operated electrically
by means of a cable. The camera is built
so that either dry holes or water holes
may be photographed.
By using a specially-designed projector,
the picture can be viewed in undistorted
form on a cylindrical screen. The camera
uses l6-mm film. Flaws are easily spotted.
Cuts Thin Slices with Air
A "cutting wind," produced by a knife
blade moving faster than the speed of
sound, is being used to cut thin slices of
almost everything from asbestos to zinc by
a scientist of the General Electric Re-
search Laboratory in Schenectady, NY.
Although a knife blade is used, its pri-
mary purpose is to produce a small pocket
of compressed air immediately preceding
the knife. Dr. E. F. Fullam, the scientist,
believes air does the actual cutting, rather
than the knife itself.
The blade is mounted in the whirling
wheel of a laboratory device called a
high-speed microtome.
As the wheel whirls at 65,000 revolu-
tions per minute, the knife blade is pro-
pelled at a calculated tip speed of 1,200
feet per second, or at the supersonic speed
of more than 818 miles per hour. Speed
of sound is about 750 miles per hour.
The blade's supersonic speed is believed
to produce a small pocket of compressed
air which tears materials on a submicro-
scopic scale. This action leaves a smooth
surface on the face of the cut, through
which the knife easily passes.
Dr. Fullam, Research Laboratory micro-
scopist and designer of the instrument,
uses his "sharp air" technique for cutting
asbestos, cork, bone, mica-insulation,
metals, wood, plastics and many other
items.
The instrument was primarily designed
by Dr. Fullam, and tailor-made to his
specifications by an instrument manufac-
turer, for cutting extremely thin cross-
section specimens of materials for study
under the electron microscope. Because of
the blade's tremendous speed, the micro-
tome has cut what is believed to be one
of the thinnest slices ever made, a metal
shaving less than two millionths of an
inch thick, or about 1,000 times thinner
than a human hair.
It is remarkable how many doubtful
meanings an allegedly pure-minded per-
son can find in an entirely respectable
joke.

Engineering mechanics is a study of the applica-
tion of fundamental physical concepts to engineering
problems. Because of its general nature, engineer-
ing mechanics draws on many fields of physical sci-
ence and is applied to all fields of engineering.
The three photographs show demonstrations in
which the student is enabled to observe the mechan-
ism of fluid flow. Three of the numerous methods
used in the fluids laboratory, to enable the student to
observe flow patterns and types of motion in fluids,
are illustrated. The first shows the development of
an eddy downstream from an obstruction. The flow
is made visible by passing light through the flowing
glycerine solution, a technique which was developed
at this school.
The second shows a flow pattern which simulates
the flow of a perfect fluid. Strangely enough, it is
accomplished by taking advantage of and accen-
tuating the imperfections of the fluid. The third
shows a cylinder obstructing the flow in a re-circu-
lating channel. A fine powder floating on the sur-
face enables one to visualize the motion in the vor-
tex trail downstream from the object.

What the
GM Organizational Setup Offers
You—the Graduate Engineer

To understand your opportunity at General
Motors you need to understand the General
Motors setup.
GM is not only a major producer of motorcars
and trucks. It is also a leading manufacturer of
many types of civilian goods from heating
systems to refrigerators, from fractional h.p.
motors to Diesel locomotives.
And, as a top defense contractor, GM is building
everything from rockets and shells to tanks and
jet and Turbo-Prop engines.
In these many operations we require the services
of all types of engineers, engaged in all phases
of engineering work—from pure research to
production supervision.
This work is decentralized among GM's 34
manufacturing divisions, operating 112 plants
in 54 towns and cities throughout the country.
Each division operates as an independent unit
with its own engineering department. Yet each
benefits from the resources of GM's central
research and engineering laboratories.
So, from the start, GM offers the engineering
graduate both the opportunities and facilities of
a large successful organization, and the friendly
working environment of a smaller company.
It is well, too, to note that a high percentage
of engineering school graduates, through hard
work and initiative, have made sound business
careers for themselves at GM. In fact, today,
many GM divisional managers are engineering
school graduates. And so are many others in
top management.
For further information on a GM engineering
career, we suggest you ask your College Place-
ment Office to arrange an interview for you
with the GM College Representative the next
time he visits your campus.

All kinds of engineering jobs
call for photography
J-jet's say you're going to engineer tomorrow's global transportation
systems—explore inaccessible areas for new mineral deposits—or that
you'll design a new machine or product. All along the engineering
way, you'll find photography playing an important part.
Photography can help you choose a site through aerial photographs.
It helps you analyze structural stresses by studies of plastic models in
polarized light. It provides information on metal strength and struc-
ture through x-ray diffraction and photomicrography. It provides a
rapid means of reproducing engineering drawings full-size—or reduc-
ing them to mere frames on microfilm for safe, easy storage and ready
reference.
Applying photography to engineering and engineering to photog-
raphy have become specialties in themselves. This has led graduates in
the physical sciences and in engineering to find positions with the
Eastman Kodak Company. If you are interested, write to Business and
Technical Personnel Department, Eastman Kodak Company,
Rochester 4, New York.

1. G-E TRAINING PROGRAMS
Sample quotes: "I knew that G.E. offered the best train-
ing courses." "Liked the idea of rotating assignments and
courses." "Wanted to take advantage of the training
courses." "G.E. had a training plan which would let me
choose a job after reasonable time for investigating jobs
available in the Company." "1 felt that Test (Test Engi-
neering Program) would make the easiest transition from
school to work." "1 felt that I would get the best kind
of electrical engineering training if I went with G.E."
"The Test course appealed to me because of its combina-
tion of continued technical instruction plus practical ex-
perience on the test floor."
2. VARIETY OF OPPORTUNITIES
"Why docs a youngster run away with a circus?"
"Believed it was a good chance to find the field I liked
best as 1 wasn't quite sure what type of work 1 wanted
to get into." "G.E. goes out of its way to find the corner
you are happiest in and best suited for." "The varied
opportunities of work let you change jobs without leaving
the company." "Only company which offered a job
where an engineer could be in on design, sales and appli-
cation —i.e., 'application engineering.' " "Promise of
varied experience made it unnecessary to decide on a
particular specialty until I had more opportunity to look
the field over."
3. GENERAL ELECTRICS REPUTATION
"G.E.'s prestige and reputation appealed to me."
"G.E. was more favorably disposed to the coming war
effort and was doing work directly contributory." "High
caliber persons with whom to work." "Reputation for
technical excellence." "G.E.'s reputation as a good em-
ployer." "Because with the name of G.E. went a sense
of security." "I felt that G.E. was the leader in the
electrical field and I wanted to take part."
4. CONSIDERATE TREATMENT
"The only offer 1 received was from General Electric
—other companies interviewed would not consider me
because of my reserve officer status." "Among the com-
panies offering jobs to college graduates in 1941, G.E.
seemed to take more of a personal interest in its new
men." "The G-E representatives made me feel they
were interested in me."

How to help a scraper
do its level best
Bearing applications on large-capacity scraper wheels
pose two problems to design engineers. One is the heavy
loads. The other is wear. Engineers solve both problems
at once by mounting scraper wheels on Timken® tapered
roller bearings. Line contact between rollers and races
of Timken bearings provides extra load-carrying capacity.
The true rolling motion and incredibly smooth surface
finish of Timken bearings practically eliminate friction
and wear within the bearing.
Mounting scraper wheels
on TIMKEN® bearings
This is a standard wheel application showing indirect mounting of
Timken bearings. The bearings are adjusted by means of a nut.
Cups are mounted in the counterbored hubs. The use of Timken
bearings in this application keeps the shaft concentric with the
housing, thus the seals are more effective in keeping dirt out,
lubricant in.

Hitting modern military targets
poses ever-new
engineering problems
Increasing emphasis in speed and mobility in modern
warfare intensifies the problem of destroying
the target —takes it out of the reach of manual ability
and into the realm of electronics. Electrical
and mechanical engineering — of the highest skill
and ingenuity — are required.
Since 1918, Arma Corporation has worked closely with
our Armed Forces and American Industry in
pioneering and developing equipment to solve such
problems. Today, Arma is in the forefront in
supplying these precision instruments for our nation's
defense, through techniques which tomorrow
can be widely applied.

Training in many different engineering branches
opens the door to opportunity at Du Pont
In recent issues of the Digest, we
have discussed opportunities for me-
chanical and chemical engineers at
Du Pont. However, this is only part
of the picture. The special skills of
more than a dozen different branches
of engineering are needed on our
scientific teams. For example:
Architectural, civil and structural en-
gineers are attached to the central
Engineering Department which han-
dles most of the Company's construc-
tion projects. In this work they make
site investigations, lay out new
plants, design buildings, determine
construction methods and specify
materials and equipment. They also
assemble necessary labor forces at
field locations and supervise the
building and assembly of complex
manufacturing facilities.
Electrical engineers aid in designing
process equipment and faculties for
power generation and distribution,
air conditioning and refrigeration.
Instrumentation is another impor-
tant phase of their work. Continuous
automatic analyzers for cyanides,
ultra-violet gas analyzers, multivari-
able recorders, and new photo-multi-
plier circuits are just a few of their
developments.
Industrial engineers help develop
methods and standards for new or
improved manufacturing processes.
This work often serves as training
for production supervisors.
Metallurgical engineers play an es-
sential part in the central Engineering
Department's program of research.
Their studies are aimed at improving
equipment and construction materi-
als, as well as methods of measure-
ment and control.
Safety engineers strive constantly to
improve the broad safety program
initiated by the Company's founder
150 years ago. Du Pont is under-
standably proud of its safety record,
which in 1950 was eight times better
than the chemical industry's as a
whole, and fourteen times better
than the average for all industry.

Carl Gotline, B.S., Iowa'41, conducts meteor-
ological engineering studies to help solve plant
chimney problems involving smoke and acids.
This by no means completes the
list. Every U. S. industry utilizes
Du Pont products. Hence there is
also a need for specialists in mining,
petroleum, textiles and many other
branches of engineering.
Along with chemists, physicists
and other technical personnel, al-
most every kind of engineer finds
opportunity at Du Pont. Your engi-
neering degree is only a door opener.
Any man with ideas, imagination
and the ability to handle people will
find plenty of room for advancement
in this company that has never
stopped growing.

ORGANIZING SERVICE
Are we asked to detect the approach of enemy attack through the strato-
sphere? Is there a commercially better method for extracting sugar from
beets? Can we help find alloys (for use in jet planes) that may replace those
made of materials now in short supply?
Unlimited numbers of technical problems confront our generation.
Among our expanding concepts of civilization and under the pressures of a
world-wide attack upon our basic freedoms we meet the questions of "Is it
possible?" and "What is best?" and "How may the data be obtained?" at
every turn.
An organization able to attack most problems, to follow through the in-
tricate maze of developments, to reconcile interests, is cooperating in a field
that gives maximum opportunity for service.

INSTITUTE
Though entirely conscious of the difficul-
ties inherent in its daily routine, the Institute
nevertheless is backed by one of the great Facul-
ties of our day and time and so looks forward
with optimism to future opportunities for solid
achievement by the University we all must
serve.

Titanium Seen As
Important Aircraft Metal
Tomorrow's supersonic aircraft guided
missiles and engines may fly faster and
higher because of an amazing metal five
times as strong as aluminum, 40% lighter
than steel, and capable of withstanding
extremely high temperatures.
Research engineers in aircraft plants
throughout the nation are investigating
the properties of this new metal—titan-
ium—in the constant search for aircraft
materials that can maintain strength under
the high temperatures of supersonic
speeds.
It is still too early to determine titan-
ium's precise applications—but it can be
produced in aircraft quality and at reason-
able cost, engineers believe it may well
solve some of the biggest problems in
current high-speed aircraft and missile
design.
They believe approximately 8% to
70% may be saved in weight by using
titanium aJloys in highly-stressed parts
such as lower wing skins.
Up to 43% in weight could be saved,
it is estimated, by substituting pure titan-
ium for corrosion-resistant steel in fire-
walls, shrouds, and other nonstructural
parts. Similarly, titanium alloys could be
substituted for low-strength steel fittings,
high-strength corrosion-resistant steel
sheet or armour plate.
One-fourth the present weight could
be saved, engineers believe, by using
titanium alloys in landing gears, machin-
ed forgings, fittings and tubings—as a
substitute for highly heat-treated steel
parts.
And the metal has virtually unlimited
potentialities in the engine field—in tur-
bine blades, for example, and after-
burners.
Today, however, world output of the
metal is only about 600 tons per year,
insufficient for appreciable use by the
aircraft industry. Though the world's
fourth most abundant metal, it is still
scarce because the technique of converting
it from ore to usable metal still has not
been completely mastered.
Big problems still face the aircraft
industry before the metal can come into
widespread use. Fabrication and forming
techniques have to be developed. Addi-
tional service experience with present ex-
perimental applications is needed. The
present low rate of titanium production
must be increased. And the high cost
of the material must be reduced. (Today,
titanium sponge costs about $5 per pound
and titanium sheet about $25 per pound.)
If these problems are oversome—and
the industry is working constantly to solve
them, while at the same time titanium
costs tend to lower as production in-
creases—titanium may well become a key
metal of the supersonic age.
Turbine-Condenser Welding
Time Cut 70 Per Cent
Welding time on large turbine con-
densers at the Sunnyvale, California plant
of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation
has been cut 70 per cent by positioning
the condensers. Originally, all welding
The condenser now is positioned first
on one side, and then the other, thus
eliminating all vertical and overhead
welding. The condenser, plus the strong-
back weighing about 35 tons, is position-
ed with an overhead crane having an aux-
iliary hook to hold the condenser in its
unbalanced position while cribbing and
blocking is moved into place.
By positioning the condenser for down-
hand welding, larger electrodes can be
used, and fewer passes are needed per
joint. This means not only a higher
deposition efficiency, but less time spent
cleaning away slag between passes.
In addition to the time saved, the weld-
ing job has a more uniform appearance
throughout, and some of the cramped
and uncomportable positions of the weld-
ers are eliminated, making the job less
fatiguing.

operations were performed with the con-
denser in one position. The results were
satisfactory, but the all-position welding
required was time consuming.
Courtesy Weitinghouic
The time spent in positioning the con-
denser is negligible compared to the more
than 50 welding hours saved on each unit.

standard of living
FANATICS in Germany, India, even some in America,
say we should scatter our billions over the world
in order to use up our surplus; otherwise (they say)
it will dam up on us and cause a depression.
It is entirely possible that we should give away
those billions for humanitarian reasons—that is
another matter. But don't let's let greedy foreigners
and stupid Americans say we're doing it for our own
selfish interests. And don't let anyone of us think
we are doing it by "soaking the rich". We are giving
away (and, remember, perhaps we should, so long
as we do it with eyes open) our standard of living.
You and I work, not for dollars but for what those
dollars will buy. The more things there are in
America, the more your day's work and mine will
buy. The more steel there is in America, the more
automobiles you can get at a low price. The more
cloth, the more suits you can own. The more food
there is, the better you and your family will eat.
There can only be so much of those things. When
you ship them away; you do without. You seldom
ship money abroad; money is only a token of
exchange for the things that are going out of this
country, out of your reach.
Perhaps that's good, perhaps that's wise. But we
should realize what we're doing. Whatever we give
away abroad comes out of what we have at home.
Unless, of course, each of us produces that much
more at his machine or plow or desk every day.
If every one of us produces more efficiently we
can have the satisfaction of knowing we are doing
something for the world without destroying Amer-
ica . . . the one strong hope of the world. If we
"share the wealth" with the world, we will soon
be sharing nothing but poverty. If we share our
increased production and demand increased pro-
duction in return, there will then be wealth and
strength to share.

1842-1912
BY
WILLIAM W. HAGERTY, Ph.D.
Professor of Engineering Mechanics

Osborne Reynolds was born in Belfast
on August 23, 1842. His father, grand-
father and great-grandfather were all rec-
tors of the same church in Suffolk. Rey-
nolds' early education was carried out by
his father who had graduated with high-
est honors in the mathematical tripos from
Cambridge a.nd was also a Fellow of
Queen's College. When nineteen years
old, Reynolds entered the shop of a prac-
ticing mechanical engineer to obtain prac-
tical experience, but after a year of this
work he decided that a knowledge of
mathematics was essential to his interests.
While his previous training had not in-
cluded the study of Greek, a required sub-
ject for entrance to Cambridge, by inten-
sive study for a few weeks he succeeded in
attaining the required standard. In 1867,
he graduated with highest honors in math-
ematics, was elected at once to a fellow-
ship in Queen's College and then entered
the office of a civil engineer in London.
In 1868 he was elected to the newly
instituted Chair of Engineering in Owens
College—later the University of Man-
chester—the second such chair in Eng-
land. Reynolds held strong ideas about
the training of students and felt that all
should be given the same broad funda-
mental training regardless of the field of
future specialization. It seems that while
he was an entertaining and brilliant
speaker, his lectures were erratic. Any
given lecture was likely to cover several
entirely different subjects and conclude
with Reynolds at the blackboard com-
pletely immersed in a new problem which
had just occurred to him and quite obliv-
ious of his students. However, he suc-
ceeded in turning out a large number of
students who attained high position in
academic and professional life in Eng-
land. His colleagues, it appears, regarded
him "with veneration not untinged with
awe."
Reynolds published at least 68 original
papers, most of which are included in his
"Collected Papers." His researches in-
cluded the fields of physics, plasticity,
hydrodynamics, lubrication, sliding and
rolling friction, the Aurora, Borealis, ra-
diation, surface tension, thermodynamics,
marine propulsion and control of ships,
model studies, wave mechanics, centrifu-
gal pumps and turbines, mechanical equiv-
alent of heat, boiling, rusting of metals,
ether and gravity.
The most noticeable thing about the
complete list of titles of Reynolds' papers
is the absence of repetition of subjects.
Reynolds would write at most two or
three papers on any one subject and pass
on to something new. Perhaps his two
best-known papers are those on lubrica-
tion and on the motion of water in
straight channels. His treatment of the
theory of lubrication was the foundation
of all subsequent theory on film lubrica-
tion. In 1919, Kingsbury of the U.S.A.
founded the Osborn Fellowship in Engi-
neering at Manchester "in recognition of
the debt he owed to Reynolds' researches
in lubrication."
The other of Reynolds' classic papers is
that on the two manners of motion of
water. The introductory section to this
paper is as follows:
The results of this investiation have
both a practical and philosophical aspect.
In their practical aspect they relate to
the law of resistance to the motion of
water in pipes, which appears in a new
form, the law for all velocities and all
diameters being represented by an equa-
tion of two terms.
In their philosophical aspects these re-
sults relate to the fundamental principles
of fluid motion; inasmuch as they afford
for the case of pipes a definite verifica-
tion of two principles, which are—that
the general character of the motion of
fluids in contact with solid surfaces de-
pends on the relation between a physical
constant of the fluid, and the product of
the linear dimensions of the space occu-
pied by the fluid, and the velocity.
The results as viewed in their philoso-
phical aspect were the primary object of
the investigation.
In Reynolds' subsequent discussion, he-
first observed that in the case of flow of

Osborne Reynolds
water through tubes, that usually the re-
sistance is proportional to the square of
the velocity of flow, but sometimes it is
proportional to the velocity. However,
the latter is associated with capillary tubes
and small velocities. Then he comments
that the equations of hydrodynamics are
applicable to flow without eddies and lead
to the conclusion that resistance is propor-
tional to velocity. However, they yield no

I. What does sales engineering have
to offer engineering graduates?
Sales Engineering is truly a way of life,
which richly rewards those who achieve
success in this field. These rewards go
far beyond those which may be measured
by the dollar sign aJone, since they in-
clude the making of staunch friends in
the business world. The satisfaction of
accomplishment in this field has a special
flavor because it is so tied in with human
values.
No engineer can achieve good sales-
manship without becoming a more in-
teresting person himself, with increased
capacity for the enjoyment of a fuller life.
It is also true that good salesmanship
superimposed upon engineering ability is
not a too common commodity and there-
fore pays off fully as well, if not better,
than most purely engineering occupations.
I am told by purchasing agents that few
salesmen who call upon them are
equipped to solve problems on the spot.
Instead, they must take the problem away
with them for solution by others in their
organizations. This proves that many who
call themselves sales engineers do not
measure up to the title. Those that do so
measure up, being in the minority, are
therefore in position to command good
incomes. They also enjoy a sense of se-
curity in the knowledge that their services
will always be in demand in poor times
as well as good times.
I know of no other line of endeavor in
which results follow so surely and quickly
upon the expenditure of the right kind of
effffort. In design or production engineer-
ing, one must often wait months for the
worth of his effort to be proven. This is
not so in sales engineering. Here one
works to obtain the application and the
order. Then there is less time lag be-
tween effort and result. If the sales effort
has been right, the order follows directly.
If not right, the order goes to competition.
Reward is therefore directly geared to
effort and the thrill of having earned a
good order never seems to wane.
The unusual freedom which a sales
engineer enjoys from the confinement of
a drawing board and the time clock is
evident. But the net effect of that free-
dom is not so obvious. The need to be in
complete command of himself to decide
where to go and when and whom to see
and what to do on arrival, stimulates ini-
tiative and urges him to greater accom-
plishment. So it is inevitable that the sales
engineer's personal development on the
job, is noticeably rapid.
II. What qualities must one have or
acquire in order to become a good
sales engineer?
First of all, one must have a sound
engineering background. This must be
good enough to command the respect of
other engineers who have made their
mark and who may be specialists in their
own particular fields. Such an engineer
will not expect one to equal him in so
far as his own speciality is concerned.
He will demand, however, that one know
enough about it to discuss it intelligently,
and to relate one's own special facility to
it, in order to accomplish a better end
result.
If one is found wanting in any basic
discussion involving mathematics or engi-
neering mechanics, he loses his prospect's
respect in this manner. The prospect then
discredits anything one does or says there-
after, regardless. The oft repeated remark
that "the engineer who fails to make the
grade professionally is sales engineering
material," is a fallacy for this reason:
When graduation approaches for most
of you there will be interviews for jobs.
Those employers looking for sales engi-
neering material will first check the schol-
astic record. They will look for at least a
"B" average with particular note whether
the record shows consistency and follow-
through. It is important that one finish
what he starts since this denotes staying
qualities.
Then, the employers will inquire as to
campus activities outside the classroom.
They will be looking for breadth of inter-
est and evidences of leadership which are
the gauge of personality.
III. What truth is there to the state-
ment that "one has to be born with cer-
tain characteristics to become a success-
ful sales engineer?"
Based solely upon personal experience
and observation, I can give assurance
that sales engineers are not always born
into that profession. The phase "natural
born salesman" is misleading in this re-
spect.
Sales engineers are made by training
and experience.
After one has completed whatever
training program his new employer
chooses to provide, the embryo sales engi-
neer has to make a beginning. At this
critical time he may hasten his progress
by applying engineering analysis to his
sales problem. The new knowledge which
he gains, by the method of trial and error,
makes this period easier. It is indeed the
time when he takes over completely and
trains himself to improve in effectiveness.
This program of self improvement never
quite ceases in fact, since there never
comes a time when he can rest on his
oars.
Every sales presentation may be likened
to a ballgame. One can play the game
over again in one's mind after it is finish-
ed, and very likely see how a game lost,
might have been won.
Rarely, if ever, does a salesman become
a sales engineer, but rather, men with
engineering training and experience turn
to sales responsibilities to further imple-
ment their engineering effffectiveness.
How can the engineer overcome an
innate aversion to selling anything?
It seems to be axiomatic that a true
engineering mind shrinks from the
thought of asking anyone to make a pur-
chase. It has been my observation that
most engineers are shy in this respect.
This need not be true if one assumes
the right approach to the problem of
making a sale.
If one defines a sale as "the transfer
of a service or some material thing for a
consideration from which the purchaser
stands to gain as much or more than the
seller," and then governs oneself accord-
ingly, there need be no embarrassment for
anyone.
Let's go into this a little further.
The consumation of any sale that does
not benefit the purchaser is not a sale,
but a "sell."
There have, most unfortunately, been
so many "sells" perpetrated upon the
public that people are ever on their guard
not to be taken in.
Therefore every salesman meets with
12

down by dint of repeated honest effort to
be helpful to his customers and prospects.
Every sales call is made with the sole
objective of showing how the use of one's
product will benefit the purchaser.
The salesman seldom, if ever, asks
favors for himself or the company which
he represents.
At the same time he finds devious ways
to be both helpful and interesting.
Then as time passes he is received into
the organization where he must do his
sales work with better grace and ulti-
mately with a hearty welcome.
I overheard a Chief Engineer remark
about one particular sales engineer as
follows. He said, "This chap is free to
come into my department whenever he
wishes. He completes his business with
dispatch and always leaves us with some-
thing on the side."
So you see it is simply a matter of
proper attitude of the sales engineer to-
ward his work and his customers that
leaves no room for either shyness or em-
barrassment on anybody's part.
I believe that if engineers and engi-
neering students understood this fact
more of them would get into sales work
much sooner than they do.
In this respect I give you an example.
A certain engineer whom I know very
well had spent several years at various
assignments when he was offered a chance
at sales work. At that time he accepted
with serious misgivings, because he be-
lieved that to succeed in sales one needed
to be a good horse trader.
Nevertheless he made a try at sales
and began by calling upon the engineers
in his territory to inquire about their
problems and how he might assist them.
Later he sought out the purchasing
agent in these organizations and told him
what he had been attempting to do all the
while studying the purchasing man in
order to try to discover what sort of a
horse trader he might be.
To his surprise and relief he found
that purchasing agents, with few excep-
tions, were regular fellows.
The chislers were so few and far be-
tween that they could be ignored with im-
punity.
Then he also found out three things
which apply to purchasing agents in gen-
eral which made life much easier.
Their first concern is whether they can
believe what the salesman tells them.
Their second concern is whether the
salesman knows his business.
Their third concern is whether they
may receive a fair deal from the salesman
and the company which he represents.
By answering these three questions in
the affirmative one's worries about pur-
chasing people are over.
It follows that every good sales engi-
neer knows that without the assistance of
a smart purchasing agent little can be
accomplished.
Ultimately also it becomes apparent
that it is the friend he makes when he
takes an order that is by far the more im-
portant.
So this is one accepted method of oper-
ation for the sales engineer by means of
which he accomplishes four things over
a period of time.
1. He promotes the use of the product
which he sells.
2. His product stays sold.
3. His repeat business plus his new
business builds sales volume.
4. He builds for himself a reputation
for ability and integrity.
This is how one sales engineer worked
out his sales problem. Anyone of you
people can do likewise.
IV. What is expected of a sales engi-
neer?
First of all he must be thoroughly in-
formed concerning the product which he
is to sell. This knowledge of product
must be kept up to date. It includes
knowledge of manufacturing process and
detail and the reasons for the methods
used.
The sales engineer should be able to
answer on the spot, almost every question
which may arise in his prospect's mind
concerning the article itself or the techni-
calities of its application to accomplish
its purpose. In this latter respect his engi-
neering ability has full sway. The product
he sells must deliver its full measure of
performance and this requires that sound
application practice be followed. Since it
is a fact that more machine components
fail to develop their normal life because
of faulty application than for any other
reason, there is yet room for more and
better sales engineering.
If however, a question is asked, which
the sales engineer cannot answer, he must
be frank about it. He should then come to
an understanding, that he will return at
some definite time to provide the infor-
mation desired. Such a promise must be
scrupulously kept.
A sales engineer is expected to main-
tain an ever expanding sales volume from
a definite territory. He is the important
man insofar as that territory is concerned.
He represents his own company there to
the exclusion of any other individual. The
arrangement is usually such that he comes
close to running his own business in this
respect.
His work is directed at organizations
where decisions concerning the purchase
of the product which he represents come
from groups. These groups are made up
of design engineers and their group lead-
ers—chief engineers, production manag-
ers, and purchasing people. The sales
engineer's work is therefore wide in scope
since, beginning with the development
of the usefulness of an application idea
with the designer, he must follow through
successive steps thereafter. These are the
check of final design for correctness of
detail, and any further recommendations
which may be required because of results
which may show up in laboratory test.
This is followed by the detail involved in
the production application of his product
and its final acceptance by the public.
Thus it can be seen that a sales engi-
neer's effectiveness if greatly enhanced
by mechanicaj facility in solving perfor-
mance troubles which arise in the cus-
tomer's laboratory, production depart-
ment, or in the hands of the ultimate
user. Most manufacturers maintain appli-
cation engineers whose sole responsibility
is to supervise application detail and sat-
isfy customer complaints. Application
engineering therefore is frequently the
training ground for men who ultimately
assume the responsibility for maintaining
sales volume. Sales engineers and applica-
tion engineers frequently work together
as a team in which case the salesman is
expected to be the leader. It is his re-
sponsibility to enunciate policy and to see
that a final result satisfactory to everyone
is obtained.
A sales engineer is always looking for
the opportunity to make a new application
of his product which will result in new
business. The machine designer, who is
his primary prospect, is ever striving to
achieve a better result. This often poses
application problems, which are most in-
teresting from an engineering standpoint
because they are so entirely new. The
sajes engineer and the designer then team
up on creative work.
At the same time the sales engineer
must keep frequent contact with a cus-
tomer list from whom repeat business is
continually coming in and which must be
maintained.
He is also required to write a clear and
concise report covering each sales call.
These reports tie his work in with that

Mr. Robert Otto in the "Super-Sonic
Eight" presents his ideas of what new fea-
tures ought to be included in the cars of
the future. Such a report as this would
be used to acquaint the sales representa-
tives with the new model.
This report has been written to intro-
duce the "Super-Sonic Eight" to the sales
staff of the International Automobile
Company. This model is a revolutionary
design in the automotive industry. The
outstanding features are the motor in the
rear, rapid motor removal, motor ex-
change, and head lights that turn with
the steering mechanism. The design em-
bodies many other features which are
synonymous with I. A. Co. products;
such as economy, low cost, and beauty.
Let us begin with the motor. The mo-
tor is essentially the same as that of last
year's model, but it is placed in the rear
of the car. The motor accessories such as
the starter, generator, fuel pump, and
distributor are now on the outer side of
the motor. The fan has been elimi-
nated and a hydromatic transmission is
now standard equipment. The motor has
been stepped up so that it is now capable
of developing enough power to operate
the car at 110 miles per hour.
The cooling system has been altered to
a forced draft system. (See Fig. 1) The
air enters through ducts in the rear fen-
ders, and serves to cool the water and
also the motor. It operates on the princi-
ple that the volume of air which enters
the ducts must equal the volume which
leaves. Since the time required to enter
is the same as that to leave, the exit
velocity must be increased to get the air
out of the duct.
The most revolutionary feature of this
design is the quick-change motor. As
seen in Fig. 1, the accessories subject to
rapid wear are easily accessible for quick
removal and replacements when neces-
sary. This will keep maintenance cost to
a minimum.
Any major repairs such as valve re-
grinding, overhaul of transmission, are ac-
complished by removing the motor. The
motor is mounted in channels as shown
in Fig. 2, and held in place by the lock
arrangement shown. When the mountings
are in the open position, the channels
serve as supports for the motor when it is
being removed.

To remove the motor the following
procedure must be carried out:
Operation Time Estimate
1. Remove radiator hose 10 minutes
2. Disconnect battery cables.... 5 minutes
3. Disconnect muffler 15 minutes
4. Remove bolts from drive

5. Disconnect gages 5 minutes
6. Unfasten lock and slide out
motor 5 minutes
7. Remove with hoist 10 minutes
Total 60 minutes
The time estimate is very conservative
has made possible the system of motor
exchange. The system is similar to that
of fuel pump or carburetor exchange. In-
stead of the garage repairing the motor, it
is removed and one from stock is imme-
diately installed. The old motor is sent
to the factory where it is repaired on a
production basis. The cost of repairs is
billed to the dealer who adds the labor
cost and this amount is charged to the
customer. If this method of pricing is im-
practical, the trouble is analyzed by the
service manager and a standard price is
charged according to his findings.

mechanic experienced on these automo-
biles. This is a considerable saving com-
pared to 4 hours minimum required for
removal of a motor from a conventional

Petroleum is believed to originate in
the chemical decomposition of organic
matter. This organic matter probably
consists of animal remains, accumulated
by the sudden environmental changes
which killed large numbers of the ani-
mal kingdom at certain times in the
geologic past. Bacteria, heat, and intense
pressures then combined to chemically
alter the organic materials of the animal
bodies into petroleum compounds.
Oil seeps are one indication of under-
ground oil pools. These seeps are simply
oil "springs."' 'Petroleum migrates up
through the porous rocks and out into
the earth's surface, usually just above
a water spring. Careful geologic mapping
of the area adjacent to the seep will
usually reveal deep oil pools in profitable
quantity in the region.
It is not uncommon to find sulphur
springs or seeps in an area that is rich

The newly-produced compounds of
crude petroleum are formed deep in the
earth's crust where the rocks are flooded
with water. Since oil is lighter than water,
it must rise in aqueous surroundings, and
migrate toward the earth's surface. How-
ever, pore spaces, through which the oil
passes, vary in size and number from one
rock type to the next. Shales are imper-
meable, sandstones highly permeable, so
that oil will more readily migrate through
sandstone than through shale.
The oil passing up to the surface
through a permeable rock, often finds an
inpermeable rock above it. If the oil can
find no way to by-pass this inpermeable
layer, then it may be "trapped" there.
This is especially the case in domed rocks,
faulted rocks, and salt traps, (see Figs.
1-3.)
If rocks deep in the earth are warped
up and domed, these wounds are often
expressed in topographic relief at the
surface. This relief may or may not be
perceivable by the human eye. It may al-
ways be determined with the engineer's
transit, however. Very slight surface rises
are usually present over wide areas in
flat country, and it is these areas than have
provided the most profitable oil wells.
in petroleum. This is because salt plugs,
the cylinders of salt which often trap oil,
(see Fig. 2)), are capped by a layer of
sulphur salts. These sajts may be dis-
solved to produce sulphur-bearing waters
which precipitate sulphur on settling at
the surface. These seeps of sulphur are
ploration, the geologist can more fully
understand the probable conditions of oil
accumulation that exist in the area, and
map these conditions. He does so by
outlining all the rocks of each particular
age in the area ajid plotting these rocks
as bounded units on a map. Each age of
rock is then marked with various sym-
bols which indicate its geometric form
and position at depth (in relation to its
surface position).
Every subsurface dome or ridge will be
mapped by the general method outlined
above. Domes ajid ridges are then as-
signed axial planes. These planes ap-
proximately divide the structure vertically
into two symmetric parts. The intersection
of these planes with the surface forms a
moderately straight line on the geologic
map. This line is the axial trace. Drilling
will be facilitated by knowledge of the
position of the axial trace, as it is the
map's surface representation of the line
along which most productive pools will
be located.
Faults will also be represented on the
geologic map. They will be distinguish-
able in the field by a break in the con-
tinuity of consistent beds. A formation
may extend for many hundreds of miles,
only to be broken by a fault and seem to
disappear. This type of information on
the geologic map is important in analyz-

June 11 through 14 are the dates of this
year's examinations by the Michigan State
Board of Registration For Architects, Pro-
fessional Engineers and Land Surveyors.
This test is given each year to all engineers,
architects and surveyors who wish to become
registered engineers in this state.
Below are presented some sample ques-
tions of last year's test, which may help to
acquaint the candidates and future candi-
dates with the type of questions asked.
1. A cylindrical tank is to contain
1125 cu. ft. and is to have a flat bottom
and a hemispherical screen for a roof.
The bottom costs 40 cents per sq. ft., the
curved wall 30 cents per sq. ft., and the
roof 20 cents per sq. ft. Find:
a. The proportions of the tank so that
the cost of materials will be a mini-
mum.

10 inches from the center of the vertical
post. The coefficient of friction between
the arm and post is f = 0.30. Find the
distance, A, at which the 50 lb. load
should be placed so that the arm C is on
the point of sliding down the post.

moment over each support. Assuming that
the depth of beam is twice the width and
that the safe working stress is 1200 psi,
find the depth of the beam.

7. The antenna circuit of a certain
radio may be represented by the circuit
shown.
Two radio frequency voltages of 1500
kilocycles and 1400 kilocycles are applied
between points A and B.
It is designed to suppress the 1500
kilocycle signal by tuning the parallel
section with capacitor C2.
It is also desired to have the maximum
1400 kilocycle current flowing through
the coil L2 by tuning L2.

weight of the compound?
9. Benzene flows through a horizontaj
venturi meter having an inlet diameter of
8 inches and a throat diameter of 3-5
inches. The differential pressure is meas-
ured with a manometer having benzene
on top of mercury. The mercury level in
the throat leg is 4.0 inches above the
mercury level in the inlet leg of the man-
ometer. The specific gravity of the ben-
zene is 0.90. The coefficient of discharge
of the venturi meter is C = 0.99. Find
the volume rate of discharge.
10. Untreated fence posts have an
average life of 6 years; the same posts
treated with creosote have an average life
of 18 years. Cost of post and installation
charge is $1.40 each. Treatment is an
extra charge. Assume interest is on a
55 per cent compound equivalence basis.
How much can one afford to pay for treat-
ment, if a 10 per cent return on the in-
vestment in treatment is required?
11. A man bought a piece of property
for $1000. Five years later he bought a
second piece for $2000. After five years
more he sold the two pieces for a total
of $4467.30. The income had meanwhile
just paid for taxes and repairs. To what
rate of interest, compounded annually,
would this profit be equivalent? (Give
the answer correct to the nearest tenth
of one per cent.)
12. A tank with vertical sides is 6 feet
square, 12 feet deep and is filled to a
depth of 10 feet with water. By how
much, if at all, will the total force on one
side of the tank be changed, if a cubical
box measuring 4 feet on each edge and
weighing 2000 lbs. is placed in the
water so as to float with one face horizon-
tal?

Clearing the track of clickety-clack
You can ride in comfort on longer-lasting rails because the song of the track is being stilled
Like the paddleboat whistle on the river, the clicketv-clack
of wheels on rails is on its way to becoming a memory.
This familiar clatter and chatter has been like music to
some of us when we travel. But it's been a headache to
others .. . particularly our railroads.
Wheels pounding on rail joints cause jolting and wear as
well as noise. And wear means expensive repair or replace-
ment of rails and the bars that connect them.
ELIMINATING RAIL JOINTS-"Ribbonrail" is becom-
ing important news because it provides a way to solve the
high cost of joint maintenance by eliminating the joints
themselves.
RAILS BY THE MILE-"Ribbonrail" is formed by weld-
ing the rails together under pressure in the controlled heat
of oxv-acetylene flames. The welding is done on the job be-
fore the rails are laid . . . and they become continuous rib-
bons of steel up to a mile or more in length.
Mile-long lengths of rail in use may seem impossible be-
cause of expansion and contraction under extreme changes
in weather and temperature. "Ribbonrail" engineering has
solved this problem . . . reduced rail maintenance cost, and
created the comfort of a smoother, quieter ride.
A UCC DEVELOPMENT-"Ribbonrail" is a development
of the people of Union Carbide. It is another in the long
list of achievements they have made during 40 years of
service to the railroads of America.

There seems to be widespread mis-

order. He is variously pictured as a play-

magic wand over his prospect while he
beguiles him into signing on the dotted
line. Selling, on the other hand, is a full
time job of hard work. It calls for a lot of
foot work, head work, imagination, plan-
ning, study and research. One can so
apply himself for years and still find
ways to improve in performance. It is
something like the artist who finishes one
picture only to feverishly begin a new
one, seeking to get closer to perfection
which he never quite reaches.
It is my belief that the selling process
is one which follows the pattern of hu-
man behavior in general, and so is pre-
dicate, in that definite laws of cause and
effect apply, just as much as they do in
the laboratory where one deals with ma-
terial things and physical forces.
Let us cite two of these laws of hu-
man behavior of particular moment in the
selling process.
The one which comes first to mind I
choose to call the "Relaxed Attitude." It
is a fact that if one assumes a too positive
approach in a tense manner one induces
tenseness in one's prospect causing him
to resist the most persuasive sales pre-
sentation. I liken this to the physical law
in static electricity where positive charged
iron particles are repulsed by the positive
poles of a magnet. So, the first lesson one
must learn, in order to sell, is to present
a complete easiness of manner so as not
to induce a prospect to put up a mental
wall of resistance.
A second law is the fact that the corner
stone upon which all human compliance
is fased is jailb in one another. Therefore,
to affect a sale you must first obtain the
trust of your prospect and this can be
most easily gained by the use of utter
sincerity. You are doomed to failure if
you attempt to act out a part in preference
to being completely yourself.
Having established trust, you still must
demonstrate that what you offer in sale
will bring profit to your prospect. He
must have need of what you offer and
you must somehow help him "to discover
for himself" that what you offer in sale
fills that need as well or better than some
otjier similar article.
Note the choice of words here—"help
him to discover himself." Pure statements
of fact are not enough to convince. In
this respect, good salesmanship and good
teaching are quite akin to one another.
When a sales engineer sketches an idea
on paper in his sales presentation to a de-
signer, and that designer takes over him-
self to complete the sketch, the right kind
of progress has been made. That designer
must make the salesman's idea his very
own. As we say, he must put something
of himself into that design, if one is to
see his suggestion accepted and his
product adopted.
There are more of these laws of human
behavior which apply to the selling
process. Understanding of them, which
comes from close observation of people
is not enough since one must be able to
apply them effectively.
One of a salesman's most effective tools
is appreciation of the special talent or
ability which every individual possesses
as compared to his fellows.
The sales engineer must be alert to
sense these special qualities in others and
adroit in finding the smooth way of ex-
pressing his appreciation of them. The
reaction one gets is invariably one of ex-
pressed friendliness and confidence. It sel-
dom fails.
The other day while leaving an office
building I noted that a carpenter and his
helper were doing a specially fine job of
putting in a new door and entrance way.
They had fine materials to work with—
hard cedar and beautiful hardware and
they were making the most of these.
I commented on this fact and their re-
sponse was both hearty and immediate.
We had something in common here
which created a friendly atmosphere.
Earlier on this call the Purchasing
Agent's conversation disclosed the fact
that he was the product of practical shop
experience and I commented on this fact
also. Again came the same result—a big
smile and statements confirming the truth
of what I had surmised.
We are talking about "Huma/i Rela-
tions" now which are becoming ever more
important and which are especially signifi-
cant to the Sales Engineer.
No discussion of this subject would be
complete without calling attention to what
is frequently referred to as the "dignity
of the individual." For regardless of how
you may choose to classify people they all
respond to recognition of themselves as
individuals.
I find it most interesting to prove this
fact in my contacts with all kinds of
people—and you may likewise find it
equally interesting.
Here is an example.
In conformity with this principle I
never get into a taxicab and make a blank
statement which amounts to a command
that—I want to go to some specific place.
Instead I say—"Would you care to take
me to the station or to whatever place
I wish to go.
The response to this latter method is
noticeably better.
This is a simple illustration but a good
one nevertheless since it illustrates the
sales engineer's need to provoke "A will-
ingness to comply" as a response to the
manner of his approach.
I believe we can define the exact mo-
ment when an engineer takes the first
step toward becoming a sales engineer.
That is the moment, when be begins to
give prior consideration to the effect of
what he is about to say or do, upon the
person whom he wishes to convince;
and so modifies his wording or action ac-
cordingly. If in doubt as to that effect, a
good rule to follow is to mentally reverse
positions with one's prospect and then
imagine how you yourself would react
when the tables are turned. This calls for
mental alertness and fast thinking until
from constant practice one learns to do
this instinctively by which time true sales-
manship has been acquired.
A few trials of this method of teach-
ing oneself to sell will not suffice other
than to demonstrate its effectiveness. One
must continually practice in this manner
in order to gain ease and facility in the
selling process.
Such facility is a vajuable aid to the
success of any engineer even though he

Super-powered receivers, built on principle!
developed at the David Sarnoff Research Center
of RCA, bring clearer television pictures to more homes.
New Super Sets
widen televisions horizons!
Although no new TV stations have
been built since 1950, television's
reach has been extended in two waijs.
In sections of cities where interfer-
ence is a problem, fine pictures can
now be seen The same is true in rural,
or TV "fringe" areas, formerly too
distant for clear reception.
RCA engineers and scientists, to offset
these limitations, developed powerful
new Super Sets. In distant fringe areas,
these sets boost a weak or faltering signal
into a clear, steady picture. While in
cities, where buildings and electrical
devices may interfere, this same super
power—plus television's first double-
shielded tuner-bring in TV at its best.
The result is stronger pictures in the
country and in problem areas, and better
pictures than ever before in areas of nor-
mal television reception.
The new RCA Victor "Picture Power" Super
Sets are examples of research and engineering
at work for your benefit. This pioneering means
finer performance from all products and serv-
ices of RCA and RCA Victor.

for a sub to dive swiftly and safely

It's a tense moment aboard a U. S. Navy
submarine when the signal for diving
Stations electrifies the crew.
And to make sure all preparations
have been properly made for a swift, safe
descent—submarines are equipped with
a panel of colored lights like the
one shown below aboard the U.S.S.
Silversides. Submariners call it the
"Christmas Tree," because when all
valves and hatches are closed the whole
panel glows green.
Important to the "Christmas Tree"
are tiny switches —that must never fail.
That's why, in choosing the hundreds
of precision switches found in every
submarine, the Navy selects dependable,
proven Micro Precision Switches, pro-
duced by Honeywell.
And this is only one of manv vital
functions Honeywell devices perform in
the fields of marine controls, aviation,
guided missiles and atomic energy.
Today, fabulous new controls for
many fields are being developed by the
men in our expanding engineering and
research sections, who find their work
often calls for fascinating study in the
realm of pure science.
There's real opportunity for engineers
at Honeywell—for this is the age of
Automatic Control.
And Honeywell has been the leader
in controls for more than 60 years!

needs little space—saves time in assembly

The Torrington Needle Bearing is
a completely self-contained unit
consisting of a full complement of
small diameter rollers and a single
retaining shell. This unit design and
construction greatly simplify han-
dling and speed assembly, and help
reduce the size and weight of re-
lated parts.
High Load Capacity
in Small Space
Because the many rollers distribute
loads over a large contact surface, a
Needle Bearing has a very high load
capacity in relation to its size. In
fact, the Torrington Needle Bearing
has a higher rated radial load capac-
ity than any other type of anti-fric-
tion bearing of comparable outside
diameter. This not only permits the
use of a smaller, lighter bearing for
a given load, but also allows reduc-
tions in the size and weight of hous-
ings and other related components.
The Needle Bearing's large inside
diameter permits larger shafts to be
used in cramped quarters, an im-
portant factor in many designs.
Installation Simplified
The installation of Torrington
Needle Bearings is fast and easy.
The housing bore is simply ma-
chined to proper diameter. The

bearing is then pressed into this
housing. An arbor press is normally
used for this operation. No spacers
or retainers are needed to keep the
bearing in place. An accurately
made shaft is required, of course, as
it serves as the inner race in most
cases and must be hardened and
ground to correct size. For applica-
tions where an unhardened shaft is
desired or necessary, inner races can
be furnished for all Needle Bearings.
These advantages make Torring-
ton Needle Bearings ideal for appli-
cations where space or weight is at
a premium, or where mass produc-
tion methods necessitate the use of
a bearing that is as easy as possible
to handle and install.

Alcoa to Operate Giant
Extrusion Press
A giant extrusion press—largest in the
nation—is presently being installed at
Alcoa's Lafayette, Ind., Works. Leased
from the U. S. Air Force, the equipment
exerts a force of 13,200 tons, equivalent
to the weight of a mile-long string of
loaded coal cars! Or, translated into nauti-
cal terms, the "push" actually exceeds the
weight of a modern Navy heavy cruiser!
In the extrusion process, a hydraulic
ram forces a heated aluminum billet
through a die opening—much the same in
principle as squeezing tooth paste through
a tube orifice, or cake icing from a pastry
dispenser. The new press means that
larger, more intricate aluminum shapes
can now be produced for aircraft and
other vital defense industries. Ribbed air-
plane wing panel extrusions, for example,
can be made in lengths up to 90 feet, ulti-
mate result of which gives a plane
stronger framing with less weight. Wider
shapes also trim weight, and production
costs are lowered by reducing the number
of rivets required.
But the big press is by no means re-
stricted to aircraft parts. It's possible to
produce oversized, strong aluminum al-
loys shapes for the architectural and ma-
rine fields and for certain other phases of
the transportation industry. Alcoa will be
able to quadruple the weight of its ex-
trusions—from 600 to 2,300 pounds per
piece. LaLfayette works' new extruder will
be 21/^ times as powerful as any extru-
sion press now operating in this country.
Its installatoin is expected to be com-
pleted in about a year's time.
World's Fastest Cableway Used
Building Large Dam
The world's fastest cableway, capable
of placing 17,200,000 pounds of concrete
in a day, is helping speed construction of
the giant Pine Flat Dam across the Kings
River, California.
Stretching its cables nearly half a mile
between movable towers on either side of
the river gorge, the cableway carries and
places concrete for the dam in n^-ton
loads. Completely driven and controlled
by General Electric equipment, the rig
is capable of carrying each load out over
the gorge at a top speed of more than
20 miles per hour, nearly twice as fast
as conventional cableways.
This speed, coupled with electronically-
controlled ease of operation, makes the
cableway a major factor in efforts of the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to rush
the dam to completion. Rising 440 feet
above the river bed, the dam will be the
eighth highest in the world.
The cableway has placed a record of
more than 4,000 cubic yards of concrete
in 24 hours, or enough to form a solid
concrete block as high as a five-story
building covering a 50 x 50-foot lot.
The dam will be the highest and larg-
est (1,820 feet long and containing
2,200,000 cubit yards of concrete) ever
built by the Corps of Engineers. Planned
chiefly for flood control, it also will be
used for irrigation, and as a source of
hydro-electric power.
Lunar Reflection of UHF
Communications
A radio message was transmitted for
the first time by lunar reflection during
a recent cooperative experiment conducted
by the National Bureau of Standards and
the Collins Radio Company. On Novem-
ber 8, 1951, ultra-high frequency signals
that had been reflected from the moon
were received by the NBS field station at
Sterling, Virginia, after having been
transmitted from Cedar Rapids, Iowa.
Those participating in the experiment
were P. G. Sulzer, G. F. Montgomery,
and Ross Bateman of the Bureau's Central
Radio Propagation Laboratory and I. H.
Gerks of the Collins Radio Company.
Radio waves had been reflected from
the moon before, but they were usually
received at or near the point of origin.
In the NBS-Collins Radio experiment, on
the other hand, the signals were trans-
mitted so as to be received at a site 775
miles from the transmitter after reflection
from the moon. The operating frequency
was 418 megacycles, generated by a 20
kilowatt transmitter, because the trans-
mitting antenna in Cedar Rapids was a
fixed structure, lunar reflection could be
accomplished only while the disk of the
moon was in the beam of radio energy
(a period of approximately one-half
hour). The antenna at Sterling could
be rotated and turned in the direction of
maximum signal strength.
Reflection of the signals apparently be-
gan as soon as the leading edge of the
lunar disk entered the radio beam. The
receiving antenna was rotated until the
maximum signal strength was obtained—
in a position pointing directly toward the
moon. As the moon continued to move
across the radio beam, the received sig-
nal strength increased. About 10 minutes
after the initial contact, the signal
strength reached its highest value. The
operators in Cedar Rapids then hand-
keyed the signal in Morse Code and trans-
mitted the historic message "What hath
God wrought!" The intensity remained
at this maximum level for another ten
minutes and then began to decrease as the
moon passed out of the radio beam. The
greatest signal strength received was about
one-millionth as strong as the signal re-
ceived by most commercial television re-
ceivers.
To verify the fact that the signal was
reflected by the moon, the actual transmis-
sion delay was compared with the theoret-
ical value. This value was determined
from the geometry of the experiment—
the relative positions of the transmitter,
the moon, and the receiver—and the
known speed of radio waves. The 2.5-
second time interval that was measured
agreed approximately with the theory.
The NBS-Collins Radio experiment
thus provides additional information con-
firming the possibility that the moon can
be used as a reflector for short-wave radio
transmission during those times it would
be in the proper position for reflection.
Use of the moon as a reflector would have
the advantage that the transmissions
would be free from interruptions. In pres-
ent long-range communications, the
ionosphere is used as a reflector. This
layer of electrically charged air, 100 to
350 kilometers above the earth's surface,
sometimes undergoes radical changes dur-
ing "ionosphere storms." When this hap-
pens, the long-range communication is
partially or completely interrupted. If
UHF were used, however, employing the
moon as a reflector, these radio storms
would have little effect on radio trans-
missions. Moreover, the moon would
not have to be optically visible to act as a
reflector, as clouds or other meteorologi-
cal conditions do not affect the radio
beam seriously.
As a result of these experiments, it is
believed that a dependable radio system
may be possible if the transmitter and
receiver were engineered for the specific
purpose.

1 he ring test, shown above, is a scientific
method for determining the modulus of rupture
of pipe. It is not a required acceptance test but one
of the additional tests made by cast iron pipe manu-
facturers to ensure that the quality of the pipe
meets or exceeds standard specifications.
A ring, cut from random pipe, is subjected to
progressively increased crushing load until failure
occurs. Standard 6-inch cast iron pipe, for example,
withstands a crushing weight of more than 14,000
lbs. per foot. Such pipe meets severe service re-
quirements with an ample margin of safety.
Scientific progress in the laboratories of our
members has resulted in higher attainable stand-
ards of quality in the production processes. By
metallurgical controls and tests of materials, cast
iron pipe is produced today with precise knowl-
edge of the physical characteristics of the iron
before it is poured into the mold. Constant control
of cupola operation is maintained by metal analy-
sis. Rigid tests of the finished product, both ac-
ceptance tests and routine tests, complete the
quality control cycle. But with all the remarkable
improvements in cast iron pipe production, we do
not forget the achievements of the early pipe

Not ordinary grinding wheels,
however. They are Norton iVew-
Process Wheels — made by modern,
streamlined, precision methods de-
veloped by Norton engineers.
A Big Step Forward
This new process involves ad-
vanced equipment, new manufactur-
ing techniques, and close quality
control during every step of grinding
wheel production. As a result,
Norton New-Process Wheels are pro-
duced to a degree of structural uni-
formity never before possible.
This increased uniformity means
extra assurance of consistent grind-
ing action throughout each wheel
and from wheel to wheel. Which, in
turn, means more evenly wearing,
longer lasting wheels — together
with more cutting action per wheel
and per dollar.
In addition, the built-in balance
of Norton New-Process Wheels cuts
down vibration and enables them to
hug the work more closely, assuring
smoother, better grinding perform-
ance.

20. An electric clothes dryer costs $250
to purchase. It contains a 4400 watt heater
unit. A similar gas heated unit requires

power supplied to the heating elements
of the electric unit is converted 100 per
cent to heat and that 90 per cent of the
heating value of the gas is converted to
useful heat. The gas is natural gas whose
heating value is 1000 Btu. per cubic foot.
Either unit would be run an average of
45 minutes per load on 5 loads per week.
Electric power costs 2% cents per kilowatt
hour. Gas costs 75 cents per 1000 cubic
feet. How long would these units have to
last in order for the total cost of each unit
to be the same?

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


ANCESTRY UNKNOWN . . .
No one knows who first thought of gears as a means
of transmitting power or motion . . . but without
them modern civilization could not function.
There would be no clocks, cars or calculators
... industry would revert to hand production ...
transportation would go back to the horse and
buggy . . . household chores would multiply . . .
office managers would be seeking mathematical
geniuses.
FUTURE UNLIMITED . . .
A gear never works alone. Only when properly
meshed can it function efficiently. So, in industry,
minds must mesh if progress is to result. Here,
in America, engineers, inventors, machinists, tool-
makers are geared for great advancement. And
their point of contact is America's all-seeing, all-
hearing and reporting Inter-Communications
System.
THE AMERICAN INTER-COM SYSTEM . . .
Complete communication is the function, the
unique contribution of the American business
press ... a great group of specially edited maga-
zines devoted to the specialized work areas of
men who want to manage better, design better,
manufacture better, research better, sell better.
WHY WE HAPPEN TO KNOW . . .
The McGraw-Hill business publications are a
part of this American Inter-Com System.
As publishers, we know the consuming insist-
ence of editors on analyzing, interpreting and
reporting worthwhile ideas.
As publishers, we know that advertisers use
our business magazines to feature the products
and services which they offer in the interest of
increased efficiency, and lower production costs.
As publishers, we know that people subscribe
to our business publications to keep abreast of
what's new in their field and in industry as a
whole. For the editorial pages tell "how" and the
advertising pages tell "with what."

Cruribfe special purpose steel
for type character application
The development of cold rolled special shape type steel is one
cf Crucible's important contributions to the business machine
industry. A major part of the type characters used for the manu-
facture of typewriters are made from this special shape.
Here's the step-by-step process.-
1. Cold rolled spe-
cial shape pro-
duced by Crucible.
3. The wings of
the type slug are
bent down and
taper formed to-
ward the edges.
0
2. The type slug
cut from the speci-
al shape material.
4. The type char-
acters are cold
swadged on the
solid edge of the
bent type slug.
0&gt;
5. The flash trim-
med off after the
swadging opera-
tion.
0
6. The finished
type ready for
hardening, plat-
ing and soldering
to the type bar.
$

The production of Crucible steel for this job is the result
of engineering and practical know-how combined with a
special method of manufacture to assure a homogeneous
microstructure for maximum forming properties, excel-
lent surface characteristics for good die life, and close
accuracy control for all dimensions of the shape.
The production of type steel requires the use of small
precision rolling mills equipped with shaped rolls and
operated by skilled workmen. During preliminary and
final inspection, shadowgraph equipment is constantly
used to check for size accuracy.
As a result of its outstanding quality, Crucible's special
shape type steel is constantly in demand and used by
leading typewriter manufacturers.
Shadowgraph Operation:
Since micrometer measurements are im-
practical due to the shape, the shadowgraph
is used to measure shape and size mini-
mum and maximum tolerances. The shad-
owgraph is a projection, greatly magnified
...on a calibrated screen...of the sample.

How Fires Start
Carelessness
Top-of-the-list cause of fires, accord-
ing to study after study, turns out to
be just plain human carelessness.
Under the heading "Careless smoking
habits" you'll find such oddities as the
waitress who cleaned hot ash trays
with napkins destined for the laundry
chute, and the mechanic who tossed a
match into a puddle of gasoline. But
far, far more frequently it's simply
the ordinary guy who unthinkingly
tosses away a lighted match. , •
How Fires Are Stopped
Grinnell Sprinklers
Education does a world of good to pre-
vent fires from starting. But until
human behavior is perfect, your best
protection lies in automatic control
of fire.
The surest control is with Grinnell
Automatic Sprinkler Systems, which
check fire at its source, wherever and
whenever it may strike, with auto-
matic certainty. For more than
seventy years fires starting in build-
ings protected by Grinnell Sprinklers
have been extinguished before doing
material damage.
Grinnell sprinklers are your assurance
of positive, automatic fire protection.

may never take on sales responsibilities
since he must not only do creative work
but be able to sell others on the worth of
his ideas. He will need also to sell himself
to his associates in order to gain their
support and cooperation. A young engi-
neer's progress in industry today depends
more upon his power of persuasion than
upon his technical ability since without
the former, the latter is of no avail.
VI. Self Development of Personality
and Leadership
We defined the qualities which make
a good sales engineer as—engineering
competence plus pleasing personality and
leadership. You are engaged in complet-
ing an engineering education. You may
at the same time develop a pleasing per-
sonality and initiative by practicing every
day in doing the things which help you
to acquire these qualities.
Personality is largely made up of in-
terest in people. Such interest is easier to
maintain if one is tolerant and centers
attention on what there is to admire
about each person one meets. The oppor-
tunity to practice an habitual interest in
people is ever at hand. There is no better
place for this than on the Michigan
campus, where one may make the most of
every contact ajl the time—that is, in the
halls and on the walks to and from
classes, at the lunch counter or at dinner,
as well as in one's clubs or fraternities.
Rather than strive to be hail fellow
well met with groups of people, it is
better to try instead to get closer to those
near at hand—by seeking to know these
associates and classmates better—as indi-
viduals. You will be truly amazed at the
result of such sincere interest on your
part.
Leadership, on the other hand, requires
that one cause other people to take an in-
terest in oneself. This is accomplished
by doing more for other people than they
can possibly do for you. So, development
of personajity and a capacity for leader-
ship go hand in hand. Both are essential
if one hopes to become a successful sales
engineer.
VII. Other recommendations
I suggest to those of you who may wish
to seek a career in sales engineering that
you include in your development program
the following:
1. Cultivation of a pleasing speaking
voice and ease in public speaking.
One should not only pursue the pub-
lic speaking courses offered at the
University, but seek every oppor-
tunity to practice the things which
are taught there.
2. Train yourself to make quick free
hand sketches to scale. There must
be a course in quick sketching some-
where in the Arts College. It is a
part of every art student's program.
Ability to sketch with facility is a
most valuable tool to every sales
engineer.
3. Form habits which make for a good
personal appearance which calls for
good grooming, good taste as to ap-
parel, good posture and courtesy
which rings true at all times.
When it comes time to take employ-
ment which will ultimately assign you to
sales engineering work, seek a connection
with a manufacturer having a record for
quality of product and dependability of
organization.
Social-business tips: Try to remember
names and faces. Get interested in the
other fellow's hobby and children. Never
underestimate the importance of the little
friendly touch.
Average technical ability multiplied
through cooperative effort accomplishes
more than great talent working alone.
* * *
When small ideas in big words fail
try big ideas in small words.
If you would command attention, un-
derstanding and action, write and speak
plainly in short words and short sen-
tences.
To learn how to make a good speech
attend a typical engineering society meet-
ing. Note just how papers are presented.
Then go thou and do otherwise.
* * *
Climbing the Executive Ladder
Number one requirement for any execu-
tive is an understanding of people and the
ability to select them, direct them with
their loyal cooperation.
Let the man below do everything he
can do as well as you at lower salary cost.
And remember that power and credit
must go with responsibility.
* * *
Both fairness and good business de-
mand that you work always for the man
who works for you.
Homely Virtues
In the engineering world, brilliance
doesn't rate unless tied to sense, character
and dependability.
* * *
To go places in an organization be
known as the man who does what he said
he would do and gets it done on time.
* * *
The ability to see the obvious is a rare
and valuable talent commanding a high
price.
* * *
For a full and happy life watch your
health, keep peace with your neighbors
and your conscience, be a good citizen, do
some physical work at home, have some
fun too, cultivate a sport or a hobby,
sample the best in the arts.
* * *
Getting-Along Skills
To succeed an engineer must learn
how to get along with the man above, the
man alongside, the man below and with
his own self.
* * *
If you can't get along with a few people
it may be their fault. If you can't get
along with many it's always your own
fault.
* * *
You'll never meet a man who isn't
smarter than you in some respect. Why
not admit it?
* * *
To make a man your friend ask his
advice sincerely.
* * *
In petty squabbles, jealousies and gos-
sip the innocent bystander may get hurt.
Stand back.
The most common and important engi-
neering operations are talking and writ-
ing.
* * *
Other things being equal, skill with
words will add between $20,000 and
$100,000 to an engineer's life-time earn-
ings.
* * *
So many silly things are done in busi-
ness that merely not being silly is almost
a formula for success.
* * *
There is neither sense nor profit in
talking over people's heads. Plain talk is
best, however profound the thought.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


At joint Technical Meetings
of Standard Oil Company and
its subsidiaries, many oppor-
tunities are presented for an
easy exchange of ideas. From
formal meetings, where tech-
nical papers are read, to small
discussion groups and conver-
sations between individuals,
a healthy and stimulating air
prevails throughout the five
day meeting.
How Exchanging Ideas
Advances Petroleum Progress
When more than 150 scientists meet for five
days and exchange views on their work during
the past year, the American consumer is likely to
benefit, through improvement of products for his
use. Conversation between scientists can often
accomplish a more complete and satisfactory co-
ordination than mere exchange of written reports.
From May 5 through May 9 this year, the
Standard Oil Company (Indiana) and affiliated
companies held their tenth annual Joint Tech-
nical Meeting at French Lick, Indiana. The key
scientists and engineers from the parent company
and all its subsidiaries attended. More than
eighty technical papers were presented.
In addition to the research men, the manufac-
turing, production, sales, chemical products, and
patent departments of the companies were repre-
sented. This helped give a broad view of company
problems.
The Standard Oil Joint Technical Meetings
are outstanding in their field. The company has
been a pioneer in bringing together scientists and
engineers from all the branches of its activities.
This is another example of leadership in engi-
neering and research, and well illustrates the
progressive atmosphere men with technical train-
ing may find in a career at Standard Oil.

ficial to the oil industry in that it permits
the geologist to examine surface relief
carefully. Two photos, if a stereoscopic
pair, will exhibit a three-dimensional ef-
fect when viewed under a stereoscope. If
a subsurface, structural dome is viewed in
a stereoscopic photo, it will be represented
by an exposure of rocks oriented so that
they dip away from the dome's center.
Subsurface ridges will also be represented
in the photo by prominent rock exposures
dipping away from the ridge's crest on
each side. Subsurface faults are best rep-
resented by an apparent truncation of
structure of one type or character along a
nearly straight line. These surface indi-
cations found in the photos, and coupled
with stream drainage patterns and the
color and tone of each rock formation
give excellent testimony of subsurface
conditions.
The rebound of sonic waves off an
especially hard rock formation gives ac-
curate and extensive subsurface informa-
tion. These waves are propagated by the
explosion of a charge at the surface. They

bounding off deep rocks, by a number of
"geophones," highly sensitive electronic
devices which "hear" the rebounding
waves and record them. By measuring
each wave's elapsed time in transit, the
distance down to a particular formation
can be calculated. When two adjacent
seismic surveys are made, each has records
of the depths to particular resistant rocks
so that the direction of slope of these
formations and much other subsidiary
data can be recorded.
Magnetic properties of rock formations
depend on the contained quantities of
iron and certain other metals which can

clues to the cause of resistance varying with the square of
velocity in the case of sinuous flow, when the motion is "a
mass of eddies." Apparently then, there was something physi-
cal that the theory did not take into account. "Answers, how-
ever, were found in the discovery of a circumstance on which
sinuous motion depends."
In his subsequent test, Reynolds reports that he found that
tendency of water to eddy is much greater as the temperature
rises. He observed that treating the ratio p/p as a single
variable, //, the tendency of water to eddy increased as
fi! decreased. The idea of dimensional properties did not
occur to him immediately and he did not recall just when he
noticed that ft is a product of a velocity and a distance since
"it is always difficult to trace the dependence of one idea on
another."
After consideration of the difficulties of integrating the
equations of motion, he in effect normalized the equations,
eliminated the pressure terms, and concluded:
It seemed, however to be certain, if the eddies were due
to one particular cause, that integration would show the birth
of eddies to depend on some definite value of
c/&gt;U
where c was the radius of the tube.
Thus there can be no doubt that Reynolds set forth the
dimensionless parameter that we know as the Reynolds num-
ber, and also that he recognized the significance of his dis-
covery.
After having studied the condition for dynamic similitude
of fluid flow in closed channels, Reynolds became interested in
the phenomenon of bed formation in rivers and estuaries. In
1885 he constructed two tidal models of the upper estuary
of the River Mersey and showed that the characteristics of the
real estuary reproduced themselves in the models with rea,-
sonable accuracy after a corresponding number of tides. Rey-
nolds was the first to introduce the time element into such
problems.
Reynolds' health and mental faculties failed him in his
later years, culminating in his retirement in 1905. He lived in
poor health until his death in 1912. While he and his ideas
seem to have been the cause of considerable controversy during
his life, Reynolds' retirement and death apparently were re-
garded as a "grievious calamity" by his associates and friends.
It is fortunate that his name is preserved by the dimensionless
parameter which expresses the ratio of inertia to viscous ef-
fects in the flow of fluids, the Reynolds number.

west allis works {Graduate Training Course 1950) Ohio State—EE—1949
Selecting a specific job in
the engineering field after
graduation from college is a
tough proposition for most of
us. It was for me, and that's
why I came to Allis-Chalmers.
I thought I wanted to be a
development engineer but I
wasn't sure. Allis-Chalmers
Graduate Training Course
gave me an opportunity of
trying design and develop-
ment — and other types of work also.
By my own choosing I am now engaged
in challenging work which I hadn't even

considered while in school. The point is,
all GTC's have the same chance of
"finding themselves."
That's the outstanding feature of Allis-
Chalmers Graduate Training Course. You
have a very broad selection, and you your-
self choose the type of training you re-
ceive. Of course you get help and guidance
from experienced men throughout your
training period. You need it, since there
are jobs here that you have never dreamed
of.
Finds Job Challenging
Take my job for instance. To the engi-
neering student it probably sounds rather
dull when compared with Advanced Ther-
modynamics or Electric Transients in
Power Systems. But, in my opinion, the
most fascinating science is co-
ordinating engineering and
production efforts through
standardization of proce-
dures, parts and materials. As
Supervisor of the Standardi-
zation Section and Chairman
of the Standards Committee,
I encounter new problems
every day—no monotony here.
But that is only part of the
story! I am also Secretary of
the Chief Engineers' Committee and
Secretary of the Development and New
Products Committee. What could be more
stimulating for a young engineer than to
be at the crossroads, where he can watch
the engineering planning of an expanding
company?
No Limit to Opportunities
I never thought I'd be doing this when I
graduated from Ohio State in 1949 and
enrolled in Allis-Chalmers Graduate
Training Course. As I mentioned, I was
particularly interested in design work at
that time. In fact, right now there is a
patent applied for on an electro-magnetic
relay device I designed. Yes, they even let
me do development work while still a
GTC student.
A student helps plan his own courses
and is free to change his plans as new
interests, new opportunities present them-
selves. He can divide his time between
shops and offices—switch to design, man-
ufacturing, research, application engineer-
ing, sales, or advertising—and can earn
advanced degrees in engineering at the
same time.
When he graduates from the course he
is encouraged to go into the type of work
he liked best while on the Graduate Train-
ing Course.
One of the reasons Allis-Chalmers offers
so many opportunities is that A-C designs
and builds machines for every basic in-
dustry, such as: steam and hydraulic tur-
bine generators, transformers, pumps,
motors, rotary kilns, crushers, grinders,
coolers, screens, and other machinery
for mining, ore processing, cement, and
rock processing. Then there are flour
milling, electronic equipment and many
others.
There is no other organization that
seems to me to offer the graduate engineer
such a wide range of activities, or that
gives him such a chance to find the type of
work for which he is best fitted.

The haughty senior girl sniffed disdain-
fully as the freshman cut in. "And just
why did you have to cut in when I was
dancing?" she inquired nastily.
The freshman hung his head with
shame. "I'm sorry, ma'am," he said, "but
I'm working my way through college, and
your partner was waving a five-dollar bill
at me."

An old gentleman riding the top of a
Fifth Avenue bus noticed that every few
minutes the conductor would come from
the back and dangle a piece of string
down in front of the driver underneath.
Whereupon the driver would utter pro-
fanity terrible to hear. Finally the old
gentleman could stand it no longer, so he
asked the conductor why he dangled the
string and why the driver swore.
"Oh," the conuductor answered naively,
"his father is being hanged tomorrow,
and I'm just kidding him a little."

Three cables in one! That
was the solution sought, for supplying
power, operational control and com-
munication to a pumping house 4'/2 miles off shore in Lake Okee-
chobee, Florida.
As usual, Okonite engineers were consulted on the problem. Their
studies showed that it was possible to combine a three-fold function
in one cable. This was accomplished by the use of Okolite high-
voltage insulation whose electrical characteristics permitted carrier
current to be superimposed on the power conductors.
The result was a single Okonite-insulated cable —steel-armored for
the 4V2 underwater miles, with a non-metallic sheath for an addi-
tional 2V2 miles underground —which supplies not only power and
operation control, but a communication circuit as well.

As Asbestos Insulation Substitute
Development of a quartz paper which
may be substituted, in certain cases, for
higher-cost asbestos insulation material
was announced today by the Navy.
The new paper, developed by the Naval
Research Laboratory, a division of the
Office of Naval Research, can be manu-
factured cheaply from abundant domestic
sources.
The paper is made from fibers which
were produced in the laboratory but are
identical chemically with natural quartz.
Two types of fibers have been made into
paper: hydrous, which contains water;
and anhydrous, which does not. The
hydrous fiber, because it does contain
water, duplicates asbestos in this respect.
Paper made from the anhydrous fiber
is expected to be used widely as an elec-
trical insulating material where resistance
to high temperature and low electrical
losses at high frequencies are required.
The type of asbestos commonly used for
electrical insulation is made from foreign
fiber. Domestic fiber, or so-called Cana-
dian asbestos, is not readily suitable for
such use because it contains a form of
iron ore known as magnetite.
The quartz paper which has been pro-
duced at NRL not only is magnetite-free,
but also will withstand temperatures up to
3„000 degrees Fahrenheit, as compared
with an upper limit of perhaps 1,000 de-
grees for asbestos.
Paper made from both types of fibers is
boron-free, a characteristic that suggests
application as electrical insulation for
cables and various components which
might be subjected to atomic radiation.
Synthetic materials now available contain
boron or similar chemical elements which
trap the atomic particles called neutrons
and so would become radioactive if used
to insulate cables or other equipment
used in the neighborhood of nuclear re-
actors or "piles."'
Both types of fibers are inherently very
porous because of their bulk, and this
property suggests application of the paper
for gas mask and other types of filters.
Paper made from the hydrous fibers has a
low dielectric constant and appears to be
an excellent material for use in radomes,
or radar antenna housings. In addition,
the ion-exchange properties of this paper
are such as to lend it for use in water
purification systems, as, for example, in

making drinking water from sea water.
Manufacture of paper from these fibers
closely resembles conventional paper-
making but is possible only because of the
extreme fineness of the fibers. Individual
fibers are much less than a micron in
diameter (a micron is 40 millionths of an
inch) averaging perhaps 1/100 the thick-
ness of a human hair. The quartz fiber
pulp is added to water in a paper beater,
the stock is circulated for a short time
and then dumped into a chest from which
it can be pumped to a conventional Four-
drinier paper-making machine. In a recent
test run at the National Bureau of Stand-
ards, the machine was able to run at a
speed of 40 feet per minute to produce
a paper five-thousandths of an inch thick.
The new paper is the latest Navy de-
velopment in electrical insulation, a pro-
gram which also has recently produced
glass fiber paper, mica paper, and a puri-
fied Canadian asbestos. All of the de-
velopments are superior to electrical in-
sulating materials now available.
Kodak Movie Film Base
Changed to Safe Tri-acetate
In 1951 an event probably unrecog-
nized by movie-goers marked a motion-
picture milestone.
It took place behind the scenes—in the
manufacture of motion-picture film at
Kodak Park in Rochester, N. Y.
A few words tell the story: from nitrate
to safety.
It was the culmination of the long
search to find a suitable safety base to
replace the inflammable nitrate base in
movie film.
Adoption of this new type of film base,
known as tri-acetate, was announced by
Kodak in May 1948 at the national meet-
ing of the Society of Motion Picture and
Television Engineers.
In March 1950, Kodak received an
Oscar from the Motion Picture Academy
of Arts and Sciencees "for the develop-
ment and introduction of an improved
safety base motion picture film." This
award was the first Oscar in many years
for scientific or technical achievement.
Kodak has conducted research on safety
films since the early 1900's and intro-
duced safety film for "home movies"
in 1923.
The company continued research
brought a major improvement in safety
film quality in 1937 when a change was
made to cellulose acetate propionate base.
Development of the present improved
"high acetyl" formula is the result of ex-
tensive research since then.
Oddly enough, the present, successful
safety film is made by retaining chemical
"acetyl groups" that were washed away
in the earlier processes.
By 1948 considerable experimental
work had been done with the new fifilm
to test it as a possible substitute for cel-
lulose nitrate film.
The new safety film met the strict
standards of professional theater and
studio use. It was welcomed by the motion
picture industry as meaning greater safety
for all who take, store, or exhibit profes-
sional motion pictures.
The last nitrate base film was manu-
factured and coated at Kodak Park early
in 1951. The last of this production was
shipped from the plant in July.
Boron Replaces Critically Short
Alloys for Defense
Tests show the element boron is a suc-
cessful substitute for critically short al-
loys such as nickel and chromium in the
making of steel for the American defense
effort, P. R. Wray, metallurgical engineer
for United States Steel Company in Pitts-
burgh has stated.
For the majority of applications for
the constructional alloy steels, Mr. Wray
said, boron can probably replace a sizable
quantity of nickel, chromium, molyb-
denum and other critical alloys where
their presence is necessary only for ade-
quate hardenability. Boron, manufactured
from borax, is used in steel to increase the
hardenability, or the depth to which steel
will harden when quenched. Only a few
thousandths of one per cent is ordinarily
added.
Photoviscosity—A Useful
Property of Glycerine
Research in fluid mechanics—the study
of how and why flowing liquids behave as
they do—has turned up another useful
and unusual property of glycerine. The
phenomenon, termed photoviscosity by its
discoverers, can be observed when glyer-
ine is made to flow through a transparent
pipe containing baffles or other obstruc-
tions which interrupt the smooth flow of
the liquid. Without the aid of any special
lighting arrangements, the streamlines of

A mass spectograph and x-ray dif-
fraction equipment are among the
important instruments of this labor-
saving type. The mass spectrograph,
pictured above, separate compounds
and elements quantitatively accord-
ing to their molecular weights, even
those which are isotopes. X-ray dif-
fraction equipment, pictured at right,
records the intensity of x-radiation
reflected from a solid in such a way
that the crystalline nature of the solid
is determined. In addition to these
instruments an infra-red spectro-
graph, a flame photometer, and
many portable measuring devices,
electrical, physical, and chemical,
are available.
Research and teaching of chemical engineer-
ing relies on accurate knowledge of the ma-
terials being processed, not only of the quantity,
but also of the chemical composition and physi-
cal nature. The Department of Chemical and
Metallurgical Engineering makes available to
the student several precision instruments for
rapid and accurate analyses, thus freeing him
from tedious routine work and allowing empha-
sis upon broader engineering aspects.

the glycerine. More remarkable is the
fact that the lines persist in the stationary
lic]uid for 30 to 45 minutes after the
flow has been stopped suddenly, so that
the flow pattern can be analyzed and
photographed in a fairly leisurely manner.
To date, this property has not been ob-
served in any other liquid. Ordinarily,
such tests require special arrangements
of lights and polarizing screens or the
suspension of foreign materials in the
liquid to make the streamlines visible.
The nature or cause of this unusual prop-
erty of glycerine is as yet unexplained,
but it has nevertheless proved to be a
useful tool in the engineering laboratory.
In the new technique, best results are
obtained by passing the glycerine through
a screen before it reaches the transparent
test or observation area. The screen causes
lines—the number depending on the fine-
ness of the screen—to appear in the
glycerine. These lines remain visible and
their movement can be followed easily
through the transparent walls of the test
section. It has been found that the lines
gradually disappear with continued re-
circulation of the glycerine. Consequently,
best results are obtained if the fluid is
passed through the test section only once
and then allowed to stand for a few
hours. After a period of "rest," the
glycerine can be used again, and the lines
will appear in their original clarity. A
piece of paper folded in vertical pleats
is said to be the best background for ob-
serving the phenomenon.
Vacuum Tube Used In Surface
Roughness Meter
The Surfagage, an instrument which
can detect scratches as small as one mil-
lionth of an inch, has been developed by
General Motors Research Laboratories.
The new precision device can be used
in machine shops and factories to insure
accuracy of highly finished surfaces of
machined parts. To make the device
available to all industry. GM Research has
licensed its manufacture to an instrument
making firm.
Although it is sensitive to surface varia-
tions as small as a millionth part of an
inch, the Surfagage is a simple, rugged,
portable instrument that can be plugged
into an electrical outlet anywhere in a
shop or factory. It records the degree of
surface roughness of a machined, ground,
honed or lapped surface.
IN THE NEWS
(Continued from page 42)
Base of the Surfagage measures only
8 by 10 inches and it stands only 8 inches
high.
Chief element of the device is a vac-
uum tube only 5/16 of an inch in diame-
ter and one inch long. The elements with-
in this vacuum tube can be moved rela-
tively to each other. When so moved,
the voltage rapidly changes. The move-
ment is produced by a well protected dia-
mond stylus which is drawn by hand
across the surface to be checked and
which is connected to the tube through a
liquid of high viscosity.
Use Color Television
For Ultraviolet Microscopy
A new use of color television which
adds another dimension to biological re-
search has been described.
The development was made possible
by hooking up an RCA tricolor picture
tube to a sensitive new ultraviolet vidicon
camera which is mounted over a micro-
scope trained on the specimen. The ab-
sorption of ultraviolet light by the tissues
of the specimen differs among them. By
arbitrarily assigning different colors to
the tissues, the biologist can make them
emerge with individual clarity. This
method supplants the old system of stain-
ing the tissues.
A specimen or thin slice of tissue
which, to the human eye, appears colorless
and flat through a microscope then can
be viewed on a television screen as a
dynamic picture in color.
"Blotter" Analysis Technique May
Lead To Improved Plastics
Dr. James H. Freeman, a scientist at
the Westinghouse Electric Corporation's
Research Laboratories, has found a new
analytical method of determining the
chemical composition of Bakelite-type
plastics.
The "Blotter" technique—more precise-
ly called paper chromatography—was first
used by chemists 100 years ago. In the last
decade it was revived and used in the
study of proteins. Only within the last
year, however, has the method been ap-
plied to the study of phenolic resins and
plastics.
Everyday items made from these Bake-
lite-type plastics include: Radio and tele-
vision cabinets, electric light switches,
telephones, electric fan blades, the handles
on electric irons, and bearings for many
machines. Dr. Freeman's new analytical
tool will have particular application in
the development of insulating resins and
varnishes for Westinghouse equipment.
Here is how the paper chromatography
technique is applied: A strip of white
blotter-like paper is suspended in a large
glass jar about two feet high. Pinpoint
samples of known and unknown ingre-
dients of a phenolic plastic are placed at
intervals along the top of the paper. The
top of the strip is held in a glass trough
filled with a solvent capable of dissolving
the samples. More of the solvent is kept
in a small dish in the bottom of the jar to
keep the air inside saturated.
In much the same way that a blotter
corner draws ink from a spilled drop, the
solvent begins to "run" down the paper
and carries the ingredient samples with it.
After 15 or 16 years, the solvent "front,"
or its leading edge, has nearly reached
the bottom of the paper which still ap-
pears white. However, when an "indica-
tor" chemical is "painted" on the paper,
different colored spots appear. Their
position on the paper enables the scientist
to identify them. The color of the spots
serves as an additional check.
Dr. Freeman said the primary value of
this method of analysis when applied to
resin chemistry is that it provides a spe-
cific and highly sensitive technique by
which given substances including some
previously unknown ones may be sep-
arated and identified.
A little boy had been climbing the tree
in his back yard. For the second time, he
came in with his trousers torn.
"Go upstairs and mend them yourself."
ordered his mother.
Some time later she went up to see how
he was progressing. The trousers were
there, but no sign of the child. Puzzled,
she came downstairs and noticed that the
cellar door, usually closed, was open.
She went over to the door and cried an-
grily, "Are you running around down
there without any pants on?"
"No ma-am,'' came the reply, "I am
reading the electric meter."

All kinds of engineering jobs
call for photography
J-jet's say you're going to engineer tomorrow's global transportation
systems—explore inaccessible areas for new mineral deposits—or that
you'll design a new machine or product. All along the engineering
way, you'll find photography playing an important part.
Photography can help you choose a site through aerial photographs.
It helps you analyze structural stresses by studies of plastic models in
polarized light. It provides information on metal strength and struc-
ture through x-ray diffraction and photomicrography. It provides a
rapid means of reproducing engineering drawings full-size—or reduc-
ing them to mere frames on microfilm for safe, easy storage and ready
reference.
Applying photography to engineering and engineering to photog-
raphy have become specialties in themselves. This has led graduates in
the physical sciences and in engineering to find positions with the
Eastman Kodak Company. If you are interested, write to Business and
Technical Personnel Department, Eastman Kodak Company,
Rochester 4, New York.
FUNCTIONAL PHOTOGRAPHY
— serves industrial, commercial and scientific progress

Photogrammetry-the technic of surveying by
photography —provides essential information for
world-wide planning of airports, pipe lines, conveyor
systems, mineral and oil development, and all kinds of

"The advice should go back to the sophomore level and it
would be to take as many fundamental engineering courses as
possible instead of specializing in one field during junior
and senior years. The specialization will come as a matter of
course due to participation in a phase of engineering occupa-
tion after graduation."
"Obtain working experience in all the jobs you think you know
nothing about and avoid your primary interest the first year
out of college. Ignore geographic location when selecting a
job. Even Schenectady is an enjoyable place to live when you've
been there long enough to know how to appreciate it. Respect
and admire your boss or change bosses."
"Too many of today's graduates are hypnotized by the glamor
fields of rockets, jets, etc., whereas they are overlooking good
opportunities in the old standard lines."
"Come with G.F.., take advantage of opportunity to find field
of most interest and possible reward. Don't jump to any fore-
gone conclusions, and don't hurry to find a 'permanent' job."
"This is for freshmen . . . Go to a school that will give you
an excellent background in fundamentals of physics, math,
mechanics, and materials. Spend at least 25 to 30% of your
time in the study of humanities. Forget about machine shop
and drawing courses and practical application. Get your prac-
tical experience eventually from a company. In a few years
you will be worth 10 times more to them and yourself than
the so-called practical student."
"Be thoroughly grounded in engineering fundamentals. Ex-
periment in your likes and dislikes by trying several jobs.
Work for a company that helps you do this."
"I think the General Electric Test Engineering Program is the
ideal employment for the graduate engineer. He should spend
the full time on Test with many assignments to obtain the
background that will be of utmost value to him."
"Don't specialize too much. Get your fill of math, physics,
and so-called liberal arts."
"Don't be afraid to change either training or vocation if you
find you don't like it."
"Get a line of work in which you are sincerely interested; it
should be a pleasure to get up and go to work in the morning."
"It is a rare thing, one to be cherished as a golden opportunity,
to be able to move around on rotation, look over the best
facilities and opportunities of a company and thereby be able
to make a much more considered choice of where, finally, to
work. These things are all possible on the G-E Test Course."
"The most pleasant life seems to be in the sales end of the
business. This is what I would tell the college men to strive for if
he is fitted for sales work."
"If you don't find your work interesting after five years or
rewarded with responsibility and money after 10 years—quit."
"I have worked with hundreds of young fellows since I was
on the Test program. Only a few of them knew exactly what
they wanted a year or even two years after graduation. One
advantage of working with a large company is that it gives
them an opportunity to observe a broad field of activities—
everything from betatrons to garbage disposers—locomotives
to guided missiles. The most important thing in selecting a job
is choosing one that will keep the individuals happy, contented
and satisfied."
"Get with the company that offers the best training program
—the longer the better."
"G-E Test is the best way to spend first 2 years after school—
particularly if the graduate is undecided as to his field."
