tained and operated to make available the personnel and facilities of the Engineering Col-
lege and other science divisions of the University, for investigations sponsored by or-
ganizations or individuals not connected with the University.
Many of the laboratories at the Universi ty are equipped for specialized work as well as
for instructional purposes and are available for research work when they are not in use in
instruction. The teaching staffs of these laboratories are composed of men having the
necessary scientific background to make them successful research workers.
The University also maintains a library rich in material for study along technical as well
as general lines.
A request addressed to the Department office, 2034 East Engineering Building, will bring
further information.

16-speed geared-head 14-inch x six foot Monarch engine lathe, equipped for machinability
tests with a constant-speed motor connected through a Reeves-vari-speed motor drive. Equip-
ment includes a mechanical three-component cutting-force dynamometer and a fluid circu-
lating system with temperature controls for cutting fluids. This equipment is used in re-
searches on the cutting properties of metal, cutting fluids, or tools where accurate control
of speed is essential.

boothed privacy for coke dates. The usual light

able price. Try their pork chops sometime. A
piece of lead pipe will facilitate service.
Calkins-Fletcher,324 S. State—A soda counter
and booths amid heterogeneous surroundings.
Can get a line on some new faces here.
Chatterbox, S. State at Hill—They have a very
good Virginia Ham sandwich. Packed to the

spot for not-too-serious eating.
Hahn's German-American, 512 E William—A
rather out-of-the-way place which is convenient
for West Siders.
Haunted Tavern, 417 E. Huron—Famous for
the best food in town. Tea room atmosphere.
Prices higher than most.
Michigan League, N. Univ. at S. Ingalls—Some

Michigan Union, S. State at S. Univ.—If you
haven't eaten in the Tap Room you don't go to
Michigan. The Dining Room is a good, but ex-
pensive, place to take the family for dinner.
Michigan Wolverine, 209 S. State—Probably
the best cheap eating place. The food gets a
little monotonous but you can have all you want.
There are social functions occasionally and clas-
sical music on Sundays.
New Granada, 313 S. State—This generally
overcrowded spot is a typical good-quality res-
taurant; prices are a trifle up.
Scottie's, 605 Church —The old R b S has
taken on a plaid appearance and a Scotch air,
but the food is the same.
Subway Coffee Shop, 727 N. Main—Ideal for
a cozy tete-a-tete. As for the food—the em-
phasis is on quantity. You can dance.
Swift's, 340 S. State—The usual drug-store re-
freshment set-up. More for your money, few
frills
On the West Side
Flautz's, 122 W. Wash—The walk will work
up an appetite for a meal that is better than
average. The prices are reasonable.
Mayflower, 123 E Liberty—Their motto, "No
beer served here but the food is good," just about
covers it.
Metzger's German-American, 203 E Wash —
This place has "atmosphere" and is popular for
stag gatherings. Meals gratifying; Strauss waltz
background.
Old German, 120 W. Wash—Typically hearty
German servings of good food at reasonable
prices Usually crowded.
Pretzel Bell. 120 E. Liberty—The Bell con-
tinues to pack them in while serving the smallest
glasses in town. Good steaks and fish standard
specialties for dinner and supper. All the best
people are seen here.
Prekete's Sugar Bowl, 109 S. Main —The
booths afford greater privacy. The food is not
bad but the service on meals is slow. Of an
evening you need a compass to get through the
haze of cigarette smoke.
Starbuck's College Inn, 319 S Main—The
meals and service are good, the glasses are siz-
able, and there is no rough-housing. Dandy for
dates.
Just Out of Town
Farm Cupboard, 4 miles out on Plymouth Road
—Full course dinners of quality and quantity.
A must for Ann Arborites. Excellent for ban-
quets and dinner occasions. Jammed after foot-
ball games.
Oak Grove Tavern, 3 miles out on Jackson
Road — A roadhouse with meals at reasonable
prices. Nice place for a date if you can get
there.
Rainbow Room, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, N. Y —
Not recommended for student week-day dining.
Prices are stratospheric. Al Donahue and Eddie
Le Baron's orchestras provide atmosphere. Closed
Sundays.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


COLONEL HENRY W. MILLER
United States Ordnance Reserves
Chief Engineer of Heavy Artillery, American
Expeditionary Forces.
Author, "The Paris Gun" and other books.
Now Chief of the Railway Artillery Section of Military Enpneer
the Technical Staff of the Ordnance Depart- German Army Tractor
ment. The method is terribly dangerous
One of the world's authorities on
military matters discusses the
manner in which wars are fought.
THE sudden reappearance of a for-
midable war has focussed the at-
tention of millions of people in our na-
tion upon an inventory of the array and
the quality of the devices used for de-
fense in these days of more or less
miraculous communication, transporta-
tion, and industrial production. On ex-
amination of this unpleasant subject
one suddenly awakes to the startling
realization that only five nations of the
entire world are now capable of initiat-
ing a major war. These are Japan, Rus-
sia, Germany, France and Great Britain
together, and the United States. The
"warfare" is mentioned, this discussion
will be confined to a treatment of the
equipment used in explosively destruc-
tive warfare. Such a discussion may be
divided in terms of observation or in-
telligence, communication, transporta-
tion, and destruction. In the space al-
lowed us on this occasion, it is possible
to make only a very sketchy survey of
even a portion of the equipment in-
cluded under these headings.
Observation
From time beyond history, political
and racial groups have had their agents
facts which probably led to the defeat
of Germany. While cruising over a re-
gion approximately twenty miles north
of Paris he discovered that the right
wing of the first army of the German
forces under General von Kluck, was
turning in a southeasterly direction to-
ward Switzerland. This aviator knew
that the French General Staff then con-
sidered it to be the intention of the
German General Staff to send their right
wing far to the west of Paris so that
they would envelop that city and any
garrison that it might contain. It is
probably safe to say that information
The Mechanisms of
Modem W&amp;t-kate
reason for this is that modern warfare
has now assumed such a character that
only those nations with highly devel-
oped industrial resources can, or dare,
initiate a major war, and wage that war
at the terrific pace demanded by mod-
ern methods.
An analysis of this subject of modern
warfare reveals the fact that there are
at least four significant phases in the
procedure. These are propaganda, sab-
otage, explosively destructive warfare,
and absorption or liquidation. Since
space does not permit examination of
all of these phases, and since it is us-
ually the third phase that occurs in the
minds of most people when the word
in the midst of their adversaries and
their observers on vantage points se-
curing information about intentions and
procedures. One of the earliest uses of
any artificial device for elevating an ob-
server was in our own Civil War when
balloons were used.
It was left for the World War to de-
velop the spectacular and very effective
use of an entirely new device for ele-
vating an observer in such fashion as to
permit him to go wherever he might
wish at a very rapid rate. Probably the
first effective observation of a signifi-
cant troop movement from this new de-
vice occurred on September 3, 1914,
when a Frenchman discovered some
of this blunder of the German staff on
September 3 was responsible for giving
the French staff several days to prepare
for their counter attack and to use their
Paris garrison to make an effective try
at cutting the line of communications
of General von Kluck's First Army.
Communication
Again from time beyond history in-
formation about both intentions and
procedure have been transmitted by
means of smoke and light signals, sound
symbols, cryptic symbols placed in pre-
arranged places, and by written reports
carried by domesticated birds, particu-
larly pigeons, and swift running ani-

war to make any effective use of the
new system of communicating informa-
tion was our own Civil War where use
of the telegraph with single wires and
field instruments was employed with
great effect. The wireless method of
sending such information through the
use of electricity was of course discov-
ered before the World War and was em-
ployed on ships and in the field through-
out that war. It is rather difficult for us
to believe in this day of ready accept-
ance of the radio that practically no use
was made of wireless telephony during
the World War. It is a product es-
sentially of post-war development. Wire-
less messages during the World War
were sent essentially in code, and the
portable field equipment for this was
most clumsy and inefficient. Every im-
aginable method was employed to
render spoken telephone messages on
the battle front unintelligible to the
enemy who was certain to be tapping
wires wherever that was in the least
possible. It was an interesting and
amusing fact that Americans have th?
credit for the most ingenious code of
the World War. We enlisted men from
all over the United States and one of
our divisions had well nigh a complete
company of Choctaw Indians. Someone
thought of the possibility of these Choc-
taws as telephone men on the front.
Germans of course tapped the line and
gave us credit for devising the most in-
genious code ever heard. They labeled
it a code from Herr Gott himself.
Communication in present day wars,
of course, permits the use of the very
latest devices for both sending and re-
ceiving, and they are of such size and
weight as to be easily portable on the
back of a man. This of course gives rise
to the absolute necessity for a few more
fool proof codes such as the Choctaw
Indian dialect that was used in the
World War.
Transportation
It was the World War that saw the
first effective use of internal combustion
engine powered transportation devices.
Three types of units were tried out for
various purposes; these were the car,
the truck, and the tractor. Practically
all were of the vintage of what we know
as the Model "T" Ford. Their design
was crude and the science embodied in
their design was very meager and inade-
quate. For the first time our United
States Army had a motor transport
corps. The engineer in charge of the
great military road from Bar-le-duc to
Verdun told me in 1918 that he had
been in charge of the maintenance of
that road since the beginning of the
war and had already put on it a 9 ft.
depth of stone. I found that road em-
ployed at night for four lines of trucks,
two going north to Y'erdun and two
coming south with wounded men, broken
equipment, or empty. It was not sur-
prising that this truck traffic would wear
out sections of the road even in one
night. If anything happened to a truck
going either way it was promptly rolled
off the road in the ditch. On the front
right fender of each truck sat a man
who was the effective headlight. It was
not permitted to turn on any lights
under any circumstances.
Among the very important heavy
transportation devices tried out during
that war and developed since was the
farm tractor, which we call a crawler
tractor, and the four wheel drive truck.
Both were tragically defective. We used
the tractor to haul artillery when our
supply of horses had been exhausted,
and to our dismay we found ourselves
dealing with a major breakdown in ap-
proximately every forty miles of use.
The breakdowns were usually inside
somewhere where it was difficult to re-
pair. Steering gears and driving mech-
anisms of both tractors and four wheel
drive trucks broke down under the
slightest provocation.
At the end of the World War it was
clear to the Army that it needed to pay
major attention to its future transporta-
tion. Several millions of dollars of ap-
propriations that were still available
were therefore used in a great program
for the development of the tractor and
the truck.
To further the idea of suprise and
disconcertion, plans for the rapid trans-
portation of troops and of artillery by-
means of motor vehicles have been
studied and perfected during these years
to the end that by virtue of fortuitous
weather conditions the German Army
was able to use its blitzkrieg or light-
ning method of penetration in Poland
against an unprepared nation. We too
have our blitzkrieg plans, although we
know very well that they are terribly
dangerous in the face of an enemy who
has sufficient protective equipment to
stop such vulnerable devices as tractors,
trucks, and tanks. To sum this up it
may be said that practically every one
who will go to a scene of action and all
of the equipment that will go there will
go on wheels driven by internal com-
bustion engines, rather than by men or
horsepower.
Devices jor Destruction
The mixture of sulphur, saltpeter, and
charcoal into a compound that we call
black powder has been in use for about
six centuries to propel solid and explo-
sive missiles to distances up to eighty-
one miles to destroy protective and other
engineering works of our enemy. So great
is the force with which these missiles can
be projected that practically nothing can
be built which cannot be destroyed by
them. Our great ships of war are fitted
with belts along their vital mid-sections,
shields on their turrets and on their
fighting tops of from fifteen to eighteen
inches of the hardest of nickel steel al-
loy armor to withstand the impact of
armor piercing shells weighing as much
as 2400 pounds and traveling at veloc-

at the moment of striking. Such pro-
jecting devices have been mounted on
rapid transportation vehicles, some with
their own self-contained power units
and others pulled by tractors to accom-
pany troops in the field wherever they
may go and at whatever speed
they may travel. The larger of
these projecting devices have
been mounted on railway car-
riages because they are too
heavy to be transported on the
roads and the reactions to their
firing are so great that no or-
dinary carriage can withstand
them. Since the World War there
have been insistent demands
for an increase in the range of
all cannon and an equally in-
sistent demand for more rapid
means of transportation. They
have been mounted on rubber
shod wheels, and every effort
has been made to enable men
to serve them more rapidly.
At the beginning of the
World War a machine-like de-
vice appeared for projecting
small missiles. It was called a
machine gun and so effective
was it in the field warfare of
1914 that it drove men into the
trenches and underground and
it was practically impossible
for either army to move. It was
clear that this device was a
permanent piece of future war
equipment. Since that time we have
done everything possible to try to
put into the hands of each individual
soldier the practical equivalent of this
device. The appearance of this machine
gun in the field during the World War
eventually called forth a device to de-
stroy it and the group of men operating
it. This mechanism was an armored
crawler tractor and it received the curi-
ous name of "tank" because that was
the word employed to designate it in
the correspondence in England while
they were developing it as secretly as
possible. As soon as this device ap-
peared in the field it was necessary to
find something that would stop it along
with the low flying airplane equipped
with machine guns which were operated
against troops with such devastating ef-
fect. So we have developed the auto-
matic 37 mm. gun using tracer ammu-
nition and firing one pound shells at the
rate of approximately 120 per minute.
Field armies must now be equipped
with large numbers of machine guns,
automatic 37 mm. anti-tank and anti-
aircraft guns, and 75 mm. field guns..
Before the end of the World War the
new device first used only for recon-
naissance in the air had become a trans-
portation device for explosives. The
great cities of Paris and London were
from mortars and cannons. It is an in-
teresting fact that our most complete
protection against destruction in war-
fare has been developed against this
most inhuman form of destructive ma-
terial.
Since ships can be used as cannon

repeatedly bombed from airplanes, large
enough even at that time to carry eight
men and a supply of six hundred pounds
of explosive bombs. Since that time and
with continued development of the ca-
pacity of the plane and its speed, it is
actually true that on many nights there
pass over us at elevations as great as
five miles, huge four-engined planes
called air fortresses, on their way from
California to the Atlantic coast. They
make the trip in less than one day and
these planes are capable of carrying
tons of high explosive in one thousand
pound units to be dropped on an ene-
my's industrial plants or heavy field
work even a thousand miles distant.
During the World War the Germans
began a practice which Napoleon re-
jected more than a century before as
too inhuman to consider. This was the
use of poisonous mixtures commonly re-
ferred to as poisonous gas. Before the
end of the World War all armies were
using nauseating, eye irritating, as well
as corrosive mixtures projected in cases
platforms and to carry supplies for those
who are at war, it is not surprising that
man's ingenuity has been turned to a
device that would destroy them. This
is a submarine torpedo which is a minia-
ture under water self-propelled bomb
initially projected from either a de-
stroyer or a submarine. These under-
water bombs travel at a speed of nearly
fifty miles an hour and carry enough
high explosives to rupture the side of
any passenger or merchant ship. Special
protection has been provided against
them for most warships. Present day ex-
periences, however, indicate how dan-
gerous this device is in the hands of a
thoroughly determined, ruthless group
who dominate any great nation.
Admittedly this is only a partial pic-
ture of the equipment employed in mod-
ern warfare. Admittedly, likewise, the
increasing power and effectiveness of all
of these destructive devices achieve
nothing at all in the solution of the
problem which gives rise to them. This
basic problem is hunger.

ASEARCH for ever better electric
insulating materials has been go-
ing on with undiminished vigor ever
since electricity first was employed to
serve mankind. When an insulation was
needed to stand high temperatures,
only asbestos and mica were available.
Asbestos is weak mechanically and its
resistance deteriorates in a humid at-
mosphere so that it must be used in
comparatively thick layers with a sacri-
fice of compactness. The high cost and
low strength of mica has limited its use
pretty much to high voltage installa-
tions, where it is practically without a
competitor. Various compromises such as
mica with a binding cotton or other
organic materials have been worked out
for higher temperatures. But these, too,
are limited in application, as the organic
binder begins to burn out when the heat
increases.
Research workers have been endeav-
oring to discover a good, moisture-proof
insulation for a long time, but only
partial success has been achieved. In
atmospheres of high humidity, moisture
still persisted in reducing the dielectric
strength and effectiveness of insulating
materials.
As a new attempt to answer these and
some of the other knotty problems in
electric insulation, a strange material
has recently been introduced into the
field and is getting a chance to demon-
strate its special advantages. The new-
comer is glass—not glass in the solid
form which has been blown, rolled, cast,
or cut by man since the early dawn of
his history—but glass in thin strands
which is spun and woven much as ordin-
ary textiles. Many of the excellent elec-
trical and chemical properties of solid
glass—the high dielectric strength, re-
sistance to corrosion, non-inflamma-
bility, and ability to stand high tempera-
tures—have carried over in the fibrous
form. These combined with the flexi-
bility and high tensile strength of the
new fibers have produced a material
which must be reckoned with in future
electrical design.
Glass fibers are made in two distinct
forms, both of which have found their
uses in electrical work as well as in
many other fields. The glass used in
both processes is a special alkali-free
type, somewhat superior to the ordinary
variety in electrical properties. The first
process to be developed produced what
is called the "staple" form. Staple fibers
are made by forcing molten glass
through minute holes in a platinum
bushing. The forcing is done by means
of steam jets and under high pressure.
The glass emerges in fibers from 6 to IS
inches long and about .0002 to .0003 of
an inch in diameter. It has the fuzzy ap-
pearance of cotton yarn, and it is spun
by the same methods as cotton. Or it
may be used in the first form as a heat
insulator in a wide variety of applica-
tions.
The second process differs mainly in
that the glass flows through the holes in
a continuous stream and is drawn on
rotating spools as it emerges. Continu-
ous ''filament" glass is spun by the same

cast since the dawn of man's history.
But now it is spun and woven to

processes as are used with silk. It is
smoother, finer, and stronger than the
staple type. In fact, the strength of the
continuous filaments is of the same
order of magnitude as the strength of
piano wire.
One of the most striking properties
of glass fibers of either type is their
ability to withstand great heat without
weakening. Their strength increases as
the temperature increases up to 400°
Fahrenheit, at which point asbestos be-
gins to fail and cotton rapidly deterior-
ates. Both classes of glass tape retain
considerable tensile strength up to
around 1000° Fahrenheit, far above the
temperatures actually encountered in
electrical work.
For situations where a heat-resistant
insulation is needed, the new glass,
therefore, seems to be superior material.
Being entirely inorganic, it is non-in-
flammable and will stand very high
temperatures. But any such porous
woven material as glass tape, asbestos,
cotton, etc. must be impregnated with
a varnish or similar material in order
to give it good dielectric strength. Other-
wise the dielectric breakdown is de-
termined largely by the air in the spaces
between the fibers.
Unfortunately, at the present time
the impregnants in commercial use are
organic varnishes which are themselves
not capable of temperatures much over
260° Fahrenheit. It is now the job of
the electrical varnish manufacturers to
develop new materials which can raise
this limit so that the heat resistant
properties of impregnated glass may be
improved. Although this is not an easy
job, progress is being made, and it is
reported that a semi-inorganic varnish
has already been developed which will
stand over 570° Fahrenheit. For the
present, the heat-resistant properties of
glass fiber are making it possible to
raise operating temperatures in some ap-
plications, but considerably greater use
awaits the development of new impreg-
nants.
Because of their high strength, as well
as their ability to stand considerable

Wanted: A moisture-proof, heat resistant insulation
abuse and pressure, glass fibers are be-
ing used extensively as wire covering
for windings and coils. A thinner wall of
insulation may be used with considerable
saving of space, and the wires have a
greater permanency than other types.
However, the glass covering has the dis-
advantages of being weak in shear when
the shearing edges are sharp, and of
having some tendency to slip. Care is
necessary in the application of the fibers
in order to eliminate trouble from these
weaknesses. A coating of enamel helps
to check slippage, while various new
winding techniques have overcome fail-
ures due to shear.
Being a solid material, each individual
glass fiber will not absorb moisture,
although the woven tape will absorb
some water. Thus it is that in atmos-
pheres of high humidity, the dielectric
strength and the resistivity of glass are
considerably higher than for asbestos
and other materials. This property has
resulted in a considerable use of glass
for installations where sufficient mois-
ture is present to affect seriously the in-
sulation.
Further applications of glass fiber
have resulted from its resistance to cor-
rosives and acids of every sort except
hydrofluoric. It is being employed in
plating machinery and other electro-
chemical apparatus for this reason.
The application of glass by the elec-
trical manufacturers is proceeding cau-
tiously as yet, for every new material
must make its way slowly until proven,
it is still more expensive yard for yard
than most of the competing products.

river models
Since Sir Osborne Reynolds made his
pioneer study in 1885, hydraulic engi-
neers have become increasingly model-
minded. Due to a multitude of modify-
ing factors, hydraulic problems must be
solved, in the main, by trial and error.
Naturally, it is cheaper to experiment
on a small-scale model than on the real
thing. The object, therefore, is to con-
struct a replica that acts like its proto-
type. This achievement of "dynamical
similitude" frequently results in a loss
of any similarity of appearance, due to
limitations of available materials, con-
flict of various forces, necessity for
depths not less than certain minima,
necessity for economy, and other con-
siderations.
Dynamical similitude is brought about
by a graphical method which consists
essentially of plotting gage heights actu-
ally observed and recorded along the
prototype river, and then adjusting the
model till its curve coincides with the
prototype's, when it has a correspond-
ing flow. After the model is thus "veri-
fied" it is a relatively simple matter to
do the experimentation to discover what
is necessary to bring about the desired
result. The method of model analysis
is particularly suitable in the cases of
dam construction, river navigation im-
provement, and flood control. It is not
quite as useful in the case of harbor im-
provement, but even there has proved
to be of some value.

x-ray
Representing an important develop-
ment is a new million-volt x-ray ma-
chine, built for research in the treatment
of cancer. Unlike previous large voltage
x-ray equipment, this one is small
enough to be housed in existing hospital
buildings. Its power is such that, ac-
cording to present prices of radium, th?
radiation from it is valued at $90,000,-
000.
The new equipment consists of a
transformer of radical design together
with an x-ray tube built in eleven sec-
tions. Transformer and tube are con-
tained in a cylindrical steel tank. The
total weight, including a thousand
pounds of lead for x-ray protection, is
cnly four thousand pounds.
The transformer is operated on three-
phase, sixty-cycle power, and is de-
signed to produce 1,000,000 volts peak
at three milliamperes or more. A tube,
which is three and one-half inches in
diameter and fifty-six inches long, is
mounted vertically within the trans-
former in the space normally occupied
by an iron core.
The high tension winding of the trans-
former consists of more than one hun-
dred thin, flat coils of wire, built like
huge pancakes with holes in their cen-
ters. These are stacked inside the bank.
Through the center passes the x-ray
tube with the target end grounded at
the bottom and the hot cathode filament
at the top. Completely enclosing the
tube and coils is a steel shield, which,

100-Coil Transformer

although on the outside of the coils, is in
effect the core of the transformer.
Another unusual point is that gas
(dichlorodifluoromethane) is used for
insulation instead of oil. Only one hun-
dred pounds of gas is required instead of
the twelve thousand pounds of oil which
would be needed.
This x-ray may also be used for radio-
graphic examination of large steel cast-
ings five inches or more in thickness.
water softener
One of the principal waste products
of this country is lignin; roughly, one-
fourth of all wood plants, including
trees, is lignin. As a waste product of
wood pulp mills, where its disposal
pollutes streams, it amounts to about
1,500,000 dry-weight-tons each year.
At least six million tons a year is pro-
duced in corn stalks, and an equal
quantity in wheat straw. Other exten-
sive sources are cottonseed hulls and
sugarcane bagasse—the fiber remaining
after the juice has been squeezed from
it.
One of the principal nuisances in this
country is water that contains iron. Few
cities have water sufficiently pure that
it does not require treatment for re-
moving iron, which imparts an un-
sightly appearance and undesirable
taste. Iron in small quantities—even as
low as 25 parts per million—causes
water to discolor laundry and in time to
clog mains. For industrial cities it is

iron in water used in manufacturing
dyes, textiles, paper, ice, and in com-
mercial preparation of foods and bev-
erages.
U. S. Department of Agriculture
chemists discovered a connection be-
tween these two facts when they tested
various types of hard water with lignin
prepared from corn cobs and found this
material to be effective as an iron-re-
moval agent. In treating water that con-
tained about 36 parts per million of
iron with 500 parts per million of lignin,
the iron content was reduced to an
average of about .2 part per million.
The lignin was recovered and used
again up to 10 times with no appreci-
able lessening of effectiveness. The same
amount of an inorganic compound com-
monly in use reduced an identical iron
content to only 1.5 parts per million
and rapidly lost its effectiveness after
the first six times. Furthermore, only
lignin gives good results with all the
forms in which iron occurs in water.
Many cities may find it possible to use
the lignin treatment with existing water
filtration plants by adding the recov-
ered lignin to the water in the mixing
and sedimentation tanks, or applying it
as the water enters the filters where
carbons are used for odor removal.
new glass
A glass which can be heated to cherry

water without breaking has been re-
cently developed in research laboratories.
Entirely revolutionary, the strangest
point about this process is that articles
made of it shrink to less than two-thirds
their original volume yet retain their
identity and suffer no distortion of form.
The process consists of the following:
a normal glass object is made by usual
melting and molding operations, but
with the special glass formula. Then,
part of the structure is removed by a
series of treatments involving final leach-
ing with dilute nitric acid. By these
treatments, 36 per cent of the body of
the glass is removed, leaving it filled
with sub-microscopic air spaces. Final
heat-treatment results in a transparent,
homogeneous glass 36 per cent smaller
by volume than the original piece. The
glass in this state is practically 96 per
cent pure silica and has low expansion.
The outstanding significance is that
this glass, which may be economically
made, is similar to fused quartz.
liquid coal
Scientists have recently developed a
startling new fuel. This fuel, which is
called liquid coal, is a colloidol suspen-
sion of coal in oil and gasoline. Before
being used this liquid coal is chemically
stabilized to hold the coal in suspension.
According to Dr. Francis W. Godwin,
who is credited with this development
in research, three different types of
colloidal fuel have been used success-
fully in recent tests on a stock model
automobile. These were made on a
standard car engine without any change
in construction, with the exception of
the removal of one fire-screen filter.
The first fuel used was a suspension of
specially prepared coal, ground to a 300
mesh, in a mixture of gasoline, fuel oil,
and lubricating oil. The second test was
made with suspension of the coal in
Diesel oil. The third and most recent
test was made with a suspension of coal
of about 500 mesh in a very light oil,
a form of range oil with a light fraction
of hydrocarbons.
In each case the fuel was placed in
an auxiliary tank. The motor was started
on gasoline, allowed to warm up, and
then switched to liquid coal. Running on
liquid coal, the car showed no undue
strain or sluggishness.
Although liquid coal is not a product
ready for the market, its possibilities are
important. Besides being used as a motor
fuel, its heating value is evidenced by

Radical Coal
Its possibilities are important
the fact that tests prove its heat value
per cubic foot to be greater than either
oil or coal alone.
waterside station
Because of its very modern equipment
and its strategic location, practically in
the heart of Manhattan, the Waterside
Station is probably the most interesting
of the ten generating stations that sup-
ply electricity to New York City.
The features of Waterside are the two
new hydrogen cooled Topping Turbines,
one by General Electric and one by
Westinghouse. These high efficiency
turbo-generators use steam at a pressure
of twelve hundred pounds and a tem-
perature of nine hundred degrees Fah-
renheit, which turns the heavy turbine
shafts at thirty-six hundred revolutions
per minute to produce fifty-three thou-
sand kilowatts of sixty-cycle electricity.
The exhaust steam, which has passed
through the blades of the high pressure
turbines in one hundredth of a second,
is fed to standard low pressure turbines
at a pressure of two hundred pounds
and a temperature of five hundred de-
grees. The nine low pressure turbines
range in size from nine thousand to forty
thousand kilowatt capacity. The exhaust
steam from the low pressure turbines
passes through condensers and the pure
water resulting is returned to the two
high pressure boilers which can produce
a total of one million pounds of steam
per hour.
It has been estimated that the Water-
side Station, running at full capacity,
uses one ton of coal every seventeen
seconds. Coal is brought to the plant
daily in barges which hold several thou-
sand tons. It is believed that if the coal
were transported in trucks on the city
streets, a continuous traffic tieup would
occur.

onto the elevated sidewalks of a busy,

It is a beautiful world, this world of
tomorrow, when viewed in the proper
spirit and from the proper angle—but it
is not a perfect world, nor is it neces-
sarily a desirable one.
One thing impresses us about this
World's Fair of 1939. It is largely an
engineer's fair and an engineer's world.
In many ways the prophesy doubtless
errs, but it does seem to foretell accu-
rately a world in which the engineer
will be increasingly important.
In many technical fields, such as elec-
tricity and chemistry, everything ap-
pears to be sweetness and light. A rosy
future is foretold. Unfortunately, this
cannot be said of the approach to some
other problems—notably housing.
In the face of statistics which show
that population has reached its peak and
despite continued evidence of an in-
crease in commuting both Mr. Bel Ged-
des in his Futurama and Mr. Henry
Dreyfuss in his Democracity (in the
Perisphere) present a rather stale con-
ception of the city of 1960 as being
bigger than the city of 1939.
The "Town of Tomorrow" as pre-
sented full size in another exhibit is a
hodge-podge of 1939 houses filled with

all the 1939 gadgets and containing few
evidences of having been scientifically
designed or planned in relation to each
other. It cannot be said that the "Town
of Tomorrow" presents a single new idea
in regard to the housing problem.
Best approach to the matter is a pic-
ture called "The City" which presents
all the evils of present day cities and
slums and shows some of the better
suburban developments of the day but
which of necessity leaves off where it
should have begun.
In its attack upon the highway prob-
lem, the Fair is more successful. The
Futurama pictures an intricate highway
system with separate lanes for 50, 75,
and 100 mile per hour speeds. However,
just as the Fair pictures a slumless world
of tomorrow, yet neatly sidesteps the
important matter of achieving this goal,
so, too, does it present a wonderful
highway system with no apparent eco-
nomic way of constructing it indicated
or implied.
A little reflection on these problems
seems to be in order.
It is true that we are now living in a
world more than half of which is at war.
And it is true that at such a time inter-
national problems tend to eclipse all
others. But because half the world moves
backward and the other halfs stands
stagnant on the sidelines is no justifica-
tion for engineering progress to cease.
Domestic prob-
lems remain and
are no less serious
than they have
been, however
badly they may
be overshadowed.
In these days
when many mag-
azines are devot-
ing nearly all
their space to the
war, we feel that
it is all the more
imperative that
publications such
as the Technic
devote space and
energy to domes-
tim problems.
With this in
mind it is our in-
tention to deal
thoroughly with
the two major
problems of hous-
ing and highways.
We do not intend
to do this in any
wispy, dreamy sort of way; there will
be no broad, sweeping pictures of
Utopian endings. Instead we intend to
deal with methods and with facts.
We do not expect that our efforts will
solve the problem; we are not even sure
that we will contribute anything new.
We do hope that we will rouse your in-
terest, and that we will gove you more
information and knowledge than you
previously had. It is probable that some
of you will in time make valuable con-
tributions to the solution of these prob-
lems. If you do, and if our presentation
of material on these subjects gave you
a start, then we are certainly more than
justified in having prepared them.
As for the housing problem: There is
a question, of course, as to what extent

extent an architectural problem. We
shall attempt to determine this through
a forthcoming debate. On one side will
be Frank Lloyd Wright, the nation's
most outstanding modern architect. On
the opposing side will be William B.
Stout, one of our most progressive en-
gineering designers.
As for highways: A round table is
being prepared in which the nation's
leading highway engineers will present
an approach to the problems and the
methods of solving them.
Yet it cannot be said that these are
the only important engineering prob-
lems of the day.
There is another vital one which con-
cerns every engineering student in the
country. That is the long discussed
possibility of extending the engineering
curriculum. Much has been said on this;
much that was fact and much that was
fantasy. And yet nobody appears to
know exactly where the profession stands
Moore is now rewriting the articles,
adding the benefits of an additional five
years of experience and study. They
will appear in successive issues during
the winter. Additional information on
employment will be provided through
articles written by experts in person-
nel work.
Nor have we stopped yet. Profes-
sional Practice is the heading on one of
our new and most interesting series. It
consists of factual problems which we
must someday meet, presented in quiz
form. Reading it explains our reason
for presenting this pertinent series to
you.
The editorial page which this year
will be with us every month, will feature
occasional guest editorials. The first of
these is by the Congressman-Journalist,
Bruce Barton, and will appear next
month.
And of course there will be the usual
complement of technical articles and
features, the presentation of students

on the matter. In a determined effort to
find out, we are assembling several
forums on this question. We invite you
to give us your opinions and ideas since
we are anxious for students to be re-
presented in these forums.
A fourth problem,
and one which con-
cerns you more than
any other, is the
job-getting prob-
lem. One of the fin-
est contributions to
the mass of litera-
ture on this subject
was a series of two
articles written by
A. D. Moore and
published in the
Technic in 1935.
They have been re-
printed numerous
times in other mag-
azines and have
served as a contin-
ual source of refer-
ence ever since. For
several years we
have received nu-
merous requests to
reprint these two
articles. Professor
and professors, and this year a new serv-
ice in the form of the calendar "In and
Around Ann Arbor."
These plans and ideas will in the ag-
gregate crystallize into The Michigan
Technic, Volume Fifty-eight. And with
this credo we set sail upon the publica-
tion sea. As always, we welcome sugges-
tions, because as always we want it to
be your voyage. Together, let us try to
make it the most successful one in our
history.

OCTOBER, 1939


AYEAR ago, I sat on the rocks
above the cabin, with the type-
writer cuddled in my lap, and hammered
out the first of the year's "Comments"
for the Technic. Today, the air is a
little too sharp for that location. These
notes are being written in the cabin it-
self. Lest these words start a rumor that
winter comes to Canada on the eighth
of September, I hasten to add that there
is brilliant sunshine, the swimming is
still fine, and my present costume is a
bathing suit.
Because this location has to do with
my point (when I get to it) and also be-
cause so many ask where our cabin is,
be it said that there is one highway from
the Soo, east to Xorth Bay. Ninety-two
miles from the Soo lies Blind River:
eight miles more, and here we are, on
an island in Lake Lauzon. Blind River
is headquarters for food, mail, day-old
newspapers, social contacts, and rumors.
War was declared five days ago.
Simultaneously, some of the season's
worst static broke loose to gum up radio
reception in Blind River; the papers
continued to arrive a day late; and
rumor began to stalk this part of the
British Empire.
The Bremen had been captured. Hit-
ler was wanting to back out of Poland,
and call quits. Revolution was starting
in Germany. France had sent an ultima-
tum to Italy. President Roosevelt had
called a special session of Congress.
Two days after the sinking of the
Athenia, a Blind River citizen earnestly
assured me that a friend had definitely
told him that the radio had positively
said that the British had got the same
submarine that sank the Athenia. (Even
if the Birtish had bagged a submarine
at the same spot, two days after the
sinking—how could they know it was
the same "sub"?)
All this is very exciting; but, accord-
ing to the four newspapers I am taking,
none of it happens to be true.
Wars, and rumors of wars. I used
to think this meant, rumors to the effect
that wars were going on somewhere.
Now, it seems it may mean, rumors in-
evitably floating around as a product of
a war that is definitely on.
To get back to the campus—a campus
requires neither wars nor rumors of
wars, to make life exciting. It has its

own rumors. The less of fact that bur-
dens the rumors, the more exciting they
are. One perennial rumor that now
amounts to sacred tradition, gets to the
avid ear of nearly every engineering
freshman: the ''triple-cut rule." It says
that three "cuts" are plastered onto the
record, for an absence that happens just
before or after a vacation. Now, whether
the triple-cut rule ever existed some-
where on the campus, I do not know. It
is a simple fact that the College of
Engineering has no such rule. But, fact
though it is, it is a negative sort of fact,
and it seems to make little headway
against rumor.
Of the temporary types of rumors,
there are a great plenty. One freshman
hears that about half the class will be
sent home (to stay) at the end of the
first semester. Another hears that hardly
any of last June's graduates have been
placed; whereas, a third hears they were
all employed, and there were not enough
to go around. And so on.
Why should a campus be such fer-
tile soil for rumor? It would be very odd
if it were otherwise. Throw together any
group of several thousand people in one
small community, and the rumors will
start their daily rounds. On the campus,
special reasons prevail. Thousands of
interesting statements are made every
year, by some hundreds of faculty mem-
bers and other speakers, to thousands
of students. The acoustics of the lecture
rooms range from fair to fairly terrible.
The speakers' ideas, phrasings, choice
of words, intonations, and general clar-
ity, range from excellent to not so good.
The listeners are attentive to a degree
sometimes falling short of perfection;
and as to hearing alone—about one
person in sixteen is at least somewhat
handicapped.
Thus it is certain that some state-
ments will not be made correctly; that
of those made correctly, some will be
imperfectly heard or understood: that
of those correctly made and understood,
some will be incorrectly remembered
or quoted. The wonder is, that a campus
is not more rumor-ridden than it seems
to be.
If rumor is inevitable (and for more
reasons than arise from the analysis
above)—what to do about it? Address-
ing the freshmen in particular, let me
suggest that you form the habit of ask-
ing someone who knows. Usually, that
is very easy to do, and the person asked
is glad to respond. Have you heard of
some rule that seems outlandish? Step
into the Secretary's office and get the
straight of it, in two minutes. The de-
partment you expect to enter—have you
heard of some requirement laid down
by the department, and which isn't in
the catalog? Go to the departmental
chairman's office, find the secretary, and
ask for information. Has someone told
you that half the freshmen are killed
off at midyear? Don't believe it.
Rumors, half-truths, obsolete informa-
tion, and plain misinformation are per-
haps as rampant in matters relating to
vocational choice and employment, as
anywhere. It is possible for a freshman
to come to us, largely influenced by
advice from older friends who drew on
their experiences of twenty years ago,
in informing him. When he enters col-
lege, he is perhaps ten years from the
time when he will have fairly large pro-
fessional responsibilities. Thus, it is
easily possible for him to be, in effect,
thirty years out of date in his choice
of vocation and in the steps he is taking
to prepare for life work.
It is up to the freshman to keep his
eyes and ears open, to read, to ask ques-
tions, and to replace his load of half-
truths with as many pertinent facts as
he can take on. The campus is rich, both
in rumor, and in authoritative sources
of information. Make your choice.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


THE FEWER, THE BETTER
The demand of the times for more production per dol-
lar, without sacrifice in quality, brings into sharper
and sharper focus the necessity for the use of the
most modern materials. It is natural that the more
different steels specified in machine construction, the
greater the fabrication and stock room complications.
To reduce these complications, many manufac-
turers are taking advantage of the versatility of
Molybdenum Steels. One, a builder of a varied line of
heavy duty machines, replaced four different alloy
steels with Chromium-Molybdenum Steel (SAE 4140)
for everything from heavy crank shafts to small screw
machine parts.
We will gladly send our booklet, "Molybdenum in
Steel", containing a great deal of practical data, free
on request from technical students and all others in-
terested in modern improved materials giving more
per alloy dollar.

Facsimile Reproduction of
A/ew5papet5
By
WALTON A. RODGER, '39E
There is no middle man in this new
way of receiving your morning newspaper.
TELEVISION has a half-brother.
Known as Facsimile Service, it is a
method whereby newspapers may be
printed in the home by radio.
News and pictures are sent out in
much the same manner as ordinary radio
programs. Facsimile receiving sets pick
up these broadcasts in the home and
reproduce the news on continuous rolls
of paper, something like a glorified
ticker tape.
At present, Facsimile is still in the
experimental stage. Two systems are
available. One was developed by W. G.
H. Finch and the other by Charles J.
Young. The Crosley Radio Corporation
and WLW, Cincinnati, are using the
Finch patents, while the Radio Corpora-
tion of America and KSD, St. Louis, are
working with the Young system.
The basic principle in either case is
the same. Material to be transmitted is
mounted on a slowly revolving drum
Reproducing Mechanism
Attached in place of
your speaker

in the transmitter. A very small and
very powerful beam of light is focused
on the drum. This beam moves back
and forth over the page encompassing
one one-hundredth of an inch at each
pass and reflecting the light onto a
photoelectric cell. Intensity of reflection,
of course, varies with the degree of
darkness of the point being scanned.
The cell gives off electrical impulses of
varying intensities which are then am-
plified and broadcast in the same manner
as the impulses received from the micro-
phone in sound broadcasting. Unlike
television, no special equipment is
needed other than the scanner. Regular
transmitting equipment may be used.
It is only necessary to substitute the
scanner for the microphone.
Still analogous to radio, these impulses
are picked up by receiving sets tuned to
the transmitter and are amplified until
they may be made to actuate the printer
mechanism. The difference in the two
systems lies in the method of printing.
In either case the paper is carried on
rolls and passes under the printer bar
and out through a slit in the front of
the set.
Under the Young system ordinary
white newsprint paper is used and over
this is placed a roll of ordinary carbon
paper. The printing is done by a small
wire stylus which projects a fraction of
an inch above the surface of the two
papers. Varying intensity of the im-
pulses causes the stylus to vary the
pressure upon the paper thus reproduc-
ing the light and dark areas of the
original.
The Finch system makes use of a
specially sensitized paper. The stylus
electrically oxidizes the paper leaving
dots of varying degrees of blackness,
likewise reproducing the original.
To print the home newspaper, a com-
plete paper is set up in type and the
pages cast and printed. It is then
mounted page by page on the transmit-
ting drum and sent over the air. About
three linear feet of newsprint comes
over the air per hour of transmission.

Radio with Reproducer
The more expensive sets
recommended
Both manufacturing companies offer
equipment which may be attached to
present receiving sets in place of the
speaker. But both recommend their more
expensive special complete sets. These
sets are justified on the grounds that the
influence of static is more noticeable in
facsimile transmission. Special antennae
are also available to help eliminate static.
The Federal Communications Com-
mission licenses stations to broadcast
facsimile experimentally over the regular
commercial wave lengths from twelve
20
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


NEW ARGUS MODEL
midnight to six A. M. The impulses may
be heard over ordinary radios as high-
pitched tones of varying intensity. An
ultra-short wave band, twenty-five to
forty-seven megacycles, has also been
made available for daytime transmis-
sion.
Since few people want to get up at
two in the morning to turn on the fac-
simile receiver, the manufacturers will
"for a nominal sum" provide you with
an electric clock which may be set to
turn on the receiver at the correct time
and turn it off when transmission has
been completed.
Except in rural areas where delivery
of the morning paper is out of the ques-
tion, it is difficult to see the economic
justification of facsimile. It must of
necessity compete with regular papers
and it is not readily apparent just how
this may be done. The Federal Com-
munications Commission prohibits the
inclusion of advertising matter and will
continue to do so as long as the permits
granted are for experimental purposes.
But should this restriction be dropped,
time required for transmission would
definitely limit the amount of advertis-
ing matter that could be carried. Further,
the editorial deadline of the facsimile
edition and the Morning Clarion Bea-
con, which sells for three cents, would
be approximately the same. Con-
sequently it is hard to see just how this
development can hope to compete suc-
cessfully with a twenty page newspaper.
Anyway, what would we do without

tech ni talk
The beginning of a new year: we look
optimistically towards one of the best
we have seen here. The football team
bids fair to knock 'em for a loop and
romp off with the conference title if

not a sizable piece of the national
honors. The Choral Union Concerts have
a line-up that is undoubtedly one of the
best possible, surpassing even last year's
outstanding record. Rooming conditions
are and will be greatly improved, and
enrollment figures seem anything but
discouraging. The lecture series looks
interesting, the campus government set-
up is new but promising, profs smile now
and then, and the weather is as good
as could be expected. The Michigan
band has proven to be as great as ever,
social functions don't seem to be falling
off, and someone tells us that even the
Michigan coed is better this year. The
list expands larger and larger, but we're
not trying to dish out peaches and cream,
and we sincerely hope that we're not
looking through rose tinted polaroids.
In hoisting our own personal belts, we
know that the Technic is better off this
year than last, and think our results
prove it. At any rate, we've tucked in
our shirt tails and buckled down to work
to give you a bigger and better mag.
The proof of the pie is in the eating.
Which reminds us of the comment of
one of the editors of a popular mag-
azine. His readers had complained be-
cause the cartoons which they wanted
to clip, were placed back to back. When
he changed this, the readers objected
because clipping cartoons destroyed the
articles. The editor in question leaned
back in his chair and gave vent to a long
sigh.
"Sometimes it discourages us," he
said, "when we think of how good we
are. And it worries us even more when
we realize how much better we're going
to get."
Modesty is its own reward.
summer school
We can report quite briefly upon the
events of the summer. It was very quiet
and restrained for the most part; every-
one went around eating ice cream cones
and having a good time while a column-
ist named Alice used the Daily to howl
about the informality of men's wear.
That's a nice thing about summer school
—in the regular session only freshmen
and B. M. O. C.'s dare eat ice cream
cones and wear slack suits, but in the
summer everybody from the pre-frosh
to the middle aged principal of a metro-
politan school indulges.
But the summer had its moral side
too. Like the ending of a Horatio Alger
story was the sign displayed for a time
in front of a local theatre, and maidenly
school teachers in attendance at the
summer session must have been con-
siderably heartened to learn that "Good
Girls Go to Paris with Melvyn Douglas."
bureau
There is a new progressive organiza-
tion on Campus this year. It is called
the Bureau of Student Cooperation and
is made up of a number of the more
influential engineering campus leaders.
Its function is to act as a Better Busi-
ness Bureau for the students, and its
seal of approval is the green E. The
Bureau investigates all merchants that
advertise to the students of the Engi-
neering College through the pages of the
Technic. Those meeting the standards
of quality and service set up by the Bu-
reau receive its green E emblem.
Further, if any student is dissatisfied
with the treatment he receives at any
approved store he is urgently requested
to report the incident to the Bureau.
Complaints will be received at the Tech-
nic office. All complaints will receive
the full attention of this Bureau, and if
the situation is not satisfactorily cleared
up, the Bureau will remove its seal from
the store in question, publicly stating its
reasons.
The Bureau strikes us as a well
worked out and worthwhile plan. With
the proper cooperation from the student
body it should develop into a powerful
force to combat the well organized Ann
Arbor trade cliques, and to insure the
best of service to the students.
fricasse
She was exotically young, and not
completely sober. Nor were her com-
panions, which probably explains the
incident.
We were resting our tired feet in one
of downtown New York's collegiate

haunts after a strenuous day at the Fair
when we noticed the party on our left.
Evidently college students from different
campuses, they were engaged in a good
natured but heated discussion from
which emerged phrases of "football—
Syracuse—Navy—Princeton—Colgate."
Finally a peal of triumphant laughter
prefaced a "We'll beat you anyhow,"
from our pulchritudinous co-ed and
closed the session for the evening.
As the party rose, we noticed the
grinning escort hesitate, slip a card off
the menu, and pin it silently to the back
of the girl's jacket. As they filed tipsily
past our table we read the proclamation:
"Fried Chicken, $1.25."

terial that is capable of assuming
a new shape when subjected to pressure,
and of retaining that shape when the
pressure is removed. The term is so
broad as to include glass, cements, rub-
ber, resins, certain forms of cellulose
and protein, and many other substances.
The only plastics which will be con-
sidered here, however, are those pro-
duced from resins, cellulose, and pro-
teins. Rubber and the inorganic mold-
ing materials are not popularly classed
as plastics today, inasmuch as the in-
dusties utilizing these materials are
considerably older than the modern
plastic industries, and were already in-
dividually organized and developed prior
to the advent of the three newer plastics.
Furthermore, nearly all the important
recent developments in plastics, have
occurred in connection with the resin,
cellulose, and protein types. This article
proposes to show what these advances
have been and what can be expected in
the future.
But before the developments can be
fully appreciated, it is necessary to ex-
plain briefly the nature of the various
plastics and their method of manufac-
ture. Plastics are often divided into
two general types called thermosetting
and thermoplastic. The first group is
produced from synthetic resins which
soften and flux when heated in molding,
and as heating is continued, are cured
by polymerization and become per-
manently hard. These inlude plastics
made from resins of phenol-formalde-
hyde, phenol-furfuraldehyde, and urea-

Their Production and Future
formaldehyde. Thermoplastic materials
are softened by heat in molding, must
be cooled to become hard, and can be
softened repeatedly by the application
of heat. There are many varieties of
thermoplastics, but the most important
are cellulose nitrate, cellulose acetate,
cellulose ethers, shellac, vinyl resins,
and proteins.
The production of articles from these
materials is carried out by molding,
laminating, or casting. There are two
principal methods for molding plastics:
namely, compression and injection. The
fundamentals of the compression mold-
ing procedure may be explained in the
following manner. A filler such as flour,
asbestos, mica, or graphite is added to
the plastic resin. Next, coloring matter
and lubricants are introduced, and the
mixture is made homogeneous. It is
then placed in a mold; the mold is
closed; and heat and pressure are ap-
plied. Temperatures range from 270° to
375° F. and pressures from one thou-
sand to eight thousand pounds per
square inch, depending upon the material
and the part to be molded. The mixture
in the mold first softens to a consistency
of putty and is forced into intimate con-
tact with all parts of the mold. In the
case of thermoplastic resins, the mold
is then cooled and the part removed;
but continued heat is necessary to poly-
merize the thermosetting resins to the
final state. Cooling is not essential to
the latter type, so they are cooled only
enough to permit their removal from
the mold with ease.
Injection molding is applied mainly
to thermoplastic materials, because it
By
AUSTIN H. BEEBE, '40E
was not until this year that a satisfac-
tory method of injecting thermosetting
resins had been found. Injection mold-
ing (of thermoplastics) consists of the
following steps. The finished plastic ma-
terial in the form of granules is fed into
a hopper and then into a cylinder ex-
ternally heated by hot oil or electrical
resistance wires. Gradually the material
reaches a temperature of 300° to 400°F.
at the front end of the cylinder. A piston
under a pressure of from two thousand
to thirty thousand pounds per square
inch then enters the back end of the
heating cylinder, and the soft plastic is
pushed at a high rate through an orifice
in the nozzle leading into the cavity
in the closed mold. The mold is usually
water cooled, and the hot plastic after
coming in contact with the cold walls
of the mold cools rapidly and is ready
for ejection in a few seconds.
The fundamental difference between
laminated and molded products is the
nature of the filler used. In the case
of laminated materials, this filler consists
of sheets of paper, linen, canvas, or silk
impregnated and dried in a continuous
operation so the original interlacing of
the fibre is not destroyed. The uncured
resin is dissolved in the solvent; the
fibre is impregnated with this solution;
and then the solution is evaporated.
Finally the sheets are bonded under heat
and pressure in almost any thickness
desired, during which process the resin
is fluxed and cured.
The final method of fabricating plas-
tics, casting, is concerned chiefly with
the phenolic types. The resin used is a
pure liquid which can be made nearly

dyes to give either translucent or mot-
tled effects. In making cast phenolics,
the liquid resin is poured into lead
molds, and then subjected to a relatively
low temperature cure for several days.
Inasmuch as a considerable period is
required for the curing of such prod-
ucts, they are usually cast as sheets,
rods, or tubes, and the finished articles
are machined from these blanks.
Although some types of plastics have
been known for nearly a century and
have been made commercially since
1904, it was not until about five years
ago that production began increasing
tremendously. Since then, plactics have
supplemented and replaced glass, brick,
steel, brass, wood, paint, and other pro-
ducts as important materials of construc-
tion. The rapid increase in the produc-
tion of plastics in the last few years,
coupled with the knowledge that the
change back to older materials after
decorations up to sixty-two by twenty
feet in size are made of crystal-like
plastic which is carved, and sprayed
with colored synthetic resin. Cast phen-
olic resins are used for statues in the
Federal Building at the Fair. The sta-
tues weigh up to 2000 pounds each,
are hollow, translucent, and beautifully
lighted from within. These are only two
of the thousands of applications of
plastics at the Fair. Thus one can see
the trend. It is expected that in the
near future plastics will be used more
extensively for structural parts of auto-
mobiles, aircraft, and other machinery.
The automobile of the future may
have a plastic body which will insu-
late against heat from both radiation
and conduction in the summer and keep
out the cold in the winter; this body
may have a translucent plastic top to
permit the entrance of healthful rays
from the sun and yet eliminate glare.

plastics had been tried as a new ma-
terial for the manufacture of various
articles is practically nil, indicates that
the use of plastics will increase still
farther. Products which a few years
ago were thought to be impossible as
applications of plastics are now being
produced regularly, and there are num-
erous indications that countless others
will soon appear on the market. Already
such articles as furniture, lenses, wind-
shields, cabinets, lighting fixtures, sta-
tues, steering wheels, silent gears, hous-
ings, and thousands of others are being
produced on large scale. Experimentally,
doors for automobile trunks and build-
ings, full sized coffins, large pieces of
furniture, and plastic "glass" are being
manufactured. As indications of what
may be expected commercially in the
future, plastics are used very extensively
at the New York World's Fair. Mural
light can be piped around corners like
water is in the conventional iron pipe;
and it is conceivable that this may some
day revolutionize the familiar lighting
systems seen nowadays.
If it were not for plastics, the air-
planes, automobiles, trains, and numer-
ous other conveniences of today could
not operate with the reliability and
efficiency we have come to expect of
them. People now eat, drink, listen to
their radios, shave, see, telephone, play
their phonographs, cook their meals, and
do innumerable other things with the
aid of plastics. It is impossible here to
give a lengthy account of all the uses
and future possibilities of plastics, but
this short sketch should make it ap-
parent that these new and interesting
products have established themselves
among the more important engineering
materials.

L\ST fall there was formed in the
'College of Engineering of the Uni-
versity of Michigan an Engineering
Committee on Professional Practice. Un-
der the auspices of this committee
weekly parleys were held to which some
twenty or twenty-five different students
were invited, to discuss problems which
have been encountered by experiencd
engineers. During this year these parleys
will be continued along the same lines
by the committee, the student members
of which are H. R. Steding, Joseph
Dieppenbrock, Robert Herman, and
Wade Flaherty. Several men prominent
in their fields of specialization have
agreed to spend an evening in Ann Ar-
bor with interested groups. These con-
tacts should prove immensely valuable,
and those who are asked are really for-
tunate. At present it is beyond the re-
sources of the committee to bring about
even half the contacts they desire.
Last fall Daniel W. Mead spoke here
on Engineering Ethics, and again this
fall a talk to all engineering students
and the public will be sponsored, with
Louis C. Fisk, '14M.E., as speaker.
While attending the University, Mr.
Fisk was a member of Tau Beta Pi, the
financial committee of the Senior class,
and Hermitage Fraternity. He is now
associated with the Hyatt Bearings Di-
vision of the General Motors Sales Cor-
poration at Harrison, New Jersey. Hav-
ing had many years of experience in
making contacts through sales work,
he is well aware of the economic pres-
sures and temptations that are often
brought to bear on the young engineer.
This, combined with a keen sense of
humor and sympathy for and sincere
interest in his younger fellow engineers,
will make his discussion of employer,
employee, and customer relations to-
gether with the art of making contacts
of real value to all of us, especially Me-
chanical and Industrial Engineering stu-
dents.
Finally, the committee, in the pages
of the Michigan Technic, will each
month present a problem in Professional
Practice, with a five dollar award for the
best written solution. This month's an-
swers should be addressed to the "Con-
test Editor," Michigan Technic, 3036
East Engineering Building, Ann Arbor,
Michigan, and postmarked not later
than October 25. They will be judged by
a faculty board. The winner will be an-
nounced, and letters meeting the ap-
proval of the Technic Editors will be

Louis C. Fisk
He is well aware of
the temptations
published, in a later issue. The first
one finds a young fellow, for the pur-
pose of the problem, you, in the not too
distant future, faced with a situation
vitally affecting his career.
Many companies hesitate or refuse to
hire young engineers since every new-
man constitutes an investment and must
be utilized and promoted to the best of
his capacities or else the firm is not
getting its money's worth or the young
man a fair deal. A boom followed by a
depression may result in the inability
of a firm to digest a large group of high-
grade potential executives hired in an
era of prosperity. If, then, a well quali-
fied young engineer is hired he may
expect to be shifted about and promoted
over a number of less trained men. Of
course, this is not agreeable to these
men, who may employ devices to dis-
credit and irritate the neophyte.
You feel most fortunate, after having
been interviewed several times, to be

pany. Their plan is to use you about the
plant where you may keep your eyes
open, frequently shifting you around,
but never putting you in a training
school. Your first assignment is in the
shipping room nailing up boxes. The
printed instructions are clear and it is
obvious that this method will give the
strongest box. Since your skill is not
great, you strike your finger often, and
once drop a box which nearly smashes
your partner's toe. After he has ex-
hausted his vocabulary, he nicknames
you "Bonehead," and persists in calling
you that on every occasion. Soon you
begin to realize that, while he is not
rushing you, his methods of box fabrica-
tion are not sound, and for some reason
he is not following the instructions
exactly.
The unfair nickname may stick, and
accompanying prejudice may hinder
your progress. Yet if you squeal or com-
plain you lose the friendship of the men
and possibly the respect of the boss. If
the inspector rejects your container, the
fault probably will be charged to the
new man—you. It will be necessary to
act quickly to correct what may become
an intolerable situation. What will you
do?
As insulation for various types of
electrical machinery fibrous glass is be-
ing used principally when it makes poss-
ible more compactness, savings in
weight, or reduced cost for a given out-
put rating. Higher temperature opera-
tion and the possibility of using thinner
insulation walls account for this.
The operating temperatures of motors
insulated with glass can be raised some-
what higher than the conventional range
due to the heat-resistant properties of
the fibers. This means greater output
for a given size machine, which is very
desirable in certain lines where space
and weight savings are important. How-
ever, in most cases, the entire machine
must be redesigned in order to bring all
the parts up to the higher heat require-
ments and allow for various other ad-
justments. Such redesigned motors have
been made as much as 15 per cent
smaller than conventional models with
the same output rating. Space savings,
greatest on the smaller models, become
less as the horsepower gets larger.
Even larger reductions in space can
be gained on machines which must be
operated at high temperatures due to
their location or possibly because of
overloads. Glass in such cases may be
used to replace the older and more
bulky heat-resistant materials such as
asbestos. Since the space factor of the
glass is about half that of asbestos tape,
these redesigned motors may be re-
duced a great deal in size, sometimes
as much as 30 to 35 per cent. In trans-
portation machinery, space savings are
very important and fibrous glass is
being increasingly used for railway and
other transport motors. Heat-resistant
insulation is needed in these machines
because of the frequent overloads.
In all cases glass is being employed
only when its special advantages offset
any additional cost involved. That it
has such advantages is shown by its in-
creasing use for a wide variety of pur-
poses. As varnishes are developed to
measure up to the thermal properties of
glass, we may expect to see further
electrical uses for this superior heat-
resistant material, ^i,

On page two of the Special Announce-
ment one reads, "Numbers below 100
indicate East Hall," and Freshman,
Esquire, is thus introduced to the ugly
duckling of the engineering family. Soon
thereafter he enters the portals of the
decrepit structure to attend his first
class in English 1 or perhaps Math 3.
After wandering through a maze of
narrow passages and inter-connected
class rooms, he perhaps comes to a door
on which are inscribed the desired
numerals, where he is safe till it is time
to go out. Then if he is particularly un-
lucky he will fall into a trap set by Pro-
fessor Brackett, who has very cunningly
established his office right on the spot
where even a wondering Freshman is
sure the door to the Great Outdoors
and Freedom is located.
For the statistics department, the
Hall has a capacity of 279,573 cubic
feet, and a floor area of 20,194 square
feet. The building was constructed in
1883 as a city school. (The name "Tap-

the grade school pupils until 1922, when

part of the city for old Tappan School
and a fire hall located on what is now
the parking lot just north of the East
Engineering Building. The fire hall was
torn down, and East Hall remodeled.
Several of the class rooms were con-
sidered to be too large, so they were
partitioned off into sizes more suitable
for work of university caliber. In addi-
tion the building was connected up with
university light and heating systems.
For the future, there is a plan—as there
are so many other plans—for a building
very similar in design to the East Engi-
neering.
There are all sorts of rumors about
the old landmark. Many cubic feet of
the basement are completely blocked
off from curiosity satisfiers. In the dis-
used belfry live pigeons who are said
to be descended from those who per-
formed heroic messenger service in in-
tra-campus battles of former years. Di-
rectly under the north entrance-way
there is a large cistern. Nobody seems
to know the reason for its existence, but
it has been suggested that a trap-door
in the floor would furnish excellent fa-
cilities for such ceremonies as baptisms
or sacrifices to the engineering gods.
free book
Those of you who were here last year
will remember that a series of functional
articles were published in the Technic.
It was the purpose of these articles to
give a picture of the different types of
work encountered in engineering in or-
der to help students select that type of
work for which they are most fitted.
So much interest was aroused by the
series that it has been republished in
book form by the College of Engineering
under the title Engineering: A Projes-
sion. A copy of this book is free to every
inquiring student. In order to secure it
merely call at the Technic office, 3036
East Engineering Building, and present
your identification card. The card will
be stamped and a copy of the book given
to you.
Anyone not enrolled as an engineer-
ing student may have a copy at cost,
twenty-five cents. The Technic will
pay postage to mail copies.
In an early issue there will be a debate
between Frank Lloyd Wright and Wil-
liam B. Stout on Architecture vs. Engi-
neering.

bob goodyear
Most thankless of all the top posi-
tions in the Engineering College is that
of Chairman of the Honor Council.
Holding the job this year is a modest
Detroiter well content to carry on his
work unsung.
No Michigan man by birth, Robert
Joseph Goodyear was born in Lowell,
Massachusetts, has since lived in Bel-
gium, England, Germany, and Spring-
field, Ohio. His principle pleasure re-
garding his four year sojourn in Europe
is the fact that it ended six years ago.
Entering the University of Michigan
in the fall of 1936, Bob became finan-
cial chairman of the Frosh Frolic, a
tryout for the Gargoyle, and a member
of Beta Theta Pi. He thought better
of his Gargoyle experience, however, and
soon transferred his allegiance to the
Interfraternity Council. Here he re-
mained until last spring, when what he
calls "a very good man-' nosed him out.
Becoming a member of the Honor
Council when a sophomore, Bob suc-
ceeded to the chairmanship a year ago.

Bob Goodyear
He didn't know his name
During last fall's turbulent political
changes he kept the Council functioning
smoothly until it had settled safely to
rest under the wing of the revised En-
gineering Council, but he insists that
much of the credit should go to Pro-
fessor Axel Marin and Vulcans.
Speaking of the Honor System, Bob
said that its success depends more on
the students' attitude and their coopera-
tion than any other factors, and he
expressed his opinion of it as succinctly
as we have ever heard it put. "It is," he
said, "a good thing."
A member of Vulcans and Scabbard
and Blade, Bob will graduate in June
with a degree in Mechanical Engineer-
ing. When he does he may leave behind
him a well organized and efficient Honor
Council, but he will take with him the
memory of one harrowing experience.
Upperclassmen will remember the
Frosh-Soph fracas in 1937 in which the
new dormitories were nearly wrecked. As
the battle neared its climax, Bob rose
up out of a sea of mud, holding to the
few shreds of clothing which still clung
to his body and shook off the freshmen
that surrounded him. Someone tapped
him on the shoulder and he turned to
find the President and two burly guards
glaring at him. Almost bursting with
rage, the irate President demanded our
hero's name.
Meekly he replied that he did not
know.
professor katz
Vocation: petroleum; avocation:
children. See if you do not agree with us
that those four words do summarize, if
somewhat inadequately, the career to
date of Donald La Verne Katz.
Born in the summer of 1907 in Jack-
son County, Professor Katz attended the
rural elementary school and then Jack-
son High, coming to Michigan to take
up chemical engineering in 1927, after
working a year in a stamping mill. He
supported himself through school, hold-
ing a board job in a downtown lunch
room, operating a screw machine during
his first summer vacation, and serving
as an assistant in chemistry during his
junior year and in chem engineering
during the following three years. For
student Katz knew almost from the start
that he would not be satisfied with any-
thing less than a Ph.D. Meanwhile the
midnight oil was burning to the tune of
three scholarship awards and election to
just about all possible scholastic honor-
ary societies.
In his first year of graduate work, he
began a very valuable association with
Prof. G. G. Brown by assisting him dur-
ing an oil refining case of considerable

legal historical importance. After re-
ceiving a doctors degree in 1933, he went
to work as research engineer for the
Phillips Petroleum Company and was
fortunate in being able to continue along
the same line as that of his thesis: in-
vestigation of the properties of oil and
gas mixtures under high pressure. While
in the Oklahoma oil fields he developed
a field unit for testing wells. In 1936
he was invited to join the University
faculty, and continued research into the
characteristics of crude oil, natural gas,
and related subjects, sometimes working
independently and sometimes assisting
Professor Brown. During these years
Professor Katz has written, or assisted
in the writing of, several papers con-
cerned with his field; has been actively
associated with the A. I. Ch. E. and the
petroleum divisions of the A.C.S. and
the A.I.M.E.; and has held the chair-
manship of the Subsurface Sampling
Subcommittee of the A.P.I. The last
few months he has been working on a
textbook dealing with engineering prop-
erties of the hydrocarbons.
When questioned as to hobbies, Pro-
fessor Katz tells about his two young
children, but further inquiry shows that
his interest in "children" (both young
and old) goes much further than that,
for he is secretary-treasurer of Junior
Research, faculty advisor to the student
branch of the A.I.Ch.E., a member of
faculty advisory board to Tau Beta Pi,
and superintendent of the Sunday
School at the First Methodist Church.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


If this were an obituary, it would
read thus: "Carl Wheeler was born in
Western Springs, Illinois and was grad-
uated from La Grange High School in
1936. In the fall of the same year he
entered the University of Michigan as
a freshman in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, from which he
transferred to the College of Engineering
the following year. Carl was active in
athletics—football and baseball—and
was president of Delta Tau Delta. He
leaves behind him a summer job at the
Union, an enthusiastic liking for Michi-
gan, and the senior football manager-
ship." But that is neither here nor there,
for this isn't an obituary, and besides,
these aren't the most interesting facts
about Carl Wheeler.
Carl, who was president of Triangles,
now heads Vulcans and is a member of
Michigamua. He was rushing chairman
of his fraternity before becoming vice
president and finally president of it, is
president of the Men's Judiciary Coun-
cil, a member of the Board of Directors
of the Bureau of Student Cooperation,
and still complains that he can't get
into enough things. He believes that
there are too many senior activities in
existence here, and because he can't be

Carl Wheeler
Stands on the sidelines
in all of them, he stands on the side-
lines and learns as much as possible by
just watching.
This enthusiasm and spirit wasn't
born at Michigan. During his high school
career, Carl managed to make the foot-
ball and baseball teams, to figure in
class plays, become editor of the senior
year-book, and to be elected to the Na-
tional Honor Society. Quite a versatile
lad!
Carl claims that three conflicting at-
titudes prevail at Michigan: the one of
the fraternity men (brotherhood is the
keystone of their existence); the "deter-
mined-to-get-an-education" spirit of the
tray jugglers at the Union; and lastly
but not leastly, Joe Football's outlook—
athletics, first, last, and always. Being
in a position to judge, our hero ventures
to opine that most fraternity men don't
know what it is to work, and most
Independents can't appreciate the sig-
nificance of brotherhood .... which just
about ties the score, as far as he is con-
cerned.
For a fellow who is having such a
"helluva swell time at collitch," Carl
does all right in the way of scholastic
achievements. He believes in the theory,
"Too many women spoil the works," and
spends his Friday nights studying. All
of which adds up to the sum total of
his ambitions: marriage to the girl back
home, and success in the lumber and
pulp industry.

GEORGE Bernard Shaw is credited
with the rather unorthadox ques-
tion, "What is greater than pride?"
While pride is ordinarily considered one
of the baser emotions, we cannot help
but admit that when it is justified the
old cynic may be right.
We have in our College an honor sys-
tem which is a source of much pride to
us. In the many years since its establish-
ment we have shouted from the house-
tops about its successful operation. We
have pointed out gleefully that those
professors who most bitterly opposed
its adoption have remained to become
its strongest champions, and the stu-
dents who fostered it can afford to settle
back, and contemplate a job well done.
But it is a fundamental error to trans-
fer an idealistic concept of a system to
an idealistic concept of the individuals
that make up that system. Unfortun-
ately it cannot be done.
Much as we dislike admitting it, there
are some students who are not only will-
ing but eager to take advantage of the
THIS is Open House year. By cus-
tom, in alternate years, the College
of Engineering throws open its doors
and places itself upon display. The
Open House entails a great deal of
work for everyone connected with it, at-
tracts much attention, and plays a help-
ful part in maintaining the high reputa-
tion of the College.
This spring—1940—is an ideal year
for an open house. It offers a logical
vantage point from which to review
Michigan's growth and development, her
work, and her contributions to this first
stage of the twentieth century.
Unfortunately, the Open House has
not always been all that it should be.
Once this was largely due to poor or-
opportunities which an honor system
offers. The students who formulated
the plan realized this and so the Student
Honor Committee was set up to deal
smoothly, quietly, and effectively with
offenders.
The system's weak link is not its
basic theory; it is not the Honor Com-
mittee; it is not the offender. It is rather

dents who would not think of violating

ganization on the part of the student
group which sponsored it. We now have
a strong, well-organized Engineering
Council that should, with the benefit of
the experience they gained two years ago,
be able to put on one of the smoothest-
running, most impressive Open Houses
ever presented.
Without doubt one of the principle
causes of trouble in previous years has
been the fact that the Open House has
been of too short duration. Normally
students from a considerable number of
high schools, parents and friends of
nearly all the students, and a surprising
numberof engineers and industrialists
endeavor to see the exhibits. It is im-
possible to expect so many people to be
the code, but who would not think of
reporting a violation either.
The enduring success of any honor
system must depend upon the strength-
ening of this link. We see a man cheat-
ing on an examination and we hesitate
to report him. We think that it is pride
that restrains us; that we are proud of
not being known as a bearer of tales,
and we say nothing.
We are wrong. It is not pride; it is
cowardice. We are afraid of what people
will think of us; of what people will say
about us if we report an offender.
We must be proud instead. We must
be proud to be a part of the honor
system. We must be proud that it is a
part of us. Its success hinges upon our
being so proud of it that our natural
cowardice is overcome and we are not
afraid to report an offender, in order
that the system may remain unstained.
Remember this, and be proud of
your honor system; be proud of your
pride! Perhaps Shaw is right. What is
greater? ^
able to see the demonstrations properly,
and to expect the guides to function
smoothly, if all the guests are to be
crammed through in just a few hours.
Then too, exhibitors are not so easily
persuaded to put forth their best efforts
when the exhibition period is too short
to be of real value to them.
Weeks of careful planning go into the
organization of the Engineering Open
House. It seems just and right that it
should be open to the public at least
from Friday noon through Saturday
night. If this extension of time is
permitted we believe that the Open
House will make a much better impres-
sion upon the thousands of visitors it
will attract. Aft,

ENTERTAINING ROYALTY-
BY PROXY
WHEN Great Britain's King and Queen visited the
New York World's Fair on their international social
call, 20 farmers were able to watch the royal pair as
closely as it they were entertaining Their Majesties out
on the farm. And the rural folk were 130 miles away
from the Fair grounds.
This long-distance watching was made possible by G-E
television engineers. Directed by C. A. Priest, Maine '25 and
ex-Test man, radio engineer for General Electric, they were
simply proving that television programs could sometimes
be received at a far greater distance than the previously
supposed limit of 40 to 50 miles.
For, instantly and clearly, while the King and Queen in-
spected the Fair, television reproduced complete details of
their visit to the group—130 miles away, atop the Helder-
berg Hills near Schenectady. Not tar from the scene ot this
experiment is General Electric's powerful new television
station, W2XB, soon to go on the air.

TECHNICAL DOUBLE TALK
WALKING through one of General Electric's factory
buildings, a visitor paused in front of two young
men kneeling in front of an electric motor. He was mystified
to hear, "Say, Bill, put a tac on that BTA, and aftn
you've hooked up the pots and c-t's and plugged power,
see if she still swings and hunts!"
All of which made as much sense to the visitor as "gate,"
"jive," "alligator," and similar swing-music terms mean
to a symphony conductor. Translated, the young man was
merely asking his co-worker to connect certain instruments
to the motor, turn on the power, and notice whether rh&lt;
motor ran smoothly.
Few of the graduate engineers selected by General Electric
for its Test Course are familiar with this Test man's
jargon when they arrive. But after a few days in the
shops the new man, too, is rattling away in the technical
double talk as expertly as his elders.

TRAVELING HOTEL
NEXT Spring, when a hotel-on-wheels rolls into Bom-
bay, India, some of the citizenry may have grave
doubts about their sanity. Or they may blame the blazing
tropical sun. They'll be wrong. Lawrence Thaw's trans-
Asiatic motorcade will be completing a 14,000-mile safari
from Paris.
Quite obviously, such things as 14,000-mile trips require
quite a bit more than savoir-faire and an adventure-
some spirit. Preparation, and plenty ot it, was required by
Mr. Thaw. This brought into the picture—both directly
and indirectly—G-E engineers.
The four mobile units of the motorcade boast of the latest
G-E two-way radio, for maintaining contact between the
various vehicles throughout the journey. During tests two
of the units maintained contact when as far as 200 miles
apart. Air conditioned throughout, the deluxe trailer con-
tains all the appliances and equipment normally found in a
modern home—from tiled bath and indirect lighting to an
array of electric appliances.

A smell of smoke, a burst of flame—and instinc-
tively you rush to your telephone for help.
Bell Telephone service is reliable for two reasons.
The people who provide it are capable. The equip-
ment is well made—Western Electric's part.
At your command is a vast plant—underground,
overhead and in central offices—which responds so
smoothly that you take it for granted.
It does so because into the production of the
43,000 different items entering into this plant have
gone careful thought and skilled workmanship.
That's been Western Electric practice throughout 57
years of telephone making.

Count on a Bell Telephone switchboard loo, and all the rert
of the complex apparatus. Here is shown one of hundred* of

With the advent of air-conditioning as well as the insulation of dwellings, the effect of windows
on the transfer of heat inward in the summertime and outward in the wintertime has become very im-
portant, with the result that manufacturers having equipment related to window openings have had
to carry on researches involving their products.
The picture shows some of the equipment which was used in determining the character of heat
flow through single and double windows. With this set-up, data were secured on the relation between
outside temperature, inside temperature, and humidity at which condensation of moisture on the
window occurs, and on other factors equally important.
This is characteristic of a type of service which the Department of Engineering Research is
prepared to render to the sponsors of a research project.

HIGGINS brings you a new stopper
for your greater convenience
This improved quill stopper has been adopted for the famous
Higgins Drawing Ink desk bottle to add to its convenience
and safety. Its several new features are as follows:
1 Shoulder ridges make stopper easy to grip for turningto remove
from bottle neck and prevent rolling when stopper is placed
on a sloping drawing table.
2 Stopper is weighted so it always rests with point of quill up.
3 Flat side on steeple provides a thumb rest which is so arranged
that open face of quill is always uppermost when thumb is
placed upon it, thus guarding against spilling.
4 Quills are genuine feather quills which will not splinter or
break and are just right to take up enough ink for one filling
of ruling pen.
5 Large cork makes possible bottle neck wide enough to admit
freely lettering pen or brush.
New stoppers and empty bottles may be purchased from your College Store or Stationer

the first picture listed below does give one ideas.
Nov 16-18, Dust Be My Destiny; 19-22, Mr.
Smith Coes to Washington: the film that is an
obvious take-off on Mr. Deeds (with a little
patriotism thrown in to match the trend of the
times), and yet, according to advance reports,
even surpasses its predecessor, 26-29, The Marx
Brothers at the Circus.
Majestic—We forgot to tell you last month
that they had done some redecorating on the
interior during the summer. The theater now
lives up to all that its name implies, and takes
its place with the five top-ranking showhouses
of the village
Wuerth and Orpheum are still operating
Anyone who has any information pertaining to
what happened to Dick Tracy after the lumber
pile fell on his unconscious, prone, and inert
body, please communicate with the party sitting
next to the record machine in Starbucks, who was
so busy listening to Over the Rainbow that he
forgot to walk across the street and so missed
the last chapter. Thanks. For more specific pro-

"To the late 4/enttf (2lay -Ondetion,
"Peart off the @olleye ojj £nyinaetlnq,
This &lt;Jn ue is dedicated.
Henry Clay Anderson, son of Mr. and Mrs.
John Ccrry Anderson, was born at Morganfield,
Kentucky, on Dec. 4, 1872. He attended Morgan-
field Academy, and the Academy of Kentucky
State College, at Lexington. He entered the Uni-
versity of Kentucky in 1893, and graduated with
the degree of Bachelor of Mechanical Engineer-
ing in 1897.
He spent two years as assistant master me-
chanic for the Cincinnati, New Orleans and
Texas Railroad at Chattanooga, Tennessee. After
this experience, he joined the University of
Michigan as an instructor of Mechanical En-
gineering. In 1903 he was made a junior pro-
fessor, in 1906, an assistant professor, and in
1912 he reached the status of full professor. In
1917 he was chosen to head the Department
of Mechanical Engineering, and remained in this
position until he succeeded Herbert C. Sadler
as Dean of the College of Engineering in 1937.
For many years Dean Anderson had served
on the Board in Control of Physical Education,
and on the Boards of Covernors of the Michigan
Union and, more recently, of Men's Residence
Halls. In 1934, he was appointed Director of
Student-Alumni Relations.
Dean Anderson's achievements had been re-
cognized by many professional and honorary
societies. He was a member of the American
Electric Railway Association, the American So-
ciety of Mechanical Engineers, the Society for
the Promotion of Engineering Education, the
Detroit Engineering Society, and the Ann Arbor
Engineers' Club. Honorary societies to which he
belonged included Sigma Xi, Tau Beta Pi, and
Phi Kappa Phi. He was a member of Sigma Chi
fraternity, and of the Detroit Athletic Club, the
Barton Hills Country Club, and the Ann Arbor
Rotary Club.
Beyond University walls, also, he was quite
widely known. For a number of years he was a
member of a consulting engineering firm; he
was responsible for the design of many power
plants, and headed numerous appraisals of public
utilities and railroads. In 1935 Governor Fitz-
gerald appointed him to a commission to promote
the use of Michigan-mined coals in public in-
stitutions, and in 1937 Governor Murphy placed
him on the State Board for the Registration of
Architects, Professional Engineers, and Land
Surveyors.
Dean Anderson was always liked by anyone
who came in contact with him. His popularity
was typified by his election as an Honorary
Sachem of the Tribe of Michigamua, in 1932,
and by the fact that he was awarded the "Spoof
uncup" at the A. S. M. E. Roast Banquet two
years ago.
His death was the result of a heart attack,
and occurred at his home while he was listening
to the broadcast of the Michigan-Iowa football
game, on Oct. 14, 1939. He is survived by a
daughter, Mrs. Harley A. Haynes. jr., of Akron,
Ohio; a son, john C. Anderson, of Saginaw,
Michigan, and two grandchildren, Harley Ander-
son Haynes and Virginia Crane Anderson.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


&amp;5 D Knew -f/im
By
DEAN EMERITUS MORTIMER E. COOLEY
as told to J. Anderson Ashburn, '40E
THE October sun was bright as we
sat down in the vaulted living room.
Dean-Emeritus Cooley thoughtfully
rolled a cigar between his fingers and
applied a match carefully to the end.
He settled back in his rocker and
watched the smoke wreathe upward.
"Anderson was in mechanical engi-
neering with me," he began. "I remem-
ber in 1900 I was called to appraise all
the state utilities and Anderson was
assigned to the locomotive division of
the railways. That was only a year after
he had joined the faculty, but he was
very thorough about it and did a mas-
terful job.
"He was always connected with the
appraisals we made during the next
twenty years, and when finally I re-
tired from the work, he took it over.
I doubt if we ever had a faculty man
with a personality to equal his. Ander-
son became very well known because of
this and was practically worshipped by
the New Jersey Service Commission for
whom he did quite a bit of work."
The square patch of sunlight which
fell full upon the carpet had moved
a bit toward the far wall. Dean Cooley
paused to light his cigar again and then
turned his thoughts into another chan-
nel.
"The Dean was a Kentucky gentle-
man first, last, and always," he con-
tinued. "You know better than I how
resourceful, how comforting, how stim-
ulating he was to his students. There
wasn't a student who, once before An-
derson, wouldn't feel free to open his
heart to the Dean. They looked upon
him as a sort of father confessor.
"I never knew him to turn a student
down or to treat him unkindly. No
matter how busy he was, no matter how
much work was piled upon his desk,
he would push it aside to talk to a stu-
dent, and he never begrudged them the
time nor tried to hurry them through.
"I have never known anyone who did
as much for his students outside of his
classes. He stands out for these personal
contacts with the student body."
Cooley was silent for a time and the
room filled with a flood of memories—
memory of how he and I used to joke
about our names being the same and
how we told each other what a good
name it was; memory of that recent
afternoon when we sat and talked to-
gether and the cheery way his face lit
up when he spoke, and the friendly nod
and the "So glad you could drop in,"
as he said goodbye.
Like an echo to my own thoughts
came the words of Dean Cooley, "All
the old alumni knew him. 'Dear Old
Andy,' they used to call him. I suppose
no one on campus was ever more
universally beloved."
The patch of sunlight had reached the
far wall now, and the subdued glow of
sunset permeated the room. Cooley
puffed reflectively at his cigar.
"Anderson was on practically every
committee of importance on the campus,
and he was very faithful in his work. He
was an intensely practical man and
could take the beautifully visionary
ideas of some of the other committee
members and adapt them to work to-
ward a practical result. This made him
indispensable to any organization want-
ing to do anything a little different or
out of the ordinary. As a consequence,
he was snowed under with work all the
time.
"He never had a real show at being
Dean, for he was worked to death by
all the things he undertook. Yet he cer-
tainly left his mark upon those he came
in contact with, and they will not soon
forget him. In all the years that I
worked with him, I never knew him
through pride to defend a wrong idea."
The cigar had burned down near its
end now and Dean Cooley leaned over
to crush it out in the ash tray. Twilight
had gradually filled the room as he
spoke and deep shadows had crept out
of the corners.
"You could talk for a long time about
Dean Anderson," he concluded, "and
the things you would say would always
be alike. His was a personality that was
not complicated in any way. Curiously
enough, his qualities did not stand out
particularly. He was the sort of man
who fitted so perfectly into the picture,
who did his part so thoroughly and
carried on his work so efficiently, (hat
you didn't notice him. It was not until
he was taken out that you really began
to appreciate how valuable and impor-
tant a man he was."
The Dean walked slowly to the door
with me and we shook hands silently
in the gathering dusk. A light breeze
stirred the trees and a few golden-
tinted leaves broke their hold and
floated softly to rest upon the fresh
earth.

\ Review of the Miehi^an-Life Conference
Transportation of Tomorrow
CHARLES F. KETTERING, Vice
President in Charge of Research,
General Motors Corporation.
HEN you try to talk about the
future of anything, you are sort
of doing guess work. Nevertheless, I
think that in this great subject of trans-
portation, if we can get back and see
where it came from and the factors that
brought it up to where it is today, we
can take a running jump and do some
guessing.
For example, and T give this as an
alibi to show why I can't predict the
future, go back and analyze the concept
of transportation at the time Dunlop
developed the tire. His kid objected to
riding a bike on Belgian block roads,
and although Dunlop wasn't an engi-
neer, he took a rubber tube, wrapped
canvas around it, and made a tire
which worked. But the best engineering
minds gave 7824 reasons why you
couldn't ride on a pneumatic tire.
Five or ten years ago the farmer
would have said it was unheard of to
drive a tractor on pneumatic tires.
You remember the time when nobody
thought you could put them on a truck
—they wouldn't stand the load. If they
couldn't predict a simple thing like a
bag of wind, we can't project things
very far.
A few years ago, one of our execu-
tives said he didn't think we were using
the best system of gear design, and
suggested that we consult an eminent
European on the subject. After much
work we got from him the design of a
gear to transmit a hundred and ten
horsepower, and it weighed exactly one
hundred pounds more than the motor
car on which it was to go.
Today we are using stresses and
stress relationships that are unbeliev-
On November first the University of
Michigan and Life Magazine played host
to some two hundred research engineers,
scientists, and industrial leaders, for a
conference on New Technologies in
Transportation. The conference, which
lasted three days, was universally ad-
judged an outstanding success, and con-
stituted a pat on the back for those who
conceived and developed it, as well as
for everyone who contributed to it. The
University of Michigan and Life Maga-
zine can well be congratulated for an
exceptionally smooth and efficient han-
dling of a splendid idea.
In trying to cover the tremendous
scope of material which was presented,
the MICHICAN TECHNIC was tackling
a tremendous problem. In solving our
dilemma, we tried to select those arti-
cles which would present newest devel-
opments in the field of transportation,
would be of greatest reader interest, and
upon which the more recent issues of
the TECHNIC had not dwelt. We are
genuinely sorry that we had to omit so
many excellent papers, and that we of
necessity had to shorten drastically those
papers presented.
With this as a foreword, the TECH-
NIC is proud to present its version of
the Michigan-Life Conference on New
Technologies in Transportation.
able. I find that the only difficulty is
that we alloy into the raw materials too
many mental misconceptions. In our own
laboratories we tell the men to forget
anything they ever learned and take a
completely fresh start at their problems.
For instance, there was a certain al-
loy that you were supposed to be able
to use for loads up to a hundred and
fifty thousand pounds. We needed more
than that, so I called in our specialist
and said to him, "How high could you
go with this if you were shot if you
didn't?" Well, he thought about it for
a while and said perhaps we might get
three hundred. So we went to work—
and finally got six.
To get into this simple subject of
gears. We have books full of informa-
tion, but we can only guarantee one
thing. If you design a set of gears, they
will be noisy. Then what you do is put
in some vaseline and a little of this and
that and make up a nice lapsing base
and you wash all the mathematics out.
But there is nothing wrong with the
formulae.
What can you expect out of fuel?
That is one of the questions we have tn
answer. We don't know. There is
enough energy in a gallon of fuel to
drive a good automobile from here to
St. Louis, but you don't get that far
with it. We have a bunch of fatalists
called thermodynamics men who say
that we have gone just about as far as
you can go. We don't believe that at
all. We won't be limited to the funda-
mentals of combustion.
In lubrication there is a lot that can
be done. We don't know much about
friction. The other day a group of gen-
tlemen got to talking about this. I
rubbed my hands together and asked.
"Why don't they get cold when they are
rubbed?"
"That's friction," they said.
"What's friction?" I asked.
After half an hour's discussion on
10
THE MICHICAN TECHNIC


friction, we decided that the sum total
of the things we know about it is that
it's what makes your hands get warm
when you rub them together. If you
study anything, and see just how much
you know about it, you'll be rather sur-
prised. I am perfectly positive that I
don't know anything, and lean prove it.
All of these things have the funda-
mental growth curve. They start out
flat, turn up sharply in the middle, and
then level off at the top. For some rea-
son every generation thinks it is at the
top of the curve. It never occurs to us
that we may still be down at the bot-
tom. We can't believe that twenty years
ago good intelligent engineers thought
they had arrived at the top.
Look at fuels. You can't explain
what stops the knock without explain-
ing what makes the knock. The big re-
lationship between gasoline and diesel
engines is that they supplement each
other in the petroleum line. Everything
that makes a diesel engine run well
makes a gasoline engine run badly, but
they knock for the same reason.
How far we can go in the internal
combustion engine business depends on
how good a molecular physicist we are
going to have in the future. Specific ar-
rangements of atoms will determine
what degree of efficiency you can get
out of the chemical energy put in by
the sun a few million years ago.
If you analyze all of the factors that
make up transportation, we have no
way of seeing any limitations as to what
we can hope to do. Why, a few years
ago, we thought 120 miles an hour was
fast.
Now as for predictions, I should say
that almost whatever our imagination
is able to grasp, we can say will be the
transportation of the future. With the
high grade engineering and education
we have today, whatever the social and
economic conditions demand in the fu-
ture, is what your transportation sys-
tem will be.
Street Light Evaluator
KIRK M. REID, Engineering Depart-
ment, General Electric Company.
THE problem of providing safe see-
ing on streets and highways is
being attacked on two fronts—fixed
street and highway lighting and auto-
mobile headlighting. In the develop-
ment of both methods of lighting,
knowledge is first of all required of the
illumination needed for safe seeing. And
then we need to know something about
requisite factors of safety to insure
quick, certain seeing while driving.
Because seeing is such a complex
physiological and psychological func-
tion, any considerable body of quan-
titative information directly applicable
to the problem of safe driving has only
recently become available. There has
been a lack of instruments and tech-
niques adequate for such measure-
ments. Fortunately, we now have them.
A method has just recently been de-
vised giving a technically adequate
method of evaluating street lighting
installations in terms of net visibility.
An instrument called the Street Light-
ing Evaluator. exhibited for the first
time at the conference, is employed.
The Street Lighting Evaluator has
three parts. The first is a pavement bed
which is mounted over the head of a
test car. A simulated pavement sample
which duplicates the optical character-
istics of the actual street surface in
question is inserted in the pavement
bed. On the pavement sample is an
obstacle whose reflection factor is a
weighted average of pedestrian clothing
as determined by extensive experiments.
A photometric element incorporated in
the pavement bed permits readings of
the brightness of obstacle and pave-
ment at chosen points over the street.
The second part of the Street Light-
ing Evaluator is the glare collector,
which is mounted above the windshield.
The opening of the glare collector rep-
resents the field of view of an average
motorist in a representative car,

Whatever our imagination is able to grasp
based upon a study by one of the larg-
est car manufacturers. The light enter-
ing the glare collector strikes a "trans-
parent diffuser." The "transparent
diffuser" integrates the glare from the
street lamps in the field of view of the
driver in proportion to the interference
with vision. The glare collector includes
a photometer and a "periscope" which
brings the photometric test field down
where it can be seen by an observer
in the driver's position.
The third part of the Street Lighting
Evaluator is the control box, which is
located on the seat of the car beside
the driver. It contains the switches and
rheostats for controlling both photom-
eters, and also a means of recording
the three photometric readings auto-
matically on a calibrated card. These
readings can then be combined graph-
ically to obtain the visibility provided.
This new method of street lighting
evaluation has several uses. It makes
possible the design and application of
luminaires to obtain for each road con-
dition the maximum visibility per dollar
of total cost. It permits comparisons of
lighting systems of different character-
istics to give meaning to the oft-
repeated and heretofore loosely used,
I.E.S. Street Lighting Code phrase "the
most effective equipment used in the
most effective manner." It affords to
utility and civic officials a means of ap-
praising the relative effectiveness of dif-
ferent lighting installations and a
guide to future improvements. And it
enables the statisticians for the first
time to analyze traffic accident ex-
perience in relation to visibility, thus
building up what must become the
ultimate criterion of street lighting
practice.
Automotive Safety Glass
GEORGE B. WATKINS, Director of
Research, Libbey-Owens-Ford Com-
pany.
C AFETY glass used today in modern
transportation may be grouped in
two general classes: (1) laminated
safety glass and (2) heat-strengthened
or tempered safety glass. Laminated
safety glass, which is by far the most
widely used safety glass in this country,
may be defined as a composite structure
consisting of two lights of glass and an
interposed sheet of plastic or non-brittle
material. The safety features of lam-
inated safety glass depend solely upon
the plastic or strengthening layer placed
between and bonded to the two lights of
glass. The plastic and not the glass is
the safety element.
The plastic for laminated safety
glass should be stable to energies in the
form of light and heat, so that it would
remain clear and colorless throughout
its useful life and in addition have the
desirable thermoplastic characteristics
to insure safety features when exposed
to all kinds of weather conditions rang-
ing from sub-zero temperature in the
Northwest to tropical climates of the
South. Accordingly, research and de-
velopment work on plastic materials in-
vestigated the broad field of plastics,
including cellulose derivatives, and
natural and synthetic resins.
By the end of I°34 the investigation
and cooperative research of the glass
manufacturers, various chemical com-
panies, and plastic manufacturers had
progressed to the point where it could
be predicted with a fair degree of cer-
tainty that some form of vinyl resin
would eventually replace cellulose ace-
tate plastic as the interlayer for lam-
inated safety glass. Approximately
four years later, substantial quantities
of laminated safety glass were being
made with a vinyl derivative plastic,
referred to as Hi-Test plastic, and at
the present time the majority of all
laminated safety glass is being made
with this improved plastic material in
thicknesses of 0.015 inch.
The vinyl acetal resins, when plas-
ticized with the proper kind and
amount of plasticizer, have the remark-
able property of elongating under
relatively low stresses until their elastic
limit is reached, at which point ad-
ditional stress is necessary before the
plastic fails. The polyvinyl-butyr-acetal
plastic, or Hi-Test, will elongate ap-
proximately 300$. Consider this re-
markable elastic property and how it
might effect the safety properties of
laminated glass as compared to a more
rigid or less elastic plastic, such as
cellulose acetate or cellulose nitrate
plastic, when some object strikes the
laminated glass with sufficient force to
break the glass. If the plastic is of such
a character that it will stretch or elon-
gate, the force of kinetic energy of the
blow will be absorbed or reduced by the
amount of work required in bulging the
plastic. If on the contrary the plastic
material in the laminated glass is rigid
or less yielding, such as cellulose
acetate plastic, the glass under impact
will first crack, but due to the fact that
the plastic will not elongate or stretch
readily to allow the broken lamination
to bulge, the plastic will shear or fail,
permitting the impacting object to pass
through with possibly still dangerous
momentum.
12
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


vinyl acetal plastic laminations will
afford greater protection to the occu-
pants of the car from the standpoint
of possible injury when thrown against
the glass and also from impacting
objects from without, than safety glass
made with a more rigid plastic.
In the case of laminated glass the
opportunities for improvement are
very numerous, since we have the
broad field of plastics for research. In-
cluded in the field of plastics are the
many kinds and types of cellulose
derivatives, many yet to be developed
and many yet to be discovered. We
have the field of rubber, natural and
synthetic, as well as the many resins,
both natural and synthetic. Therefore,
the improvements that we may expect
in the future in laminated safety glass
are almost infinite and will be limited
only by limiting research and develop-
ment work.
Boundary Layer Phenomena
EDWARD A. STALKER,
University of Michigan.
BY boundary layer I refer to the very
thin layer of fluid adjacent to the
wing, so small in fact that the wake
behind the streamlined wing is of the
order of only 3% of the chord of the
wing. Yet in this narrow layer lies the
secret of the really successful airplane.
So let us examine its nature in a rather
elementary manner.
In Figure 1 is shown a wing subjected
to "wind-stream" and attention is di-
rected to a small mass of fluid at A. If
the fluid is inviscid, the particle moves
rearward in complete balance because
the pressure on the faces of the particles
are changing as well as the velocity.
These variations are orderly, however,
and follow Bernoulli's equation stating
that the sum of the static and dynamic
pressures are always equal.
The static pressures are unbalanced
as between the faces so that the net
force is toward the leading edge of the
wing. The force constituted by this
pressure is, however, just balanced by
the rearward momentum of the particle.
Suppose, however, that the momen-
tum has been quite completely de-
stroyed by the time the particle has
reached the position B. What will be
the behavior of this small mass? The
pressure distribution curve shows that
at B the mass is still subjected to pres-
sure difference on its face tending to
move the particle toward the leading
edge. That it actually stops and then
flows forward is a matter of experience,
readily shown in the wind tunnel.
It is well known that the failure of
the flow to follow the upper surface of
the wing is the cause of loss of con-
trolled rolling and the cause of spin.
Thus it is seen that the presence of
viscosity in the air destroys the pros-
pect of the lifting capacity continuing
to increase with increasing angle of at-
tack and limits the maximum lift coeffi-
cient to about 2 for moderate Reynolds
Numbers.
It is not, of course, possible to relieve
the air of its viscosity, but possibly
something equivalent to that might be
done and so restore the hope of achiev-
ing the inviscid fluid, which has a maxi-
mum lift coefficient or lifting capacity,
if you will, some ten times higher than
that of a plain wing. It may be postu-
lated that all the friction in the bound-
ary layer does is to destroy energy in
the flow, and that if this energy is
everywhere replaced at the original level
the equivalent of eliminating the fric-
tion has been achieved.
In some experiments before 1920,
Handley Page, in England, discovered
on an empirical basis that a slot

Figures 1 and 2
through a wing made possible an in-
crease in lifting capacity of some 50r/(.
It is now known that the function of
the slot is to add energy to the retarded
layer or the boundary layer and thereby
restrain the separation on the upper
surface of the wing. The slot converts
the pressure difference above and be-
low the wing into kinetic energy which
then is immediately available to impel
the boundary layer rearward.
The success of the Handley Page
wing suggested the possibility of blow-
ing mechanically out of a slot in the
upper surface. The production of lift
by this method was at first costly, but
now, in the light of present knowledge,
not unreasonably so, and further study
promises to make additional large size
reductions.
There is still another method of elim-
inating the boundary layer, and that is
by sucking it into the wing through
openings in the surface. Then the unre-
tarded air above the boundary layer is
continually brought down into proxim-
ity with the surface. This method is the
most economical of energy for the same
augmentation of lift. In the case of
wings particularly, the control of the
boundary layer will lead to astounding
changes in aircraft. If the lift coefficient
is increased three times, the landing
speed is reduced 42 percent, so a pres-
ent-day airplane landing at 50 miles per
hour will then land at 29 miles per
hour. If the lift is increased six times,
the landing speed is reduced to 20.S.
If this is too low a landing speed (and
a true still wind speed of 30 miles per
hour is said to be low enough) the wing
area may be reduced to increase the
speed. Also, some of the lifting capacity
can be reserved for adequate lateral
control. In air-carriers, the added lift
will be used in large part for increasing
the pay-load and improving control.
Boundary layer control is most easily
applied to thick and highly cambered
sections. In fact, a combination of
both enables one to realize the highest
lifts with a minimum of power. It is
the author's belief that thicker wings
can be and will be used in com-
mercial aircraft. In the past, thick wings
have been unduly maligned because no
correction was made for the sharply de-
fined ends of the test wing. The thick
wing was thus inadvertently charged
with added drag.
The need for efficient blowers for
boundary layer control suggests a study
of existing machines in the light of mod-
ern fluid and, in particular, of boundary
layer theory. For aeronautics the blow-
ers must be carefully designed, and they
must occupy a small space or at least
a space of small depth. Two types of
blowers are feasible, the propeller and
the centrifugal type. For this paper I

For television, a pose
will consider the latter only and point
out an application of boundary layer
control.
It is desirable to utilize the full
depth of the wing. The blower is com-
posed of an upper rotor, and a lower
one. The upper inducts air radially in-
ward, while the lower one discharges
radially outward. The upper rotates
relatively slowly but it is equipped with
blades having boundary layer control
exercised through slots, as a result of
which a large inward pressure is placed
on the fluid to impel it inwards against
the natural force outward. The air for
the slots is furnished by an inlet which
receives a high pressure flow from the
lower rotor.
Even from this brief outline of the
subject it should be evident that the
control of the boundary layer is certain
to play an important part wherever
fluids are flowing. In particular, the
role will be great in aircraft. For in-
stance it will:
1. Multiply the lift some six times,
and correspondingly reduce the landing
speed.
2. Provide lateral control under all
conditions.
3. Eliminate the deadly spin as an
involuntary maneuver.
4. Increase the high speed by reduc-
ing the wing area required.
5. Increase the payload several times
over.
6. By heating the air circulating
within the wing, prevent icing.
Reduction of Wind Drag
J. R. WESKE, Case School of
Applied Science.
\\ 7HILE experimenting with air-
*» flow through small openings, it
was discovered that a low pressure dis-
charge of air at right angles to the wind
stream produced a negative drag.
Working with this principle, attempts
were made to reduce wind drag due to
vertical surfaces by ejecting a stream of
air in front of the surface. In this way,
it was found possible to fill out the
streamline form with air to a point of
almost eighty percent efficiency. By
properly locating the discharge slots,
this may be further increased.
The air jet may be provided by the
engine exhaust if it is not too dirty and
does not distort vision too greatly when
used in front of windshields.
Replacing Internal Bracing
RALPH UPSON,
University of Michigan.
WE believe that structural weights
may be greatly reduced if internal
bracing can be replaced by internal air
pressure, as in non-rigid airships. The
pressure can probably be supplied auto-
matically by properly placed intake
jets.
For the purpose of determining
stresses in the preliminary experiments,
it has been found successful to fill an
inverted wing section with wa'er. By
tipping the wing to increase the pres-
sure on the leading edge, it is possible
very nearly to neutralize the stresses
encountered in actual flight. ^rK
Machined Finishes
D. A. WALLACE, President,
Chrysler Sales Corporation.
TN THE past we have had difficulty
in specifying surface finish. Engi-
neering departments refer to finishes
by the method of producing them,
such as turning, grinding, honing, lap-
ping, or the new method of superfinish-
ing. These terms can be placed on a
drawing, and are to a certain extent
informative. However, in the shop, men
have and understand only three kinds
of finishes. These finishes can only be
described in this manner—a good fin-
ish: a damned good finish; and a God-
damned good finish!
It does not matter in which shop
you are. A foreman will instruct a work-
man on a lathe or grinder that on the
part he is finishing, he desires one of
these types of finishes mentioned. At
the present state of the art, the follow-
ing methods are used to measure the
smoothness of surfaces: visual, touch,
microscopic, by photomicrograph, pho-
tomicrograph of profile, interference of
light, X-ray diffraction, and several
others. So there are several methods for
measuring surface smoothness, yet none
of them is "fool-proof"—that is, none
can be used universally and understood
by fellow engineers and all machine
shops. The measurement of surface
quality is still a wide open field and at
the present time the trend is not indi-
cated. It is very probable that ulti-
mately there will be no single method
for indicating smoothness, but perhaps
a combination of several methods in-
stead.
Perhaps foremost among the little
understood surface phenomena is fric-
tion. More recent work has shown that
plastic impacts occur between the mat-
ing surfaces.
Another characteristic of surfaces of
tremendous importance is that of wear.
There are two principal causes of wear
—abrasion and corrosion. Abrasion can
take place only in case of actual metal-
to-metal contact. On smooth bearing
surfaces having no asperities which can
puncture the oil film, thus causing
metal-to-metal contact, all wear is due
to corrosion. Since no lubricant has as
yet been developed which is free from
corrosive agents, this is a vital subject.
The actual causes of corrosion are
many and complex. The most important
are oxidation, electrolytic action due to
differences in electrical potential of the
various types of crystals in non-homo-
geneous materials, and purely chemical
actions. A smooth surface having less
exposed area is less subject to attack
from oxidation. Sharp ridges on a sur-
face, such as grinder marks, are at
higher electric potential than pits in the
surface. The result is an accelerated
rate of corrosion. Many experiments
have given conclusive evidence of this
fact.
Photomicrographs of ground surfaces
show a surface with characteristics veri-
similar to those of turned surfaces. The
scratch pitch and depth are usually less
14
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


surface. They also usually contain less
fragmented material, oxides, precipi-
tated carbides, and more smear metal
than turned surfaces.
Honed finishes give a cross-hatch
scratch pattern in the surface, and in
the developing of this pattern, a large
percentage of the defects previously
produced by the preliminary grinding or
boring operation can be removed.
The lapping method of producing
surfaces is one that has no commercial
possibilities in that the element of
skilled labor is a major factor in the
production of a good lapped surface:
and also, the length of time required
to lap properly a part would make the
cost of any production item prohibitive.
Lapped surfaces, however, are very
smooth, inasmuch as they are produced
at a relatively low speed and pressure,
and with varying degrees of multi-
motion, depending on the technique of
the operator.
The tool used in the superfinish proc-
ess is a bonded abrasive in which the
relatively coarse grits are firmly em-
bedded. Because of this, only the cut-
ting points of the grits are available
to remove material from the surface
being finished. The abrasive blocks are
always of such surface area that once
an abrasive grit has done its work it is
washed away and does not remain be-
tween the stone and the work, thus con-
tinually producing additional scratches.
These are made up in the sizes best
adapted to the work—large or small,
rectangular, square, curved, cupped; in
fact, any shape necessary to fit the job.
The motion of the abrasive over the
work is a complex combination of con-
tinually reversing short and long mo-
tions—about -J.i inch long. This per-
mits loose abrasive and metal to be
flushed out by the cutting fluid, thus
preventing built up edges. Since each
abrasive grit is always cutting in a
changing direction, the lubricating film
from the cutting fluid is continually re-
placed. The fluid is termed a lubricant
and not a coolant, because at the end
of the finishing cycle the glazed, bonded
abrasive surface and the work surface
have become smooth and the fluid has
sufficient viscosity actually to balance
the pressures between the work and
the abrasive.
Because of the lubricating action of
the fluid, the superfinishing process is
a controlled operation. With a definite

The resulting superfinished surface is
free from the peaks that other finishing
processes produce. In the process, the
peaks are removed but the small pits or
hollows remain. The effect of the pits
on potential differences at the surface is
negligible, so that a superfinished sur-
face is more resistant to corrosion, and
hence resistant to wear.
There is no more promising or active

New Applications of
Chromium Plating
DR. RICHARD M. WICK, Research
Engineer, Bethlehem Steel Company.
"DERHAPS as unexpected a develop-
*■ ment as any in the field of metal-
lurgy, is the application of heavy
chromium plating to bearings and
wearing surfaces. A clutch plate so
treated has been tested and found to
have much better endurance than ordi-
nary clutches. The somewhat low co-
efficient of friction of the chromium
plate is in some cases a disadvantage;
but in many cases it is a decided ad-
vantage.
Chromium plate has been applied to
pistons, cylinder walls and heads, etc.
At low temperatures it is not affected
by hydrocarbons or by lead tetraethyl.
There seems to be, however, a critical
temperature above which certain or-
ganic materials and carbon monoxide do
affect it. It has been found excellent for
live steam pistons and cylinder surfaces.
The hardness ranges from 600 to
1100 Brinnel Hardness Number, and
depends on factors such as the current
density and the temperature of the
plating solution. The most satisfactory
hardness is usually found to be around
825 BHN. Impact stresses will not
chip or crack the plating, even though

Causes of Rail Failures
HERBERT F. MOORE.
University of Illinois.
THE stepping up of railroad sched-
ules with the attendant strain upon
track has led to increased emphasis
upon the structural characteristics of
the rail itself. The stresses which track
will stand constitute a limiting factor
to what can be done towards increasing
wheel loads or speeds. Study of the
stresses, however, has lagged until very
recently because of the difficulty of de-
termining their value.
Extensive tests are now being made
both in the laboratory and under actual
service conditions to study the causes
of rail failure. The sensitive extensom-
eters used have shown that localized
stresses in rails reach values many times
those calculated by the usual formulae
of mechanics. Constant reversals of such
high stresses eventually start small
cracks, some of which develop into
failures.
Contrary to the opinions of many
railroad men, these recent tests are
showing that the most important factor
in causing rail failure is not the loco-
motive but the freight car. The much
greater number of car wheels that pass
over a rail make a consideration of
freight wheel loads all important. The
balancing of locomotive reciprocating
parts is less significant from a track
standpoint than improvements in freight
car design. Tests on track in service
have shown that one wheel out of every
500 or so causes stresses far larger than
usual. These high values are due prin-
cipally to out-of-round wheels, or soft
spots in the roadbed.
Reduction of Knock
W. C. LOVELL,
General Motors Research Division.
THE ideal fuel would be plentiful,
cheap, have great ease of evapora-
tion and freedom from knock. Since
1927 we have increased the efficiency of
our available fuel, gasoline, by cracking
processes. The results since that time
have been the raising of the octane num-
ber from 60 to 70 which gives at 40
miles per hour a 45c/&lt; increase in per-
formance factor and a 20'v increase in
economy. Yet we are still far from
eliminating the troublesome knock in
gasoline.
We have found that by cutting car-
bon atoms off the end of the seven car-
bon atom chain in the gasoline mole-
cule we can cut down knock, and this
method lowers the vaporization tempera-
ture. It is a much better procedure to
change the long string of carbon atoms

into the more balanced chunky mole-
cules, thus giving less knock and a
correspondingly higher octane number.
Another method is to change the double
bond position between the carbon atoms.
With the use of higher octane rating
gasolines we can increase the power
and economy of our engines, and make
better use of the higher compression
ratios and supercharging.
It is interesting to note that at present
a 100 octane ratio fuel has a delivery
cost of only 30'/^ more than a 70. In
the future we must devote more of our
efforts to fitting our fuels to our engines
and our engines to our fuels, to continue
the advances which have thus far been
made.
Plastics Symposium
THE over-enthusiasm of designers in
recent years has pushed plastics
into fields into which they never should
have gone. Plastics are not the cure-
all for all material problems, but they
do have many uses, and many more will
be found. Their present limitations
are the necessity for forming them
under great heat and pressure in heavy
steel molds, with the result that costs
are high and rate of production very
slow. The recent development of in-
jection molding has lowered costs some-
what.
Urea and formaldehyde react to
form a substance capable of taking
many forms and known as Urea For-
maldehyde plastic. This reaction may
be stopped during the manufacturing
at some intermediate point, depending
on the ultimate use, and the material
powdered and shipped to the consumer
who puts it in a mold and applies heat
and pressure. This plastic alone is not
very stable, but is made more satisfac-
tory by the addition of alpha cellulose.
Wood flour would be cheaper, but it is
necessary to use the purer cellulose so
that the color may be controlled and
duplicated. The cellulose combines
chemically with the plastic, losing it&gt;
identity, and contributing nothing to
the strength of the material.
A brand new development in the
Urea Formaldehyde plastic field is the
process of impregnating cotton cloth
with the plastic in the form of a syrup.
In this case the cellulose does not lose
its identity, and therefore adds strength
and, more important, elasticity—lack-
ing in plastics. The reaction proceeds
at room temperature in cheap wooden
molds, and may be speeded up greatly
by raising the temperature slightly.
Boats and canoes have been made,
using built up layers of this material,
which have stood up well under alter-
nate wetting and sun drying—probably
the severest treatment possible. This
plastic-impregnated cloth has great
potentialities as a building material,
since the size of sheet is almost unlim-
ited, it can be unrolled from a bolt for
various curved shapes, and it is fire-
proof and a good insulator. In Septem-
ber a small playhouse, 6'x6'x8', was
built at the University of Michigan
under the direction of Prof. D. W.
McCready, and so far has resisted the
rigorous and changeable Ann Arbor
weather.
Other plastics are finding uses in the
transportation and allied fields as
binders in laminated safety glass, and
as instrument panels, railway car win-
dow sills, buttons, illumination fixtures,
and insulation.
Oxidation of Oils
MERRELL R. FENSKE,
Pennsylvania State College.
IN RECENT years the oxidation
characteristics of motor oils have
become of increasing importance. In
general, this has been brought tbout by
16
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


resulting in increased speed and power.
For example, in automobile engines
made during the last ten years, com-
pression ratios have increased 38^,
engine speeds have increased 30%, and
the average horsepower has increased
70r/(. Several problems have arisen
which normally have not been charac-
terized as oxidation problems, but in
general they are all due to oxygen being
assimilated by the oil. As a result, the
oil changes from a hydrocarbon mix-
ture, whose properties and behavior are
relatively well known from a lubrica-
tion standpoint, to a much more com-
plicated and much less known mixture
containing oxygenated substances. It is
one thing for an engineer to design en-
gines to be lubricated by hydrocarbon
mixtures and for the petroleum refiner
to supply such mixtures as mineral oil,
but it is quite another thing to use this
engine with complicated, uncertain, and
ill-defined mixtures of oxygenated sub-
stances which result when oils have
been attacked by oxygen. It is now
known that sludging, ring-sticking, var-
nish formation, bearing corrosion, vis-
cosity increase, and acidity are basically
oxidation problems. If oxygen did not
attack the lubricating oil, such prob-
lems would be inconsequential. Based
on past experience it is reasonable to
assume that additional problems, each
hearing its own characteristic name,
will appear in the future. In view of
this, intensive studies on oxidation are
being made and will continue to be
made. Many future uses for lubricants
will be dependent upon the outcome of
these studies.
In general, oxidation problems are
accentuated in the lighter oils. Conse-
quently a much smaller number of the
above problems occurs in the heavier
grades of oils. Absorption of a given
amount of oxygen by a light oil will
cause a much greater percentage change
in its basic chemical composition than
if the same amount of oxygen were ab-
sorbed by a heavy oil. In other words,
the assimilation of a given amount of
oxygen causes the oil to change over to
the complex mixture of oxygenated sub-
stances to a much greater extent. Since
internal combustion engines are de-
signed to be lubricated with hydrocar-
bons, it is obvious that trouble may
occur when such substances are no
longer the lubricating fluid. If engines
had been designed in the past to oper-
ate with such oxygenated materials,
then many of the problems which have
now arisen would be non-existent. As
long as engines are designed to be lu-
bricated with hydrocarbons, it is impor-
tant to reduce or prevent the attack of
oil by oxygen.
It is now known that certain oil frac-
tions are anti-oxidants even though they
themselves in concentrated form are
quite readily oxidized. These are very
useful materials, for as a result it now
little is known. Enough is known, how-
ever, to demonstrate that these oxygen-
ated materials are responsible for the
problems which have been described
above.
There is no doubt that a great deal of
work needs to be done to afford a better
understanding of the chemistry of
lubricating oil and the chemical
changes that occur in the course of its
use in an engine. While there is a

The odd moments were well filled
appears possible to prepare clean oils.
By incorporating such fractions in op-
timum proportions viscosity increase
and acidity can be held at minimum
values simply because oxygen assimila-
tion has now been retarded. This is ob-
viously a desirable way to prepare oils
resistant to oxidation.
In general, in automotive and air-
plane lubrication, problems have not
arisen which are caused by the failure
of the oil to lubricate. As hydrocarbon
mixtures, their viscosity characteristics
are sufficiently well known so that
lighter oils arc being used where it was
first thought that heavier oils were nec-
essary. Problems and troubles have
arisen largely because the oil does not
persist as a hydrocarbon mixture, but
instead it changes at varying speeds and
degrees into a mixture containing com-
plex oxygenated substances about which
variety of chemical changes to be
studied, those concerned with oxidation
will become increasingly important. As
engine design progresses, the oxidation
characteristics of oils will rank with or
outrank such other problems as ease of
starting, oil consumption, volatility, car-
bon formation, etc. It should be noted
that some of these problems, namely,
ease of starting and oil consumption,
have been partially solved by changes
in automotive design. The need for
engine design that will reduce oil oxida-
tion can hardly be exaggerated. Oils
are organic substances, and in common
with all such materials they are sus-
ceptible to oxygen attack. It is obvious
that the oxidation products need
neither resemble nor serve the purpose
of the original substance any more than
the flue gas from a boiler resembles
the coal fed to it. ^

Just after one of those victorious
home football games of which we have
had such an epidemic this year, we
were trying to elbow our way into the
tunnel that leads off the gridiron. Most
of the band and a few of the last strag-
glers from the team had been caught in
the crowd and were struggling vainly
to get off the field.
We noticed that one of the tunnel
guards was taking a malicious delight
in swinging out right and left in his
attempts to stave off the crowd while
the band and team got through. One
rather tall, spare man made several
futile attempts to break through, but
was repulsed bodily, and the last time
with vicious force. At this the crowd
paused for a second while mayhem
kindled.

Then with cries of "Spare our coach,''
they trampled the burly guard to earth
and bore "Our Fritz" in triumph off
the field.
caps and carvings
Eventually we squeezed through as
well, and although somewhat the worse
for wear, joined the band for the tra-
ditional march back up to the campus.
The band members reversed their caps
as they have done after every home
victory for more years than anyone can
remember. Then as they reached State
Street they burst into "The Victors,''
and in triumph strutted up to the
campus.
The band has been going through this
traditional little ceremony rather fre-
quently of late, but we have yet to find
a Michigan Man who sees anything
monotonous in the procedure.
Which reminds us of a bit of tradi-
tion that has nearly passed into ob-
livion these past few years. We think
it's because of a misunderstanding, and
we'd like to clear it up.
No doubt you've often admired the
carved tables in the Union Taproom.
The Union admires them too, and wants
more of them. In fact, they've done
everything short of putting want-ads in
the paper for them.

The tables originally came from the
"Orient'' of "back to Joe's and the
Orient" fame. Students used to sit bull-
ing over a couple of beers, and go to
great pains to carve those works of art
that now grace our Union. However,
if you'll notice, there hasn't been a
scratch put on those tables in the past
ten years. Surely there are still some
artistic souls who would like to make
their mark in the world. So let's save
our Union's fast thinning hair. Haul
out that knife, and let's have a little
cutting up.

The ordeal is over again, and almost
forgotten.
We mean registration, of course. Sta-
tistics tell us that if all the registration
material and all the people connected
with the whole damned affair were laid
end to end, we would like to be present
with a steam roller. But one amusing
incident comes to mind.
We found one fellow who took our
bureaucratic University for somewhat
of a ride, however. His name is Man-
derson. Now Manderson came in the
M-Mav group which registered from
9:00-9:15 on Friday. But he had rea-
sons for wanting to get it over with. So
the resourceful fellow filled out his
name as ANDERSON which put him in
the A-Ao group which registered from
8:00-8:30 on Thursday. Safely past the
guards the simple process of inserting
M s before the rest of the name com-
pleted the card, and registration was
taken care of.

We certainly want to thank the Gar-

Now we hate to turn around and ask

him. A furrow creased his brow as he

SPECIFYING FOR
DEPENDABILITY PLUS
Failure in the motor crankshaft of a piece of fire fight-
ing equipment may mean the difference between a
small fire and a large one, even between life and death.
That is why a leading manufacturer chooses
Chrome-Molybdenum (SAE 4140) steel for this vital
part. It has the requisite strength and toughness. And.
most important, it has good fatigue strength to meet the
continually alternating loads which are characteristic
of crankshaft service.
Furthermore, the uniform response of this steel to
heat treatment assures the consistent qualities essen-
tial in volume production, while its comparative inex-
pensiveness and ready machineability in the heat
treated condition keep costs down.
Molybdenum steels and irons, industry's modern
materials, make production dollars go further in many
ways and help produce better products at lower cost.
Our booklet, "Molybdenum in Steel", containing a
great deal of practical data will be sent free on request

ON THE fine evening of October 6,
the student body of the University
of Michigan took a long step toward
putting its house in order. Sound and
effective student leadership returned to
the campus, as will be seen further
down in this account.
The Pep meeting had been held far
from the scene of former riots, with the
hope that the change of location would
dents. He may be self-appointed, at the
moment and on the spot; or he may
have been carefully selected by opera-
tion of machinery set up for the pur-
pose. In either case, his success is
measured by his following, and not by
whether his name is known, or whether
the results are socially desirable or so-
cially destructive.
Let a basketball game get into full

Fracas
Far from the scene of former riots
in itself prevent trouble. It did not.
Thousands of students left the meeting,
and, with a sure instinct for excitement,
went to town. Went to town under
whose leadership? Student leadership—
following the shouted urge of anony-
mous rabble rousers who always are
with us.
Are rabble rousers leaders? No
—if they get no following. Yes—if they
do. For some years now, the anonymous
rabble rouser has had his following here-
abouts. He has had his way on numer-
ous occasions. Riots after Pep meetings
furnish the most striking testimony to
this fact; but other incidents have
rounded out the story.
A student leader is one who leads stu-
swing. The home team is getting the
worst of it. A student, no doubt preju-
diced in favor of the home boys, con-
vinces himself that the referee is being
unfair. He appoints himself as an on-
the-spot student leader, and starts up
that damnable form of criticism—hiss-
ing the referee and the opposing team.
A second student, sitting nearby, tells
him in plain simple, direct language, to
close his yap. Here are two potential
student leaders. Which one gets the fol-
lowing? Which one did get it last year?
The first student got the following, and
the second one wasn't there. The referee
finally resorted to the rules, penalized
the home team, and Detroit papers duly
and prominently recorded the unsavory
story next day. (Note: When an insti-
tution presumes to exist for the purpose
of bettering somewhat the sorry lot of
humanity, and when it or its personnel
takes a major lurch in the opposite di-
rection, it is news—and it ought to be
printed.)
A thousand people pay out hard cash
to see a movie. Down in the protective
darkness of the audience, a student who
hasn't grown up yet and
probably never will, begins
to laugh his way through all
of the dramatically tense
moments. Perhaps he wants
to show that he is not
touched when others are, or
—perhaps a lot of things:
make your own guess. Does
he get a following? You
know the answer. And the
appreciation of a good film
is effectively ruined, time
after time, for thousands of
people (including students)
by that emotionally unstable
student who can't be his age,
who is already proving him-
self unfit to be in a univer-
sity, and who will continue
to discredit the university if
it ever makes the mistake of
handing him a degree. But,
when he gets a following, he
is a student leader. The
other fellow who might have
sat nearby, and might have
taken steps to end the dis-
turbance doesn't seem to
have been going to movies
and basketball games for the last six or
seven years.
But again, the other fellow seems to
be coming out of his shell. He came out
in most encouraging numbers on Octo-
ber 6, 1939. As we were saying in Para-
graph One, rabble-rousing student lead-
ers brought the boys to town. But when
they got there—to the spots where all
good riots used to be held—cheer lead-
ers and M-Club members were all over
the place. Plenty of excitement, a lot of
running around, traffic stopped here and
there, some bonfires started, and nobody
went home for quite some time—but no
riot. Cheer leaders and M-Club mem-
bers didn't go home either. They stuck

trolled the situation.
As far as we know, this is true of
every college and university: no Board
of Regents, no president, no faculty, no
police department, nor any combination
of these, has ever discovered a puncture-
proof formula or line of action, by which
college student bodies can be "kept
under control," be it a matter of in-
cipient disturbances in movies, or of
unsportsmanlike conduct at games, or
of large groups which may become riot-
ing mobs at the drop of a hat or a wrong
remark. As far as we know, no such
formula can be discovered. These things
are group phenomena, casual, changing,
varied, usually unpredictable, and not
subject to constant organization and
control. They arise in the group, and by
and large, can only be handled there and
by its own members. Student leadership,
good or bad, will happen. The bad kinds
are always present and ready for action.
Their incidence is a certainty. Good
student leadership is a thing deliberately
engaged in—by a man who has kept his
head, and who is willing to stick his
neck out, be identified, and take a stand.
October 6 marked the return of effec-
tive student leadership to this campus.
Let's have some more of it.

nicknames
There is a silent duel going on in the
College of Engineering now in which
the faculty and students have unwit-
tingly taken opposite sides. It is con-
cerned with the almost universal prac-
tice of referring to the College as the
"Engine School." This nickname is
looked upon with abhorrence by most
of the members of the faculty. To un-
derstand their attitude it is necessary to
trace back to the origin of the term.
When the College became an inde-
pendent unit of the University and the
engineer was beginning to come into his

Coach Crisler was a rookie, his coach, in
dressing him down once, yelled, "Who
do you think you are—Fritz Kreisler?"
The name stuck and today literally
thousands of students and alumni affec-
tionately refer to "Fritz" Crisler. Can
you conceive of any of them calling him
Mister Herbert O. Crisler?
One of our most popular professors
is A. D. Moore. Is there a student who
does not call him "A. D."? A. D. has no
objection because he recognizes it as an
indication that he has been accepted by
the students. It is at one and the same

own, the rivalry between the Lit School
and the College was considerably less
passive than it is today. Seeking a term
of the utmost derision to hang upon the
engineers, the students across the cam-
pus hit upon the appellation "Engine
School." That the inspiration was not a
brilliant one is evidenced by the fact
that it came at one time or another to
the students of practically every univer-
sity in America. Time passed and the
rivalry went the way of all traditions,
but the nickname stuck and received a
complete acceptance on the part of the
students.
Not so the faculty members. They
could not think of the term without re-
membering its origin, and to them the
use of it was akin to a slap in the face.

faculty efforts have been in vain.

of a respect that is not tainted with
shame. It is only in totalitarian states
that one never speaks familiarly of the
leaders.
This is exactly the place which the
term "Engine School" holds in the eyes
of the students. It is a term of endear-
ment, showing that they love and respect
their College. If we meet a student who
refers to the "Engineering College,"
then we can be pretty sure we have
found a student who does not like engi-
neering.
We are living in a streamlined age.

Much as we dislike talking about
ourselves, we feel impelled to inform
you that the Technic received four
awards at the recent Engineering Col-
lege Magazines Associated Convention.
They were: first place for the best stu-
dent-written articles, second place for
the best editorials, second place for the
best illustrations, and third place for
the best single student written article.
This swells to twenty the number of
awards which the Technic has re-
ceived since the beginning of the pres-
ent decade. Of these awards, five were
for the best all-around undergraduate
technical magazine. Your active cooper-
ation has enabled us to do this. Thanks,
and don't stop now.

PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE
EACH month the Engineering Com-
mittee on Professional Practice is
presenting, in these pages, a problem
which is typical of those faced by a
young engineer. The Committee offers
a five dollar award for the best written
solution to each problem. This month's
answers should be addressed to the
"Contest Editor," Michigan Technic,
3036 East Engineering Building, Ann
Arbor, Michigan, and postmarked not
later than November 30. They will be
judged by a faculty board. The winner
will be announced, and letters meeting
the approval of the Tf.chnic editors
will be published, in a later issue.
The problem:
After you have been out of college
for two years, during which time you
have obtained some high-grade experi-
ence in detailing and designing struc-
tural steel, you transfer to a small,
poorly organized fabricating concern.
You find that the concern has a contract
to fabricate the steel work for a large
church building. You lik'ewise find that
one member of the firm agreed with the
architect to have a structural design
made at the fabricating plant without
the knowledge of the client; this in view
of the fact that the architect had no
competent structural engineer in his
organization. The work was designed by
a poorly trained young man who made
it very heavy so as to feel sure that
it was safe. The member of the firm
then went over the design and increased
the thickness of all angles by one-eighth
of an inch and stepped up the weight
of all other structural shapes accord-
ingly. The architect's plans were made
and issued on this basis, and this was
the basis on which all other contractors
made their estimates.
When this concern made up its bid it
subtracted one-sixteenth of an inch from
the thickness of the material as shown
on the plans. It was therefore impossible
for any other fabricating concern to
present a comparable bid, since none
other knew about the excessive thick-
ness of the material.
The time had now arrived when it
was necessary to begin fabrication. Some
apprehension was felt by the manage-
ment about the competence of the origi-
nal designer, so you are called upon to
check the design. You find that it is so
excessively heavy that you recommend
a considerable reduction in the amount
of material to be used. This is done, and
the saving from the two increments of
weight, the first one made up of the re-
maining sixteenth inch thickness of
metal, and the second one the saving
which you are able to make due to your
superior ability as a designer, will now
appear as unfair profits for the fabricat-
ing concern.
Obviously this constitutes collusion
between the architect and the fabricat-
ing concern to obtain from the client
money for services and material which
are not rendered.
You have full knowledge of all that is
taking place.
What are you going to do?

Engineering Opportunities. Edited
by R. W. Clyne. Published by D.
Appleton-Century Company, New
York, 1939. 387 pages. $3.00.
This book might best be described as
a handbook which gives a detailed an-
swer to the question, "What is engi-
neering?"
In it, engineering is divided into
twenty-six fields, and each of these is
discussed in detail by some youthful
but prominent member of that field.
The average discussion presents a little
history, an analysis of what an engi-
neer does in that field, and concludes
with a discussion of probable future
developments .
As is to be expected, there is some
variance in the ability of the various
writers, but they are on the whole
clear and concise. Though the book is
primarily intended to help those who
24
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


gineering to select the branch they
would prefer to be in, it has a definite
reading value to those beyond the ca-
reer-seeking stage, in helping them find
the kind of jobs they would like.
This and the Technic's publica-
tion, Engineering: A Profession, which
tackles the field in a similar manner but
from a functional standpoint, form a
pretty comprehensive means of evalu-
ating the profession of engineering.
The serious student who is anxious
to fit as smoothly as possible into his
chosen field will find a study of this
book not only interesting, but well
worth while.
How to Write Better Business Let-
ters. By L .E. Frailey. Published by
American Technical Society, Chicago,
1940. 195 pages. $2.00.
In his introduction Mr. Frailey states
that there is no greater tragedy than
an empty mind—the owner too lazy
to fill it with the facts that would gen-
erate the power of which it is capable.
If Mr. Frailey is thus advocating
self education in one's spare time, he is
certainly doing his part to make the
task a pleasant one. It is rare indeed
that an educational book enters the
market that is as readable as his Better
Business Letters.
Although English composition is stud-
ied for many months by all college stu-
dents, and report-writing is given
especial attention in many fields, little
is done to help students to write better
letters. Yet, after graduation, every
college student will be called upon to
write one business letter after another.
It is to meet the need for skill in this
specialized type of composition that
Mr. Frailey has written this book.
Mr. Frailey not only points out the
things that are to be considered in writ-
ing a letter, such as planning the best
way to please a particular individual,
the physical form of the letter, and the
type of language to be used, but gives
many examples of good business letters
concerned with different types of sub-
jects.
A few hours spent in studying this
book should be valuable to the engi-
neering student, and would certainly
not be dull.

hadley smith
Of all Hadley Smith's many accom-
plishments, the one for which he is best
known is that his signature is resting in
the pocket of virtually every male stu-
dent on this campus—some eight thou-
sand strong. For he is the Recording
Secretary of the Men's Union, and as
such his signature is reproduced on
every Union card.
Hadley, or "Had," came to Michi-
gan in 1936 from Royal Oak High
School. He has been on the staff of the
Union since the second semester of his
freshman year, last year serving on the
Junior Council and this year on the
Executive Council. In connection with
the Union, he is also in Mimes and will
be working for the traditional opera
which may be revived this year. In his
second year, Hadley affiliated himself
with Delta Tau Delta and at the end
of the year was initiated into Triangles.
He made the Engineering Council in
his junior year as well as Vulcans,
Michigamua, and Tau Beta Pi. It
might be added that all this while
"Had" was holding and still is holding
a four year Alumni Scholarship.
Just what department Hadley is in
in the Engine School is a matter of some
doubt. He has registered in the Electri-
cal, Civil, and Mathematics departments
in past years, but he is now expecting a
degree in Mechanical Engineering. His
three summers spent in the Experimen-
tal Department of the Packard Motor
Car Company have been, he believes, a
valuable experience. On his not too fre-
quent days off, "Had" could invariably
be found either swimming or playing
tennis, his favorite recreations, aside
from attending plays. He was on the
freshman tennis team here, but gave it
up for want of time.
The most interesting thing about our
quiet and serious friend is that he was
the man behind the "Sinister Six." Who
will forget last December when mysteri-
ous little paper triangles appeared on
campus trees, and the Daily carried ad-
vertisements featuring a row of little
men in various odd positions? So big a
mystery was it, that when the story was
finally explained, the United Press and
the Associated Press sent representatives
here to find what it was all about. The
"Sinister Six" was Hadley Smith, and
he had thought of the idea way back in
October when trying to think of some
way to make the Ice Carnival a suc-
cess through advertising. The idea of
the little men in odd positions was taken
from a Sherlock Holmes story, "Tale of
the Dancing Men," in which the men

Hadley Smith
Wandered in the dead of night
formed a code by their different posi-
tions. The signs for the trees were all
mimeographed secretly by "Had" with
the help of one friend and were put up
by the two in the middle of the night.
Hadley can tell of many ad%'entures in
eluding the watchmen and other persons
wandering around in the dead of the
night, and the whole affair was filled with
suspense. At the same time that the
messages appeared on the trees, mys-
terious letters were sent to various stu-
dents. "Had" knew and planned that
some people would remember the Sher-
lock Holmes story and, after reading it,
would be able to decipher the message
and so start rumors. However, he did
not want these rumors to start spread-
ing till the mystery had reached its cli-
max, so he had all books containing the
story removed from the library till he
considered the time ripe. Then the
books were returned, and the word
gradually spread around till everyone
realized that the signs advertised the
Ice Carnival. The discovery came just
before Christmas vacation and so some-
thing was needed after the vacation to
keep up interest. Therefore "Had" de-
cided to hold a contest to elect the
Queen of the Ice Carnival and brawny
Jack Brennan was "elected." While he
never did tally the votes, Hadley be-
lieves that if he had, Here Renda would
have won! The ballots are still in his
office and if anyone feels curious and
industrious he can go over and get to
work. Anyway, as a result of these
two clever advertising stunts the Ice
Carnival was a tremendous success.
Hadley is somewhat undecided on h\~
plans after graduation in June, but leans
toward sales promotion work. Judging
from his ability along that line as indi-
cated by the success of the Ice Carni-
val, we can see that Had is leaning in
the right direction.
professor stout
1895—Melville Bigham Stout is born.
Let's let it go at that. Vital statistics are
rather prosaic anyway, don't you think'
Also let's leave his childhood for his
biographers.
1914—The War breaks out and Mel-
ville goes to college at the University
of Pittsburgh. No doubt the latter is
the more important event.
1917— Melville and the United States
go to war against the Central Powers.
Over there M.B. builds railroads and
depots and erects supply lines at the
front. (He modestly admits that he
had some help with this work.)
1918— The war's over and Melville
can come home and go back to school,
for the world is now safe for democratic
practices.
1919— The University of Michigan
beckons and within one year Engineer
Stout leaves Ann Arbor with an all "A"
record and a B.S. degree in Electrical
Engineering.
1922—After working with Westing-
house Airbrake for two years, Mr.
Stout returns to the University of Michi-
gan to accept an instructorship in Elec-
trical Engineering. For six years he
26
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


also does research work in the lines of
economical power distribution and elec-
trical insulating materials for dynamo
machinery.
1928—A "prof" now, and he cer-
tainly has earned his title of Assistant
Professor.
1935—Only one step from a full pro-
fessor and the prof is just hitting his
stride.
During his advancement, Professor
Stout conducted important research on
forces due to wind gusts as they affected
transmission lines. He developed a high
speed electric anemometer for this study
and has had numerous publications in
the various trade journals.
One wouldn't think the professor had
time to do anything besides his work,
but he certainly has made good use of
his spare time. His varied activities in-
clude membership in A.I.E.E., S.P.E.E.,
-Sigma Xi, Tau Beta Pi, University
Club, Ann Arbor Club, Junior Research
Club and Advisory Board for the
Michigan Technic.
Still more—the man has a private life
too, even though we seem to be doing
our best to make it less private. Con-
fidentially, he's married and has two
children: Thomas, 14, and Virginia, 10.
We hear from reliable sources that Tom
is a cynic, though we're sure he didn't
acquire this trait from his father unless
Professor Stout's faith in mankind was
destroyed when one day he passed a box
of doughnuts around the class and the

said class didn't leave one for the pro-
fessor.
We can't imagine where, but some-
where mingled in with his family duties,
his teaching and his research, Professor
Stout plays a little handball and tennis,
makes a hobby of photography and has
just recently turned his attention to
astronomy. At present, he is grinding
a six inch mirror for a reflecting tele-
scope which he will build. As yet he
hasn't volunteered to grind the ninety-
eight inch mirror for the University.
henry c. billings
Henry C. Billings is one of the multi-
tude of students from the state of New
York. At least, he claims that Rome,
New York, is his home town. "Hank's"
preparatory training was taken at Rome
Academy, where he was prominent in
school activities. He was a member of
the Rome Symphonic Society and
played in its orchestra for two seasons.
The high school orchestra, dramatic
club, French club, and science club were
all part of Hank's extra-curricular
work. As a Hi-Y member, he held the
offices of secretary and vice-president in
his junior and senior years. Athletically,
Hank played on the tennis team for one
year, and in the City Ice Hockey Loop
for two winters.
Graduation day saw Hank ready to
work for the Snider Packing Corpora-
tion in Rome. As he says, "There was
not much glamour, but plenty of aching
bones. Made me appreciate college!"
September saw him heading west for
the Engineering College of the Univer-
sity of Michigan. Following the path of
all good freshmen. Hank joined Sigma
Rho Tau and tried out for the Technic
He was a member of the Freshman Glee
Club, and partially supported himself
with an N.Y.A. job. The summer after
his first year found him working again
for the same company.
In his sophomore and junior years,
Hank was Sales Manager and Illustra-
tions Editor of the Technic, and be-
came vice-president of Sigma Rho Tau
in his junior year. Naturally enough,
he also became a member of the Insti-
tute of Aeronautical Sciences. This year,
his last, he is president of Sigma Rho
Tau, a director of the Bureau of Student
Cooperation, and was recently elected
vice-president of Williams House. Sand-
wiched in these years was a session of
summer school and another summer at
the packing corporation.
Hank also has several hobbies, the
principal one being photography. In
fact, he's ready to snap anything with

pictorial value. He also enjoys swim-
ming, and hopes to renew his hobby of
music at a later date. His last, but not
least, interest is in practical mechanics,
and he is always ready to take a car
apart on some pleasant afternoon.
However, a hobby such as practical
mechanics is likely to prove more or less
disastrous. It seems that Hank took
Professor Lay's M.E. 14 course on air-
craft engines, and one of the principles
is that an airplane motor needs no fan
because of the air cooling it receives.
Well, Hank was driving home by way
of Toledo a couple of days after finish-
ing the course, when the fan flew apart,
knocking a hole in the radiator and
gashing the hood. As they were near a
garage, assistance was found in the per-
son of the newly-wed garageman. Three
hours of work fixed the radiator, but
Hank decided to make a practical appli-
cation of his theory and do without a
fan. All went well until Cleveland was
reached at dawn. Then, as they slowed
down, a geyser of hot water appeared,
much to the astonishment of the early
risers. After numerous stops for fresh
water, Hank finally reached home, fully
convinced that he didn't own an air-
plane.
Hank graduates in Aeronautical Engi-
neering this June, and hopes to become
a sales engineer. According to him, his
chief ambition now is to get Professor
Brackett to trade in his Lincoln on an
airplane.

Keep Ifou* -Head
IN THESE days of political turmoil,
you and I are constantly being bar-
raged by propaganda on war, on peace,
on the third term; on the past, present,
and future policies of our government,
Japan's government, Hitler's govern-
ment, and God knows what else. As a
group, and as individuals, we are prone
to bend violently one way or the other
in the face of these propagandist storms
and sweeping revisions of order. Though
the problems are present day matters,
the situations are so old and have oc-
curred so often that we should, by this
time, be used to them.
We are not novel in this era. The
same sort of thing has been going on
since time began. It happened in Greece
and Rome, and has been taking place
in more modern Europe for centuries.
Consult the record of former days and
you have to rub your eyes to be sure
you are not reading the saga of the New
Era, the New Deal, and the New World
Crisis.
But why must there be so much heat
and distortion? Why not more calmness,
a longer look? In the United States we
have the world's most expensive and in-
clusive educational systems. Surely, the
first fruits of real education ought to be
a large and patient tolerance. The edu-
cated man should be differentiated from
the uneducated by a certain poise and
balance; he should read headlines in
terms of history.
It is disturbing to find college men
and women as rabidly partisan as the
unschooled. Conversation at high-class
dinner tables, in the past three years,
has often not been good testimonial to
the steadying influence of higher educa-
tion. Perhaps the pouring in of so many
new fancy courses has crowded history
out. Certainly the conduct of many col-
lege folks gives little hint that past
events have taught them how human
nature acts.
It would seem that a well-ordered
social structure ought to include three
fairly definite groups. There should be
a strong, self-officered Left, made up of
the young and less privileged; a compact
Right of those, who by temperament,
circumstance, or years, are more con-
servative; a Middle of the Road group
Bruce Barton, author, Con-
gressman, member of a suc-
cessful advertising firm,
former magazine editor, and
Phi Beta Kappa, offers some
down to earth advice.

which, recognizing the need for and ac-
cepting the sincerity of the other two,
constitutes a moderating influence be-
tween. This middle group should cer-
tainly include a majority of the more
mature college-trained minds. These
should attempt to discover and encour-
age the truth on both sides. They should
tides of controversy rise too high, they
should steady themselves by rereading
Emerson's essay on "Compensation."
"Polarity, or action and reaction, we
meet in every part of nature,"' he wrote,
"in darkness and light, in heat and cold,
in the ebb and flow of waters, in male
and female, in the inspiration and ex-
piration of plants and animals, in the
systole and diastole of the heart, in the
undulations of fluids and of sound ....
"This law writes the law of cities and
nation. It will not be balked of its end
in the smallest iota. It is vain to builii
or plot or combine against it. Thing?
refuse to be mismanaged long . . .
Though no checks to a new evil appear,
the checks still exist, and will appear. li
the government is cruel, the governor's
life is not safe. If you tax too high, the
revenue will yield nothing. If you make
the criminal code sanguinary, juries will
not convict. Nothing arbitrary, nothing
artificial can endure . . . Under all gov-
ernments the influence of character re-
mains the same. . . ."
He who knows this truth and acts
upon it is not violent in his thinking or
his speech. He neither shouts condem-
nations of the political reformer nor kids
himself that any political reform is go-
ing to usher in the millennium. His roots

Naval Architecture Streamlines the Barges
One of the largest builders of barges for our inland waterways has made use of
the facilities of the Naval Tank to improve its product twenty-five percent.
The clean cut bow wave on the barge model in Figure 1 shows a minimum loss
of power and the full sized barge drove with an equally good bow wave.
The model barges grouped together at the end of the Naval Tank in Figure 2
may look like toys, but as a result of the tests enough fuel was saved on the first round
trip of the flotilla to pay for three years of testing.

20.000.000TH OFFSPRING
L^ST month, the historic city of Lynn, Massachusetts,
i paraded, unveiled a tablet, and had a ceremony in its
new stadium—all because of the 50th anniversary of one of
its most prominent families. But commendable as a Golden
Anniversary may be, that was only part of the reason. The
city was also hailing the arrival of the family's 20,000,000th
offspring.
"Watthour meters" is the family name, and it was in 1889
that Professor Elihu Thomson, electrical genius, developed
the first practicable meter of this type. Produced by the
Thomson-Houston Electric Company, one of the organiza-
tions which were merged in 1892 to form the General Electric
Company, this early meter stepped into a world having only
17,500 household users of electricity. The 20,000,000th meter
joined a world which in 1938 had 22,900,000 household users.
The G-E factories at Lynn today are a far cry from the small
factory of 50 years ago which produced little dynamos and
arc lamps—two great factories now produce powerful motors,
ship-propulsion equipment, turbines, superchargers for air-
planes. At Lynn, too, there is a division of General Electric's
Test Course for recent graduates ot engineering colleges.

SNOW CRUISER
WHEN it comes to dignity, Antarctica's penguins, with
their permanent tail coats andstiff shirts,are right in the
front row. But their dignity is due for a shock. A "snow
cruiser" will soon be rolling across the penguins' icy front yard.
Putting it mildly, this cruiser is quite different from the
locomotives, trolley coaches, and other vehicles that G-E
engineers help to build or equip. But these engineers weren't
the least perturbed when called upon to design electric equip-
ment for the strange conveyance. Four G-E traction motors,
generators for the two 150-hp diesel engines, and complete
control equipment were installed.
The cruiser was designed by the staff of the Research
Foundation ot the Armour Institute ot Technology for use
by the Government during the L". S. Antarctic Service under
Rear Admiral Byrd. It is so built that it will crawl over
crevasses 15 teet wide. Constructed by the Pullman-Standard
Car Mfg. Co., the vehicle is 55 feet long and will weigh
75,000 pounds when fully loaded. Ten-foot pneumatic tires
support the tour wheels. A five-passenger airplane is carried
on top.

OPPORTUNITY
IN five universities, eight selected college graduates are
doing research work in electricity, physics, and chemistry,
aided by Charles A. Coffin Foundation Fellowships. As under-
graduates these men attended the U. of Cincinnati, Johns
Hopkins, College ot the City of New York, U. of Washington,
Oberlin, Columbia, Muhlenberg, and Denison.
These awards are granted annually by General Electric in
honor of the Company's founder and first president—Charles
A. Coffin. Several previous recipients have attained national,
and even international, fame; one, Dr. Carl D. Anderson,
has received the Nobel Award in Physics—-probably the
outstanding recognition for scientific achievement.
The committee of three distinguished men who will make next
year's awards is composed of: J. H. VanVleck, representing
the National Academy of Sciences; Olin J. Ferguson, repre-
senting the Society for the Promotion ot Engineering Educa-
tion; and F. Malcolm Farmer, representing the American
Institute of Electrical Engineers. Applications tor the 1940
fellowships are now being distributed to colleges and univer-
sities. They must be completed and returned to the Secretarv
of the Charles A. Coffin Foundation, Schenectady, N. Y.,
before January 15, 1940.

STEELS FOR HIGH TEMPERATURE APPLICATIONS
The development of steels for high temperature
service, such as tubes for oil-cracking stills, super-
heaters, and heat exchangers, constitutes one of the
many problems worked on in the University laboratories.
Some of the steels developed are:DM for pipe and
tube applications up to 1200° F.; MM9 for pipe and tube
applications up to 1000-1100° R; 17-22 and DM-45 for
bolt and flange applications;and low-alloyed Calorized
steels for refinery tubes.
Such developments necessitate the making of many
experimental heats,and determining at high temperatures
the creep strength, the short-time tensile strength,
the impact resistance, the hardness, the oxidation and
corrosion resistance, and the stability of the steels
produced.
Those which show satisfactory characteristics are
then investigated in regard to heat treatment, grain
size, melting procedure and casting and fabrication
practice.
The facilities for such developmental work are
available through —

THE MICHICAN TECHNIC



CHEMICALS INDISPENSABLE
TO INDUSTRY
CONCRETE, LIKE HUMAN BEINGS, must be
kept from catching cold.
Dow chemists have a prescription for this
purpose now widely used by contractors. For
if concrete "catches cold" it freezes. Curing
time is prolonged and other difficulties arise.
Concrete must be cured, whatever the
temperature may be. The curing, of course,
does not refer to any illness suffered by the
concrete, but to treatment that increases the
extent of the hydration (water adsorption)
of the silicate compounds which constitute a
large portion of Portland cement.
These extremely small jelly-like particles
of silicate form a cementing film to hold
together the crushed gravel, stone or slag
which makes up a large portion of the con-
crete. In winter it is extremely important that
this cementing process be accomplished as
quickly as possible.
The "cold cure," or rather the cold pre-
ventive, which Dow chemists prescribe for
concrete is calcium chloride made available
in a convenient form known as DOWFLAKE.*
Calcium chloride has a strong affinity for
water. It therefore increases the rate and
extent of hydration (water adsorption) and
the quantity of gelatinous silicate.
Its use assures, really, a victorious race
against time and temperature, for it means
that the curing period can be cut in half.
Authentic tests by the National Bureau of
Standards established that with two per cent
of calcium chloride the time for standard con-
crete to attain safe comprehensive strength
was reduced from 14 to 7 days.
When you reduce curing time in winter
you reduce freezing hazards and the time
required for protective measures, such as the
use of salamanders (mobile heating units),
tarpaulins and other expensive equipment.
You are also reducing labor and construc-
tion costs and the chances of penalties for
failure to complete the job on time. The
lower the temperature, the more effective the
use of DOWFLAKE to protect concrete and
to produce high early strength.
And so out of Dow laboratories comes still
another product that chemical research has
made indispensable to industry.

TECHNIC
FORUM

JAMES S. THOMAS. President
Chrysler Institute of Engineering
and Clarkson College of Technology
THERE is no doubt in my mind but
that six years is little enough time
to train an engineer. Engineering is a
profession. Most of the other professions
find it necessary, or at least desirable, to
offer courses extending to six or more
years, and with interneships, as in the
case of medicine, they utilize as much as
eight years before expecting to get a real
doctor.
However, I do not place my advocacy
of a longer course for engineers upon
the so-called "cultural" basis. The sub-
ject a man studies has nothing to do
with his cultural development. It is the
interest he brings to the subject, and the
thoroughness with which he masters it
that determine its cultural value for him.
The value of economics, political his-
tory, English, foreign language, and the
social sciences to a doctor, for example,
is to make him a better doctor. Such
subjects would be particularly valuable
to an engineer because a knowledge of
them would make him a better engineer.
The engineer has not always understood,
if indeed he has not been indifferent to,
what his work has done for the world
and what service his work has rendered
humanity. Too few of our engineers have
made any effort to interpret for the pub-
lic the advantages to the public of their
work. A broader training and a wider
knowledge of the world's affairs would
enable them to give some badly needed
interpretations.
I have not too much faith in "pre-
Lasr May. the TECHNIC published
an article interviewing Michigan's Dean
Emeritus Mortimer E. Cooley, in which
he stressed the need for enlarging the
present engineering curriculum. As
presented by Dean Cooley, the new
course would not delete any of the
present technical subjects, might even
allow for further study along technical
lines. His main thesis, however, was to
include such subjects as business ad-
ministration, economics, political sci-
ence, and foreign languages in the
curriculum in order better to prepare
the man for his business and profes-
sional life. This subject was one which
struck home to engineers in general
and students in particular. As a result,
the TECHNIC has prepared a forum
in which to present the opinions of
engineering leaders in business and
educational fields on the advisability of
extending the engineer's required cur-
riculum.
In presenting this forum we believe
that we are dealing with one of engi-
neering's most vital and yet most con-
troversial problems. The Society for
Promotion of Engineering Education
now has a separate committee devoted
to it. It constantly comes to the fore
when educational leaders meet. All of
our readers are invited to contribute to
this forum, another session of which
will be presented in a future issue of

available and the demand of reader
interest dictates.
engineering" courses given in detached
form and separate and apart from the
engineering college where the spirit of
things is definitely scientific. Indeed, I
doubt the possibility of giving a student
two years of a sort of "cultural" stucco
and expecting it not to crack up on him.
If engineering students are to have a
cultural outlook upon life, they will get
the most of it on the campuses where
they are pursuing their regular courses
in engineering. Culture is a thing ab-
sorbed; it comes from attitudes and in-
terest, most of which are inspired by the
interests and attitudes of the faculty
and administration of the college in
which the student is doing his work. I
should much prefer the "cultural"
courses to be sprinkled throughout the
engineering courses and offered by men
wholly sympathetic to the work being
done in a particular institution. But if
it must be a water-tight compartment
dose of "cultural subjects," let us add it
at the close of the engineering work
rather than at the beginning.
I believe it was Matthew Arnold who
said, "Culture is the art of becoming."
This is a lifelong process. The desire
to become what we are not at the mo-
ment is the very essence of culture. I
hope we can forget the word "culture"
in this connection, and, having admitted
that it takes at least six years to make
a real engineer, if not a lifetime, set
about developing a blend of courses
which will inspire men so that they will
never quit learning, blend their technical

THE establishment of a six-year en-
gineering course can be considered
from several points of view. I have
been informed that forty or fifty per-
cent of our engineers do not follow
their profession after graduation. Many
of them become executives, salesmen in
engineering and related or unrelated
lines, draftsmen, etc. For this group I
believe a four-year course is sufficient.
There are others, however, who go into
jobs that call for strictly research engi-
neering, and for these a six-year course
is a necessity.
Most engineers realize that their edu-
cation really begins when they start
actual work, and make use of books,
night schools, and correspondence
courses to fortify weak spots in their
technical and cultural knowledge. I
personally am not in favor of establish-
ing a compulsory six-year course for all
engineering students.
WILLIAM WICKENDEN. President
Case School of Applied Science
CONFUSION arises whenever we try
to make engineering education all
of one piece. Some students have practi-
cal interests, some strongly scientific.
Some are intellectually broad; some have
abilities in limited fields. Some have
freedom in time and money; some are
cramped. Some profit by a long stay in
college; some are "fed up" by gradua-
tion. Industry wants leaders of breadth
and imagination and experts of special
training—some of each, but most of its
recruits are set at jobs which require
personal alertness and adaptability, but
do not demand or develop intellectual
breadth. As to the engineering profes-
sion, who can define it? If we use the
term narrowly, engineers in industry
become as definitely tagged, and per-
haps as isolated, as C.P.A.'s; if we use
'it loosely, nearly all executives are in-
cluded. This is a picture of diversity,
not uniformity. The answer, as I see it,
is not a rigid caste system of education
as in medicine, but a flexible one—for
some men four, for some men five and
for some six years of university training,
cut to individual measure. -^rS

"DEGARDING an extension of engi-
■"-^ neering to include business and
cultural courses: in my opinion this will
merely fill the man's head with a lot of
knowledge that might seriously interfere
with rrs thinking. There are a million
different types of engineers: some cul-
tural, some mathematical, some thrifty,
some inspired, and others lazy. Each
one needs a separate type of training to
fit his negatives, as well as his positives,
to future success.
The greatest deficiency of all educa-
tional centers is the lack of courses on
how to think—how to choose the proper
assumptions on which reason and anal-
ysis must start—as is most obviously
proved by the round-table radio discus-
sions punctuated with professorial dig-
nity that emanate from many of our
universities on Sundays.
The assumptions that all employers
are Capitalists: that all laborers are
Communists; that all preachers are
narrow-minded, are only assumptions
from which to start thinking and anal-
ysis.
In engineering, wt deal with facts and
are not concerned with opinions or be-
liefs, but too many engineers take opin-
ions and beliefs as fundamental begin-
nings of their mental process. Rather
than lengthening the engineering course.
I would be in favor of fitting what we
have more directly to the problems of
the mind involved in the course—that
what he learns in school may be directly
applied to the problem he is on. If he
knows how to think and study, he can
go somewhere and find the information
that he needs to solve his problem,
whether he has anything else or not—as
witness George Washington Carver, of
Tuskegee, and his remarkable work in
the chemistry of the peanut; and there
are a host of others that might be cited.

WHILE there are still some die-
hard reactionaries in the engineer-
ing profession who believe that the
problems of our society should be left
to the social scientists, there is a grow-
ing opinion that engineers should come
out of their shells and take an active
part in the social sphere. Yet even
among those who agree upon this prin-
ciple, little has been done about the
matter. Most national engineering so-
cieties seem somewhat indifferent to the
social progress that might come as a
result of united effort. The American
Engineering Council and the Engineers'
Council for Professional Development,
two organizations which have attempted
to broaden the engineer's interests, have
both done good jobs within their means,
but, nevertheless, have considerable dif-
ficulty in gaining support. It seems,
then, that if engineers are to have a
social conscience it can best be incul-
cated at college, and therefore the engi-
neering curriculum must be changed to
allow for this. The initial step is difficult
to take, but unless the engineering col-
leges are to be in the position of shirking
responsibility, they must act. Enough
time and sufficient guidance of the right
kind must be included in the curriculum
so that the student will have reasonable
opportunity to prepare himself for the
responsibilities he will meet in the day
he reaches professional maturity. Habits
must be formed in college, interests stim-
ulated, and competences developed
which will enable the engineer to co-
operate naturally and effectively with
educated citizens who are working to-
ward the same ends of social under-
standing.

AS I see it, there is no need of in-
creasing the length of the present
engineering courses. We would be more
in favor of shortening the course to two
years. After the student gets a back-
ground in physics he should have a
chance to go to work and use this train-
ing. Many engineering college graduates
lack ability to do things with their
hands. I feel that engineering students
should have more opportunity to apply
their training in physics and mechanics
to actual jobs. That is why I like the
cooperative form of education. It gives
the boy an opportunity to receive both
technical training and practical expe-
rience and helps him to find out about
his own ability.
Information obtained in courses in
business, economics, etc., is useful to
engineers. However, I believe the engi-
neering graduate who is really ambitious
to get ahead will study these things as
he finds a definite need for them on the
job. I do not see any reason why he
should spend one or two extra years in
school just to get this information.
G. M. BUTLER, Dean

IAM strongly in favor of expanding
engineering curricula to at least five
years for many reasons of which the
most important are as follows:
1. Only exceptionally able students
who do not have to earn any appreciable
part of their expenses and do not en-
gage in athletics or other beneficial
extra-curricular activities can now finish
our over-crowded "four year" curricula
in four years. Most engineering students
already take five-year curricula.
2. Experience has proven that an en-
gineering student who studies "the hu-
manities" late in his course absorbs
them avidly, enjoys such study, and has
his viewpoint broadened and his mental
horizons extended in such a way as to
enrich his whole life, but our four year
curricula are so crowded that it is im-
possible to incorporate into them such
desirable courses and still lay a satis-
factory foundation for an engineering
career.
3. In most states doctors, lawyers,
and high school teachers (and, among
many sects, ministers) are not permitted
to practice those professions after spend-
ing only four years in college. A suc-
cessful engineer must have mastered a
wide variety of very difficult subjects,
and he should not be expected to com-
plete his formal education in less time
than persons who wish to engage in
other professions.

answering the question—
Casting or built up arc weld?
ARC WELDING
By
FRANK A. MICKLE
Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering
ARC welding is not a new art, since
its development was begun in
the late nineties. The growth of this
manufacturing process has been slow
and tedious, and it was not until about
twenty years ago that sufficient prog-
ress had been made to apply it in a
commercial way. Such marked progress
has been made recently that it is now a
very common tool of the manufacturer.
Although it is not a "cure all" for the
difficulties of complicated parts, the
progress in its use is saving costs and
reducing weights in many instances.
No sane person believes that it is ap-
plicable to all designs of castings and
structures, but in the future much prog-
ress and more extensive use of it seems
likely. The basic idea behind this proc-
ess is to reduce costs and weights and
still have equal or better parts.
Work in Process
Not for all designs
There are three factors influencing
the choice between a casting and a pari
built up of rolled shapes arc welded to-
gether. They are cost, weight, and the
elimination of vibration. In any case
one or all three of these may have a
strong influence on the cost.
The weight factor is of considerable
importance in considering floor loads
and handling charges. The vibration and
resonance problem depends on the re-
quirements of the part. There may be a
slight advantage of castings over welded
parts when considering resonance be-
cause the cast parts do not vibrate as
easily nor at as undesirable pitches as
structural shapes do. The "cost deliv-
ered" factor is without doubt the out-
standing general factor.
The simplest of all situations is the
case when the greatest rigidity possible
is required and
where some of
the work must be
done in one lo-
Amerh.* Machinist cality and the fin-
ished structure
shipped to a re-
m o t e point.
Transportation
facilities may not
be available for
shipment of the
finished parts and
bolted connec-
tions are not suit-
able. Under these
conditions arc
welding could be
used to make
portions small
enough to ship.
These pieces
could be ma-
chined and
shipped to the
[K)int of erection and then arc welded
together into the required unit.
One outstanding case of the "cost
delivered" factor (or it might be called
the feasibility factor) has come to my
attention. This is the two-hundred inch
reflector telescope erected at Mount
Palomar in California. The greater
part of the structure housing this tele-
scope was made in the East because no
equipment was available in California
for fabricating and machining this hous-
ing. It would have been very undesirable
to have had to cast certain parts in seg-
ments, ship them to California, and bolt
them together on the location. This
difficulty was easily circumvented by
designing the housing in segments and
finish machining them, then transport-
ing them to California and up the
mountain, and welding them together
at the place of use. No comparative costs
are available for this project, nor would
they be of any value if they were. The
project would have been impossible from
a practical standpoint if this procedure
had not been followed.
The general case cannot be described
or explained so easily. Let us assume
that the part under consideration could
be manufactured by either method sat-
isfactorily. It is first necessary to esti-
mate the costs impartially. These costs
will include certain common items after
the rough drawings for each type have
been made. These items are the cost of
the finished drawings, tracings, blue-
prints, material (rolled steel, cast steel,
or cast iron), and handling of the ma-
terial. The items not common to both
methods are for the casting: patterns
and core boxes and pattern and core
box storage and insurance: for the
welded job: welding rod, electric power,
and welding equipment. It is necessary
that foundry equipment depreciation be
included in the pound price of castings.
When considering the cost of patterns,
including storage and insurance charges,
care must be taken to estimate carefully
the number of castings to be made dur-
ing the life of the pattern so that all
pattern costs may be distributed uni-
formly over this number. It must be
borne in mind that labor costs must be
studied carefully. In the case of welding
a much higher percentage of the labor
must be skilled than when castings are
used.
The above is predicated on the as-
sumption that the part is a new one and
that no patterns and core boxes are on
hand. If such is not the case, that is, if
the patterns and core boxes are avail-
able, their present value should be

Electric Arc Welding
The man is skilled, the procedure sometimes indispensable
charged against the change to welding.
The cylindrical pressure vessel is now
receiving considerable attention. It
seems, at present, to be the opinion of
the majority of those interested in this
phase that pressure vessels made of steel
plate three-quarters of an inch thick
or less should be riveted. Those of
greater thickness can be made at less
cost and of better quality by welding.
Cases arise frequently where the dif-
ference in weight between an iron or
steel casting and a welded steel part is
of no importance. Where there is no
machine work necessary and a large
number of the part is to be made, the
cast method without doubt would be the
more economical because it is the ma-
chining work on castings that raises the
costs of such parts more than any other
one item.
The art of welding is in its adolescent
period, and we should see marked ad-
vances in the immediate future.

new pavement
The problem of increased accident
rates after nightfall is becoming more
and more important to traffic engineers.
Along with improvements in lighting
facilities has gone investigation into the
light-reflecting qualities of various pav-
ing materials. The usual type of black
Macadam pavement with minimum
reflectance value, when viewed at
night under modern lights, appears as
small spots of brightness alternating
with large splotches of darkness in areas
where the light has been absorbed.
Dark-colored objects are visible only
part of the time at night on this pave-
ment—when silhouetted against the
lighted patches. Surfacings now in com-
mon use have light reflectivity varying
in degrees from less than four to more
than 30 per cent, according to color and
character. Some surfacings reflect light
diffusely, like new snow; others reflect
specularly, like rippled water. As a rule
the two types of reflection are found
intensity, direction, and angle of light
applied.
Mr. C. A. B. Halvorson, lighting en-
gineer, describing before the annual
meeting of the Association of Asphalt
Paving Technologists some experiments
carried out on an actual roadway, an-
nounced a paving process whereby many
of these difficulties are overcome. When
the roadway is processed with granite
chips "glued" to the old surface with a
layer of asphalt, a diffusing pavement
with a uniform reflectivity of about 30
per cent is produced. Under the same
night-lighting conditions the new pave-
ment silhouettes all objects, the surface
appearing bright throughout without in-
termittent areas of darkness wherein
hazards could be concealed. The granite-
chip paving also presents several other
advantages. With lighting from automo-
bile headlamps alone the visibility dis-
tance is increased several times. Under
a cloudy sky the pavement appears uni-
formly bright, and visibility of objects
is high, whereas in bright sunlight the

Dark areas are eliminated
combined to a greater or less degree in
all types of pavement under varying
conditions of weather. Such surfaces
have none of the uniformity of reflec-
tion over large areas which is necessary
for proper visibility at night. With but
one or two exceptions pavements change
their reflection characteristics when wet,
and the brightness uniformity has been
found to vary greatly with the specific

ably less bright when facing the sun
than the dark pavement which has a
high degree of mirrorlike reflection. Still
another advantage is found when the
granite-chip pavement is covered with
water; under those conditions the sur-
face still appears uniformly bright, be-
cause the sides of the chips stand out
above the water film.

fine shot
X-rayers have always experienced dif-
ficulty in photographing objects of rela-
tively great opaqueness, such as metals.
There is such pronounced difference in
the absorption of the rays by air and
by metals that the part of the negative
not behind the object is necessarily over-
exposed, causing the exposure to "spill
over" and blur the edges of the image.
Similarly, when the object has some
sections much thinner than others, there
is a fuzziness of edges.
Various attempts have been made to
remedy the difficulty. One way was to
use a film of low contrast value, with
special filtering screens and long ex-
posures. The result was loss of detail
and contrast. Another method was to
immerse the article in a solution of lead
acetate or some similar compound. Such
liquids improved the sharpness and con-
trast of the radiographs, but they still
left room for improvement, since none
of the liquids used was of an opaqueness
approximating that of the metal. A
third idea was to surround the object
with a mass of special, lead-bearing
putty. Nonuniformity of the putty
handicapped that procedure.
The problem, then, was to find a
surrounding substance that would com-
bine the characteristics of opacity,
fluidity, and homogeneity. The solution
was discovered in the use of fine metal
shot. Opacity approaching that of the
photographed object is achieved by
choosing the right metal or alloy with
which to make the shot. Fluidity results

from the use of extremely fine shot—
10,000,000 occupy one cubic inch of
space—which "flows" freely to fill all
crevices. The smallness of shot, to-
gether with uniformity of packing, also
gives a homogeneous background. By
use of this method, technicians can use
short-exposure films with intensifying
screens and obtain greater contrast and
detail in the radiograph.
pressure
An electric arc, about half an inch in
diameter, carrying ten amperes in free
air, will contract to a tiny thread under
a pressure of 1000 atmospheres, and the
voltage necessary to maintain it will be
increased several times. A hydrogen arc,
which has an extremely small section at
ordinary pressures, cannot be operated
at all in the range above twenty atmos-
pheres, while arcs in helium have been
operated at pressures above 200 atmo-
spheres without the development of any
abnormal instability.
Investigation of arcs has been con-
ducted at pressures as high as 3600 at-
mospheres, but due to limitations of
present equipment, accurate measure-
ments are possible only up to 1275 at-
mospheres, or nine tons per square inch.
Such experimentation is done behind a
barricade of sandbags, and within a
thick-walled cylinder of exceptionally
strong steel.

High Pressure Arc Apparatus
Behind a barricade of sand bags
Most high pressure arc phenomena
are attributed to convection currents
("cyclones") in the gas. It is known
that temperatures inside the arc column
go up to between 11,000 and 12,500 de-
grees Fahrenheit. Arc gas thus heated
becomes extremely buoyant, and this
buoyancy results in convection currents
around the arc. Such currents in free
air have a velocity of somewhat more
than four feet per second. The velocity
goes up with the pressure, and calcula-
tions based on data taken at low pres-
sures show that the convection velocities
would become higher than the velocity
of sound, which is impossible. The con-
vection velocities do not actually in-
crease as rapidly as pressure because
there is a most important counteracting
force in the observed decrease in size of
the arc column, which means that the
volume of gas available for bringing
about the buoyant force is somewhat re-
duced. Actual measurement of velocity
at high pressures is impossible, but all
indications seem to point to the fact
that the velocities do become very great.
bombing bulbs
Getting the sodium into a sodium
lamp of the type used in highway light-
ing is a considerable problem, because
of the metal's tendency to combine with
other elements. It first undergoes a
triple distillation. A glass system is
built, with the sodium within a wire
mesh at one end of a vessel, and a
vacuum pump connected at the other.
The sodium is heated, and, as it escapes
from the wire mesh, it leaves a slag of
impurities behind. It is distilled into a
second vessel, and the process is re-
peated twice more, each step increasing
its purity. Attached to the fourth ves-
sel by slim necks, or capillary tubes, are
the glass cases of sodium "bombs." These
bombs are evacuated bulbs, smaller than
marbles, and are made of glass less than
six thousandths of an inch thick. In its
final distillation, the sodium is de-
posited in the capillary tubes, and argon
gas is released into the system to force
it down into the bulbs, each one getting
about 1/80 of an ounce. The necks are
then heated, sealing the bulbs for re-
moval. In this way, bombs for a dozen
lamps are made with one operation.
The bomb is placed in the lamp tube,
the inside of which is coated with a so-
dium-resistant flashing glass, and the
tube is evacuated and sealed. By means
of a high-frequency coil, heat is induced
in the sodium, which melts, then boils,
finally exploding the glass bomb. The
sodium is deposited against the walls of
the lamp and the glass of the bomb is
shattered into dust which remains inside
the bulb.
calcium carbide
As early as 1836, Edmund Davy, an
English chemist, observed that a by-
product which he obtained during the
production of metallic potassium was
capable of decomposing water with the
evolution of a gas which contained
acetylene, but it was not till 1862 that
Woehler announced the discovery of
the preparation of acetylene from cal-
cium carbide.
In spite of these early laboratory ob-
servations, it is perfectly safe to say
that until 1892 few chemists ever saw
an acetylene flame, much less dreamed
of it as a commercial possibility. On
May 2 of that year, at Spray, North
Carolina, Major James T. Morehead
demonstrated for the first time the
feasibility of large scale production.
Care must be taken in shipping and
storing calcium carbide to prevent fire
or explosion. It cannot explode by it-
self, nor can it take fire or otherwise do
harm if it is carefully sealed from the
air. The sheet steel drums in which
calcium carbide is shipped are airtight
and watertight and are rigidly con-
structed to withstand the extremely
rough usage that they often receive
while in transit. It is important that the
drums are not overly abused or handled
in such a way that they might become
ruptured or punctured.

building up foreign and domestic
commerce, and in offering a safe hobby
for those interested in aviation, depends
to a large degree on wing design.
Early wing designs were structurally
weak. Wings were built light and flex-
ible to allow for lateral control by the
warping of their surfaces. Due to this
light construction of spruce, bamboo,
and wires, many early planes crashed as
the result of spar failure. Designers had
difficulty in ascertaining the location of
such failures because of the inaccuracy
of spectators' reports. The singular rec-
tangular spruce spar was replaced by a
laminated multi-section spar with thin
layers of mahogany on the top and bot-
tom for high bending stress, and a
spruce core. This permitted greater
strength at the extreme fibres and al-
lowed for flexing with only a slight
weight increase of the structure.
Airfoils in their early stages of de-
velopment were of a form which was the
result of study conducted on soaring-bird
wings. The airfoil profile of the Wright
brothers' first successful ship had a cir-
cular arc for the top and bottom curva-
ture. This type of profile was found to
have a larger lift than those resembling
a bird wing section. The thin airfoil as
found in the Bleriot biplane of 1906 and
the Vosine biplane of 1910 was replaced
for other similar ships to utilize the ad-
vantages characteristic of thick airfoils.
The thick ones allowed space to conceal
the airfoil structure from the wind, thus
reducing the large drag.
A major change was
brought about in the air-
foil section by experiments
in 1911 of ElishaK.Fales.
The change waseventually
adopted during the World
War to give better per-
formance. The foremost
part of Fales's experi-
ments was to determine
the relative importance
of the upper and lower
curved surfaces of the air-
foil. The upper surface
was found to be of major importance.
Further investigation credited it with
two-thirds of the lift under cruising po-
sition. The best location of the maximum
arching to obtain the best center of pres-
sure characteristics, small c.p. move-
ment, and location of the c.p. trans-
verse to the wing span, was advocated
as being near the leading edge of the
airfoil.
The designers in the pre-war period
were limited as to the number of desir-
able materials which possessed lightness,
high strength-weight ratio, and corrosion
resistance. The most adaptable metals
for airplane use at this time were ex-
tremely high priced for the amount
required or they were unavailable at
that time due to a lack of development.
Wood was the cheapest and most plen-
tiful; while steel was available, it was
used only in the form of wires and sev-
eral fittings in the wing truss. Few steels
could be obtained even at high cost be-
cause the extensive development to adopt
the ferrous metals to aircraft use had
not been begun at that time.
The tubular steel wing structures
were first employed in the Antoinette
monoplane. This bicycle steel tubing was
desirable from the strength-weight ratio
standpoint. The shock loads imposed on
the material of this structure in landing
and take-off soon caused the wings to
become deformed. The process of repair
proved to be difficult and very expensive.
The attempt to employ aluminum in a
wing was made in the Bleriot monoplane
that flew the English Channel in 1909.
The wing was composed of wood spars
and aluminum ribs which formed the
airfoil shape. Although this metal
proved successful, its use was restricted
because of high cost.
Ribs employed in the early airplanes
were of solid wood section until it was
found in 1907 that they could employ
laminations of ash and spruce to obtain
a lighter and more durable form. There

the landing wires. The flying wires
were attached to the under carriage of
the plane.
The air races and competitive events
carried on in England and France be-
fore the war helped to stimulate the de-
velopment of the airplane. Modifica-
tions in wing design aided the attempts
to reach new speeds which in 1911
reached approximately 70 m.p.h. The
governments in 1914 saw the great pos-
sibilities of the airplane for scouting
purposes. Then, extensive experiments
were carried on to improve the per-
formance of the planes to meet the re-
quirements of use.
Airfoils developed in this period were
numerous. The airfoils of a given type
produced by each nation varied con-
siderably as to the length and thickness
as well as the degree of curvature for
maximum lift. The U. S. thick sec-
tioned high-lift airfoil was about 300c
longer than a similar German airfoil
with a less degree of curvature and
thickness.
The predecessor of the modern wing
slots and flaps was a variable camber
airfoil which was developed in the late
war period. This type was an approach
to what is known as a stable airfoil
which has an equal upper and lower
camber; namely, the departure of the
upper airfoil surface from the chord at
a given point back of the leading edge
is equal to the lower departure at that
point. The objective obtained was the
increase in the surface for take off and
the reduction of area to increase the
speed when off the ground. This reduc-

tion in area by shortening the chord per-
mits higher wing efficiency by a decrease
in the wing drag. This wing was com-
posed of three sections employed in a
monoplane in 1919. The top and bot-
tom sections moved respectively forward
and backward when increasing the wing
area. The chord length when closed was
63" and open 129". The mechanical
difficulties in control of this airfoil made
it impracticable.
F. H. Norton's airfoil experiments at
the close of the war shed considerable
light on airfoil characteristics. Interest-
ing results showed: the desirable loca-
tion of maximum camber is at the Yi
chord to give a more gradual change of
the lift on approaching the stalling
angle; maximum airfoil thickness is
16% chord and any greater thickness
gives an unstable condition; and the ad-
dition of a convex lower surface to a
thick tapered wing increases the lift
and reduces the drag. The above re-
sults led to the increase in safety and
the improvement of some airfoils. The
development of the airfoil was rapid in
this period but the limitations of this
article allow the presentation of only a
few elementary changes which have oc-
curred.
War planes, first used for scouting
purposes, soon became an offensive
weapon. Maneuvering in combat re-
quired better performance because of
high dynamic wing loads.
Higher stresses required superior ma-
terials to improve the strength and light-
ness of these combat ships. The solid

ACOUPLE of years ago, just when
Professor H. C. Anderson as-
sumed the Deanship of engineering, I
had occasion to write a letter to the
Dean. He at once replied. I shall treas-
ure that reply, for it was the first letter
that "Andy" ever wrote as our Dean.
He soon found himself deeply immersed
in replies. Letters of congratulation
poured in upon him, to each of which
he made a personal reply. For some
time after his appointment, ''Andy"
could be observed slipping into his
office on Sundays—to keep abreast of
his mail.
This issue of the Commentaries is not
written as a eulogy. Many of those
have appeared, and still more are else-
where in preparation or in press. Rather,
this is an attempt at making a partial
analysis of the personal qualities of a
man who had, and still has, a pervading
influence on the lives and characters of
thousands of students and graduates of
Michigan.
Only a few weeks ago, Dean Ander-
son called me in to talk about a certain
student's difficulties. This student was
one of the numerous students he knew,
and in whom he took a personal inter-
est. "Andy" took pride in being helpful
to students, and in helping to solve
their problems. Soon the conversation
swung to the placement of graduates
in positions. In spite of his manifold
duties, he had continued to maintain
contact with many seniors, recent grad-
uates, and employing firms. From his
long career as teacher and engineer,
"Andy" knew more employers of engi-
neers than did anyone else in the col-
lege; more opportunities for placing
graduates came to him, than to anyone
else. And that day, this fall, he said,
"As long as I'm here, I'll keep on with
these boys, and do what I can for them."
He meant it, he was doing it, and he
knew when he spoke that "As long as
I'm here" might mean 10 years or 10
minutes.
Men, like machines, perform accord-
ing to design. After a serious break-
down such as Dean Anderson had, most
men would have been justified in retir-
ing from the scene—and all would be
advised to do so. But his emotional and
mental pattern and design prevented
that. "Andy" had been in action from
boyhood up, and action it would be—■
until he was taken out of the game by a
Captain who knows when a good player
has gained enough ground.
It has been my privilege to introduce
"Andy" to a number of audiences. Not
long ago, I facetiously described him as
a man who held so many posts of re-
sponsibility in the university that it
would be possible for him to sit all
morning as a member of committees,

Dean Anderson
We have gained a fine memory
passing tentatively on university affairs
—then sit all afternoon in other capaci-
ties, nullifying the same measures. In
part only was this incorrect: he was not
a nullifier. If a thing was good, it not
only had his understanding and sym-
pathy—it got Dean Anderson's active
support. And his support was not a
mere passive nod of approval, for he
was one who did his utmost to improve
a thing, whether or not it was directly
his responsibility. If a project was
worthwhile, he was behind it one hun-
dred per cent; his approval always gave
others confidence in the plan, while his
unstinted effort toward its completion
was an inspiration to his co-workers.
What personal qualities made this
man uniquely valuable to the university?
Wide knowledge of the institution's
problems—yes; but this is not enough.
Willingness to work—yes; but so are
others informed, and willing to work.
We must look beyond these factors, nec-
essary though they be.
"Andy" trusted people to the limit:
not blindly, but intelligently. Most peo-
ple rise to their best levels, when they
know they are trusted to do and be their
best. He knew that, and kept it as a
working principle.
He knew the meaning of the word
"compromise," in the best sense. He
knew that seldom, if ever, do humanity's
problems yield to one and only one solu-
tion; that give-and-take is a prime in-
gredient in any solution that has a
chance to remain useful. But if anyone
misjudged this characteristic, and was
so foolish as to propose something not
ethical in all respects, he would soon
find that "Andy" could smell a rat and
destroy it faster than most.
He had an ever-watchful regard for
people's feelings.
He had a great and genuine interest
in his fellow man.
And he had an unlimited supply of
good will. People will trust a man of
good will, even if they disagree with
him; whereas, we cannot trust a man
with whom we disagree, if he lacks good
will.
Dean Anderson was not a lovable and
uniquely useful man because he was an
engineer, nor because he originated as a
Kentucky gentleman, nor because of any
other external reasons. It was because
he managed to develop a group of ad-
mirable personal traits and character-
istics to an unusual degree. Now, a
student who sets out to be a second
Henry Clay Anderson will fail, no mat-
ter how hard or how intelligently he
works at it. But any student can be
equally successful in his own way, and
can carve out for himself a much hap-
pier and more useful life, if he will do
his best to develop these same traits to
the best of his ability.
In losing Dean Anderson, Michigan
men have lost a great friend. But we
have not lost a great friendship, and we
have gained a fine memory.

Many a design problem that used to be troublesome is
being worked out these days by the use of modern ma-
terials. Take logging trailer brake drums, for example.
Holding back 50 ton loads on long, steep grades and
running high temperatures is all in their day's work.
But. by making his drums of Chromium-Molybdenum
(0.35-0.45% Cr.; 0.35-0.45% Mo.) iron, one of the lead-
ing manufacturers has more than met the severe
operating conditions.
The iron is strong and tough, with good resistance
to abrasion. Furthermore, it retains these qualities after
repeated heating to around 900 degrees F. followed by
rapid cooling. In addition the Molybdenum content
reduces the tendency to distortion due to heating —
thus reducing the pounding action that leads to pre-
mature failure.
Our interesting booklets "Molybdenum in the
Foundry" and "Molybdenum in Steel," containing
much practical data, will be sent free on request
from any interested technical student.

By
O. W. BOSTON, 'HE
Chairman, Department of Metal Processing
CUTTING fluids comprise liquids,
solids, and gases, which are applied
to the tool point to facilitate the metal
cutting operation. Millions of gallons
are used annually to accomplish any one
of a number of purposes, singly or in
combination, such as to increase tool
life for a given cutting speed, prevent
distortion of the work while it is being
machined, reduce power consumption,
break up and help remove chips, and, at
low speeds and light cuts, improve the
smoothness of the machined surface.
The performance of a cutting fluid,
therefore, must be based on its success
for each particular application to a spe-
cific metal, tool, and cutting operation.
The Performance of Cutting Fluids
The influence of cutting fluids on the
torque of a I '/i inch diameter twist drill,
when operating at a speed of 60 f. p. m.
and a feed of 0.015 inch per revolution,
in each of nine metals is shown in Fig.
1. Eleven cutting fluids were used, as
designated in the legend of Fig. 1. The
highest curve, for a nickel-chromium
steel known as S. A. E. 3150 in an an-
nealed condition, shows that the highest
torque is obtained with the mineral oil
containing 5 per cent oleic acid, No. 9.
The next highest value is obtained with
cutting fluid No. 1, dry cutting. The
lowest value of torque is obtained with
the sulphurized mineral oil, No. 10;
with the sulphurized base oil, No. 11,
second best; and the borax water, No.
2, third lowest. It is interesting to note
that for the other steels, the curves are
somewhat, although not exactly, similar
to that for the S. A. E. 3150 steel. How-
ever, the performance of one cutting
fluid on a given metal is not a criterion
of its comparable performance on an-
other material.
20
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


terials plotted over the cutting fluid
numbers are shown in Fig. 2. Again, no
similarity is seen between the curves of
any two metals.
The same eleven cutting fluids were
used further to lubricate a bearing in
order to determine the value of each as
a lubricant. Dry lubrication was re-
placed with clear water. The bearing
testing machine rotated the journal in
a bearing at 100 r. p. m. A new com-
bination of journal and bearing was used
for each test. The load was increased
at a rate of 1,000 pounds every ten
seconds. The beam load was plotted over
the applied pressure for each of the
cutting fluids, and it was found that the
lowest beam load was for water until
a pressure of about 9,000 pounds was
reached, when the beam load rapidly
increased and bearing seizure took place
at about 10,000 pounds pressure. Lard
oil, No. 5, gave a low beam load, but
seizure occurred at a pressure of ap-
proximately 13,000 pounds. The maxi-
mum beam loads occurred for oils 6, 9,
7, and 10. Seizure occurred for cutting
fluids 6, 9, and 7 at relatively low pres-
sures. For No. 10, seizure occurred at
the highest beam load of 223 pounds and
a pressure of 14,000 pounds. The sul-
phur in the plain mineral oil permits
the generation of considerable friction
and heat, but prevents seizure of the
bearing. It is interesting to note that the
beam load for a given pressure for the
sulphur-base oil, No. 11, was less for
most pressures than were those for No.
10. The fat of this oil presumably re-
duces the friction, although seizure oc-
curs for a beam load of only 200
pounds at a pressure of only 11,000
pounds. This characteristic represents
the main difference between the blended
sulphurized base oils and the sulphur-
ized plain mineral oils.
Results of careful tests have shown
that the straight line curve representing
cutting speed as a function of tool life
for a given set of conditions, in turning,
as plotted on log-log paper, may be
changed in its vertical position on a
scale, as well as in slope from the hori-
zontal, if one cutting fluid is replaced
by another, with all other factors re-
maining constant. These factors cover
the type and material of tool, tool shape,
size and shape of cut, cutting process,
as turning, drilling, broaching, grinding,
milling, or threading, and the analysis
and structure of the material cut.
It has been observed in many tests
that the cutting fluid which gives the
longest tool life does not necessarily give
the lowest tangential cutting force at
the same time. Some tests give definite
data to the contrary.
To obtain a superior finish on any
machined surface, the size of the built-
up edge should be reduced. The ma-
chinist accomplishes this by increasing
the cutting speed, reducing the size of
cut, grinding the tool to keener cutting
edges and greater rake, and by applying
a cutting fluid. Results of numerous
tests suggest that the cutting fluid it-
self has the least influence on finish of
all factors named for normally high cut-
ting speeds. For low cutting speeds, as
in broaching and threading, the cutting
CARBON TOOL STEEL
when cutting with water is the lowest.
It is believed that tool life in turning is
a direct function of temperature, so that
it would be expected that the cutting
fluid having the highest refrigerating
property would produce the longest tool
life. At the same time, it is reasonable
to expect that an oil, as a result of its
good lubricating properties, might re-
duce the heat generated at the tool point
and, even in spite of its lower thermal
conductivity, keep the temperature at
the tool point lower than when the bet-
ter refrigerant is used, and, as a result,
provide longer tool life. Experimental
data confirm this belief in some specific
tests, but fail to confirm it in others.

fluids, particularly the sulphurized base
oil, do produce superior surface finishes.
The temperature developed at the tool
point while turning various metals has
been found, by the tool-work thermo-
couple method and the tool thermo-
couple method, to vary almost directly
with the speed for a given cutting con-
dition. When a cutting fluid is applied
in turning steel, however, all other fac-
tors remaining constant, the temperature
when cutting dry is highest, when cut-
ting with an oil is somewhat lower, and
Presumably, lubrication and thermal
conductivity are both of importance. It
is believed that the ratio of lubrication
to cooling varies for different specific
applications. At the present time suffi-
cient data are not available to establish
a satisfactory rule governing this rela-
tionship.
Practical Application

fluids varies considerably from plant
to plant. Cutting fluids are selected for

American Machinist
A Cutting Fluid in Action
Large quantities, high velocities, low temperatures
of the human element, the results of
these surveys are similar in only a gen-
eral way.
Air is often applied as a suction or
blast to cutting operations such as turn-
ing or boring cast iron or on surface
grinders and polishing machines. Its
main purpose is to remove small chips
and dust, but some cooling also is ob-
tained.
Plain water or water containing an
alkali such as borax makes a very satis-
factory cutting fluid where cooling and
washing away chips are required, as
in grinding, drilling, sawing, light mill-
ing, or turning. The fluid is inexpensive,
but does not prevent the formation of
rust on the machine and work if care-
lessly used.
Emulsions constitute the greatest vol-
ume of cutting fluids used today. They
are used on practically all typ^s of metal
cutting operations and on nearly all
metals. They are used on nearly every
degree of adhesion and low thermal con-
ductivity. They are stable and relatively
inexpensive and do not stain the work
because of an active sulphur content.
The fixed oils have greater adhesive-
ness or oiliness, comparatively high flash
points, and a relatively higher specific
heat, and undergo less change of fluidity
at high temperatures. They are more
expensive, become rancid, liberate free
fatty acids, develop disagreeable odors,
and become gummy on slides when
used.
Sulphurized oils are now used as all-
round cutting fluids for rapid production
involving good surface finish and close
tolerances. Straight sulphurized mineral
oil seems to be the most satisfactory
where a black oil and sulphur stain on
the metal are not objectionable for ma-
chining, such as broaching, milling,
tapping, and threading of all highly duc-
tile and tough metals. They are a neces-
sity on the soft and highly ductile
metals, such as hot-rolled low-carbon
steel, iron, stainless steel, etc. They may
be blended with plain mineral oil to
lower the viscosity, make it more trans-
parent, or reduce the sulphur content to
obtain longer tool life for use on many
less difficult jobs.
Sulphur-base oils blended to suit with
from 5 to 20 parts of light mineral oil
are used in plants where a number of
different conditions are to be met, as
when machining numerous types of
metal at various speeds and combina-
tions of cuts. These blended oils are
more transparent.
Chlorinated oils were found to reduce
the power of metal cutting in turning
from 20 to 30 per cent of that for the oil
with no chlorine, yet the same value
of tool life for a given cutting speed
is obtained for both oils.
It is frequently found that a satis-
factory cutting fluid set-up is obtained
by the "cut and try" method. The keep-
ing of careful records of performance
in each plant is probably one of the
best ways to arrive at the most satis-
factory operating conditions.
Considering all factors involved in
the results produced by the application
of a cutting fluid, a general summary
might be made as follows:
1. The greatest function of a cutting
fluid is cooling, although lubrication
seems to play some small independent
part. The cutting fluid in some manner
affects the size of the built-up edge,
which, in turn, affects the finish pro-
duced, in a minor way.
2. Water usually produces a long
built-up edge which protects the tool
face from the sliding chip and, therefore,
gives a longer tool life than other types
of cutting fluids. A blast of cold air in-
creases tool life to some extent, and
water compounds or emulsions are bet-
ter than most oils. One cutting fluid may
give reduced power consumption in cut-
ting without giving longer tool life.
3. Lubricants are not necessarily the
best cutting fluids for producing a good
finish. Elements added to oils, such as
sulphur, chlorine, graphite, etc., may
improve finish.
4. A long tool life, a good surface
finish, well broken-up chips, and lower
power consumption are not interrelated.
They are independent factors, and the
cutting fluid must be selected to produce
the results most desired.
5. Cutting fluids to be most effective
should be applied in large quantities at
high velocities and maintained at rela-
tively low temperatures.

Last month considerable space was
devoted to a report of the recent Michi-
gan-Life conference on New Technolo-
gies in Transportation. All the material
presented then was of a very serious na-
ture, but now that we've had a chance
to recover from the strain we can recall
some of the lighter events of the meet-
ing.
For instance, we can still see the slide-
darkened Rackham Amphitheatre, and
hear Dr. Gustave Egloff as he punc-
tuated his speech with "Lights, please:
may we please have the lights?" A fran-
tic assistant was pleading with the time
rheostat, which refused to be hurried by
the punching of a button. Finally, mind
prevailed over technology, and a burst
of applause greeted the lights as the
conference returned to "Motor Fuels—
Present and Future."
befuddled juggler
A warm spot will always remain in
our memory, too, for Dr. McMath, who.
in some astounding moving pictures of
solar phenomena, gave the first public
demonstration of the only film of its
kind in the world. Professor A. D.
Moore, Master of Ceremonies at the
Samples of Science show at which this
film was shown, had been carrying on
the program all evening in fine style,
providing demonstrations of the molec-
ular theory, atom-smashing, and the
explanation of light waves, all with the
well planned use of his juggling ability.

He had been of inestimable value to all
the lectures preceding the one on astron-
omy, and so when Dr. McMath as-
cended to the Lydia Mendelssohn stage.
he too summoned the now weary A. D.
to the platform and put him through
his paces. Dr. McMath watched our
sweating hero for a few minutes in ap-
preciative silence, then turned to the
audience and said, "I've been trying all
evening to figure out some way to use
this in my demonstration, and Fll be
hanged if I can see how to do it!"
cherchez la ork
Now that the Engineering Ball has
departed into memory:—and a very
pleasant memory, too—it is safe to

record one little incident which at the
time struck those concerned neither as
little nor incidental.
Be informed, then, that at the time
when the ribbon-bedecked members of
the central committee and their guests
were sitting down around the table to
partake of a formal dinner, Clyde Lucas
and what Dean Stason would call his
"ork" had not yet put in an appearance,
nor was the ballroom decorated.
The table talk was all about how to
put on a dance with no music and none
of the usual ballroom paraphernalia.
Those who sat near Chairman Jim
Brown at the table will swear they saw
a hair or two turn white during the din-
ner.
It seems that when the committee ar-
rived to put up the decorations Friday
afternoon, the ballroom was filled with
desks and hard-working men. An at-
tendant coolly informed the committee
that a C. P. A. exam was in progress,
and would not be over until six-thirty.
The committee's formal banquet was at
seven-fifteen. Pandemonium ensued.
But those of you who went to the
dance know that the decorations were
complete and the orchestra did arrive.
Both events transpired at almost pre-
cisely nine o'clock.
Christmas
Until you've tried to do it at two
o'clock in the morning, you can't ima-
gine how difficult it is to think up a new
and original way of saying Merry
Christmas and a Happy New Year.
After about forty-five minutes of
racking what was left of our brain, we
began to understand why it is that so
many of those peculiar creatures who
write greetings for Christmas cards end
up in institutions.
We worried and worried about it un-
til we were on the verge of insanity our-
self. We tried substituting Joyous for
Merry and Prosperous for Happy and
all sorts of other synonyms, antonyms,
and pseudonyms, but eventually we con-
cluded that nothing is quite so sincere
and appropriate as the plain ordinary-
garden variety of greeting and so there
is nothing for it but to say Merry Christ-
mas and a Happy New Year.
Well, let's say it.
Merry Christmas and a Happy New-
Year!

Wing Design
(Continued from Page IT)
spars became obsolete when the appli-
cation of I-beam sections and the built-
up type of box spar was used. Wood
struts were hollowed and began to as-
sume a stream line form. Some struts
were composed of both wood and steel
to obtain lightness, strength, and good
aerodynamic shape. Several forms of
these struts are steel tubes with wood
fairings, streamlined hollow wood sec-
tions with steel tube inserts, and the
solid streamlined wood sections with
steel leading and trailing edges.
Heat treated steel and its alloys
found more use in wings and it was
rapidly being adopted for airplane con-
struction. Very efficient struts were
formed of heat-treated steel tubing while
similar tubing was employed in the trail-
ing edges of the wing for rigidity.
The greatest development was that of
duralumin and its application to all
metal planes. It had a tensile strength
of plain carbon steel and a modulus of
elasticity ]/) that of the same metal. A.
Wilm and associates developed dura-
lumin in Germany between 1900 and
1914.
The wing trusses found on the war
planes had been greatly modified with
respect to the early types. The external
truss was eliminated entirely on the Ger-
man all-metal monoplane by designing
the wing as a unit spar. Six duralumin
tubes formed the main span members of
this Junkers wing and were fastened to
the corrugated sheet metal covering of
the airfoil. They were interconnected
by numerous short members. These ma-
jor tubes had riveted steel sleeves which
were threaded and could be attached to
the fuselage by collar nuts. The ad-
vantage of this wing was its clean aero-
dynamic form.
The development of the modern air-
foil has created hundreds of forms.
There have been many refinements and
the general airfoil selection is made by
the designer first as to the classification
of the designed plane—whether commer-
cial, racing, or military. Then the se-
lection must be made for the airfoil of a
particular classification that will meet
the required performance characteris-
tics of the plan.
The use of the high taper wing for
strength and aerodynamic advantages
developed the problem of tip stall. This
problem could not be determined in the
laboratory. In actual tests on take-off
and landing it was found that the tips
would stall causing turbulent air around
the aileron which prevented lateral con-
trol. Through the use of wing slots and
flaps, aileron control is maintained be-
yond the stalled condition permitting
slower and safer landing speeds. Wing
slots were first devised by Handley-Page
and tested at the close of the World
War. Their extensive use on large com-
mercial land planes has increased the
operating safety and economy.
The problem of monoplane wing in-
terference at the root where drag existed
was considered important on commercial
transports in 1933. From personal ob-
servation and inquiry the author found
a certain airline (there were no doubt
several others) successfully obtaining
more economical operation from adding
fairing at the wing root.
The external trussing of the biplane
26
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


day the biplane utilizes very few struts
and tie wires. The use of lighter struc-
tural and lighter wing fitting materials
has increased the strength and rigidity,
permitting the modified form of truss.
The late development of the inter-
nally braced semi-cantilever wing has
shown amazing progress with the appli-
cation of the ferrous and non-ferrous
metals to wing construction. Attempts
to eliminate stress concentration by the
use of these metals in the box spar and
cylindrical spar design with stressed
skin wings has found great success.
Many considerations in the design of the
externally braced wings have been ap-
plied advantageously to the internally
braced wings. The variation in thick-
ness ratio along the span and the distri-
bution of loads on the spar for low and
high lift angles are the application of the
type previously mentioned.
The amazing development of the
semi-cantilever wing as to size and the
application of load distribution theory is
found in the Boeing 314, Atlantic Clip-
per, and the Barkley-Grow wings. The
dimensions of the Boeing 314 wing are:
span 152 ft., chord at tip and root re-
spectively 7'4", and 29'1". The airfoil
is the symmetrical type with stressed
skin construction on the forward part
to transmit the torsional and drag loads
to the rear spar. Dural tube and sheet
is used for the structure with fittings of
stainless steel. Steel tubing is employed
in the engine mounts and the center sec-
tion of the wing. The location of the
four engines, gasoline tanks, and the
landing gear in the wing have reduced
the root stress of the box spar.
The Barkley-Grow wing is consider-
ably advanced in design. This cellular
structure is made of lattice work which
tends to transmit the uniform loads of
the wing to the fuselage through several
members of this lattice construction.
The usage of the box spars with stiffen-
ed or cylindrical shaped monospars has
been directed towards a uniform load
distribution on the wing. The cellular
wing appears complicated from a struc-
tural point of view, but it is said to be
economically and efficiently produced.
A spectacular material which many
people hear of but are not fully ac-
quainted with may offer a revolutionary
wing, safer and more efficient, for future
planes. Plastics will be and are being
used for the construction of aircraft
wings. Here, then, is a new field, with a
host of new problems for the research
engineer to solve. &gt;$JR

drill revision
Members of the Reserve Officers
Training Corps are learning this year
the new drill recently adopted by the
United States Army. Emphasis is
shifted from the variety of movement
of larger units to the thorough train-
ing of the individual soldier. The drill
replaces the formations which stemmed
from the armies of Frederick the
Great, with more simple forms which
have the elasticity to meet the needs
of modern military practice. The basic
combat team, a squad, now moves as a
column of single men instead of in two
lines of fours, and the leader, a sergeant.

Rorcees
Emphasis now on the individual
28
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


while his assistant, a corporal, brings up
the rear. This drill form needs little
change to pass from precise disciplinary
movements to the utility forms for
loading men onto trucks, or marching at
night during blackouts. Further simpli-
fication is achieved by a reduction of
the cadence from 128 to 120 beats per
minute.
PROFESSIONAL
PRACTICE
THE Engineering Committee on
Professional Practice, in line with its
program for making students more cog-
nizant of one very important, if extra-
curricular, phase of their future work—
the problem of ethics—presents each
month a hypothetical but realistic sit-
uation, such as might be faced by any
engineer. A five dollar award is made
to the writer of the best solution each
month. The answers are judged by a
faculty board. There is not necessarily
any completely "correct" solution.
Judging will be based on reasonableness
and recognition of factors involved.
Answers this month should be addressed
to the "Contest Editor," Michigan
Technic, 3036 East Engineering
Building, Ann Arbor, Michigan, and
postmarked not later than December 15.
The winner will be announced, and
letters meeting the approval of the
Technic editors will be published, in
a later issue.
The Problem:
A young chemical engineer is em-
ployed by a city to test coal, fuel oil and
other supplies, prepare specifications
and compare materials offered. In test-
ing alum to be used in the water purifi-
cation plant he finds the best product is
that manufactured by a relatively small
and unknown plant. The purchasing
agent follows his recommendation and
places the order. A month later the
young chemist receives a check for a
sum larger than a year's salary, with a
letter explaining that it is the custom of
the company to pay its representatives
five per cent on sales and that since he
has been instrumental in securing this
unsolicited order they are pleased to
enclose their usual commission. What
should the young man do, both in jus-
tice to his employer and himself?

ganson taggart
Born in 1918, in a small suburb of
Albany, New York, Ganson Powers
("Gun") Taggart passed through a
relatively uneventful childhood, remem-
bered chiefly for Scouting activities.
Ganson belonged to a Scout Mounted
Troop, and developed a liking for camp-
ing; the latter hobby has paid dividends
in the form of three summers of re-
munerative work. At the customary
age, Taggart entered Milne High School
and took part in the numerous goings

Cun Taggart
One watchman who really watched
on there, being, at various times and
among other things: business manager
of newspaper, member of student coun-
cil, president of senior class, and mem-
ber of Adelphi Honor Society. He also
played around with photography, and
developed an interest in chemistry which
has lasted till the present time. In 1935
Gun enrolled in Phillip Exeter Acad-
emy, devoting himself there to lacrosse
and some advanced (for prep school)
chem courses.
After a year at Exeter, Taggart
deemed himself ready for Chemical En-
gineering and the University of Michi-
gan. His campus activity here has been
centered mainly about the Michigan
Daily and his fraternity. During the
first year, Sigma Rho Tau claimed him
as a neophyte; he also did sufficient
studying to make Phi Eta Sigma; and,
finally, he became a pledge at Psi Up-
silon. As a sophomore. Gun went out
for the business staff of the Daily, car-
rying on where his high school journal-
ism left off. This year he is assistant
business manager of that paper, presi-
dent of the Psi U house, a member of
Triangles, and treasurer of Vulcans.
Meanwhile, Taggart has been active
in intramural sports, besides holding va-
rious jobs at different times. He worked
for his board when a freshman, and the
next year worked in the Mosher-Jordan
sandwich shop, serving as night watch-
man there on Sundays. He claims he
was one watchman who really watched.
Last summer a job in the Kenwood Mills
laboratory provided a little practical
experience in Chemical Engineering. As
do so many chemicals and chemists, he
plans to take some graduate work, ob-
taining at least a Master's degree before
breaking into the industrial world.
professor bouchard
A career that parallels, perhaps as
closely as any, that of the romantic en-
gineer of fiction has been Harry Bou-
chard's. His work has taken him over
a good part of this continent and into
China. Perhaps this extensive traveling
was foreshadowed by his parentage, for
he was born on February 1, 1889, in
Michigan City, Indiana, the son of a
railroad conductor.
After preparatory training at Michi-
gan City and Detroit Central High, he
proceeded to earn a Bachelor's Degree
in Civil Engineering at the University of
Michigan. His sophomore and junior
summers were spent as a rodman on the
Michigan Central Railroad and as an
assistant at Camp Davis. Graduation in
1911 saw him start on his journeys with
a job as instrument man and draftsman
for a hydroelectric development on the
Savannah River. Then to Duluth, Min-
nesota, where he worked for G. S. Wil-
liams, former professor in the College of
Engineering. From there he moved on
about the country, finding time to get
married on December 26, 1913.
It was in September, 1918, that a
series of events brought Professor Bou-
chard to Michigan as an instructor.
Having just finished a job at Cheboy-
gan, he came to Ann Arbor for the
funeral of a friend. Here he met an
acquaintance who needed assistance cm
an engineering project near Detroit.
While working on this job, he got ac
invitation from the University to join
the faculty of the Department of Geod-
esy and Surveying, where there was a
shortage of men because of the war.
He served as assistant professor until
January, 1925, when he accepted the
position of Professor of Railway Engi-
neering at Pei Yang University in Tient-
sin, China. In the fall of the same year,
he first made personal contact with
Oriental revolution. Two armies were
fighting for control of Tientsin, and one
afternoon a car, in which was a group
of children including Bouchard's youns:
daughter, was commandeered by officers
of one army. The parents were frantic
for several hours, but all the children
were returned home safely that evening.
In February, 1928, the Bouchards
returned to the United States by way of
Europe. When they arrived, Prof.
Bouchard returned to his job as Assist-
ant Professor of Surveying, which he
held until he was made an Associate
Professor in September, 1929. He is
now also Acting Director at Camp
Davis; his book on "Surveying," pub-
lished in 1935, has been praised for its
clarity and accuracy. Honors conferred
upon him include membership in Tan

also belongs to the A.S.C.E. There are
two things that have made a great im-
pression on Prof. Bouchard since his
return to the University; they are the
higher cost of tuition and living today
as compared with his undergraduate
days, and the feeling of close-knitted-
ness of the Department of Civil Engi-
neering because of the contact between
students and professors during field trips
and at Camp Davis.
harry howell
It seems that we just cannot keep
these Union men out of "Presents," for
this month we give you another man
from that State Street institution:
Harry Howell, a Vice-President. Harry
came to Michigan in 1936 from Nutt
Terrace High School in Schenectady,
NT. Y., and, incidentally, he agrees that
his high school did have a rather odd
name. Apparently a talented person,
Harry went in for a number of diversi-
fied activities while in high school, in-
cluding the swimming team, string band,
school paper, class play, and some dance
committees.
When he came to Ann Arbor, Harry
went the way of all good engineering
freshmen and joined Sigma Rho Tau,
sticking with it for two years. He also
pledged Sigma Alpha Epsilon and in his
second semester went out for the Union.
In his Junior year he was on the Execu-
tive Council and distinguished himself
by being Ticket Chairman and directing
many other of the Union activities, in-
cluding the work on the Pictorial History
of Michigan which is on display in the
pool room. This year Harry is, of
course, a Vice-President of the Union,
and a member of the Judiciary Council.
He is also a member of Triangles and
Vulcans.
Harry is quite a hardy person. Rec-
ollections of his early childhood include
the chewing of ground glass and the eat-
ing of strychnine pills! One of his
favorite sports now is hunting small
game with the bow and arrow. He also
enjoys swimming, canoeing, and fishing,
and he makes many of his own flies. The

Harry Howell
Chewed ground glass
summer before coming here Harry spent
as a counselor in a summer camp. How-
ever, the following summer he worked in
the machine shops of the General Elec-
tric Company at Schenectady. His last
two summers were spent in the summer
school, which he thinks is a lot easier
than the regular session.
In connection with his interest in
canoeing, Harry recalls an interesting
trip he made up the Hudson River to
Lake Champlain in the summer of 1935.
The trip lasted about 35 days and Harry
and his companion ran out of money
and spent the last week and a half on
a scanty diet of crackers and milk.
Luckily for the two, Harry's friend had
some farming experience and the two
picked up a few odd jobs on farms and
managed to keep themselves going.
Harry lost twenty pounds by the time
the trip was over.
Harry, who is twenty-two years old,
is taking the combined course in Engi-
neering and Business Administration.
He is now in his last year in the Engine
School, but he will return next year in
the Business Administration School.
When he finishes up there he thinks he
would like to make a try at factory
management, particularly personnel
work. When queried as to his opinion
on the plan for a more liberal education
for engineers, Harry said that he thought
it was a "swell idea" and he would
endorse the five or six year program.

Tifity IftLtd JZine, PUaiel
STUDENTS probably do more ob-
jecting about the seats they get for
football games than any one other thing
concerning the University. Feeling that
so much concerted complaining could
hardly be groundless, we decided to in-
vestigate the matter.
First of all, on east and west sides of
the stadium put together there are only
twenty-five thousand seats between the
goal lines. Into these seats must go all
than twelve thousand students and fac-
ulty members, it is easier to understand
why one doesn't always get the best
seat in the stadium each game.
However, on one score the students
have a very legitimate complaint: fre-
quently freshmen receive better seats
than seniors. There are plenty of ex-
amples to prove that distribution is not,
as claimed, determined by the number
of years spent at Michigan, and within

The Michigan Stadium
One complaint is legitimate
the bondholders, the students and fac-
ulty, the members of the M club, and
the visiting rooters. These latter alone
frequently take a quarter of the avail-
able seats. Furthermore, all M club
members and bondholders are guaran-
teed seats on the Michigan side between
the forty yard lines. Considering all this,
and remembering that there are more
this classification by the order in which
applications are received.
But there is a simple enough explana-
tion for this, too. Many a freshman and
many a sophomore records himself as a
senior on the ticket applications. There
have been cases in which whole fraterni-
ties have filed as seniors in a block and
gotten away with it. It is easy to see
how receipt of fifty or sixty per cent of
the applications marked "senior" would
not only destroy one's faith in human
nature but wreck any plans for distri-
bution by classes.
Recognizing that not much can be
done about this under the present sys-
tem of distribution, we would like to
make the following recommendations for
future ticket allocation.
First, why not place upon that section
of the registration card which is ex-
changed for football ticket coupons a
statement as to when the student first
entered Michigan? This statement is
already placed in several other places on
the card, and it would be easy for the
cashier to note the accuracy of this one.
Second, print prominently upon the
coupons the number one, two, three,
four, five, or six to indicate the number
of years at Michigan. All students with
seven or more years to their credit would
be placed in the six year group, since
there are relatively few such students.
Third, when the student turns in his
registration card for his athletic coupon
book, he would be given a set of cou-
pons numbered corresponding to his
number of years at Michigan as indi-
cated by the registration card. Applica-
tions as received would be divided into
six groups accordingly, and filed in the
sequence received in each group. An
allotment would be made of the student
tickets, and the orders from the six
group would be filled first, then the
five, and so on down, tickets being
assigned in the order received in each
group.
The adoption of some such method
of ticket distribution as this should be
possible with only slight changes in the
present routine, and would assure fair
treatment of the students—who are.
after all, the people for whom the game
is ostensibly being played. -^5;

WHERE DEPENDABILITY COMES FIRST
The prime consideration to both manufacturer and
user of a light plane engine, is dependability. And
among the vital factors in insuring dependable per-
formance are the materials specified.
That is why a prominent manufacturer of light
plane motors uses Chrome-Molybdenum (SAE 4140)
steel for crankshafts and certain accessory gears and
shafts.
Experience proves that, when properly heat treated,
the steel develops the requisite combination of duc-
tility, impact strength and fatigue strength with hard-
ness. Out of this combination of mechanical proper-
ties comes the essential dependability. In addition,
the steel machines well at the specified hardnesses.
Detailed information on Chrome-Molybdenum
(SAE 4140) and other Molybdenum steels important in
aircraft construction will be found in our booklets
"Molybdenum in Steel" and "Aircraft Steels". Both
are free on request to technical students and all others
interested in modern materials for modern needs.

This investigator is developing a use for a chemical
by-product for which there is no market in its present
form. It is being turned into a product which is market-
able. An important result of the development is the
elimination of the cost of disposal of the waste product,
but more important is the fact that the product can
be sold at a profit.
If you have any production processes which result
in waste products, research may turn them into dividend
producers for you.

paved the way for modern industries.
a S recently as IS years ago only two
Xjl types of steel were available for
high temperature applications. When
plain carbon steel was not suitable, be-
cause of its insufficient strength or lack
of surface stability, it was believed that
the highly alloyed austenitic or ferritic
type materials had to be used. Since the
price differential between these two
groups was large, being of the order of
1 to IS, progress was retarded in those
industries requiring the use of high
temperatures and pressures.
Starting about 1928, extensive investi-
gations were undertaken to determine
the influence of alloy additions upon the
high temperature strength characteristics
and, soOn after, relatively low alloyed,
and thus comparatively inexpensive,
steels were developed for high tempera-
ture service. This development program
is still in progress and each year new
steels are being added to the list. One
steel manufacturer has just published
the fourth edition of its Digest of
Steels for High Temperature Service,
and this contains twenty-three different
analyses, twelve of which would be
classified as of the low alloyed type, ten
of the intermediate type, and one
austenitic.
The fact that so many steels are now
available might at first appear to be
confusing, but if proper attention is
given to the influence of alloy additions,
such is not the case. Insofar as high
temperature applications are concerned,
one convenient method of classifying
alloying elements is on the basis of
whether they form carbides or go into
solid solution in the matrix. Examples
of carbide formers are chromium,
molybdenum, tungsten, vanadium, man-
ganese, columbium and titanium; while
representative solid solution elements
are chromium, nickel, manganese, sili-
con, aluminum and copper. It is appar-
ent from this grouping that certain ele-
ments, such as chromium, fall in both
classes. In other words, after a certain
amount has combined with the carbon,
the remainder goes into solid solution.
Likewise it is now recognized that the
high temperature strength can be in-
creased by the addition of carbide form-
ing elements while the surface stability,
that is, the resistance to oxidation and
corrosion, is improved by the solid solu-

tion elements. In this respect, however,
some knowledge must be had as to the
characteristics of the individual ele-
ments in order to know which will be
the most effective for the given purpose.
For example, it is known that the resist-
ance to the corrosive attack of hot pe-
troleum products is proportional to the
chromium content, although this resist-
ance can be further improved by the
addition of other elements such as sili-
con and aluminum. Likewise, while
chromium by itself, at least in amounts
up to 6.0 percent, does not impart suf-
ficient oxidation resistance, very high
resistance to scaling can be obtained by
the further addition of the proper
amount of silicon, or silicon plus alumi-
num.
Neither can any of the elements be
added indiscriminately, for it is generally
true that certain critical amounts are
required in order to impart the most de-
sirable characteristics. In the case of the
carbide forming elements, not only does
the strength fall off beyond a certain
addition, but a two phase structure is
apt to result due to the steel being
placed beyond the gamma loop. If this
happens, then free ferrite appears which
remains unchanged as the steel is heated
through the critical range and thus it is
not subject to grain refinement by the
usual methods of heat treatment.
In addition to possessing sufficient
strength and surface stability at the pro-
posed operating temperature, the steel
must not undergo embrittlement during
JANUARY, 1940
7


embrittlement is marked in the straight
chromium steels but can be eliminated
by the addition of molybdenum. Like-
wise, in many applications it is desired
that the steel not undergo pronounced
air hardening after cooling from above
the critical range, such as in welding.
can be one containing 0.15 per cent
carbon, 5.0 per cent chromium, 1.5 per
cent silicon, 0.50 per cent molybdenum,
and 0.50 per cent columbium. The car-
bide forming elements, chromium,
molybdenum, and columbium, increase
the high temperature strength but
chromium also improves the resistance

Central Station

Air hardening results from the dis-
persion of hard carbides, such as chro-
mium carbide, through the matrix and
this tendency can be decreased by either
of two methods: removal of the carbon
from the field of reaction or the elim-
ination of the critical range. The ad-
dition of relatively small amounts of
columbium, or titanium, decreases the
hardness because of the fact that the
carbides formed are very insoluble, and
for all practical purposes have the same
influence as though the carbon content
of the steel were greatly reduced. If
these elements are added beyond a cer-
tain amount, however, then it has the
effect of throwing the steel beyond the
gamma loop and thus eliminating the
critical range. Other elements which
can be used for eliminating the critical
range are aluminum, vanadium, molyb-
denum, silicon and chromium. Elements
which counteract this effect are carbon,
nickel, manganese and cobalt.
In order to summarize the preceding
discussion, it might be well to select a
typical analysis for a high temperature
steel and to explain the purpose of each
of the elements present. Such a steel
to corrosion and oxidation, while molyb-
denum eliminates the susceptibility to
temper-embrittlement and columbium
decreases the air hardening character-
istics. The increased silicon content
greatly improves the resistance to oxi-
dation. In fact, this steel with normal
silicon content, 0.50 per cent maxi-
mum, would scale badly at 1200 de-
grees Fahrenheit, but with the given
amount of this element it scales little
in air even at 1500 degrees Fahrenheit.
Available information indicates that in
chromium bearing steels, silicon is seven
times as powerful as chromium in im-
parting oxidation resistance.
The most suitable steel for a given
high temperature application depends
entirely upon the conditions which are
to be encountered in service. In central
steam stations, the most widely used
alloy steel at the present time is plain
carbon steel to which 0.50 per cent
molybdenum has been added. This is
true because in the more modern plants
steam temperatures of 900 to 950 de-
grees Fahrenheit are now being used and
at these temperatures the addition of
this amount of molybdenum greatly
improves the resistance to deformation.
The surface stability of this steel, while
no better than that of plain carbon steel,
is ample for this application.
In the petroleum industry the choice
of steel depends largely upon the type
crude being processed. If the crude
is "sweet," that is, only mildly corrosive,
then a chromium content of 1 to 2 per
cent would be sufficient. If, on the
other hand, the crude is extremely sour
(badly corrosive), then a chromium
content of 9.0 per cent might be
needed. Intermediate crudes would re-
quire a chromium content between these
two extremes, that is, between 2.0 and
9.0 per cent. All of these steels would
likewise contain molybdenum, to im-
prove the strength and eliminate the
susceptibility to temper-embrittlement.
Up to recently, the amount used for this
purpose was generally 0.50 per cent,
although recently steels have become
available with 1.0 and 1.5 per cent mo-
lybdenum. These steels may likewise
contain silicon content to improve the
resistance to oxidation and corrosion
and columbium to eliminate the pro-
nounced air hardening characteristics.
The chemical industry generally re-
quires steels with a high resistance to
corrosion and consequently they may
contain chromium in amounts up to 28
per cent, depending upon the severity of
the conditions. Again, however, the
steels should also contain elements such
as molybdenum, silicon, and columbium
to eliminate certain of the detrimental
characteristics of the straight chromium
steels and to improve their strength.
Many of the higher chromium steels
likewise contain an increased nitrogen
content, mainly for the purpose of grain
refinement.
In addition to the characteristics al-
ready listed, one other important factor
must be considered in the selection of
steels for high temperature service—
that is cost. The ideal steel for any
given application is of course the one
which will render satisfactory service at
the lowest cost per day. Unlike the ma-
jority of applications at room tempera-
ture, it is generally found that each high
temperature application, especially in
the petroleum industry, must be consid-
ered separately due to the many varia-
bles present, both in the crude being pro-
cessed and in the operating details. It
is for this reason that such a large num-
ber of different steels are justified and it
is up to the operator to select from this
list the one which will most economi-
cally meet his requirements.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


a job—and who doesn't?—
some brief, pointed ideas.
'Paat Sit:
YOU do not know how to write a job-
hunting letter. That goes, literally,
for nine of you out of ten. And you had
better learn. Last week I sat in the office
of a Detroit business man, who had ad-
vertised for an engineering sales assist-
ant. He showed me a stack of letters of
application. Except for about two let-
ters, the stack was not worth the trouble
involved in pushing it into the waste
basket.
When you write that letter, either
conform to business usage and put it on
8.5 by 11, or don't write it. Never write
it on someone else's stationery. Ordinary
business correspondence never appears
except in typed form. Neither should
yours. You may type the letter yourself
if you can do a good job that is no com-
promise with shoddiness in any respect;
otherwise, get somebody to type it for
you. Let handwriting be but a reluct-
antly adopted alternative. If you must
write by hand, either do a good job or
let it go.
Imagination and the creative instinct
are valuable assets, but not when ap-
plied to the formal parts of a letter of
application. Please, please do not
assume that you know all about this
letter business. Get a copy of Hadida's
Pitfalls in English (Putnam) or some
such manual, and find out exactly how
these things are done. While on a tender
subject, what of your spelling? Think
of the graduates who have written back
to me and spelled it ''Proffesor." Note
the many seniors who write "proceed-
ure." Dwell on the case of the man who
spends four years playing with our
apparatus, and still writes and speaks
of "lavatory," meaning laboratory. The
pertinent question is: are you wise
enough to know that your spelling is
shaky somewhere, and do you know
enough to have a friend check over your
letters before you send them?
Letter Content
Design the letter with care. Very
often, the purpose of the letter is to
secure an interview. The almost invari-
able rule is: no interview, no job. Hiring
BY POPULAR DEMAND
Ever since "Dear Sir" and "Good
Morning, Sir" appeared in the TECHNIC
in 1935, we have received favorable com-
ments from many students who have made
good use of the material presented.
The articles were reprinted in numer-
ous other publications and we have fre-
quently been asked to run them again.
Because we feel that they constitute one
of the briefest and best bits of informa-
tion on the important subject of contacts
with prospective employers, we are doing
so now.
Professor Moore points out when a can-
didate (senior or graduate) for employ-
ment makes up his typed personal record,
his most usual omissions are date of the
record and preferences.
Here is the first of the two articles.
The second will appear next month.
sight unseen is extremely rare. When
your letter gets there, it is the only
thing there to represent you. Unless it
is one of the few that commands atten-
tion and earns respect, you are accept-
ing an almost insurmountable handicap
from the very start. The interview is not
granted. Or if it is, the employer is
likely to sit before you, constantly re-
minding himself that "this is the chap
who used his girl's perfumed stationery:
his fountain pen ran out halfway, mak-
ing it a two-color job; he failed to get
my title right; he ended in a rush with
'Very truly yrs.'; yes, I remember this
man's letter."
What to say? So many exceptions
come in, that the subject is too broad to
attempt writing comprehensive rules
here. Carefully think out the minimum
requirements; find the things you must
say, then say them concisely and clearly.
Beyond such a limit you hardly dare
go, unless you are one of the few, blessed
with imagination, good taste, and ma-
turity of judgment, who knows he can
add touches lending a personal distinc-
tion to an otherwise prosaic document.
If you can do this, it is invaluable. If
not, emphatically do not try it; it would
turn an otherwise successful business
letter into something ludicrous.
Some day, as an engineer, you will
have to send an engineering report by
mail. The situation also calls for a letter
of transmittal. You would not dream of
thinking that, since you must write a
letter anyway, you should recast the
whole report and shove it bodily into the
letter of transmittal. Now, a similar
mistake can be made if you try to cram
all the factual data about yourself into
your letter of application. If you had
an engineering report on yourself, you
would mail it to the employer, and your
letter of transmittal would become a
letter of application. This brings us to—
The Typed Personal Record
The personal record may be thought
of as a special form of engineering
report. Its subject is—you. It is typed.
It is in outline form. Every item is so
presented as to be easily found. It must
always give the minimum required facts.
It may contain more, depending on your
judgment. The form, the general appear-
ance, the sequence of classifications—
Yours very truly,

that should be your own. A wide latitude
exists within which your material can be
suitably arranged. Do not make your
job look exactly like one you have seen;
consciously make it your own, to give
it individuality. That the paper should
be standard size need not be mentioned.
The personal record may vary from
one to five pages in length. Many recent
graduates who have filed records with

Motor News
Summer Jobs
Employers are interested
me usually manage to cover between
one and two pages. A graduate ten years
but may have to adopt an ingenious
tabulating scheme to compress his varied
experiences into an acceptably short
document.
The record serves at least three
needs. It enables you. perhaps for the
first time, to know your own experi-
ence, training, education, and value.
When a copy is filed with your faculty
placement officer, you are giving him
just the fine cooperation he needs in
helping to place you now or later. And
a copy placed with the employer pre-
sents you to him in the form of a high-
grade report. These needs indicate the
content.
Content of the Personal Record
1. Photograph. Perhaps the home
town paper honored your departure for
college with a story, and wisely included
a picture to prove to the incredulous
that there was no mistake in identity.
Of course, you saved a clipping. Leave
it intact: that half-tone print will not
serve here. As a senior, you are being
photographed for the 'Ensian, to a size
of 4 by 6. In general, that is too large.
Get a relatively inexpensive photograph
made, size 3 by 4 or a little smaller.
Never send a snapshot or a bad photo-
graph; omit entirely rather than com-
promise. Never place the picture on
the record so that it will be folded and
creased in mailing.
2. Personal Facts. Such items as
name, address, telephone number, date
of the record itself, your age at that
date, place of birth, height, weight, state
of health, whether married, whether
there are children or other dependents
—these usually head the record in out-
line form.
3. Affiliations. Memberships in honor
and professional societies are given.
4. Education, Training. The high
school may or may not be mentioned.
The college, degree, and date of gradua-
tion must be given. A breath-taking
omission occurred when one of our
graduates remembered everything ex-
cept to say in his record, that he ever
graduated anywhere. Advanced degrees
are of course mentioned. Any special
training, such as one gets within numer-
ous industrial training set-ups, is set
forth.
Under Education, some go so far as
to list all college courses taken. Probably
the typical employer would consider this
as going too far with detail. However,
a selected list of courses considered
most valuable and which might be most
pertinent for a certain kind of employ-
ment ought to go in.
5. Experience. Err on the side of
completeness. Tell the jobs you have
held before, during, and after college.
One little item, such as selling groceries
one summer, may seem insignificant to
you; it may turn out to be the very
thing that separates you from the group
of applicants and hands you the job.
Selling groceries is sales experience, it
means getting along with fellow hustlers,
and it involves meeting the customers—
pleasant, cantankerous, and all kinds
between. Did you earn college expenses
on some menial job in the hospital?
Then you are one of the very few grad-
uates having any kind of extended hos-
pital contact whatever. A manufacturer
of therapeutic apparatus might want
you for design, development, or sales.
Companies making unusual finishes,
paints, flooring materials, sound absorp-
tion materials, surgical supplies—all
these would prefer a man who had hap-
pened to spend four years working in
any capacity in a hospital, to others
who had not.
6. Activities. (Remember, the se-
quence of divisions is up to you; if you
prefer to list Activities right below
Education, do so. I'm putting them
here to be sure they get into the story.)
Class offices, memberships and offices
held in societies and student activities—
all should be mentioned. Does every
employer expect that all his recruited
graduates shall have a long record of
activities? Not at all. Some would pay
no attention to it. A few might even
object to it, when looking for a certain
type of man. Most of them will tolerate
a decent amount of activity background,
and many will insist on some.
7. New Objects Planned, Designed,
or Built. Here we come to the gadgets.
Many seniors have been tinkering for
years, planning or building model en-
gines, model aiqilanes, radio sets, and
so on. Make clear those that were really
built, as against those that never got
beyond the design stage. The late B.
G. Lamme, so long and so eminently the
chief engineer for Westinghouse Electric,
interviewed thousands of graduates. He
always inquired into this kind of self-
imposed activity. He considered it
essential to the make-up of every to-be-
successful engineer. It may well be that
he gave the matter undue emphasis; but
due to his influence, you may be assured
that manj' employers of engineers think
the same way about it.
8. Special interests. You can bring
these out strikingly, in part, by putting
red stars on those courses (under Edu-
cation) whose content most represents
the lines you wish to follow. A foot-
note can explain the stars. Then, in a
paragraph or two, state your special
interests. One of our men roomed in
the house of a married "Medic" student:
due to long talk-fests there, and with
other particular motivations, he took an
unusual dose of work in the Arts college.
He wound up with a permanent and
informed interest in sociology, mental
hygiene, medicine, medical apparatus:
and said so in his personal record.
Another man stated that he had been
reading Lester's Marketing Industrial
Equipment on his own time, and had
been following current articles along the
same line. Since he wished to locate in
sales engineering, he had listed a valu-
able special interest in an up-to-the-
minute way.
9. Preferences. You may hesitate to
mention two or three or four preferences,
fearing that some employer may pass
you up if the opening he has does not
quite fit your desires. Indeed, the fear
may be justified. But you can hardly
leave him completely in the dark; he is
quite likely to do the same to you—
10
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


to ask you to come across the state for
an interview, only to find that you don't
want his sales job. On the positive side,
if he is looking for a production man,
and you have said you wanted to be one,
you begin to get together with him right
away. Of course, preferences are to be
stated in general, functional terms. An
older man may properly say he wishes
to design fractional horsepower motors;
that is his line, and has been for years.
You will say, as a recent graduate, that
you want design of small rotating appa-
ratus. And put down about three pref-
erences, not just one. It is seldom neces-
sary to state negatives. However, if you
positively will not consider something—
such as sales—say so.
10. References. It is customary to
cite as references, one or more of the
men you have already worked for. They
are used to these matters, and will take
it as a matter of course. As a college
man, such references will not complete
your list. You must not fail to refer to
at least one faculty member. Otherwise,
the employer will assume that for some
reason that ought to be smoked out, you
left college under such a cloud that you
would rather not have your name
brought up on the campus any more
than can be helped. That isn't the case
—but what is he to think? No, you do
not need to ask permission of any
faculty member in order to refer to him.
Whether or not you ask him about it,
he will be glad to respond to inquiries,
and he will tell the facts as he sees them
in either case. Xow, there is often good
reason for asking him first: you thus
make more certain that he really will
remember you. It lessens the chance
that in a couple of years he will be
mistaking you for the classmate of
about the same size, weight, and degree
of difficulty in keeping awake in that
early afternoon class.
11. (....?) Write your own ticket.
It is by no means intended that when
ten categories are listed above, you will
faithfully have all ten—no more, no less.
Make the job your own. And after
reading this, do not get in wrong by
trying to bedevil some poor faculty
member into telling you in detail how
to do it. Get to work and design the
record. Type it to see how it will look.
Then, if you wish, take it to a faculty
member and ask for suggestions.
It is entirely legitimate to get all the
ideas you can from personal records al-
ready available. We have plenty on file
in the E.E. Department. The secretary
in room 274 (mornings only) will be
glad to let you look at several at your
leisure.
To close this matter of personal rec-
ords, a striking instance may be cited.
A recent graduate carefully informed
himself before he left the campus. He
shortly sent me one of the best records
I have ever seen. A few days later he
called on a certain firm in his home city,
and handed a copy to the girl. She
cheerfully passed it in to the chief engi-
neer, and promised it would receive at-
tention. However, she told the graduate
not to wait. It was not customary to
grant an interview the same day. He
chose to wait anyway. In live minutes
he was called in. He answered three
questions and in ten more minutes was
hired. Total elapsed time, fifteen min-
utes. He's there yet.
Author's 1940 Addendum . . .
In the spring of 1939, I made a study
of the content of interview and applica-
tion blanks of 21 companies. I have not
seen such a study published anywhere;
this is the first publication of the present
study.
Forty-two items were found that are
of significance in the placement of col-
lege seniors. Omitted are some items
that apply mainly to older men—such
as Number of Children: also omitted
are items of significance only to non-
collegiate men.
The table presents (at top) the confi-
dential key numbers of 21 companies,
and (at left) the 42 items. A blank
space means that the company did not
include that item. It is amusing to
note that one of the largest firms in the
world forgot to ask for Height and
Weight.
Companies 1-3 are automotive; 4-11,
chemical; 12-13, electrical; 14-17, me-
chanical; 18-19, steel; 20-21, optical
and business machines.

JANUARY, 1940


the people of the United States en-
tered a war for which they were woe-
fully unprepared. The war department
itself, because of lack of experience, only
added to the confusion of industrial and
economic America at that time. The
folly of permitting our country to drift
into war without making adequate pro-
vision for the coordination of industry
was soon very apparent to our people
and our leaders. It is needless to say
that many faults were corrected. At the
end of the war, American industry had
been remolded into a compact, smoothly
running machine—a true war industry.
The past war brought a realization
that lack of adequate plans for indus-
trial coordination and military procure-
ment was a source of many evils. Among
these were the waste of resources in over
production, the shortage of essential
items, and long delays in the procure-
ment of munitions. Competitive buying
by the individual supply services from
the same manufacturers was an addi-
tional source of waste.
As a result of these difficulties, it was
decided that never again should our na-
tion be caught thus unprepared. On
June 4, 1920, the National Defense Act
was passed. In it was a tremendously
important section called The Industrial
Mobilization Plan, which is a peacetime
preparedness plan designed to correct
the evils mentioned above.
The plan is roughly divided into two
parts, one of which deals with procure-
ment and the other with control of eco-
nomic resources and the mobilization of
industry. In formulating the measure, it
was necessary to consider the demands
made upon industry by both the Army
and the Navy. To coordinate the needs
of the two services, an Army and Navy
Munitions Board was provided for.
Practically all peacetime planning is au-
thorized by this board. In the event of
war, it will continue to act as a procure-
ment coordination agency but will also
be the nucleus for the formation of the
War Resources Administration. The
latter body will direct the actual war-
time functioning of all industrial activi-
ties.
Three main steps are to be followed
in wartime procurement planning after
the Army and Navy General Staffs have
tendered the military program that is to
be followed. The first is the calculation
of the primary requirements of articles
to be issued. From this, an analysis of
the individual items into their require-
ments for labor, raw materials, trans-
portation, and funds is to be made.
Secondly, apportionment of these items
to War Department Procurement Dis-
tricts and to individual supply branches
will be worked out. Lastly, the alloca-
tion of the actual manufacturing plans
to industry by the joint Army and Navy
Munitions Board through the medium
of the supply services involved will be
made.
In order to secure a fair distribution
of the industrial and economic load to
all sections, the country has been di-
vided into fourteen procurement dis-
tricts. Under the direction of the dis-
trict chiefs, a survey of the manufactur-
ing facilities in each section is being
carried on continuously. Along with the
possible use of a plant for the manu-
facture of war materials, care must be
taken to leave a sufficient portion of each
plant for ordinary commercial produc-
tion. Provision for the stepping up of
activity is planned at the same time to
take care of not only the military load
but also the increased commercial re-
quirements naturally ensuing.
Probably the most important duty
of the Munitions Board is the allotting
of facilities. This involves the assign-
ment of definite pre-surveyed facilities
to an authorized procurement agency for
the purpose of supplying the needs of a
particular department. The supply serv-
ices of various departments make re-
quests to prepare certain industrial con-
cerns for their probable duties in war-
time. The Munitions Board has to de-
cide which department should be allotted
the facijities. When a department has
been assigned certain plants in a district,
How our nation can be rapidly
and efficiently re-geared to
produce the needs of war.

Industrial Plant
How much of this production capacity could be spared?
it must make the necessary contracts
with the manufacturers. Investigation
of the present equipment has already
been made by the district chief, and now
further planning in regard to actual
wartime duties must be carried out.
When complex non-commercial items
must be produced, the job of planning
becomes much more difficult. In the
Army alone there are seven supply
branches: the Quartermasters, Ordnance,
Signal Corps, Engineering, Medical
C orps, Air Service, and Chemical War-
fare branches. In many of these, the
requirements are strictly commercial
in nature, and thus may be supplied
through stimulation of peacetime in-
dustry. However, in the Ordnance
Service, and in some other branches,
the requirements are greatly different
from the peacetime products. The con-
struction of new plants and the ex-
tension and conversion of others will be
necessary to meet the needs of these
latter services should war come. As in
all other cases, such plans are all ready.
The great industrial changes neces-
sary in the event of war may bring with
them damaging effects with a possible
dangerous upsetting of our economic
equilibrium. The President of the United
States has the job of solving the many
problems arising in this connection. The
size of this task makes it imperative that
a wartime chief executive be aided by a
special organization. The existing cabi-
net is not adaptable to the duties this
organization will be called upon to per-
form; therefore provision has been made
to establish a War Resources Adminis-
tration when war is imminent.
This body is by no means the only
new administration provided for in the
Industrial Mobilization Plan. However,
the other bodies will require definite leg-
islative authority for their establish-
ment. In the interim, the War Resources
Administration will perform the initial
duties necessary to bridge over the
transition period from peace to war.
Thus the plans are in readiness for
handling the tremendous problem of
adapting our country to wartime condi-
tions. Every effort is being made to
keep them up to date and to make cer-
tain in every way possible that the
mistakes of the past war will not be re-
peated. To this end government officials,
industrial leaders, and the public are
cooperating in every way possible.
In conclusion, one very important
point should be emphasized. It is neither
the intention or desire of the executive
branch of our government to try to dam-
age or wreck industries through these
mobilization and production plans.
Manufacturers will not be permitted to
devote even half of their peace time re-
sources to the production of war sup-
plies. Some patriotic industrialists de-
voted most of their resources to the pro-
duction of munitions in the World War
and found in the end that they had lost
their peace time business. This is not to
be encouraged or even permitted. Not
even all manufacturers who wish to
be included in the war plans are ac-
cepted.

hind salt in which the
engineer plays the lead.
Salt Mining
By
D. W. KAUFMANN, '20E
Miners at Work
Oddly enough, exactly like coal

'"THE State of Michigan leads all
-*- others in salt production, and a
check of the United States records for
the last eighty years shows that the
leadership was relinquished only four-
teen times—in each case to the same
rival, New York State.
Geologically speaking, the different
rock layers of Southern Michigan may
be compared to a pile of saucers of a
size covering the entire state. Each
layer, or saucer, of rock is shallowest at
the edges of the state, and dips inward
and downward toward the center of the
state. The rocks themselves are in gen-
eral composed of alternate layers of
limestone, dolomite, shale or sandstone:
the whole covered by a mantle of sur-
fac? clay, sand and gravel.
One of the rock forma-
tions, the Salina, of Silurian
age, is composed of alternat-
ing layers of rock salt, shale
and dolomite, the aggregate
depth of all the salt layers
being several hundred feet,
although the depth of any
one layer may vary from a
fraction of an inch up to 25
feet or 30 feet. This salt oc-
curs under all of the South-
ern peninsula of Michigan,
except the southwestern por-
tion. Being well below the
surface of the ground, the
salt deposits are protected
from the solvent action of
the rain and ground water.
At Detroit, Michigan, the
first salt bed is found at a
depth of about 900 feet. If
this particular stratum is
followed diagonally north-
west across the state, it will
be found at a depth of about
4500 feet at Midland, due to
the saucer shape formation
of the rock layers. It will
then rise to approximately
2000 feet depth at Manistee.
The Michigan salt produc-
tion from the Salina forma-
tion is obtained in two dif-
ferent ways—by evapora-
tion of brine, and by mining
of rock salt.
To obtain evaporated salt,
wells are drilled down to
tap the salt deposit, and
water is forced down to dis-
solve the salt. The resultant
brine is raised to the sur-
face, and evaporated by

one or two different methods. One
method is to evaporate the brine under
vacuum, to produce the familiar salt we
use on the table. A second evaporating
method is the use of shallow exaporating
pans, operating at atmospheric pressure.
This produces the so-called grainer salt,
having a very flaky texture, and used
principally in the meat packing industry.
Evaporated salt is produced at Port
Huron, St. Clair, Manistee, and in the
Saginaw valley, by the evaporation of
well brines. Wells are likewise used at
Wyandotte and at Midland for brines
for chemical manufacture.
In contrast to the above, rock salt is
produced by sinking a shaft down to the
salt formation, and sending miners un-
derground to remove the salt in solid
form, in exactly the same way as coal is
mined. Note that both rock salt and
evaporated salt are produced from the
same stratum of underground salt.
Up to 1910, all Michigan salt produc-
tion was evaporated salt. However, in
1906 a radical change was initiated in
the Michigan salt industry, in that shaft
sinking was begun, to reach the salt
deposit and mine the rock salt.
Innumerable difficulties were encoun-
tered in this pioneering work, including
quick-sand conditions, enormous flows
of water, particularly in the Sylvania
sandstone 420-430 feet down, hydrogen
sulphide gas, etc. However, by 1910 a
6x16 foot three-compartment shaft was
finished and the production of rock salt
begun.
Detroiters in general do not realize
that for the last thirty years, a salt
mine has been operating inside the city
limits of Detroit. This of course is be-
cause rock salt is not ordinarily sold as
such to the individual citizen, but is
used only in manufacturing or food in-
dustries. In the last five or six years,
however, Michigan citizens have become
far more conscious of the rock salt in-
dustry due to the widespread applica-
tion of the salt for ice removal on city
streets and sidewalks. This Detroit mine
is the only rock salt mine in the central
states. The nearest rock salt mines are
in New York State in the East, Kansas
in the West and Louisiana in the South.
Some years after the original shaft
was sunk, a test shaft from the then
existing mine workings showed the pres-
ence of a thicker and purer vein of salt,
about 200 feet lower down. Accordingly,
in 1922, a new shaft 16 feet in diameter
was sunk to this lower salt deposit,
which is now mined exclusively.
The salt vein in which mining opera-
tions are now conducted is about 26 feet
thick, with a shale capping and a shale
floor. From 12 to 18 inches of salt is
left in both roof and floor, to avoid
mining out particles of shale which
would have to be removed later. The
roof of the mine is 1124 feet down from
the shaft collar, at the surface.
The salt is mined by the room and
pillar method, the rooms being about 50
feet square and the pillars 40 feet
square. A map of the mine appears
somewhat like an evenly laid out city,
with the streets (the mined out rooms)
50 feet wide, and the blocks of houses

(the pillars) 40 feet square. Today the
total length of the "streets" would add
up to well over twenty miles.
Rock salt is fairly brittle when in
small lumps, and can be crushed by
sledge blows, but in massive form in the
mine it is considerably harder than coal,
and a hard blow with a pickaxe may
indent it only an inch or so.
The first mining operation is under-
cutting, and consists in cutting out a
horizontal slice of salt along the floor of
a 50 foot room. This slice or kerf is
about 6 inches high, and extends about
7 feet into the face of the rock salt wall.
Its purpose is to give expansion room
for the salt mass which is broken down
by the subsequent blasting; otherwise
more blasting powder would have to be
used to break the salt away from the
solid main mass.
The second mining operation is drill-
ing, which is performed by electrically
rotating augers, much like large di-
ameter carpenter's wood augers, 9 feet
long. The number of holes, and location,
and the angle at which they enter the
solid salt mass are all scientifically de-
termined, in order to break down the
maximum amount of salt with the least
expenditure of powder, and at the same
time produce a minimum amount of fine
salt dust.
The third mining operation is blast-
ing, performed by loading the holes with
special strength blasting powder, and
exploding this with electric detonators.
The shooting is done by special powder-
men on the night shift, after the balance
of the miners have left the working
faces.
The blasted-down salt is loaded into
trains of cars hauled by electric locomo-
tives on narrow gauge trolley tracks.
The loading is done by mechanical shov-
els of two types. One type is hydro-elec-
trically operated, and the other is the
large size three-quarter cubic yard elec-
tric shovel such as is seen in gravel pits
and quarries. The scale of the mine op-
erations, and the height of the roof can
best be appreciated by seeing these large
shovels in operation underground.
The only water entering the mine is
seepage coming down the shaft. This
water is conducted to the bottom, and
periodically pumped to the surface. The
ventilation is taken care of by forcing
air down with a fan. The air passes
down a special duct in the shaft, and
is led through special ventilating pas-
sages to the portion of the mine furthest
from the shaft. Here the air is released
to sweep freely through the workings,
back to the shaft and to the surface
again. The returning air carries back
the fumes from blasting, combustion
products from carbide lamps, etc. The
mine temperature is extremely equitable
and comfortable, being 55 to 60 degrees
Fahrenheit the year around. The combi-
nation of fresh air, comfortable temper-
ature, freedom from dust, and cleanli-
ness and purity of the salt surroundings
themselves all contribute to make ideal
working conditions.
All power is electric. 4400 volt alter-
nating current is brought underground
to a sub-station and converted to 250
volt direct current, to operate the elec-
tric locomotive trolley system, and the
mining machinery.
The mine is electrically lighted
throughout, with the exception of areas
immediately adjacent to the working
faces, where carbide lamps are used.
Processing of the rock salt is rela-
tively simple, requiring only crushing,
removal of shale, and screening. The
mine-run rock salt consists of ungraded
material just as it is broken down by
the blasting, and ranges from lumps 2
feet or more in diameter down to im-
palpable dust.
The skips of salt hoisted from the
mine are dumped into a hopper from

goes to a jaw crusher, the product of
which is also hand picked, and then fed
to a smaller jaw crusher. This latter
crusher product also goes to the breaker,
together with the screen undersize.
The entire crushed and picked ton-
nage thus enters the breaker, where the
greater hardness of the shale lumps and
salt impregnated with shale is utilized
to separate such material from the pure
salt. The resistant shaly material passes
through the breaker in comparatively
uncrushed condition, and is discarded.
The pure, brittle salt lumps break up to
such a point that they pass through the
breaker screen.
This latter crushed and processed
material is then ready for screening.
Four commerial sizes are produced; the
largest or No. 2 grade being %e inch
maximum diameter. The next smaller or
No. 1 grade has a maximum diameter of
inch. Next is the CC grade with a
maximum diameter of four mesh. The
finest, or FC grade consists of every-
thing through a ten mesh screen.
After screening, the salt goes to stor-
age bins for loading into railroad cars or
trucks. During the months of open
water navigation, a portion of the salt
is transported to a warehouse and load-
ing dock on the Rouge River, for boat
shipments. It is interesting to note that
statistics compiled by the Port of De-
troit Authority show that salt shipments
by boat rank sixth in total annual ton-
nage.
The rock salt is surprisingly pure, av-
eraging approximately 98.4 percent so-
dium chloride. The major impurity is
calcium sulphate in the form of the min-
eral anhydrite, which is slowly and dif-
ficultly soluble. Dissolution of rock salt,
leaving the insoluble material behind,
results in a brine of remarkable purity:
as good as, or better than brine made
from the average evaporated salt. The
major proportion of the rock salt ton-
nage is, of course, used in chemical man-
ufacture, salting of hides in the meat
packing industry, regeneration of water
softeners, etc.

"The world at its worst" might be
the title given to this little incident
which befell an unfortunate friend of
ours. Calling his fraternity, whose num-
ber is 3807, he was somewhat surprised
when the voice which answered merely
said "Hello."
Thinking he had caught a pledge in
an infraction of the rules our friend
replied gruffly, "Hello what!"

"Just hello," said a surprised voice
at the other end.
"Now look, you know the proper way
to answer the phone at our house. Let's
pretend I just called and try it again.
What do you say?"
"Hello."
This went on for some time until at
last our hero, who was by this time get-
ting rather red, demanded in exaspera-
tion, "Don't you even know where you
are?"
"Certainly," came back the unruffled
answer, "3107."
incidental intelligence
The New York World's Fair is, and
should be, a dead issue by now. How-
ever, there still lurks in our memory an
incident that happened next to G. M.'s
glass walled diesel engine.
Whom should we chance upon but
one of the Gargoyle editors, who was
watching the lubricating oil copiously
splash the inside of the engine. Finally
he turned to a companion and we heard
him say reflectively, "No wonder those
things have such a high fuel consump-
tion!"
research
We know of two fellows who found a
novel way to fill the superfluous hours of
the past summer session. They sprawled
on the grass in the middle of the campus
each day, and conducted a searching
survey by guesstimation to determine
the percentage of girdle wearers in the
passing parade. For analytical purposes
they divided their subjects into four
main groups, she does, she doesn't, can't
tell, don't give a damn.
Incidentally, we noticed that an over-
whelming majority of femininity fell
into the D.G.D. class. Who said sum-
mer school is different?
progress
Technology has got us down.
For years we have noticed an occa-
sional cop wandering around with a
piece of chalk in search of a motorist
who had failed to move on after the pre-
scribed fifteen, sixty, or one hundred
and twenty minutes. The procedure had
always seemed sufficiently haphazard
and the odds against being apprehended
sufficiently great for us not to worry
particularly about being caught if "we
happened to overpark.

But them days are gone forever. En-
gineering has come to the aid of the
denizens of law and order. Today ye
chalker of tires rides in the sidecar of
a bright red motorcycle and laconically
does his duty while his partner speeds
the infernal machine along at twenty
per. With this unjust speed up in oper-
ation the darned cops can cover the en-
tire limited area every few hours and
local parkers have suddenly become
clockwatchers.
Technology, as we said, has got us
down.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


PRACTICE
NOW It Can Be Told Department:
Believe it or not, last month's prob-
lem presented a real-life situation. (The
one about the chem engineer who unex-
pectedly received a check for recommend-
ing a certain brand of alum, you remem-
ber.) As it happened, the poor fellow
did just exactly the wrong thing, under
the circumstances. He perplexedly
showed the check to the mayor of the
city, who, in his best kind-fatherly
manner, advised the engineer to "Just
sign that over to me; I'll take care of
it, and everything will be all right."
The offer was accepted, and as a result
the chemist got neither the money nor
any credit for being honest.
As you do no doubt know by now,
the Engineering Committee on Profes-
sional Practice is presenting in these
columns each month a problem, typical
of those which are faced by every prac-
ticing engineer. A five dollar award is
made to that solution which, in the
opinion of a faculty board, is most ade-
quate. Answers this month should be
addressed to the "Contest Editor,"
Michigan Technic, 3036 East Engi-
neering Building, Ann Arbor, Michi-
gan, and postmarked not later than
January 25. The winner will be an-
nounced, and letters meeting the ap-
proval of the Technic editors will be
published in a later issue.
The prize for October was awarded to
Bennett O. Moyle.
The Problem:
You have, for the past ten years,
been employed in the purchasing
agent's office of your company, inspect-
ing and buying certain materials. You
have recently been offered a position on
the engineering sales force and it has
become necessary to decide between
jobs. You will probably have to go to
South America and other parts of the
world. Your salary will be increased
but your job will depend on your suc-
cess and will be somewhat less secure.
You will be away from home, and both
your and your family's social standing
in the community will be changed. The
average savings of the salesman are no
greater than those of the purchasing de-
partment buyer. Give the arguments
weighed in reaching your decision.

darkest africa
Gone is the old type, hardened ex-
plorer of the Stanley and Livingstone
era, who tramped through the jungles
on foot with nothing but a handful of
native porters and an elephant gun.
Instead we have the modern explorer,
who travels with a fleet of trucks and
luxurious land yachts. The Gatti expe-
dition to the Belgian Congo is the mar-
vel of natives wherever it goes. The ex-
pedition is equipped with complete elec-
trical service, including table cooking
appliances, refrigerators, ventilating
fans, illumination, and even electric
blankets for cold jungle nights. Need-
less to say, it is also equipped with tile
baths and hot and cold running water.
hard but tough
If you want a surface that will resist
abrasion on a material that will with-
stand shock, one of the best ways to get
it is to make a cast of chromium-molyb-
denum steel and flame harden it. One
case in which such results are particu-
larly desirable is that of mine machin-
ery. A con%'eyor screw for classifying
cinnabar, for example, is not only sub-
ject to considerable wear and impact,
but at one end undergoes a temperature
of 600 F. Furthermore, any ordinary
method of quenching is impossible, be-
cause of warping. The difficulty is rem-
edied by casting the screw from steel
that analyzes: carbon 0.40%, manga-
nese 0.65%, silicon 0.30%, chromium
0.60%, molybdenum 0.25%. The cast-
ing is annealed at 1575" F., machined,
Flame Hardening
Quenching is impossible
Climax Molybdenum

normalized from 1650° and drawn at
800°. The flights are then flame hard-
ened on both sides to a depth of %e
inch and over an area extending 2\'-&gt;
inches from the outer edge. The steel is
water quenched by a jet immediately
behind the flame tips. Finally, the
screw is drawn at 450 to relieve any
remaining stresses.
An essentially similar process is used
in the manufacture of dipper teeth for
power shovels and even of die blocks.
Gears, both spur and worm, also demand
both hardness and strength, and may be
successfully made in the same way. The
steel, in this case, has a slightly different
composition: carbon 0.30-0.35%, chro-
mium 0.60-0.80%, molybdenum 0.20-
0.30%. Out of one hundred worm gears
that have been flame hardened, not one
has shown distortion greater than 0.0005
inch.
design for earthquake
One field in which Western tech-
nologists have learned from the Jap-
anese is seismic design. At the World
Engineering Congress (Tokyo, 1929),
American engineers found Japanese
work on seismic design and construction
of buildings so advanced that they ac-
cepted the Japanese conclusions as the
best thought of the day. Since the Santa
Barbara and Long Beach quakes of
1925 and 1933 respectively, American
engineers and governments have become
increasingly interested in the subject.
Experimental work with models and the
shaking table has proven of more value
than theoretical study, and there is still
no agreement regarding actual forces to
be resisted or detailed methods of de-
sign. A large body of partially conclu-
sive knowledge has been accumulated,
however, and the following is a brief
summary of "what we think we know
today'' about the construction of build-
ings in earthquake zones:
1. Stability of foundations is as-
sumed. 2. Study of ground characteris-
tics is important in evaluating probable
forces. 3. The walls offer the major re-
sistance. Walls and floors should have
strengths commensurate with their rigid-
ity and stiffness. 4. Vertical elements
resist torsion in proportion to their
rigidity and to the square of their dis-
tances from the centroid of resistance.
5. Centroid of resistance of vertical ele-
ments should coincide with centroid of
mass of building. 6. Current methods
for determining relative wall rigidity are
substantially correct. 7. Buildings not
over 100 feet high, with height not
greater than twice the least base dimen-
sion, may be designed as rigid struc-
tures for a lateral force of 1/10 of grav-
ity. 8. Shear distortions are much more
important than lateral distortions. 9.
While the fundamental period of vibra-
tion is most important, the second and

Civil Ent
Earthquake Tests
The Orient leads
third modes may also affect the struc-
ture. 10. Increase in flexibility of base-
ment or first story results in decreased
dynamic shears in higher stories. 11.
Tall buildings with steel frames and
brick masonry walls must be regarded
as flexible rather than rigid structures
and should be designed for dynamic
shears. Shear varies from 1 /20 of gra%'-
ity in first story to 1/7 of gravity at the
top, the mass in each case being taken
as that above the story in question.

bob smith
Bob Smith was born in Barberton,
Ohio, where he lived until he was six
years old. At that time he moved to Los
Angeles, living there for eight years, and
finally settling down in Akron, which he
now calls his home town. He attended
Buchtel High School, from which he was
graduated in February, 1936. In the

Bob Smith
When a feller . . .
semester between his graduation and his
matriculation at Michigan, he took post-
graduate work in high school and at-
tended the night school of the University
of Akron.
Bob, who is twenty-two years old, is
enrolled for the combined course in Me-
chanical and Industrial Engineering. He
may return next year to get his Master's
degree, but he is not sure. Bob would
like to get into factory management,
especially personnel or labor relations
work.
Bob made a rather auspicious start
when he arrived here, for in his fresh-
man year he went out for the Track
Squad and the Boxing Squad, was treas-
urer of the Freshmen Class, made Phi
Eta Sigma, and pledged Chi Psi, of
which he is now social chairman. At the
end of ;hSs sophomore year he was
chosen for Triangles and last year he
was initiated into Tau Beta Pi. This
past November he survived the Vulcans
ritual. Bob is also a member of the
Engineering Council, and is, of course,
President of the Senior Class. Not only
that, but he is a very nice guy.
For recreational sports, Bob prefers
hunting, fishing, and golf. Offhand we
would not agree with his roommate's
jesting assurance that Bob is a "glass"
athlete. Before coming to college Bob
put in several summers as a lifeguard in
a summer camp. At the end of his
freshman year he was employed as a
blueprinter, and between his sophomore
and junior years he worked as a lab
assistant in the ceramics laboratory of
the Ohio Insulator Company. This last
summer, Bob took things easy.
fred shands
Born during the first World War,
Frederick L. Shands will be graduated
probably in the course of the second
major conflict of our generation. The
first event, which enlarged the popula-
tion of Kirkwood, Missouri, by one,
occurred in October, 1918; th; second,
which sends out another Michigan-
trained Chemical Engineer, will take
place next June.
Fred led quite an active life in high
school. Besides being an "A" student,
he was a member of the student council,
on the wrestling team for two years,
and on the football team for three
years, being captain his senior year. It
was during this season that Fred's ath-
letic career was ended because his arms
were dislocated several times while play-
ing football and later while wrestling.
Summer vacations were spent in such
diversified occupations as working in a
greenhouse and on a highway construc-
tion job. One summer the wanderlust
got him and he finally wound up work-
ing on a ranch in Colorado.
After graduation from high school in
1936, Fred headed for the University
of Michigan and more specifically, the
College of Engineering. Here he spent
his first year earning a Phi Eta Sigma
key and trying out for Sigma Rho Tau
and the Technic. (He recommends
this procedure for Freshmen.)
Then followed a summer of washing
windows at the Monsanto Chemical
Company plant in St. Louis. After
returning for his sophomore year, he
pledged Alpha Delta Phi. He also con-
tinued his good scholastic work, carried
on with Sigma Rho Tau, and joined
the A. I. Ch. E.
Last year, his third, Fred was tapped
by Vulcans and elected to Tau Beta Pi.
When the smoke of spring elections had
cleared away, he found himself Presi-
dent of the Tau Betes, vice-president of
Alphi Delta Phi, and President of the
A.I.Ch.E.
After graduation Fred intends to

enter the chemical processing field. In-
cidentally, Fred is another one of those
"builder-uppers." In fact, his interest
in mechanics led him to build a small
gasoline car in high school. Powered
by a two-cylinder motor mounted in
the front, with knee action provided
on the front wheels through the use of
bicycle springs, it was quite some auto-
mobile. However, there were no springs
on the rear wheels and, according to
Fred, the motor had a smooth ride
while he took all the knocks.
professor eriksen
In the spring of 1912, Edward Leer-
drup Eriksen, a cub engineer just ar-
rived from Denmark, got a job in Mon-
treal on the Mount Royal Tunnel.
In April he became detail designer
on the Quebec Bridge, in the erection
department of the St. Lawrence Bridge
Co. That was 1913; a year and a half
later Canada was at war and Eriksen,
along with many another young engi-
neer, was out of work.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


wrote to several acquaintances. The
reply of one, a certain John A. Van den
Broek of Ann Arbor, Michigan, led to
an offer of three weeks' work as assis-
tant to M. E. Cooley on some appraisal
work. The job was accepted: it actually
lasted a year, and in the meantime Van
den Broek exerted all his persuasive
powers on Mrs. Eriksen, finally con-
vincing her that the teaching profession
was the right place for her husband.
Friksen, in an acquiescent mood, filled
out an application blank, the summer
of 1915 before leaving for New Jersey,
then promptly forgot about it. However,
when an Engineering Mechanics post
was vacated that fall Eriksen became a
teacher.
He continued in the Engineering Me-
chanics Department until 1920, trans-
ferred to Civil Engineering for three
years, and then for seven years was
Associate Professor and Professor of
Structural Engineering at Purdue Uni-
versity. In 1930, Michigan needed a
man to head the E. M. department.
The post was offered to Eriksen; he
accepted, and has held it to date.
Prof. Eriksen has been active in sev-
eral engineering and educational organi-
zations, including Uansk Ingenior-
forening, S.P.E.E., A.S.C.E., M.E.S.,

Professor Eriksen
Conditions differed
University Council, Tau Beta Pi,
Junior Research Club, and Iota Alpha.
He is also a member of the Ann Arbor
Rotary Club and at present serves on
the College of Engineering Executive
Committee. His technical work for the
last few years has been mainly in the
fields of stability, theory of elasticity
(as applied to thin plates), and stresses
due to welding.
As a professor, Eriksen has had am-
ple opportunity to observe the workings
of American technical education. As a
student he was similarly brought into
contact with that of Europe when he
took his B.S.C.E. at the Copenhagen
School of Polytechnique. Prof. Eriksen
refused to make a direct comparison of
American and European methods, saying
that conditions were far different and
(hat he would be prejudiced anyway. At
Copenhagen Polytechnique nearly all the
emphasis was on theory, with practi-
cally no lab work. As a result, the
graduate was far beyond an average
American in theoretical engineering,
but found it harder to get acclimated to
industry, due to the absence of practi-
cal experience.
And Prof. Eriksen is a loyal alumnus
—he still gets a great deal of pleasure
out of reminiscing with brother alumni
Hansen and Jensen (both live in Ann
Arbor) about their college days.

fa
vance to other positions. Belief in
one or two fundamental principles will
permit him to build a philosophy, the
practice of which in itself will become a
helpful factor as he attempts to gain his
desired rung upon the industrial ladder.
It is usually fatal to permit himself
to think or say to his friends, ''I am
just temporarily working at this job. I
really am not suited to this task. I ex-
pect to move to the 'So &amp; So' Depart-
ment in a short time." With that atti-
tude and philosophy he will never do
any job with enough enthusiasm and
vigor to raise himself above the aver-
age.
WThen the head of a division wants
a new man, he probably will ask for a
fellow who is a go-getter, one who has
done an exceptionally good job some-
where in the plant. Exact training and
the fact that a man has always wanted
to get into some particular division
usually are minor considerations. The
position most often goes to a young
man who tackled his first job, regard-
less of what it was, with a determina-
tion to make himself indispensable to
his superior.
A man can do a great deal in train-
ing himself to like the task at hand, no
matter how distasteful or disagreeable it
may seem at first. One thing to re-
member is the more he studies almost
any phase of work, the greater will be
his appreciation of the breadth of the
field and its hidden possibilities. As
these possibilities begin to appear they
act as spark plugs, continually stimu-
lating his interest.
One time a divisional superintendent
was asked whether he always had the
right man available when he needed a
new leader. His answer was "no." It
seemed he always had to compromise in
some respect. This unfortunate situa-
tion which no doubt obtains in many
modern industries soon would be reme-
died to the great benefit of both em-
ployer and employed if young men
would really practice preparedness and
have more patience and more faith in
their own future. -^1

The great improvements which have been made in recent years in the quality and
yields of gasoline and lubricating oil for automobiles and airplanes have been due to
research on the behavior of petroleum when heated for definite periods under high
temperatures and pressures.
The Department of Chemical Engineering has been active in this field and the
illustration shows Professor George Cranger Brown examining an experimental furnace
in which petroleum hydrocarbons may be heated under controlled conditions to tem-
peratures as high as 1000 F. and pressures up to 3000 pounds per square inch.
Over a dozen research papers dealing with phase equilibria and the thermo-
dynamic properties of petroleum hydrocarbons have been published, and a book em-
bodying the results of the researches is well on its way to completion.

LENGTHENING THE LIFE

way of blocking the path to mine operating economy.
By the same token, it offers a great opportunity for cost

with conveyor screws for handling cinnabar. Requisi-
tions for replacements were coming along all too
frequently.
Chromium-Molybdenum cast steel screws solved
that problem. A simple preliminary heat treatment
gives the screws strength and toughness to withstand
heavy pressure and impact loads. Flame hardening
the flights to 630 BHN gives them the ability to stand
up for long periods under the severely abrasive action
of the ore.
The records show that the Chrome-Moly screws last
three times as long as others previously used which
were actually higher in cost.
Our booklet, "Molybdenum in Steel", which con-
tains a great deal of practical data, will be gladly sent
free on request to technical students and others inter-
ested in improved materials.

Others carry coal, gravel, oil, cement
The humble, overlooked
workhorse of the waves
By
LOUIS A. BAIER
Associate Professor of Naval Architecture
FEW people realize the importance of
the humble barge in the marine
transportation of raw materials and
manufactured products. In harbors they
are used in the transfer of freight and
railroad cars; they service ships prepar-
ing for sea; and in addition they per-
form the multitudinous tasks at hand
along any busy waterfront. The inher-
ent value of the barge is obvious. Cheap
in construction, with no capital invest-
ment in machinery, requiring a mini-
mum crew, and having maximum capa-
city, it can be loaded and unloaded while
the tug is busy elsewhere. A single tug
can tow a large number of barges made
up into fleets or flotillas of a cargo ca-
pacity far beyond the possibilities of
a single self propelled unit in restricted
waters. Large ship-shaped seagoing
barges carrying coal are towed between
Hampton Roads and the northeastern
coast ports by powerful tugs at fuel
costs consistent with the low freight
rates available on this type of bulk
cargo. Today on land we find large
truck operators taking a page from the
history of barge transportation in the
use of tractors and trailer units.
On our many rivers we find the barge
of major importance. Practically all the
Ohio and Mississippi River freight
movement is handled in barges assem-
bled into flotillas running as high as
10,000 tons deadweight capacity. The
towboat is integrated into the flotilla
at the after end and pushes rather than
tows the fleet. This is necessary because
of the impossibility of maneuvering the
long, heavy flotilla around bends and
turns in the river channels if handled
with a towline in the coastal manner.
The towboat, being aft and securely
lashed to the fleet, is able to back, steer,
and flank to negotiate the currents and
bends, and also is in the proper position
for locking or making landings.
The design and construction of these
barges was developed principally
through experience and individual "rule
of thumb" formulae acquired by the
river pilots and operators. Certain de-
sign characteristics are, of course, fixed
by the depth of water available, the di-
mensions of the locks and the type of
cargo. The shape of rake ends, radius
of bilge and the choice of flotilla assem-
bly pattern varied considerably with
little benefit of scientific determination
for efficient propulsion. In 1912 the U. of
M. Naval Tank carried out some model
tests on barge forms for the Missis-
sippi River Commission, which indi-
cated the possibilities for sizeable power
reductions in the design of these plebe-
ian members of the maritime family.
Further flotilla tests were made in 1929
for the Standard Unit Transportation
Company, also operating on the Missis-
sippi River. During the last four years
the Naval Tank has been utilized by
the Dravo Corporation of Pittsburgh to
carry on extensive research in connec-
tion with the company's business of
barge construction and operation. New
barge designs based on the results of
these model tests to date have confirmed
in actual operation on the rivers pre-
dicted economies of 25% to 30% in
fuel consumption.
The governing factors in design are
the depth of water available in the
channels at low water and the dimen-
sions of the locks which must be tra-
versed during this same river stage. In
contrast, at the flood season the locks
are completely submerged and traffic
flows down the center of the river well
over the dam levels. The Ohio locks
are 600 ft. x 110 ft. while those in the
Monongahela are 360 ft. x 56 ft.: hence
barge beams are either 35 ft. for three
barge wide flotillas or 26 ft. for two and
FEBRUARY, 1940


are variable depending on the type of
cargo but so chosen that a single flotilla
for the Ohio can be made up slightly
less than 600 ft. in over all length and
for the Monongahela about 350 ft. in
length. Some tows are just under 1200
ft. in length necessitating separation
and double passage at each lock. We
find then the following barge sizes in
general demand: 130 ft. x 30 ft.; 132
ft. x 35 ft.; 140 ft. x 26 ft.; 175 ft. x
26 ft. or 35 ft.; 195 ft. x 26 ft. or 35 ft.;
210 ft. x 26 ft.; the depths running
between 10 ft. and 11 ft. The operating
drafts are usually about 7 ft. 6 inches
although occasional loadings go to 8%
or 9 ft. For special river trades, dimen-
sions may go as high as 280 ft. x 48 ft.
x 11 ft. Cargoes may vary from coal to
gasoline, sand and gravel, cement, lum-
ber, steel products, etc. As an example
of capacity, one of the 195 ft. x 35 ft.
x 10 ft. barges will carry 10,500 bbls.
of gasoline on 8 ft. 9 in. draft, and yet
be only one unit of, say, a five barge
flotilla, the sixth place being utilized
by the towboat.
At low water 9 ft. of water is available
in the Ohio River pools but all model
tests are arranged for 12 ft. as being
more nearly representative of normal
conditions. The tank, therefore, has been
equipped with a hanging false bottom
made up of steel sheets resting on 5 in.
channels and supported from the tank
wall on bronze threaded rods. This ar-
rangement allows adjusting the bottom
level to any depth of water required.
For example, if 1/24 scale models are
being tested, 6 in. of water over the
false bottom simulates 12 ft. of water in
the river. The resistance, wake, and
sinkage are, of course, exaggerated as
the water is shoaled.

Typical Barge Arrangements
Research showed faults, improvements
As mentioned previously the research
has been directed to determining the
most efficient shape of ends, radius of
bilge, and flotilla pattern. While it is
impossible to note in this brief article
detailed results, certain general conclu-
sions are of interest.
1. The barge or flotilla showing least
resistance is not necessarily the most
efficient, as the horsepower per ton of
cargo carried per mile is the final cri-

Flotillas are more easily controlled from the rear
Ohio and 2000 to 3000 in the Missis-
sippi River.
6. Increase in the ratio of length to
beam, the elimination of off-set corners
in flotilla makeup, and the reduction of
gaps between the interior barge ends
and adjacent bilges, all tend toward
lower resistance. For example, using the
same barges and cargo capacity, Flotilla
B showed a 27% decrease in power at 6
M.P.H. over arrangement A, long in
common use on the river. Flotilla C
towed 32% easier than pattern A at the
same speed.
In view of the above, many operators
are now weighing the decreased power
costs available through use of barges
having interior ends square and exterior
ends shaped, against the increased cost
of assembling such non-symmetrical
ended barges at the loading terminals.
In closing, one further example of re-
search work on barges in the Naval
Tank may be of interest. Single loaded
barges towed at the end of a hawser on
our seaboard frequently develop exces-
sive tendency to yaw.
These yaws have a
period of perhaps 6
to 7 minutes and am-
plitudes of some 250
ft. This sinuous track
is of course danger-
ous to shipping and
costly in excess tow-
ing power required.
Numerous tests with
models have indicated
the best means of
eliminating yawing,
and several barges in
coast and bay service
have been equipped
with skegs developed
at Michigan.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


WILLIAM H. YENNI, '32E
Chief Engineer, Joseph Weidenoff, Inc.
IN 5,000 miles of travel the points of
a six cylinder automobile distributor
open and close over 45,000,000 times
and the fuel pump rocker arm oscillates
more than 15,000,000 times. The pistons
of an engine operating at or near top
speed must start from a dead stop at
top dead center, accelerate to a speed
of over 45 miles per hour and then come
to a stop at the bottom of the stroke.
This entire motion takes place within a
distance of between four and five inches
and in less than eight thousandths of a
second.
In order to retain such engine per-
formance as is provided by the engine
manufacturer, it is necessary to recog-
nize the fact that parts subjected to
such service are bound to wear. The
relatively high efficiency obtained in
present day engines depends upon the
proper operation and synchronism of its
parts. Easy replacement or adjustment
of these worn parts is one of the im-
portant features which makes the auto-
mobile practical.
The early engine designer was pri-
marily interested in making the engine
run. Efficiency was desirable, but so
many parts used on the early engines
wore out or got out of adjustment after
only a few miles of operation that there
was little time to consider efficiency
during that short running period.
The mechanics of those days were
much like the designers of the engines.
They also were interested in making the
engine run. A large number of their
adjustments were made by listening to
the engine. Their tools were frequently
improvised additions to a set of
wrenches, a screw driver or two, and a
few feeler gauges. They adjusted the
distributor point spacing with a feeler
gauge, the carburetor by listening to the
engine, and the generator charging rate
by reference to the dash ammeter. They
were generally successful, because the
engine of those days was lower in speed,
compression ratio, and efficiency than
the present day engines.
The modern engine is much more
sensitive to adjustments of the various
parts which affect its operation. It has
been repeatedly proven that an appar-
ently smoothly operating engine, as far
as sound is concerned, can be using an
excessive amount of gas. Feeler gauge
settings of the points may be in error
ten or fifteen crankshaft degrees. The
dash ammeter has been recognized as
merely an indicating device with the
result that generators and their controls
are checked with instruments designed
for the purpose.
Instruments have been used for quite
a few years for checking the brakes,
wheels, headlights, and other parts of
the car associated with safety of opera-
tion. The engine "analyzer" has fol-
lowed this other test equipment and,
while its importance can hardly be com-
pared with that of safety testing de-
vices, it has been recognized as decidedly
worthwhile to engine repairmen.
Properly designed engine analyzer
equipment must be properly used to
result in satisfaction to the car owner.
Condemnation of good parts reflects
adversely on the manufacturer of the
test instrument and the service station
performing the repairs on the engine.
False assumption that a fault has been
corrected and unnecessary charges for
repairs cause the car owner to become
suspicious of test equipment.
A large number of analyzer units are
available to service stations. Elaborate
and complete equipment for engine
analysis can represent an investment of
four or five thousand dollars. Satisfac-
tory work can be done, however, with
about one sixth such an amount. The
list which follows will cost about six
ly replacement of worn
ts will restore your
tor's original efficiency
hundred dollars and includes enough
equipment to test properly and quickly
an engine for most of the common
faults which occur after 5,000 or more
miles of travel. There are three groups
into which these instruments can be
divided:
1. Instruments for combustion and me-
chanical system tests.
2. Instruments for ignition system tests.
3. Instruments for low voltage system
tests.
This grouping is made because of the
difference in the nature of the instru-
ments used for testing these parts of the
engine.
Instruments jor Combustion and
Mechanical System Tests
Vacuum Gauge. The vacuum gauge,
when connected with the intake mani-
fold, is used for detecting low pressure
in cylinders due to sticky or worn valves,
piston ring leaks, cylinder head gasket
leaks, intake manifold leaks, faulty car-

ders, or any other engine conditions
which affect its efficiency as a vacuum
pump. Additional tests with other in-
struments are usually necessary to deter-
mine just which of the above faults are
causing erratic vacuum gauge readings.
Compression Gauge. The compression
gauge, when connected to individual
cylinders for pressure measurements, is
a "follow up" instrument to the vacuum
gauge. It makes it possible for the oper-
ator to determine just which of the
cylinder troubles is causing low com-
pression with a resultant improper
vacuum gauge reading.
Exhaust Gas Analyzer. The exhaust
gas analyzer is used to check the car-
buretor. This instrument is best used
with the car on the road or being loaded
by means of a dynamometer. Dirty or
worn carburetor jets, fuel pump pres-
sures which are high or low enough to
affect carburetion, incorrect carburetor
float level, air cleaner restrictions, and
defective automatic choke all result in
improper exhaust gas analyzer readings.
As in the case of the vacuum gauge, the
exhaust gas analyzer will indicate im-
proper carburetion and further tests are
necessary to locate definitely the fault.
Low Reading Pressure Gauge. A low
reading pressure gauge is frequently
used to check fuel pump pressures when
the exhaust gas analyzer indicates such
a test is necessary.
Instruments for Ignition
System Tests
Ignition Coil Tester. This instrument,
as the name implies, is for testing the
ignition coil. Due to high and low speed
requirements of the modern coil, most
coil testers give the coil a "high speed"
and "low speed" test. The first of these
tests also checks the coil for low voltage
or hard starting.
Condenser Tester. A replacement con-
denser costs only about fifty cents, in-
stalled, and therefore it might seem
strange that a condenser tester costing
more than five or ten dollars would be
a justifiable investment. The reason a
much greater investment is usually
worth while is because of the great
amount of time saved by the mechanic
in tracing down faulty ignition which is
causd by either a defective condenser
or one of improper size.
Distributor Test Fixture. The dis-
tributor has such an important function
to perform and it has become so intri-
cate that a testing unit for this part of
the engine is quite important. Most dis-
tributors have both mechanical (con-
trolled by a governor) and vacuum ad-
vance mechanisms. In addition, the set-
ting of the points is of greater impor-
tance on the modern distributor than in
the past, because of higher speed re-
quirements. If the points remain closed
too long, the coil does not completely
dissipate its energy before the points
A Scries of Generator Tests
An intelligent interpretation of readings is called for

close again. This results in pitting of the
points. If the points are not closed long
enough, the coil does not receive suffi-
cient energy to produce a spark at high
engine speeds. This condition produces
a high speed miss.
The distributor test fixture is an in-
strument designed for testing the dis-
tributor for proper operation of the two
advance mechanisms, for proper "con-
tact dwell" or point opening, and for
other distributor faults.
Instruments for Low Voltage
System Tests
The instruments used for these tests
can be grouped together as they are
frequently used together. A voltmeter,
ammeter, and a few variable resistors
are sufficient for most of the tests on
the low voltage system of the car.
Voltage regulators, current regulators,
relays, generators, starters, batteries,
and wiring can be tested and frequently
adjusted by reference and intelligent
interpretation of readings obtained with
the voltmeter and ammeter. Variable re-
sistors are used for adjusting the cur-
rent or voltage of those parts which re-
quire such regulation for a proper or
convenient test.
With a public which demands fuel
economy, performance, and comfort, the
engine analyzer equipment has made it
possible for thousands of additional
miles to be obtained from a car. In-
struments are used where visual in-
spection or hearing
are inadequate for
location of faults.
Worn bearings are
still located by a
"knock" and no in-
strument is neces-
sary to find a leaky
radiator hose con-
nection. Engine an-
alyzer equipment
performs three func-
tions: first, it makes
it possible for the
operator to locate
faulty parts; second,
it makes it possible
for the operator to
check adjustments
when such adjust-
ments are practical:
third, it makes it
possible for the op-
erator to locate and
to correct faults
more quickly, with
a resultant saving to

Brit-k and Clay Record
Pouring and Testing a Field joint
No roots can get in here
al, misc.
It is a well known fact that a coat
of aluminum paint on a truck or barn
roof greatly reflects the sunlight and
thus lowers the temperature inside. Be-
cause of this fact G. P. Crowden of the
London School of Hygiene papered an
entire room with aluminum foil and kept
a single electric bulb lighted in this
room. The heat from the lamp was re-
flected so well that no other heat was
required in the room for the entire
winter.
Another example of ingenuity is a
result of the war. In England the black-
out resulted in the production of an
aluminum shield which encases the bus-
iness end of a cigarette to prevent the
glow from tipping off the enemy during
air raids. The shield has several holes
for draft.
Aluminum is also used in the manu-
facture of furnaces. A high-frequency
induction furnace, used in the melting of
high-quality magnetic metals, produces
the high temperatures necessary by in-
ducing an electric current in the mate-
rials. It is obviously important to keep
the outer framework of the furnace from
becoming similarly heated. To prevent
this, it is necessary to use a non-mag-
netic material. At the same time, it is
desirable, in certain cases, to make a
structure light enough and strong
enough to allow the furnace, with its
load of molten metal, to be picked up

Aluminum Xcws-Lflter
High Frequency Induction Furnace
No magnetic materials need apply
and dumped into the ladle. One ma-
terial combining these characteristics is
aluminum. Accordingly, Ajax-N'orthrup
has built a furnace using aluminum-
alloy structural members for the frame-
work.
sewer pipe
For the past ten years, one of the
principal problems with which ceramic
engineers and sanitary engineers have
been faced, is that of finding a pipe ma-
terial, suitable for house connection sew-
ers, that would withstand the penetra-
tion tendencies of roots. Originally, all
efforts along this line were aimed at the
formation of the caulking compound, on
the assumption that if this completely
filled the annular space between the
spigot of one pipe section and the bell of
the next, no root would penetrate. That
this assumption was false became obvi-
ous from the results obtained.
In 1935, the Clay Products Institute
of California built a test plot consisting
of an area surrounded by a brick wall
and then filled with fertilized earth,
which was planted with black acacia
saplings on 24 inch centers. In conjunc-
tion with this test plot investigations
have been conducted which have led to
some practical results. Some of the con-
clusions reached are: (1) the best of the
available caulking materials are the sul-
phur silica compounds; (2) standard
pipe is not dense enough—it has a con-
stantly saturated outer surface, which
attracts the roots; (3) both pipe and
caulking should be able to withstand a
pressure of 15 pounds per square inch,
without seepage, for safety; (4) even
with the best pipe and caulking mate-
rial, it is impossible for the average
workman always to make a satisfactory
joint, under actual working conditions,
with the spigot and bell.
Except for a tendency towards denser
pipe material, there has been no general
agreement as to how best to put the
findings into practice. One of the pipes
developed as a result of the experi-
mentation has withstood successfully a
year's sojourn in the test plot under a
pressure of over 15 pounds, and incorpo-
rates a number of unusual features:
It is steel reinforced, and self-center-
ing, with the caulking material built in
The collar permits a deviation in align-
ment of five degrees without reduction
of the annular space. It requires about
one-half as much material for the field
joint as does the standard pipe. Use of
a rubber band for the outside runner
permits full and easy inspection of the
joint; when the field joint is poured, the
hot compound melts the surface of the
collar and welds to it. It is unglazed on
the outside for better scarification, and
glazed on the inside for less friction.
Bends and short lengths have scarifica-
tion full length, so that they may be
more readily cut and fitted.

By
A. D. MOORE
In Charge of Placement
Department of Electrical Engineering
There's no sure way to get that
job, but some ways stand
a better chance than others.
Editor's Note: "Good Morning, Sir"
is the second of two articles which were
first published in the Technic in 1935
and are now being reprinted because of
popular demand.
SOME interviews are easy to obtain.
An employer's representative comes
to the campus, you sign up for an inter-
view, and that's that. At the other end
of the scale is an interview you seek,
and which takes place in the employer's
office. Let us talk about that kind. As-
sume that the employer has written to
me, asking for candidates. I dip into
my file of available men and select four
names. Maybe I really found six who
might qualify, but only four have com-
plied with the well-publicized request
for filing personal records; two others
have not, and are often passed by for
that reason. Why? If a man will not go
to a small amount of trouble to partici-
pate in a plan erected entirely for his
own benefit, how can I believe he will
take care of an employer's interests in
any better style?
The Trial
Here the battle is won or lost

Next, having the typed records at
hand, I can make sure the four are
qualified, with no loss of time. Dupli-
cate letters are now sent to the men,
apprising them of the opening, and
giving the essential facts of the case. At
the same time, I write to the employer,
and at least tell him the names of the
men he may expect to hear from. If I
have time—and often I don't—and if
the occasion may warrant, I may also
discuss each man in the letter to the
employer.
It is now up to each man to tele-
phone the employer for an interview
date; or, to write a request for that
privilege. If the request is by letter, the
candidate includes a copy of his per-
sonal record.
Assuming you are granted an inter-
view, you get there ahead of time. In
the next twenty minutes you decide your
fate. I assume you have already learned
(forgive these personal details) that
pants look better when pressed; that a
recent shave improves any male of col-
lege age or over: that finger nails need
cleaning as well as cutting:
that there is at least once
when it is well to sit up
straight and favor the
other fellow with a few di-
rect looks—which is right
now. The employer has
usually had some practice
at interviewing, and he
will probably lead the con-
versation. To any ques-
tions, give direct and clear
replies. If he dangles an
opportunity for you to run
off at length on some tan-
gent, be wary. Perhaps
Synchroscope
he is looking for that very trait. You
came here about this job, and not to
issue a half-hour alibi for the football
team. Of course, if it appears that he
really wants to take time out to discuss
football, skeet shooting, or the soy bean
crisis, let him have his way and even
contribute to the sin. But be careful.
Don't ever make the mistake of as-
suming that all employers are inter-
view experts. Some certainly must find
interviewing quite a trial. When the poor
man seems hesitant about prying into
your qualifications, he may need help.
Take the lead and tell your story to
the best of your ability—keeping your
twenty minutes in mind. He is a busy
man, but kindly and courteous. He may
make it easy for you to overstay, but
will take sharp and secret objection to
any serious transgression. If you err on
the safe side by attempting to leave too
soon, he will hold you; don't worry
about that. If he keeps you all morning
and then takes you out to luncheon, it
is a safe assumption that matters are
going rather well. But look out for
luncheons. It will then be too late for
anything but regrets, if you do not al-
ready know how to handle yourself at
table. This does not finish our discus-
sion of interviews; we will have to come
back to it later on.
How You Can Fit In
You are about to graduate; it is cus-
tomary for graduates to secure employ-
ment and make a living; therefore, you
propose to follow custom. Well, no grad-
uate is ever handed a job on that basis.
The hard cold world doesn't care a
whoop whether you, individually, get a
job or not. The only reason you will
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


The Reward
To the brave, the fair; to the prepared, the job
ever be hired is because you have con-
vinced some employer that it will pay
to take you on. Now, it is true that a
few large companies recruit a large
group of men each year, the only im-
mediate concern being that each man be
desirable. The company is big enough
to use any one man later, in almost any
line along which he may develop. That
is campus recruiting; you can learn of
it here, first-hand. It is quite a different
story when you approach an employer
who has no jobs open.
You make such an approach because
this is one company you would like to
be with. You secure an interview. The
employer is glad to look you over, at
least. Now get this picture: that morn-
ing he, the chief engineer, has had a
dozen telephone calls, a third of which
call for decisions. His patent expert was
in a while ago to raise a question he
will have to settle, and he doesn't know
the answer. Nobody knows the answer.
Shortly before you arrive, a report is
dumped on his desk, calling for a close
decision as to whether to spend fifty
thousand for scrapping old machinery
and buying new. His wife is on the
telephone, asking him to help guess
whether little Philbert's temperature is
due to scarlet fever, indigestion, or
cussedness inherited from the father's
side. And then you walk in. He didn't
ask for you in the first place. He cannot
use you now. Unaided, he can't see
where he might use you six months
hence. If you simply appear as a large,
blushing graduate who wants to work for
him, all you are doing is to hand him
one more vexing problem he can't find
the answer to. Did you just remark that
such a chief engineer's morning is rather
unusual? Well, maybe you are right;
many of his mornings are easier to get
through than this one.
Doesn't it become rather clear that
under such circumstances, you had bet-
ter come prepared to help him solve your
problem? It is possible for you to come
to the interview knowing a great deal
about the company's products; adver-
tisements, trade journal articles, gossip,
friends—there are many possible leads.
You learn that certain products have not
switched over to welding—which is one
of your preferential interests. You are
prepared to suggest that you might be
taken on in any capacity whatever, just
so you could learn still more of welding
problems and needs, and could soon be
of value in the application of welding.
Some of his Company's products are
intricately shaped. You have learned
that diecasting is used to the limit, but
that apparently plastics have been left
alone. You learned something about
plastics in college, and have picked up
a good deal more from recent publica-
tions. You do not rudely take the gen-
tleman to task for not having lost his
head over plastics, but you do find a
chance to say how fascinating it would
be to have a job where such adaptations
might work well and save money.
Of course, all such preparation may
usually miss the mark. As long as you
are an outsider, you may never be able
to smoke out a thing the company isn't
already alive to and worried about. The
point is, that the employer will be pleas-
antly astounded to interview a recent
graduate who is thinking more of the
employer's problems than his own. You
will not be hired that day; he can think
of no excuse for wedging you in. Two
weeks or three months later, that man
may call you long distance (provided
you include your telephone number in
your record) and ask if you can go to
work next Monday.
On Knowing Your Way About
Ann Arbor, population 25,000, four
bookstores. Largetown, population 250,-

town has a college or two, probably the

FEBRUARY, 1940


Why not be equally acute about some
of the simpler, more accessible factors
that will affect your job-finding prob-
lem? Two states have equal areas, equal
populations. Therefore, equal engineer-
ing opportunity? Certainly not. That
depends on industrial development.
Some simple measures of states, their
development, their share in national in-
come, can be found in the World Al-
manac. Or you might borrow the most
recent national membership list for your
professional society, to count up the
proportion of national membership re-
presented by a state or region in which
you wish to locate. Why? Isn't it fair
to assume that roughly, engineering op-
portunity is in proportion to the degree
in which a city's engineers are found
in your society?
Often your line of preference will lead
you to special questions not answerable
by those who are convenient to your
personal approach. If you wish to work
at improving leather processing, you
have to know where the leather business
is. McRae's Blue Book is a register of
American industry. There is undoubtedly
a national leather association, anxious
to answer letters. You pay taxes to sup-
port bureaus in Washington that know
the answers to such questions. Use the
privilege. The Polk people publish a
guide to Detroit's business and industry.
You can buy a copy for fifty dollars, or
you can walk into a hotel in Detroit
and use free of charge the copy that is
chained to the desk.
In the job conference with E. E.
seniors last year, the seniors were asked
to name some companies they had
thought of tackling. About ten com-
panies—all large—were rapidly nomi-
nated. I had with me a January trade
journal which was filled with annual
survey reports. One such listed about
thirty leading manufacturers, and
showed whether they had made or lost
money in the preceding two years. Eight
of the ten companies named had lost
money. A number of firms that had al-
ready climbed out of the red were not
mentioned. There are about six hundred
electrical manufacturing companies in
the United States. Why do great num-
bers of electrical graduates concentrate
their attention on the few? And isn't it
too bad, when at a given time, energy
directed towards getting into these few
may be almost entirely wasted?
While this article was being written,
Mr. Clifford A. Faust of Transit Journal,
and vice-president of Eta Kappa Nu
Association, dropped in. He has been
in charge of the association's placement
work in New York. In a large share of
cases in which unemployed engineers
came to him, he found they had re-
ligiously hounded eight or ten com-
panies, and had cultivated few, if any
other contacts. A survey disclosed the
fact that several hundred New York
firms were employing one or more elec-
trical engineers. These were the firms
where the job hunters were finally
placed.
The Bulletin Board
In order to make a point later on, the
bulletin board should be mentioned. In

the writer's department the bulletin
board is made to serve a variety of edu-
cational functions. Routine matters are,
of course, posted there. In addition, a
rather continuous parade of items is run
throughout the year. Many of the fea-
tures described in these articles are pre-
sented in one form or another. The
senior is given plenty of opportunity to
inform himself as to what is expected
of him in participating in our particular
placement scheme. When a significant
book appears, such as that by Lester
(mentioned in the first article), sales-
minded seniors are urged to read it.
About halfway through the year, the
bulletin board announces—
The Job Conference
This annual event is mainly for
seniors of the electrical department.
Starting at 7:30 P.M., with about 70
men present, it ends at 11:00 because
we have to go home sometime. It is an
open forum, devoted entirely to rapid-
fire questions and answers about the
very things these articles are trying to
cover. Should one return for graduate
work? Should he do so right away, or
get some experience first? Does a rolling
stone gather any moss, or anything else?
What about these training programs?
What are present starting rates? What
to do when an outside offer comes to a
man already employed: These are
lengthy matters. This article has no
room for discussing them. If you want
to hear them talked about, you are wel-
come to attend the conference. I will
offer to write about them in future ar-
ticles, provided a sufficient number of
readers will let me know their wishes.
Perhaps you had better tell the Editor
about it at the same time. It would be
up to him, you know.
Seniors—Live and Otherwise
The live senior will inform himself
on job matters long before his active
contacts begin. A large share of the
things he wants to know are common to
the whole senior class. It is out of the
question for any faculty member to find
time to dish out the answers to in-
dividual seniors. Hence bulletin board
service. And then comes the test. When
a senior drops in along about May and
innocently asks some question that re-
veals he has not kept himself posted,
and when discussion reveals the fact that
he first heard of the job conference the
day after it was over, we know we are
dealing with a man who has been sound
asleep. If he does not promptly come to
life and catch onto things in a hurry,
we fear he may be in for a series of
disappointments for some time to come.
Keep In Touch
Soon after graduating, send a copy
of your personal record back to your
faculty placement officer. As soon as
you get that job, let him know. Get
out of the way, and let him concentrate
on your unemployed classmate. Once
a year or so, drop him a letter, bringing
yourself up to date. (Ask him to file
your letter without bothering to answer
it: maybe, if he has a spare moment,
he'll answer it anyway.) In a few years
he will have a complete file on you.
Since you will be one of the few who
really do this, he will reach for you first
when something nice shows up.
While on one job, if you ever decide
that you want to make a change, you
must be particularly sure to inform your
faculty member about it. He does not,
for several reasons, wish to bother you
with offers in the usual case. He should
and will let you alone when your present
opportunities are as good where you are
as it seems they would be elsewhere.
Moreover, your company will properly
resent it if we or anyone else are con-
tinually bringing offers to your atten-
tion. Experienced men know that a good
share of a year's productive effort can
be seriously upset, if full consideration
is given to but two or three good offers
a year. When you really wish to make a
change, tell somebody about it.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


... Bell Telephone engineers
developed a better microphone
Did you realize that much of the technique
of radio broadcasting is an outgrowth of Bell
System research? Through the years, Bell Tel-
ephone Laboratories and Western Electric
(manufacturing unit of the System) have pro-
duced many advanced types of equipment for
better broadcasting.

GLIDING is the art of flying a
heavier-than-air, motorless craft,
which derives its lift from the flow of air
over its wings. Soaring is a more ad-
vanced form of gliding in which the craft
remains in flight for a longer time and
may ascend by gliding in up-lifting cur-
rents of warm air. The first soaring
flight, of nearly ten minutes, was made
at Kitty Hawk by Orville Wright in
1911. Gliding was at practically a stand-
still until after the World War. Because
of the limitations on the use of airplanes
placed on Germany by the Versailles
treaty, gliding and soaring began to
develop. By training many pilots in
motorless crafts, Germany built up a
large reserve of pilots despite restric-
tions on her use of airplanes.
Gliding is very beneficial for training
in power flight because the pilot can call
on his experience as a pilot of motorless
craft in emergencies, particularly those
resulting from motor failure. Since he
does not rely entirely on a powerful en-
gine he is a more dependable pilot.
The two most popular types of motor-
less crafts are the Utility Glider and the
Sailplane. The Utility Glider is an ex-
cellent ship for training since it will
stand the hard knocks to which it is sub-
jected when used for training. It has a
light wing loading (less than 25 lb./sq.
ft.), even though the span is only about
35 feet. It weighs approximately 250
pounds. The effectiveness of its control
areas at low speeds makes it adaptable
for training. The Utility is a very simple
ship and for that reason is easily as-
sembled.
The Sailplane is a higher performance
ship. It flies faster and with a much
tlatter glide than a Utility. Because this
type of craft is much heavier than a
Utility, it must have a greater wing
span. Sailplanes vary in weight from
300 to 500 pounds and have a wing
span ranging from 45 to 65 feet.
The University of Michigan Glider
Club has been continually active since
1927, and has been very progressive in
its work. The auto tow method for train-
ing was popularized by the Glider Club
in 1928, when it began to tow a wood
skid primary (similar to a Utility, ex-
cept the fuselage is not covered) on a
froz?n lake. In the spring the wood
skid was replaced by a single wheel and
thus the method of training used today
was established. The Glider Club has a
record that no other club can equal:
four times it has won the Sherman M.
Fairchild Trophy, which is presented to
the club acquiring the greatest contest
points.
At present the Glider Club is training
its members in its two Franklin PS-2
Utility gliders. These two ships are ideal
for complete instruction in gliding and
for basic instruction in soaring. The club
has added a winch and hopes to add a
Schweizer two place sailplane to its equip-
ment. The winch makes the launching
of gliders much easier, and the two place
sailplane would be of a great advantage,
since it would allow the instructor to go
aloft with his student. A sailplane would
also permit the club to give its members
some advanced training in soaring. This
new equipment would allow the club to
instruct more students and to train them
to a much higher degree.
The local club has trained more than
600 students since 1928 without a single
injury. All these students were trained in
single place gliders. Instruction in
motorless flight is given to all club
members by a few members who are
qualified as instructors. The members
of the club, approximately sixty, are
divided into groups of about six for
instruction purposes. Group instruction
is given every afternoon and on Satur-
day and Sunday mornings. These groups
meet at their assigned time behind West
Engineering Building and are then taken
to Triangle Airport in the Glider Club
truck.
Upon arrival at the airport the in-
structor informs his group as to the
airport boundaries, the traffic signals,
and what ships have the right of way.
Now the instruction may begin. The
student is first acquainted with the ship,
its assembly, and its controls. The use
of the controls (stick and rudder pedals)
is carefully explained and made clear
by giving the student basic examples
as to how the air currents act when a
certain stick or pedal movement is made.
Because the landing gear of the ship
is a single wheel, ths controls must be
operated to keep the ship level while
it is in motion on the ground as well
as in the air. After the student has be-
come fully acquainted with the controls
he is towed across the airport by the
truck at a speed which allows the con-
trols to be effective but not at sufficient

Super-activity
in aviation is cur-
rently putting the
spot-light on the
unique value of
magnesium — the
world's lightest structural metal.
In aeronautics, the race for greater
speed—greater payload—hinges on the
elimination of needless weight. Mag-
nesium, weighing only one fourth as
much as iron—one third less than any
other metal commonly used—is rapidly
being specified in an increasing number
of applications.
But, aviation is not the only field in
which magnesium is riding high. The
whole realm of transportation—rail-
roads, buses, trucks, passenger cars, and
even tractors — is fast adopting mag-
nesium as the means of stepping up per-
formance, pay load capacity and power
utilization through weight reduction.
Industry, too, is taking an ever-growing
advantage of the high-strength low-
weight ratio of this metal. In machinery,
household and office appliances, hand
and portable tools, it is doing what no
other metal can accomplish.
Magnesium, known in metallurgic
circles as DOWMETAL*, is a basic metal
like iron, tin, copper or aluminum. It is
not only light—but strong and durable;
ready to serve in many heavy-duty appli-
cations. For example, DOWMETAL land-
ing wheels on the huge, multi-motored
transport planes withstand the shock
and impact of tons.
The New Douglas DC 5
DOWMETAL, produced in a wide range
of specialized alloys, is available in sheet,
strip, plate, sand, die and permanent
mold castings; also standard and special
extruded shapes. It can be worked by all
common methods such as stamping, forg-
ing, drawing, hot-forming, riveting, and
welding.
No wonder that DOWMETAL is riding
high in American industry. It speaks the
idiom of present-day designing and fabri-
cation—greater performance through
lightness.

speed to allow the ship to take to the
air. While he is being towed he must
keep the wings level and the ship in
a straight line behind the truck. These
tows give the student excellent practice
with rudder (to turn left or right) and
ailerons (to keep the wings level). The
speed of these tows is gradually in-
creased until the student can handle the
ship successfully on the ground, while
being towed at flying speed (30-3S
M.P.H.). During these tows the stick
is held forward so that the tail will be
high and thus the ship will not take off
even though it is mov-
ing at flying speed.
After the student has
had ten or fifteen
ground tows, he is ready
to take off. These next
flights are low altitude
or ground skims and the
student is instructed
to fly from six inches
to a few feet above the
ground. There is a new
factor which has en-
tered into his flight,
that is, the smooth,
even operation of the
elevators. Usually his
first few flights are
very wavy and the
landings quite bumpy. The tow line is
not released from the ship in these first
low altitude tows because in many in-
stances the instructor brings his student
in to a safe landing by increasing or de-
creasing the speed of the tow.
The landing of a glider is much sim-
pler than that of an airplane, since the
glider is flown down to the ground at
its regular gliding angle and then leveled
off, whereas an airplane is brought to
a three point landing and therefore can
not be landed at its regular flying angle.
When the wheel of the glider touches,
the stick is pushed forward to avoid any
possibility of an accidental take off. A
glider will not ground loop or nose over.
When the student has become ac-
customed to the flying speed and the
gliding angle of the ship, he may then
be towed slightly higher and permitted
to release the tow line and glide to the
ground from about ten to fifteen feet.
Gradually these tows are increased in
height to about seventy-five feet so that
gentle turns to the right and the left can
be practiced and gradually developed
into 180 and 360 degree turns. In turn-
ing, the glider must be nosed down
slightly just before the turn in order to
maintain flying speed since an aircraft
has higher resistance in a turn than in

Utility Glider
Stands the hard knocks
a straight flight. The student is advised
to alternate the direction of his turns
so that he will not favor turning in one
direction. As the student increases his
altitude and the degree of his turns, he
will find it necessary to judge his dis-
tances very accurately when coming in
for a landing. In order to aid him in
landing his craft at a certain point he
will learn to side-slip and fish-tail, and
eventually he will be able to land within
a reasonable distance of a predetermined
mark.
Now that the student has learned the
basic principles of flight he has only to
practice them in order to smooth out his
movements and respond automatically
to the varying currents which alter a
ship's direction. As he becomes more
and more efficient in controlling his
glider, he will be able to remain in the
air for a longer period of time. Finally
he will be able to gain altitude while in
free flight, thus experiencing the new
and different sensation of soaring.
After a student has mastered his
flight, he may qualify for a private or
a commercial glider pilot's license. A
private glider pilot's license parallels, to
a degree, the private airplane pilot's
license. To obtain this license the pilot
must take a flight test which consists
of a minimum of three flights including
moderate banks in either direction. The
commercial license requires a physical
examination equivalent to the physical
examination for a private airplane pilot's
license. The flight test for this license,
in addition to normal take-offs and land-
ings, includes a series of general and
moderate banks, 360 degree turns and
precision landings. Both of these licenses
are issued through the Bureau of Air
Commerce.
The International Commission for the
Study of Motorless Flight (I.S.T.U.S.)
issues a different type of glider pilot's
certificate. There are five classes: "A",
"B", "C", Silver "C", and Golden "C".
An "A" certificate signifies that a pilot
has made a straight flight of one-half
minute duration with a good landing.
With the addition of two 360 degree
turns the pilot obtains his "B" certifi-
cate. The "C" certificate has a required
time element of five minutes duration
from the moment of release. A much
advanced pilot may obtain the Silver
"C" and Golden "C" licenses, which in-
volve three factors: duration, altitude,
and distance. The Silver "C" signifies
a real soaring pilot since its requirements
are as follows: duration of five hours,
altitude of 3280 feet, and distance of
31.3 miles; for the Golden "C" a dis-
tance of 186.4 miles and an altitude of
9,842.5 feet are required. Because of
the high altitude requirement there are
to date only three Golden "C" pilots in
America.

Now that grades are out and we all
know the worst, it is possible to mention
the word exams without ending up on
the business end of an uppercut, and so
we hasten to report the plight of a poor
student of accounting who somehow
confused 71 and 173.
He was sitting in his fraternity non-
chalantly reading the last issue of Life
when a brother sufferer in the essentials
of accounting strode in.
"Well," asked the nameless one, "are
you all set for the final this afternoon?"

The brother's eyes suddenly grew
wide as he replied. "This afternoon?"
he said. "Why, I just finished writing
it."
Life suddenly seemed futile.
double talk
Which leads us logically to an inter-
mission bull session which took place
at a recent concert. Talk had turned
to the music of Tschaikowsky and some-
one had brought up the "highbrow" the-
ory that to enjoy his music was to indi-
cate that one lacked a true appreciation
for the classics.
At this point the student on our left,
who by the way was not an engineer,
piped up with, "Well, I don't agree with
that at all. I think Stokowski has got
one of the best bands in the country."
Don't ask us how he got there. We're
wondering ourselves.

Nothing is more fun than prophesy-
ing and nothing is more likely to boom-
erang to the discomfiture of the strug-
gling columnist. Because we are
fundamentally weak minded we are go-
ing to sink into the class of the New
Yorker and give our own predictions
for the semester upon which we are
now embarking.
This semester, we think, Presidents
Roosevelt and Ruthven will remain in-
communicado on the subjects of third
terms and Deans, respectively.
At least one sorority will proudly an-
nounce that every active is wearing a
fraternity pin.
The between-class stag line will again
jam the Arch so effectively as to make it
virtually impossible for the causes of it
all to pass.
The Student Senate will pass resolu-
tions calling for better student govern-
ment but it will disappear completely
from the campus scene.
The good resolutions about keeping
up to date in their courses with which
students are starting the new semester
will be broken before the end of the
week.
The Gargoyle will not run a feature
story on the Slide Rule Ball.
The Lawyers will try to steal the Slide
Rule from said Ball, but they will fail.
Despite the absence of the Dean of
Students, University regulations will
continue to tighten and, if they can find
a way to enforce it, picnics in the Arbo-
retum will be the next to go.

A. D. Moore will deny in no uncer-
tain terms that he is giving up juggling.
The Naval Architects will continue to
work later than any other group, with
the Metallurgists second, and the Tech-
nic staff third.
The dry cleaners will not reduce
their rates and the theaters will not
install air conditioning.
The weather will continue to cloud up
on Friday and clear up on Monday.
The Big Ten will decide at its spring
meeting that there is no subsidization
of football in the Big Ten.
Michigan will win the intercollegiate
swimming meet in a walk, or should
we say a swim.

All the peace organizations on the
Michigan campus will cooperate to hold
a tremendous mass meeting on the Na-
tional Strike Against War Day. The
music will be provided by the R.O.T.C.
band and the rally will be attended by
eleven people not on the committee.
Triangles will manage to elect at least
one sophomore who isn't forgotten be-
fore he graduates and Vulcans will keep
the tappees guessing by changing their
initiation.
The engineers will be the life of the
swingout and it will rain for Commence-
ment.
oh well
We were standing at the end of that
Friday night line-up in front of the
Pi Phi house, bidding our fond adieus
for the evening, when we noticed the
front porch light blink its come-in-or-
be-late warning. The couple next to us
walked slowly up to the door, and we
heard the usual "Good night, I had a
wonderful time." As the door closed
on his erstwhile date, the escort in ques-
tion slowly clamped his hat on his head,
and as he shuffled past us homeward
bound sighed heavily, "Oh, well, an-
other night shot to hell."

Most of us noticed the laying of the
new pipes in the underground heating
system last fall. The piles of new pipe to
be put in, the old pipe taken out, and the
open manholes we couldn't help seeing.
But what most of us did not know was
that the work was done by the Buildings
and Grounds Department of the Univer-
sity and was a two-year job. This seems
somewhat surprising at first, but it should
be remembered that they can only do the
work in warm weather. Due to the con-
struction of the West Quadrangle Dor-
mitories the 12-inch steam pipes had to
be replaced by 20-inch pipes to carry
the increased quantity necessary. The
new pipes were laid between the
R.O.T.C. building and the front of the
Michigan Union. From there, it was the
work of the contractor building the dor-
mitories. The dormitory construction
has been made possible through PWA
grants. The government bears 45% of
the cost, the University bearing the re-
maining 55%.
It is probably not very well known
that all the installation work done by
the B &amp; G Department has been re-
ceived by putting in a bid along with the
private contractors. B&amp;G always gets
the contract, of course, since it under-
bids all its "competitors" because it does
not make a profit. Last summer B&amp;G
installed much new machinery in the
University power house, built in 1915.
Included in this was the installation of
a 1500 horsepower Stirling type boiler,
a 4000 kilowatt turbine generator
(bringing the total up to 8300 K\V),
and an electrically driven air com-
pressor. Probably the biggest installa-
tion job done by B &amp; G, which handles
only electrical and steam installation,
was the work done on the Rackham
Building. The building alone cost about
$1,560,000 to build and the money al-
lotted for the electrical and the steam
work permitted the use of the "best
made."

PRACTICE
An engineer frequently faces prob-
lems which are not peculiar to his voca-
tion, but are encountered by men of all
professions. One of these is the question
of social adjustment. Recently we were
talking with an air clipper pilot who
flies back and forth between the United
States and South America; he asserted
that any personable young man who
would go into one of the prosperous
districts of South America and leave
liquor and women alone for three
months, would be presented business
opportunities which should spell for him
a prosperous future. His great plea was
that the American engineer and business
man learn the manner of the people.
The same sort of thing applies in this
country, perhaps to a lesser extent. A
young resident engineer or inspector
coming into a strange town is probably
capable, through his training, of taking
part in the most highly cultured social
activity the community has to offer.
However, due to lack of thought or by
following lines of least resistance, he
usually spends his recreation hours in a
cigar store, picture show, or beer joint.
These in themselves are harmless, ex-
cept that small town beer halls are of a
much lower type than those of a college
town. The young man is soon avoided
by those people who, in his own home
town, would have made his closest
friends. The Professional Practice Com-
mittee's contest this month seeks to dis-
cover a way of avoiding just such a
result.

johnny haigh
We had arranged to meet Haigh some
time Sunday afternoon. About five of
three he called up and asked if we could
whip over right away, as he had a prac-
tice scheduled for 3:30. We did so, and
found him trying to get in a few minutes
of week-end studying. He had returned
from Columbus at one o'clock the night
before, and was looking forward to a
six day trip East starting Wednesday to
meet Yale and the New York Athletic
Club. These frequent and extended trips,
together with the 2% hours of daily
practice, make it rather difficult for
a swimmer (or a man in any other
sport) to indulge in other activities. In
fact, Haigh's one regret during the past
four years is that he has not been able*
to take part in enough social affairs.
That disadvantage, however, he feels is
more than compensated for by the sat-
isfaction of working with a group like
the Michigan swimming team and a
man like Matt Mann.
John was born in 1917 in Chicago.
He began to swim at the age of 10 and
continued to do so through high school
(he attended three of them, due to re-
arrangements of school districts), from
which he graduated in February, 1936.
His father is in the metal fabrication
industry and John spent several months
visiting various plants with him. John

Swimmer Haigh
Expects to go to work
was interested in mechanical engineer-
ing, so when he had been persuaded by
Mann that there was a pretty good
school over in Ann Arbor, it was off to
Michigan for Johnny.
Here he joined the Beta house and
has since become a member of the M
Club, Triangles, and Vulcans, besides
being (along with most of the rest of
the team) a swimming Ail-American. He
has spent his summers life-guarding,
summer camp counseling, and working
in a steel mill. Between semesters, and
at other spare moments when in train-
ing, he builds model airplanes. He is
particularly interested in hydraulic ma-
chinery, and expects to go to work after
graduation this June.

For students in the Engineering
School, Sigma Rho Tau and Prof.
Robert D. Brackett are almost synony-
mous terms. The driving force behind
this organization, certainly one of the
most popular on the campus, Prof.
Brackett was born in Ionia, Michigan,
but lived in California until five, when
he returned to Ionia to attend grammar
school there and at Grand Rapids. He
attended high school in Chicago, going
to Lake View for three years, and grad-
uating from New Trier.
While a student at Northwestern Uni-
versity, Prof. Brackett was very much
interested in speech and was active in
speaking and debating societies. He took
courses at the Cumnok School of Ora-
tory under the then famous Robert Mc-
Lean Cumnok. He also became inter-
ested in the practical side of sociology,
which interest he maintains today, and
took part in settlement work. He re-
ceived his A.B. from Northwestern in
1909, having accomplished a triple ma-
jor in English, Economics, and History.
He was offered the Settlement Fellow-
ship in Sociology upon graduation, but
he declined to accept it in order that he
might start teaching.
His first assignment was at Duluth
Central High School in Duluth, Min-
nesota, where he taught for three years.
The following three years were spent
at Washington High School in Mil-
waukee, Wisconsin. From there he went

Inventor Brackett
"Behemoth" is still good
to Texas Agricultural and Mechanical
College. He taught English there for
seven years and still holds a soft spot in
his heart for the school. One of the big-
gest thrills he has had in a long while was
listening to Texas A. and M. beat Tu-
lane in football on this past New Year's
Day. While in Texas, he started an or-
ganization after which Sigma Rho Tau
is patterned. He accepted an Instructor-
ship in the Engineering English Depart-
ment of Michigan in 1923 and has been
here ever since, now holding the rank
of Associate Professor.
Prof. Brackett believes that public
speaking is a form of culture in itself.
To him, the field of speaking covers
not only the actual oral delivery, but
also the research and other work neces-
sary before the delivery can be attempt-
ed. Realizing the practical values to the
engineer of speaking, he organized Sig-
ma Rho Tau in 1929, which as we all
know has enjoyed a prosperous history
ever since and now has chapters in sev-
eral colleges.
Married tweny-seven years, he now
has three children. The oldest, a girl,
is a Michigan graduate, having majored
in speech, and is now married. He also
has another daughter, a student in the
Architecture School, and a son, "Bud-
dy," now in Junior High School. He has
spent his summers giving lectures and
sailing with his son in their sailboat
which they keep on Sinclair River. Prof.
Brackett is also somewhat of an in-
ventor. Shortly after the war was over,
he made up a military chess game with
new pieces and different types of moves

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


He also invented a device, dubbed a
"coachiometer" by some of his stu-
dents. This consists of a clock with elec-
trically operated light signals to be used
in coaching the speaker.
Prof. Brackett bought a new car this
summer. However, he still has "Behe-
moth," his Lincoln, now eleven years old.
The upkeep on "Behemoth" varied from
$3.37 to $200 a year. The $200 ex-
penditure came in the year that he had
the engine rebuilt, but otherwise the
car was very efficient. He maintains that
the Lincoln is "still good," and he can
attribute his buying the new car only
to super salesmanship.

James E. Brown's two most perplex-
ing problems are his roommate and the
guy who sits next to him in M. E. 60.
The first qualifies by being bigger than
Jim, and the second by constantly beat-
ing him at tit-tat-toe.
Jim has a few other problems which
have already been made public. To
Prexy James falls the task of running
the Engineering Council and overseeing
its various activities. Add to this the
handling of Chi Psi's troublesome
pledges, holding membership in Vulcans,
being Chairman of the Engineering
Ball, a member of the Slide Rule Ball
Committee and of the Board of Direc-
tors of the Bureau of Student Coopera-
tion, then you will have the essence of
Jim's public life.
Privately, the Peoria flash is a pilot
of no mean ability, handles his dukes
well enough to have won the Freshman
Boxing Championship, is now a senior
student in aeronautical engineering; is
just short of being tall, has sandy hair,
grey eyes, and an incorrigibly wicked
sense of humor.
When tapped for Vulcans in his Jun-
ior year, and left with the rest of the
group ten miles out of town at two in
the morning, Jim insisted on climbing
trees to get his bearings set. On one of
his sorties he was able to locate the
north star and thus inform the already
determined group that they were on the
road to home and bed.
This fall he celebrated being on the
other side of the fence during tapping
by winging empty beer cans at passing
street lights as the Vulcan's truck
wended its way from tappee to tappee.
An embryonic baseball career was
nipped in the bud when he failed to
chalk up a single hit.

Boxer Brown
Climbed trees at 2:00 A.M.
Contrary to the impression all this
might leave, Jim is a serious minded
gent, sincerely well liked by everyone
who comes in contact with him, and one
who handles responsibility intelligently,
soberly and completely.
Incidentally, to whom it may con-
cern, it's no use, the home town girl
has his pin.

J. ANDERSON ASHBURN, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF
RICHARD M. ADAMS, MANAGING EDITOR
THERE was a joke going around the
office last summer which involved
the "dim light cast by the new fifteen
watt bulbs which B. &amp; G. has just
installed as an economy measure." The
joke might have been funnier if it had
not been so tragically true.
Not, of course, that there actually are
fifteen watt bulbs in operation, but the
lighting conditions sometimes lead one
to think that there might as well be.
The Technic recently did some research
to ascertain just how serious the situa-
tion is, and uncovered some pathetic
figures.
For instance, in mid-afternoon on a
clear, sunny day, with all the lights
burning, the illumination in each of the
three engineering libraries is about one-
half the minimum required for safe
studying. At night the light in these
libraries is about one-quarter of the
absolute minimum. For cloudy days,
the classroom lighting is less than a
third what it should be; and for night
work the light on the average professor's
office desk falls below twenty-five per
cent of the required candlepower. Even
more serious is the situation in the draw-
ing rooms where not only is the light
woefully inadequate, but vicious shad-
ows are frequently cast across the draft-
ing boards.
The worst single case of lighting en-
countered in the college was that of the
balances in the gas and fuel analysis lab-
oratory. Here, at mid-afternoon of a
sunny day and with all the ligtits burn-
ing, the illumination falling upon the
finely marked scales was only one
twenty-fifth of the minimum for such
circumstances. To illustrate this case,
the lighting would have been the same if
a single match had been held several
inches from the scale in a totally dark
room.
It is scant wonder, in view of such
conditions, that an appointment must be
made weeks in advance to get glasses
fitted at the Health Service.
There can be not the slightest doubt
that these poor lighting conditions are
doing irreparable harm to the vision of
A Michigan Drawing Room
Vicious shadows are
frequently cast
every student and professor in the Col-
lege of Engineering. They all know it,
and they complain futilely from time to
time. In many departments, independ-
ent efforts have been made to alleviate
the situation, but painfully little prog-
ress has been made.
We know the other side of the story:
money. Proper illumination could be
obtained by roughly quadrupling the
present wattages, but you know what
that would do to the current costs, and
it would necessitate installation of larger
cables throughout. It just isn't prac-
tical.
But it is criminal to let so many peo-
ple do so much work with such patheti-
cally inadequate light. When eyesight is
endangered, it would seem that no cost
would be too great, and still there is no
hope of obtaining adequate light from
present installations.
All this would be sad but pointless if
there were no solution available. The
one bright spot in the picture is that a
solution is available. As was pointed out
in the Tfxhnic last May, twenty-five
dollars will buy the ingredients for a
Quarter of a mile of fluorescent lighting,
and glass is twenty cents a pound.
Furthermore, the same illumination can
be obtained from one-third the amper-
age with fluorescent lights.
Tests on an installation above a draft-
ing table in the blue print room, show
that there is a more than adequate,
nearly uniform, almost shadowless light
over the entire working surface of the
table.
The joker in the pack is that while
the tubes themselves are cheap and the
cost of operation is no more for three
times as much light, the initial installa-
tion cost for fixtures is very high.
Nevertheless, the installation of some
such adequate lighting system, regard-
less of cost, is a step which is demanded,
in the name of humanity, unless we are
to continue doing damage to the vision
of students and faculty to an extent
which cannot possibly be measured in
terms of money.

When a pile driver goes to work time is generally the
essence of the contract, with penalties for non-fuliill-
ment an ever-present threat Hence the ability to give
continuous service under difficult conditions and with
a minimum oi attention is an essential requirement.
That, in turn, depends largely on the choice, for each
part, oi the material best adapted to the job.
One manufacturer, whose pile drivers have made
an enviable record for trouble-free performance,
guards dependability by making the ram piston — a
vital part — of Nickel-Chromium-Molybdenum Steel.
This steel develops to a high degree the particular
combination of toughness, strength and hardness, in
the heavy sections used, which is necessary to with-
stand the rigors of the service.
Our interesting booklet, "Molybdenum in Steel",
which contains a great deal of practical, helpful data,
will be gladly sent free on request to technical stu-
dents and others interested in improved materials for
modern needs.

IMPURITIES

IMPURITIES
One interesting research problem
presented to our laboratories for solution involved
the question, "Why may two spark plugs of
the same make and dimensions require different
voltages to make the spark jump the same gap
under the same conditions?"
It was found that spark plugs with
electrodes containing magnesium as an impurity
gave the better performance.
The research showed that other
elements were even more effective and the
manufacturer now specifies that one-twenty-fifth
to one-fortieth of one per cent barium be alloyed
into the electrode wire. This gives a wire three
times as good as the best obtained with the
magnesium.

Engineers must know
both how to secure and
how to interpret patents.
By
CHARLES H. BEARDSLEY, '26
Patent Attorney
THE subject of patents for inventions
cannot adequately be outlined in a
few thousand words, so these random re-
marks can only touch lightly upon a
few points. It is hoped that they may
stimulate some interest in, and perhaps
correct a few common misconceptions
about, patents.
Patents are authorized by the patent
laws enacted by Congress under the
power granted it by the United States
Constitution; the several states are not
empowered to grant patents. The Com-
missioner of Patents, who is in charge of
the Patent Office, is authorized to super-
intend the granting and issuing of pa-
tents, but he has no power to enforce
them. Redress for infringement of a
patent can only be obtained through a
civil lawsuit by the owner of the patent.
A patent is not granted on every type
of novel idea, but only for an invention
within one of the classes of patentable
subject matter designated by the sta-
tutes. These classes include "any new and
useful art, machine, manufacture or com-
position of matter, or any new and use-
ful improvements thereof."* An "art"
is a process, or mode of treatment, other
than a process of nature, involving one
or more operations (which may be chem-
ical or physical) performed on a certain
material or materials to produce a par-
ticular result (for example, a process of
making steel). The term "machine" in-
cludes any device for transmitting or
transforming energy. A "manufacture"
is an article, other than one occurring in
nature, which does not have its own
definite principle of action (for example,
a razor, or even a bridge). A "composi-
tion of matter" is a material—solid,
liquid, or gaseous—other than one oc-
curring in nature, which results from
the compounding, either physically or
chemically, or both, of two or more in-
gredients. An "improvement" is any
addition to, or change in a known art,
machine, manufacture, or composition
of matter.
Among the subjects which are not
within the statutory classes of invention
are: articles, processes or materials oc-
curring in nature; abstract ideas; prin-
ciples or laws of nature; mental theories;
policies or plans of action; methods of
doing business; or mere functions, at-
tributes, or results.
In order to be patentable, an inven-
tion must be "new and useful." It is
not "new" if it was previously known
or used by others (even a single person)
in this country, or described in a patent
or printed publication in this or any
foreign country, even though the in-
ventor himself did not know of such
anticipation of his invention. Novelty is
not negatived if the prior knowledge or
use was secret, or incomplete, or so long
prior as to be forgotten and knowledge
of the same had been lost, or if the use
was experimental, or if accidental and
the significance was unappreciated.
An invention is "useful" if it is capa-
ble of producing a desired result of
benefit to the public, even though very
slight. It is not considered useful if it
is capable only of being used for a pur-
pose which is undesirable on the ground
of public policy. For example, a device is
not "useful" which has no usefulness

*For the sake of brevity, and since these
remarks are primarily for engineers, patents for
ornamental designs and for plants are not dis-
cussed herein.

injurious to health or safety. The in-
vention must be operative, even though
imperfectly, but it need not be entirely
practical, or efficient, or of commercial
value.
A third requisite of patentability is
that the concept be of an inventive
character. The question of what is "in-
vention" cannot be answered by any
general statement or definition, but can
only be determined on the basis of the
particular facts in each case. Strangely
enough, the principal rules relating to in-
vention are negative ones and tell us
what is not invention. Invention must
be the result of exercise of the mental
faculties to a greater extent than is
represented by the use of mere skill by
a trained worker, must not represent a
step backward, and must constitute
more than the mere natural progress
and improvement of the particular field
in which the worker is engaged. How-
ever, invention may be found in only
very slight changes or improvements.
It may be the result of an accidental
discovery, so long as the significance of
the discovery is appreciated.
A patent is granted only upon an ap-
plication in suitable form by the in-
ventor to the Commissioner of Patents.
The application includes a petition, de-
scription of the invention or "specifica-
tions," and drawings where the invention
is capable of illustration. Included in the
specification are one or more "claims,"
which are brief formal statements of
what the invention comprises. An oath
by the inventor that he believes himself
to be the first inventor, and a govern-
ment fee are also required as a part of
the application. Ordinarily, no model
need be built, and no actual demonstra-
tion made.
The application is referred to a Pri-
mary Examiner of one of the sixty-five
examining divisions of the Patent Office,
who is skilled in the particular field to
which the invention relates, and who
makes an investigation of the prior
patents and publications to determine
whether the invention is novel and pat-
entable. If the invention is patentable,
and the application is in proper order,
a patent is granted upon the payment
of an additional government fee. Us-
ually, the application is not accepted in
its original form and revision of the
claims, and arguments in favor of the
patentability of the invention are neces-
sary.
An application for a patent may be
made only by the original and first in-
ventor—or inventors, if it is a joint
invention—with the exception that
where an inventor becomes insane his
guardian, conservator or representative,
or where he dies his executor or adminis-
trator, is entitled to make application
in the inventor's behalf. There is no dis-
ability on account of the inventor's being
a married woman, a minor, a non-resi-
dent or an alien. An application cannot
be made by an employer, business asso-
ciate, friend, or assignee of the inventor.
Since only a natural person can be an
inventor, a partnership, association or
corporation cannot file an application.
An inventor may, either intentionally
or inadvertently, lose his right to obtain
a patent. The inventor is barred from
obtaining a patent if the application is
not filed within two years* after the in-
vention was patented or described in a
printed publication in this or any for-
eign country, or was in public use in the
United States, or if the invention is
abandoned before the application is filed.
Moreover, an inventor may, during the
pendancy of an application, abandon
or disclaim his invention, and thus de-
prive himself of the right to obtain a
patent.
If, during the pendency of the appli-
cation, it is found that two or more ap-
plications are in conflict; that is, are
claiming substantially the same inven-
tion, an "interference" may be declared
and the several applicants required to
prove which of them is the first inventor.
If the Patent Office inadvertently grants
a patent during the pendency of a con-
flicting application, an interference be-
tween the application and the patent
may be declared. Inasmuch as the Pat-
ent Office has no facilities for making its
own investigations, it decides this ques-
tion solely upon the testimony presented
by the contesting inventors, and it is,
therefore, important, from the stand-
point of the applicant, that he present
convincing proof as to when he made his
invention.
Broadly speaking, it may be said that
an invention comprises two parts: first,
the mental act of conceiving the inven-
tion, and second, the physical act of
embodying it in tangible form; an in-
vention is not considered complete until
it has been "reduced to practice" by the
second act. For example, in the case of
a machine, "reduction to practice" com-
prises constructing a device of substan-
tially full size and successfully operating

it to perform its intended function. An
invention is not completed merely by
making drawings or a small scale model,
or by describing the invention, either
orally or in writing. However, as between
rival inventors, the first to conceive the
invention will be held to be the first
inventor, provided he is reasonably dili-
gent in reducing the invention to prac-
tice, even though the other inventor,
who conceives later, succeeds in reduc-
ing his invention to practice first.
The only exception to the rule of re-
quiring "reduction to practice" for a
completion of an invention, is where an
allowable patent application is filed. The
act of filing is considered the equivalent,
in most respects, to the reduction of the
invention to practical form.
A patent does not give the patentee
10
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


the right to practice his invention; it
gives him only the right to exclude
others from making, using or selling the
invention. The inventor has an inherent
right to practice his invention, whether
he obtains a patent or not, so long as his
invention does not infringe an earlier
patent. If it does infringe an earlier
patent, he is an infringer, whether he
obtains a patent or not. This apparent
paradox perhaps may be understood by
an illustration. For example, inventor
A has a patent granted in 1930 covering
broadly a machine in all its practical
forms. Inventor B in 1935 invents an
improvement upon the machine covered
by A's patent. B's machine, even though
an improvement, infringes A's patent.
Thus, while B can prevent A from using
the improvement on A's machine, A,
Electronics
on the other hand, can prevent B from
using the machine, not only in its orig-
inal form, but also with the improve-
ment.
The right granted a patentee operates
anywhere within the territory under the
jurisdiction of the United States, or
upon a ship flying the United States
flag. United States patents, however,
have no force or effect in any foreign
countries. Conversely, no foreign patent
can be enforced against any person
within the jurisdiction of the United
States. A patent can be enforced against
one or more natural persons or against
a partnership, association, or corpora-
tion.
Infringement is the making, using or
selling of an art, machine, manufacture,
or composition of matter encompassed

within the terms of the claims of the
patent. Any subject matter illustrated
or described by the patent but not cov-
ered by the terms of the claims is open
to the public. A party who aids or in-
duces infringement, or who makes, uses,
or sells parts for a patented invention,
may be held liable for "contributory in-
fringement."
Enforcement of a patent is effected by
the owner of the patent bringing a civil
suit against the infringer in the proper
United States District Court. Infringe-
ment of a patent is not a crime and the
executive branch of the federal govern-
ment has no duty nor power to prevent
infringement. Recovery for damages
may be obtained by a civil suit in a
state court, but no injunction can be
obtained.
In the event that the patent is held
valid and infringed, the patentee usually
obtains an injunction restraining the
infringer from committing further acts
of infringement during the life of the
patent. In addition, the patentee may
obtain either a money recovery, based
upon the actual damage which he has
suffered by reason of the infringement,
or upon the profits obtained by the in-
fringer by reason of his use of the in-
vention, or in certain cases, a reasonable
royalty.
A patent is granted for a single non-
renewable term of seventeen years,
which can be extended only by special
acts of Congress. Such extensions have
been relatively rare.
A patent is not effective until the date
of its issue and there is no liability for
infringement prior to the issuance of the
patent, even though an application is.
pending. The words "Patent Pending"
found on patented articles, usually in-
dicate merely that an application is
pending. Upon the expiration of the pat-
ent, and forever after, the invention is
open to the free use of the public; there
can be no infringement of an expired
patent.
The purpose of the patent laws is to
encourage invention, and it is generally
believed they have been effective in pro-
ducing this result. It is the privilege and
duty of engineers—who comprise the
largest class of inventors—to aid in the
further improvement and development
of these laws, so that they may con-
tinue to fulfill their purpose.

Costly and dangerous mistakes in
structural design can be avoided
by investigation of models.
STRUCTURAL

LAWRENCE C. MAUCH, '21 E
Assistant Professor of Civil Engineering
The Questions Answered
Ideas are also sold.
THE term "structural model" is most
frequently used to designate a struc-
ture or a structural member that has
been built for observation of its behavior
when subjected to various conditions of
loading. When such observations are ac-
companied by definite measurements,
the engineer can make more accurate
assumptions in regard to the fundamen-
tal action of similar structures or as to
the characteristics of the applied load-
ing. Deductions obtained from such
tests are, of course, more convincing if
expressed in mathematical terms which
permit of generalization, but even such
a rational development frequently re-
quires experimental data for its practical
application. In addition, structural
models have given valuable aid in the
solution of difficult problems of con-
struction or design.
Three general uses for structural
models may be distinguished, although
a particular model may be employed
for more than one purpose. Experimental
models used for the determination and
verification of assumptions and postu-
lates in structural design will be con-
sidered first. The methods employed can
be illustrated by several examples of
experiments carried on in the Civil En-
gineering Department.
For many years, engineers have been
interested in the pressure of earth
against retaining walls and in the resis-
tance that soil offers to the pressure of
column and wall footings. However, the
experimental work recorded in technical
literature up to a decade or so was in-
sufficient to justify the premises upon
which specification and building codes
were formulated. Since 1927, the De-
partment of Civil Engineering has aided
in several research projects under the
supervision of Professor W. S. Housel,
which have added considerable informa-
tion to the subject of foundations and
have served as the basis for new de-
velopments in the field of soil mechanics.
In one of the projects, a sixty-ton jack
was used to load bearing plates of vari-
ous sizes and shapes to a pressure which
produced continual settlement. Valuable
data were obtained on the effect of size
and shape of plates on the rate of settle-
ment and upon pressure distribution.
The two-hinged Vierendeel truss arch
is typical of certain types of structures
in which the various members are rigidly
connected together. The word "rigidly"
is only a relative term, as the material
within the joint, or the area common to
the several members that are being con-
nected, actually undergoes some de-
formation. A study has been made by
the author to determine the stresses and
deformation in such structures with the
expectation that more accurate informa-
tion as to the effect of the joints upon
structural action will enable better de-
signs to be made. The deformation
within the joint has been measured both
on separate joint models and by meas-
urements on small scale structural
models. This data has revealed charac-
teristics of various joint details that are
of importance in determining the stiff-
ness and strength of the structure.
As previous tests had shown the ad-
visability of giving special consideration
to the structural action of rigid connec-
tions for members with I-shaped cross-
sections, a study of this problem to-
gether with some associated questions is
being made by the author. The initial
tests of both celluloid and steel models
have already revealed the weakness of
unstiffened curved compression flanges
against lateral buckling and twist. These
tests and a study of the data have not
yet been completed.
The mathematical analysis of many
statically indeterminate structures may
be undesirable because of the time re-
quired or because of the use of doubtful
physical factors. Again, a mechanical
12
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


may be desirable simply as a check on
the mathematical solution. Whatever the
reason for using a model may be, the
first problem encountered, and fre-
quently the most difficult, is the con-
struction of the model. In selecting pro-
portions and materials, the safest proce-
dure to follow is to regard the model
as one structure and the prototype as
another, with the relationship between
the two established by fundamental
principles of mechanics and strength of
materials.
The use of the elastic deformations of
these small models to determine the
stresses and strains in complicated struc-
tures represents the second type of use
for structural models. To obtain the
fundamental relations between the ac-
tion of the prototype and the model, let
us consider the displacement of the end
of a structural member that is caused by
deformations due to flexure, shear, axial
stress, and torsion respectively. The dis-
placements shown in Figure 1 can be
summarized as follows:
Ab due to bending moment—

EI
F/
A„ due to shear—function of...kv
A„ due to direct stress—

where E = modulus of elasticity in
direct stress; E. = modulus of elasticity
in shear; A = area; I — moment of
inertia; J = polar moment of inertia;
and k — shape factor.
Let the subscript m denote quantities
in the model and p in the prototype.
Then, if only flexure is to be considered
in both model and prototype, the rela-
tionship will be:
F / 3 F
Em In
F,
where R„ =^
F,
ip I, _ / Rf R,» \ / Ip\

/ F p

P 'P ^P
If, therefore, the values A|„„ are to be
proportional to Abp, the ratios RF, R(, R,.
can be selected arbitrarily provided that
the ratio ~T^~ is kept constant for every
member. Evidently, for this case, any
scale, any material of constant E, and
any shape cross-section can be used.
If the deformations due to both bend-
ing and direct stress are of importance
in the prototype, then they are also of
importance in the model and should
have the same relative magnitudes. This
relation can be written directly from the
values as follows:
A(im Afjp F,„ /m Em Im Fp /p Ep Ip
-=— or
Abn, A|lp A,„ Em Fm An" Ap Ep Fp 1/

A K"l A
In this case, the transverse scale and
shape of the cross-section cannot be
selected independent of Rj, the length
scale. Similar relations can be estab-
lished for shear and torsion, although it
is not often necessary. From this brief
description, the reader has perhaps al-
ready drawn the correct conclusion, that
the construction of an accurate model
is often a difficult task. Although the
most accurate models are usually ob-
tained by reducing all dimensions of
the prototype by the same scale factor,
they are not always convenient to use.
As the law of superposition does not
apply when buckling of compression
members occurs, considerable care must
be taken when interpreting the data from
models in which such conditions exist.
In the mechanical analysis of models,
two distinct methods of solution are
available, use of the Maxwell-Mohr re-
ciprocal theorem, and the measurement
of deformations due to the application
of definite loads. As each method has
relative advantages and disadvantages,
a careful study must be made of the
model to be tested and of what is re-
quired from the test before the testing
procedure can be adopted. In general,
the reciprocal theorem is most conven-
ient when only the values of redundant
external or internal forces are desired.
The use of loads similar to those acting
on the prototype is of advantage when
the emphasis is more on the stiffness and
participation of the various members
and connections. For some problems,
both methods are useful. When the
loads on the prototype are due to grav-
ity forces of the structure itself, they
are very difficult to reproduce correctly
on the model.
Other procedures for the solution of
special problems in stress analysis such
as photo-elastic measurements, mem-
brane analogy, or electrical potential
analogy, although valuable for certain
types of models, will only be mentioned
here as they are more limited in scope
than those discussed previously. They
are used to determine localized stress
conditions rather than general structural
action.
The third type of model is fairly fa-
miliar to engineers. In many structures
that are used for industrial buildings,
large bridges, power development, and
municipal projects, special features are
incorporated whose construction and op-
eration involve new problems. Small
scale models serve to show if the con-
struction problems have been correctly
solved and if the desired results will be
obtained. They are also used as demon-
stration models to give people who are
unfamiliar with the project a quick in-
sight into the primary features.
The place of models in the develop-
ment of structural design has been
briefly discussed in this article together
with some examples of their use in
structural engineering at the University
of Michigan. The author hopes he has
made clear that a careful design of a
model must be made before it will repro-
duce even approximately the action of
its prototype. The conditions of similar-
ity between model and prototype are
seldom exact, except for simple cases,
and, therefore, the tests of actual struc-
tures must occasionally be made.

a group seem to have successfully
dodged manufacturing as a field in which
to apply their training. To be sure, a
great many go to work in industrial
concerns, but seem to prefer the more
scientific effort concerned with product
design carried on in the so-called En-
gineering Department. Not every en-
gineer is constituted to do otherwise.
But there are many who, foregoing the
privilege of wearing a white collar,
would be happier, and hence more suc-
cessful, if they went into the "shop."
You will say that the graduate en-
gineer knows nothing about manufactur-
ing operations and therefore cannot get
a worth-while job in the shop. By the
same process of reasoning, you will also
conclude that he knows very little more
about industrial design. As a matter of
fact, if the employer were to attempt
to get a full return from wages paid
immediately, about the only department
in industry where he could place the
graduate to "work at his trade" would
be in the laboratory.
Various figures are quoted as the cost
to train a new employee, which indicates
that the employer recognizes an ac-
cumulated loss incurred with each new
man. The figure would differ according
to the department in which he starts, but
from the graduate's viewpoint, that is of
no particular concern. What he wants is
to get on the payroll, and here is where
he probably makes his first mistake. He
may be able to get a slightly higher
wage at the beginning by going into the
"Engineering Department."
One cannot find fault with his im-
mediate concern to make a living but
perhaps he chooses the "Engineering

Department" for another reason. He is
often schooled to think that he should
attain a vice-presidency in the not too
distant future. As a result, he may rea-
son that he is closer to that position if
he stays on the office side of the organ-
ization.
It would appear that many others also
reason the same way, because once he
has landed, the graduate who critically
takes stock of his prospects usually finds
considerable competition already ahead
of him. Now, one need not be a gradu-
ate engineer to appreciate the effects of
competition. The good man will succeed
with the help of his rivals. On the other
hand, the average man may not make
the progress he thinks he should in the
technical work of the "Engineering De-
partment."
The "average engineer" referred to
here likes action. He likes people and
mechanical processes to about the same
extent. Such preferences are mentioned
to contrast with leanings toward the ab-
stract applications of formulas to design
and mechanics. Either type of individual
is assumed to possess honesty, initiative,
judgment, and analytical ability to the
same degree. However, in addition, tact,
a pleasant personality, sales ability, and
similar traits must be present in the en-
gineer who would accomplish many ob-
jectives in the shop which depend so
largely upon the personal equation.
Perseverance, mechanical inclinations,
imagination, and commercial instinct
are other highly desirable qualities
which will add to the success of the en-
gineer who chooses the shop as his start-
ing base.
Assume that the graduate has thought
the problem through to a conclusion,
has read something about
the field of work being dis-
cussed here, and has de-
cided to make a start in
the shop. His first prob-
lem, then, will be one of
orientation, because his
associates have not had as
complete an education as
he. He will find it help-
ful to conceal his scholas-
tic attainments until they
can be applied without
ostentation. If he connects
with one of the firms that
hires half a dozen engi-
neers for training every
year, he can be less re-
served because the shop
groups in those plants have
long since learned what to

It is his analytical ability, the most
valuable asset the engineer has, that
gets him off on the wrong foot. This
attribute may even reach an apex in the
rare quality of imagination, the very
quality which industry seeks. It is ap-
plied imagination which produces the
perpetual change that creates disturb-
ance. Industry wants and needs change,
lots of it, as pointed out by the Brook-
ings Institution in this sentence: "A
particular business man, firm or corpora-
tion may indeed survive over a long
period of years, but only if production
methods employed keep always abreast
of changing times."
Many of the more logical thinkers of
today suggest that lasting improvements
in general welfare will come from low-
ered selling prices which result from
lowered costs. Here is where the techni-
cal man with analytical ability and
imagination can find work to do. Time-
study work, now given the broader name
of Industrial Engineering, is a part of
the usual cost reduction program. Time-
study work offers ample opportunity
to use analytical talent and creative
ability. It offers more than that. It pro-
vides what is perhaps the most rapid

means through which to learn manu-
facturing processes and product. And
that is what the engineer needs most,
after he has elected to go into the shop.
He needs it, first, in order to become as
quickly as possible an asset to the firm
instead of a liability. In addition, he can
then apply his engineering, analytical
ability and imagination, more usefully
and more frequently. His batting aver-
age will consequently be further im-
proved.
However, the young engineer must
realize beforehand the significance of
the previous remarks about his training.
In timestudy work, he has much the
same opportunity to see things greatly
magnified as when he looked at a speci-
men through a microscope in the labo-
ratory. He sees many changes that could
be made. Some of them will be very
worth-while improvements because his
outside viewpoint, another of his assets,
enables him to offer constructive sug-
gestions. So far, everything is all right.
It is when he puts forth the suggestions
that he collides with the well-known
adage that says "it is human nature to
oppose a change." The young engineer
must learn to get around this difficulty
by perfecting the indirect method which
enables the other fellow to suggest the

Training for progress.
change. It is a difficult reversal of atti-
tude because the graduate has stood up
for his deserved credits for so long. But
the engineer will soon learn that the
other fellow will push his own ideas
much more strenuously than he will
those which are sold to him.
So, one of the first things the gradu-
ate learns more about is how to accom-
plish results while getting along with
people, how to sell himself. He very
quickly becomes grounded in the com-
mercial aspects of industrial processes
because his suggested improvements will
bring out the points of relative costs.
The proposals may be good ones and
indicate reductions in some elements of
cost, but the expense of making the
changes together with the quantity of
sales will have to be balanced against
the saving to ascertain the net results.
While all of this is going on, he will
have ample opportunity to learn the
product of the firm, every nut, bolt and
washer in it, and how everything is
made. This form of education will be
much more rapid and complete than he
can obtain in any other branch of the
organization. It follows that after he
has successfully engaged in timestudy
work for several years, the young engi-
neer will know most of the details of
manufacturing. He will understand the
shop and the operator's viewpoint. He
will know how to get things done, how
to plan production or a course of action,
how costs are prepared and what goes
into the figures.
Because of his intimate knowledge of
manufacturing details, he may then be
given some difficult situation to analyze.
Perhaps he will be asked to straighten
it out because he knows how to accom-
plish results without creating an abnor-
mal disturbance. The successful com-
pletion of one assignment usually brings
forth something more important to be
done, and the graduate finds himself on
the way up. He is approaching a part-
ing of the ways.
He can satisfactorily complete the
majority of his assignments and con-
tinue to grow with the organization. His
training fits him to progress within the
plant, toward operation or staff super-
visory work. The combined knowledge
of product, process and time-cost, per-
mits him to proceed in the organization
in several logical paths. Which he takes
depends upon his personal likings and
the opportunities afforded. He can step
out of a planned path to the goal of
attainment he must set, if he expects to
make progress, and come back to it at
another junction.
The shop trained engineer can logi-
cally progress from timestudy through
accounting to a position commonly
called comptroller. He can choose plan-
ning, methods, sales research, and prod-
uct engineering. He might prefer to
shift over to straight operating as a fore-
man or superintendent, thence on to a
position in charge of manufacturing. If
his inclinations seem more toward sell-
ing, his shop training will assist him in
application engineering. On the other
hand, he may prefer to specialize in In-
dustrial Engineering. He may want to
see more of shop operations in other
plants. He may enjoy the creative ef-
forts of improving methods and lowering
costs.
Industry needs more engineering tal-
ent and the graduate should give some
consideration to the opportunities pre-
sented in the field of manufacturing.
To be sure, he should make certain that
he is suited to that kind of work, and
be reasonably confident that he would
enjoy it. Having answered these two
questions in the affirmative, he can start
in to get additional education while ap-
plying his engineering training in one
of the most fascinating fields of en-
deavor to be found anywhere,

MODULATION
By
CHARLES R. TIEMAN, '41 E
Here is a new development which
will revolutionize the radio in-
dustry, if the public can be sold.
AGREAT stir in the radio indus-
try is not an uncommon occur-
rence, but when some new development
does excite manufacturers and broad-
casters, the public service as well as the
public pocketbook is at stake. In a very
short time there will be a public hearing
in Washington upon the subject of fre-
quency-modulation—the new process of
radio broadcasting that promises to
revolutionize the industry if it is
adopted. Educational groups as well as
radio manufacturers and broadcasters
will have their special lobbies acting for
them. The outcome of the hearing will
give the Federal Communications Com-
mission some solid ground on which to
base its decisions affecting the industry.
To distinguish the frequency modula-
tion or f-m system from the ordinary
garden variety of amplitude modulation,
or a-m system, is not an easy task since
most of us don't understand what the
a-m system is. Modulation denotes a
change, indeed, the radio wave in each
case is changed in some definite manner
to convey intelligence.
Now, to get a picture of what modula-
tion is, think of a lamp to be used as
a signaling device. As long as the light
burns at the same intensity, no intelli-
gence is communicated from sender to
receiver; but if the brightness of the
light be varied, intelligence may be ex-
changed by a code system. If the varia-
tions in light intensity follow in accord-
ance with an audio or speech frequency,
a suitable receiving device can interpret
the varying light densities into an audi-
ble sound. This process of varying the
intensity of the beam is amplitude mod-
ulation. In practice, the amplitude of a
radio wave, called the carrier, is made
to vary in accordance with an audio
wave. A graph of an amplitude modu-
lated wave looks as though the audio
were getting a free buggy ride on the
back of the carrier.
Now, as hypothetical experimenters,
if we desire to scrap all our old equip-
ment and invest our pennies in a new
group of gadgets, we may simulate fre-
quency modulation. Instead of varying
the intensity of the light beam, we could
just as well vary its color in accordance
with a pre-arranged code as before. By
having a suitable receiver, the varying
colored light could convey intelligence
just as effectively as before. The essence
of the f-m system is the variation of a

carrier frequency in accordance with
audio frequencies. The amplitude of the
carrier remains always the same, but
as the audio signal becomes louder, the
deviation from original frequency be-
comes greater.
Unfortunately, a price must be paid
for the conveyance of audio frequencies
on a radio carrier. In the case of a-m,
two additional frequencies are estab-
lished for every audio frequency that
rides on the carrier. The two sidebands,
as they are called, are radio waves whose
frequencies are carrier plus audio, and
carrier minus audio. Mathematically
the relation is fB, = fcar -)- fa and
f,2 = f,.ar — f„. The sidebands give a
width to the radio signal amounting to
2f». This ether space required affects
the number of stations that can operate
within a given band of frequencies. For
modern broadcasting this space required
by one station amounts to 10 kilocycles,
since audio frequencies up to 5000 cycles
are modulated. The value of 5000
cycles is used as a compromise between
fidelity of reproduction and ether space
occupied. So the price paid for a modu-
lated wave is a limitation of stations
within a given band.
The early investigators found that in
an a-m system the frequency of the car-
rier must be kept as absolutely constant
as possible if serious distortion and spu-
rious sidebands were to be avoided.
Regarded as an evil, f-m was kept in the
background for some time. However,
some experimenters played with the cir-
cuits with the hope of condensing the
ether space required by a modulated
wave. But a mathematical investigation
of the f-m possibilities disclosed that the
equation representing such a wave was
a Bessel function indicating an infinite
number of sidebands. The practical
band width has been determined after
much cut-and-try and set at 200 kc.

Western Electric makes — for the nation's ears
—the telephones and the vast array of equipment necessary
to provide Bell telephone service. Moreover, out of the
telephone have come many other products which widen the
hearing range of your ears — adding to public safety, conve-
nience and pleasure. Here are some of these, made with
the skill gained in seventy years' experience.


THE AUDIPHONE—based on techniques
developed in Bell Telephone Laboratories
—is helping many thousands with impaired
hearing to hear clearly again. The Ortho-
Technic model represents the most recent
forward step in hearing aids.

RADIO BROADCASTING is also anout-
growth of work in Bell Telephone Labor-
atories. More than 200 of this country's
leading stations now use Western Electric
equipment to put your favorite programs
on the air.
THE FLYING TELEPHONE, which helps
make possible today's splendid airline ser-
vice, is the air-minded member of the fam-
ily. All the major airlines and many private
flyers now keep an ear to the ground with
Western Electric equipment.

TALKING PICTURES, too, came out of
telephone research. The principal produc-
ers and thousands of theatres use Western
Electric sound apparatus for recording and
reproducing pictures that entertain and in-
struct millions.


PUBLIC ADDRESS equipment, which
widens the hearing circle at large gather-
ings, is another young brother of your tele-
phone. It serves many purposes in hotels,
schools, hospitals, auditoriums, stadiums,
airports and amusement parks.

POLICE RADIO—pioneered by the mak-
ers of your Bell telephone—is one of the
law's most powerful weapons. Today

tion of the f-m system meant operation
at the ultra-high frequencies where
plenty of room was available.
So why go to all the trouble of chang-
ing frequencies of standard broadcast
programs, why invest millions of dol-
lars in new equipment—including 43,-
000,000 new receivers—and scrap all
the old just for the sake of using a new
development?
Simply this. The f-m idea allows sev-
eral advantages over the a-m system. In
the first place, man-made static is
—30 decibels down. With such a ratio
in our a-m receivers, results would be
unbearable. The same rejecting prop-
erty of the limiter washes away all inter-
ference from stations which are suffi-
ciently below the level of the desired
signal to gain limiter action.
Comparable quality of transmission
may be achieved in either system if the
power transmitted is disregarded. But
with a given power, however, a program
of a given quality and transmitted on a
given frequency may be sent over a serv-
ice area by f-m from 10 to 30 times as

Radio Waves
43,000,000 new receivers?
greatly reduced or entirely eliminated.
The f-m application allows from 10 to
30 decibels reduction in noise over the
a-m system. That is, from a power
standpoint, the noise is from 10 to 1000
times less. With the proper receiver cir-
cuits, even the cracks and hisses accom-
panying tuning can be washed away.
Such freedom from noise is achieved
by a special circuit component termed
a limiter. The limiter allows only the
strongest signal to come through by its
ability to select only the topmost peaks
of the wave, leaving the remainder be-
hind. In this manner only the "cream"
is skimmed off while the rest is disposed
of. Due to the fact that a f-m signal is
of constant amplitude, the limiter idea
is applicable only to this particular kind
of wave. With a signal-to-noise ratio of
two, the noise will be completely rejected
great as would be covered by a-m. This
situation is a direct result of the noise
rejecting properties of the f-m receiver.
Our modern system of combating noise
is to transmit so much power that the
noise signals are reduced only in a com-
parative sense, but the f-m system of
reception actually washes the noise
away.
A f-m station requires 2 to 5 times
the ether space for its proper transmis-
sion. This means that at a given loca-
tion only one-half to one-fifth as many
stations may be received by the f-m
system. It does not necessarily follow,
however, that the number of stations
in the whole country must be reduced
by the same ratios. In fact, the number
of stations may be increased. Why? For
this reason. The desired to undesired
signal ratio for good reception is 40
decibels for a-m stations and only 6 deci-
bels for the other type. These figures
bear out the fact that transmitting sta-
tions may be placed in closer proximity
when operating by f-m, causing an over-
all possible increase in the number of
stations operating over a large area. The
distance between the proposed stations
has been estimated at 200 miles for good
performance.
The big selling point to the public the
proposed system possesses is the possi-
bility of getting a very high degree of
fidelity. Not that it is absolutely impos-
sible for the a-m idea to duplicate high
transmission, but it is much simpler to
construct the necessary equipment and
circuits for the purpose. One reason is
that on the f-m system the modulating
power may be introduced at a very low
power level, rather than amplifying the
audio to a high degree and modulating
at a high power level. The associated
audio equipment for a-m introduces the
distortion that makes high quality repro-
duction difficult, if not impossible.
The lack of high powered audio
equipment results in a net saving for the
broadcast station's investment and oper-
ating expense. This condition coupled
with the fact that a f-m station does not
have to be very high in output power
anyway, makes the new system attrac-
tive to an aspiring new station. But to
an established broadcaster, the loss of
old equipment and a new investment for
new apparatus, however, makes the pos-
sibilities for an economic saving very
dubious.
Because the 43,000,000 radio receiv-
ers now in use would need replacement
in favor of the noiseless ultra-high fre-
quency type, the receiver manufacturers
are not exactly weeping heartfelt tears
over the recent development,but whether
the public can be sold on noiseless high
quality radio reception is still a matter of
great controversy. Some say that the pub-
lic is complacent in view of the fact that it
is satisfied with a poor quality of recep-
tion that is now so prevalent. They main-
tain that the broadcasting is truly of a
higher quality than the receivers in use
can faithfully reproduce, so that regard-
less of how good the transmission is, the
cheap, poor quality receivers in the hands
of the public will still make a pitiable
mess of the program. However, others
think that the public may be educated to
desire a finer radio service even to the
point of footing the bill for an expensive
frequency modulation system.

TIMKEN Tapered Roller Bearings
Industry's bearing problems constantly are increasing in number and
importance due to the rapid developments and improvements in machin-
ery of all kinds.
Speeds are going higher and higher. Operating loads—both radial and
thrust—are becoming heavier and heavier. Working clearances of moving
parts are getting closer and closer.
So in order to meet all modern requirements an anti-friction bearing must
be able to do a lot more than eliminate friction. It must also be able to
carry any load or combination of loads that are imposed on it—radial, thrust or both to-
gether—and at the same time hold shafts, gears and other vital moving parts in correct
and constant alignment.
TIMKEN Tapered Roller Bearings have been doing all of these things—and doing them
effectively—for more than 41 years. Today they are used in automobiles, motor trucks,
trail ers, streamlined trains and locomotives, steel rolling mills, precision machine tools—in
fact wherever smoothness, accuracy and stamina must be assured.
TIMKEN Bearings are made by one of the world's out-
standing engineering-manufacturing institutions ... a
large and financially strong organization with complete
research, production and testing facilities, including
the world's largest electric furnace steel capacity. TAPERED ROLLER REARINGS

And then there was the Ch.E. 10 stu-

Where, the perplexed student asked his

Just around the corner from our
building is a little store with which you
are probably familiar if you have ever
bought a girl a present. Remarkable as
this modern curiosity shop may be, it
is nothing as compared to the woman
who presides over it.
Ruth Ann Oakes is as fierce an ogre
as ever breathed fire in the eyes of a
customer, if you would believe the opin-
ion of her fellow Burr-Pat salesmen.
This may in small part be due to the
fact that she frequently sells more in a
month than some of them do in a year.
She is considerably less than an ogre
to the hundreds of students and towns-
people who are her customers and all of
whom affectionately call her Ruth Ann,
but what she may lose in ferocity she
gains in respect. Credit this to the un-
compromising honesty with which she
runs her business, which is a poor place
to try to bicker.
Possibly Ruth Ann knows more about
the inner workings of the University
than Alexander G.; certainly she is al-
ways at least forty-eight hours ahead
of the newspapers. Always she is the
first person to know who is elected to
the honor societies. Yet through the
maze of information in which she moves,
she has never been known to lose her
head and tell anyone something they
had no right to know.
Ruth Ann suffered through our Uni-
versity to a master's degree, and was for
a number of years one of the town's
leading dramatic lights. She was associ-
ated with Robert Henderson in the early
years of the Dramatic Season and from
her tutelage passed, among others, Hol-
lywood's Ruth Hussy.
But even more remarkable to us than
Ruth Ann is her husband, Frank Oakes,
who is Social Director of the Union.

In our file of people who were too

placed the freshman who had a new and
different idea for getting that badly

Being possessed of more originality
than the average student, he wrote his
father that he needed money to buy
a horse for R.O.T.C. and sat back pa-
tiently to await the check.

He was somewhat disconcerted con-
sequently when the Railway Express
Agency phoned him to ask him where he
wanted his horse delivered.
incidental intelligence
It would seem that the sorority girls
hereabouts are letting this 3 to 1 ratio
go to their heads, or maybe someone
was disappointed in love. At any rate,
one fairly prominent sorority recently
decided that its waiters weren't serving
the daily repast with decorum befitting
the social position of its members. So
during a meeting they passed a motion
requiring the waiters henceforth to ad-
dress the members with the prefix
"Miss" attached. The result was an icy
aloofness from the waiters, albeit per-
fect service. But the girls were quite
puzzled by the reaction and just couldn't
understand why the regulated males
didn't remain chummy. So logically
enough at the next meeting they passed
a regulation requiring waiters to be

pleasant and perpetually wreathed in
smiles when in the dining room. We
wonder what brand of perfume the boys
will have to wear after the next meeting.

There's no denying the lawyers are
resourceful people. We just discovered
the secret of why the Crease Ball is
perennially attended, and is sometimes
proclaimed a success by those going. It
is a well founded theory that a commit-
teeman will attend his own dance. Con-
sequently the central committee of the

each and every bar aspirant to the cause,
gives him a title, and there you have it.

The time has come for the leopard to

We tell you this not because we think
you'll find it sensational news, except
that it may remind you how fast the
years roll by, but rather by way of an
alibi.
You see, we haven't seen the plans of
the new staff yet, and for all we know
they may be planning a full page of
Hurrell photographs in color. In case
this is done, we want it clearly under-
stood that we had nothing to do with

Confidentially, we don't expect this to

THE BROWN JUG
A. D. MOORE COMMENTS
THE end of a class hour arrives, and
an engineering student moves down
the hall to another class. If he is a
Michigan student, he does not take a
direct path. To do so would be to col-
lide with so many fellow students, that
first-aid rather than professorial atten-
tion would be needed at the end of the
trip. In sidestepping so many future
the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,
somewhat over 170,000 are counted as
engineers. So—when our student stum-
bles through half a gross of future
competitors merely to change classes,
thinking he will be one of 12,408 when
he graduates, and darkly ruminating on
the fact that 170,000 are already hold-
ing down the jobs before he gets there

Too Many Engineers?
Only the local drop in the national bucket.
engineers, our crowded student may
gradually gather the impression that
engineering itself must surely be over-
crowded. In fact, he may already have
been told so, by someone, somewhere.
Let us build up that crowded feeling.
The January number of the Journal oj
Engineering Education (S. P. E. E.) has
a survey, which credits Michigan with
2151 undergraduates in engineering. But
this is only the local drop in the na-
tional bucket. With 146 schools report-
ing, the undergraduate engineering
enrollment in the U. S. is stated as (at
least) 102,879. That's quite a bucket-
ful. Or, as to graduates, we observe
12,408 first degrees granted last year.
If you were made responsible for finding
jobs for that many men each year,
wouldn't you be slightly appalled?
Or again, take a look at the number
of engineers the country already has.
No one knows, of course, because there
are so many border-line cases, and the
definition of engineering is so fuzzy
around the edges. Trusting Lubin, of
—can we blame him for yielding to that
crowded feeling occasionally?
But—as in so many instances—situa-
tions vary with the way you look at
them. Take the home owner who orders
five tons of coal. He gazes fondly at the
pile, remembers what he paid for it,
hopes it will last as long as possible,
fears it will melt away all too fast. Now
suppose it was delivered in the yard, by
mistake; and the owner must peel up
his shirt sleeves and heave it into his
cellar. After the fifteenth heave, he
straightens up with difficulty and wishes
to heaven the pile would melt away
faster. His viewpoint has changed.
To change our dark outlook for the
student, change the viewpoint. Our first
three paragraphs emphasized the supply.
Now consider the demand. There are
no accurate measures of demand for
engineering services. Inherently, there
cannot be. Temporary trends are, of
course, discernible. Sometimes there are
more calls for graduates, sometimes less.
Short-time trends are of no importance
22
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


may, for a time, profit or lose by them.
What are the long-time trends? Will
the demand for engineering services
increase for the next 20 years? Will it
decrease? No one knows, and no one
can know. Anyone who predicts is bas-
ing his prediction on so much guess and
hunch, that it can be little better than
a personal guess.
And so—we cannot state the demand.
But we can trot out some figures that
illuminate. It is often assumed that the
country has about 40,000,000 wage
earners; of these, 170,000 are engineers.
That makes 235 wage earners to each
engineer . . . and since the wage earners
are the customers, each engineer's share
of work to be done to supply engineered
products, must spread over 235 cus-
tomers. Or again, divide the number of
engineers into the total population, and
we find one engineer to nearly 800 men,
women and children. Let our student
with the crowded feeling think ahead,
and imagine himself as holding up his
end to supply his share of direct and in-
direct engineering service to 800 people.
The crowded feeling begins to evap-
orate, perhaps to be replaced with some
wondering as to how in the world can
one engineer be expected to do all
that?
The engineering profession is con-
stantly pestered by a small group who
wish to close the profession, to restrict
it, "to raise its level," and so on. What
their real motives are, I do not know;
I suspect that usually, it is to gain pres-
tige and to increase income. Would such
a move, if carried far, increase income?
I suspect that in the end, it would re-
duce it; for any drastic reduction in
numbers of engineers ought to result in
drastic reduction in the supply of engi-
neered products — which inevitably
would reduce the general level of pros-
perity of the country. Let no one mis-
take these remarks for an argument in
favor of letting down the bars. It is no
such thing. But it is an argument against
letting these pestiferous gentry have
their way about things.
The very acute editors of the
Technic will have recognized that some
of these ideas appeared in this column
about a year ago. The freshmen will cer-
tainly remember hearing some of them
in a recent Assembly. But after all—
can't a commentator once in a while
bear down on the same idea twice, if he
changes the words and figures, and if it
is worth mentioning again anyway? We
hope so.

inside job
A new method of hardening the in-
side surfaces of cylinders and other
bores utilizes the principle of electrical
induction. The machine used has a head
which passes completely through the
bore, heating the metal by induction,
and follows with a water quench. The
entire operation takes but a few seconds,
and decarbonization, oxidation, and dis-
tortion are all reduced to a minimum.
Furthermore, the device is very flexible
in adaptation. Present equipment can
be adjusted for diameters of 2 to
inches and lengths up to 30 inches, and
these ranges will soon be extended. Con-
trol of area, depth, and degree of hard-
ness is extremely accurate. Depth of
area hardened can be varied from
30/1000 to Vs of an inch. The process
permits redesign of parts with lowered
weights and costs. For example, auto-
mobile hub forgings can be made with
the roller-bearing race an integral part
of the hub. Other practical applications
are the cylinder bores of diesel, gasoline,
and steam engines; oil-well casings; and
the inside diameters of sleeves used in
sleeve-valve, internal combustion en-
gines. Induction heat treatment is, of
course, applicable only to magnetic ma-
terials, which include, in this case, any
ferrous material which may be hard-
ened, drawn, tempered, annealed, or nor-
malized by ordinary methods.
illumination
Several developments in lighting sys-
tems and lamps have been made during
the past year or so. In Fitchburg, Mas-
sachusetts, a windowless building was
designed and built. The air, heat, hu-
midity, sound and light are regulated to
give the best attainable working condi-
tions for employees and the maximum in
efficiency in manufacturing processes.
The illumination is provided by 100
watt fluorescent units installed through-
out the building.
Lighting's final triumph occurred in
the Cleveland Municipal Stadium last
summer when 55,300 baseball fans
showed their complete approval of night
baseball by turning out to watch the
Cleveland Indians play. It was the larg-
est crowd ever to attend a professional
ball game at night. Seven hundred and
twelve floodlights, each with a 1500
watt lamp, were used to illuminate the
field. As a result there was an average
of 140 foot candles for the infield and
100 foot candles for the outfield.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


PRACTICE
The problems of right or wrong be-
havior are among those every engineer
has to face in the professional world he
enters. His loyalty to his company and
friends and his honesty in business
matters are constantly being tested,
sometimes in circumstances where hair-
line decisions have to be made. Often
his future in the company may depend
on a few words which, if carelessly
spoken, may result in a retardation of
his progress.
This month the Committee on Profes-
sional Practice presents a problem that
will undoubtedly confront you at least
once in your professional career. To the
author of the best solution, a five dollar
award will be made. The answers are
judged by a board composed of faculty
members. Answers this month should
be addressed to the "Contest Editor,"
Michigan Technic, 3036 East Engineer-
ing Building, Ann Arbor, Michigan, and
postmarked not later than March 30.
The winner will be announced in a later
issue. C. Newton Hagar, '40E, won the
December contest.
The Problem
You are a young engineer employed
in a designing office as a detailer and
are familiar with the work under way.
There has arisen a situation in which
your office has landed a job that another
local organization expected to design. It
has been your habit to take lunch with
the boys from the other office; indeed,
there is a group of young people who
frequently spend the evenings together,
that includes employees from both of-
fices. The situation has become a bit
embarrassing as you must not disclose
confidential information and some ani-
mosity has arisen between the organiza-
tions.
A similar situation arises for automo-
bile designers, who may be called upon
to participate in plans of a new model,
as an effort is made to keep such devel-
opments secret.
What would be the sensible behavior
in this case? You value both your
friends and your job, and have hopes of
making progress.

dave cushing
A man of diversified talents and in-
terests, Dave Cushing can also call a
number of places "the old home town,"
for he has lived in Denver, Colorado;
Hannibal, Missouri; Boston, Massachu-
setts; and Tacoma, Washington. He
attended the Lincoln High School in

Vaulter Cushing
Logging was tough
Tacoma and graduated in 1935 as the
valedictorian of his class. While in high
school, Dave was active in track, basket-
ball, football, and decathlon. After grad-
uation from high school, he moved to
Woodbury, N.J., where he took a year
of post-graduate high school, at the same
time helping coach track.
Dave attributes any prowess he has
in athletics largely to the two summers
he spent in a logging camp in Washing-
ton when he was 14 and IS years old.
He was only "a puny runt" at the time
and his Dad believed that it would build
him up, and apparently it did. It was
plenty tough though, and there were
many times when Dave never expected
to live the summer through. Dave has
worked for Du Pont in various places
for a total of five summers. Between his
sophomore and junior years here, Dave
went to summer school, which he, like
most people, thinks is easy. He is now a
senior and will receive his B.S.E. in
Chemical Engineering this coming June.
In his freshman year, Dave went out
for football and track and made Phi Eta
Sigma. In his sophomore year, he made
the varsity track team and is now in his
third year on the varsity team in that
sport. He also was Class President, was
in the Engineering Council, and was
elected to Triangles. In his junior year,
Dave made Tau Beta Pi and received
the A.I.Ch.E. Scholarship Award and
the Phi Lambda Upsilon Award. This
year, Dave made Vulcans and Phi
Kappa Phi and was elected president of
his fraternity, Phi Kappa Sigma. He
was the recipient of the Athletic Associ-
ation Award of $700, given to the letter-
man with the highest scholastic average.
In addition, he holds an assistantship in
Physical Chemistry under Dr. Gillette.
To more or less round things off, Dave
belongs to the M Club and is Vice
President and Program Chairman of the
A.I.Ch.E.
Dave expects to go to work for Du
Pont in 1941. He was one of the men
selected to go down to the plant at com-
pany expense last fall to look things
over. However, he wants to get his Mas-
ter's degree before he starts work, so it
looks as if Du Pont will have to wait
a year before it gets Dave Cushing.
professor boston
Professor Orlan W. Boston was born
and received his pre-college training in
Nashville, Michigan. After graduating
from high school, he came to the Univer-
sity of Michigan and since then he has
spent the greater portion of his time as a
student and teacher in the Engineering
College.
Destiny certainly marked him as a
teacher, although he had not planned to
be one. In his senior year Professor
Boston, then a mere student, assisted
Professor Greiner in teaching Mechani-
cal Engineering. With Professor Grei-
ner's aid, he established two new courses,
M.E. 6 and M.E. 15a, and he distinctly
remembers the novelty of teaching a
section composed of his classmates.
After graduation in February, 1914, he
continued on as assistant to Professor
Greiner, and in October, was made an
instructor in Engineering Mechanics.
The most important event of the next
few years was the fact that he married
the daughter of the head of the forestry
section of the "Lit School." He had
barely gotten used to married life when
the United States entered the World
War. An application to Washington
was followed by an assignment as a lieu-
tenant, junior grade, of the United
States Navy. As such, he worked on the
development, design, manufacture, and
inspection of submarine mines used in
the North Sea.
June, 1919, saw him teaching again,
in the University of Michigan, but only
for a short while, for in September he
became industrial engineer and assistant
to the Vice-President of the Cleveland
Tractor Company. After two years, the
lure of a teaching job proved too great,
and again he joined the faculty of the
Engineering College, this time as Assist-
ant Professor of Shop Practice. Since
then he has held numerous positions in
the Engineering College, and at the pres-
ent time is Professor of Metal Processing
(which was formerly known as Engi-
neering Shop) and director of the De-
partment of Metal Processing. The

number of Professor Boston's published
articles is getting close to the hundred
mark and the list of societies and com-
mittees to which he belongs would fill
a page. As he expresses it, he is a
"crank on cutting tools and fluids." He
is on just about every important com-
mittee in this field in this country. Be-
sides this, he has his Master of Science
and Doctorate as a Mechanical Engi-
neer. It is enough to keep any man

bob herman
There are three Important Facts
about M. Robert Herman, Jr.: (1) his
first initial stands for nothing, (2) he
was the first person to graduate from
the high school from which he gradu-
ated, and (3) he is a cousin of a friend
of a brother-in-law of Nelson Eddy.
He was born January 7, 1920, in
N. Y.C. (His father is now a field direc-
tor in international relief work.) When
he was twelve, he joined the B.S.A.;
he spent most of his summers at
camp, worked up to an extremely high
rank known as Silver Eagle Palm,
and became Assistant Scoutmaster. At
high school Herman worked on the
school paper and was manager of the
science laboratories and president of the
dramatics club. At the same time he did
enough studying to be able to come to
Michigan, in February, 1937, with
twelve hours of advance credit. In the
previous September, a new high school
was opened at Woodmere; Herman
spent his last semester there and, be-
cause he was going to college, got his
diploma a few days before the twelve
others graduating at mid-year.
Bob claims he has mostly loafed here

Businessman Herman
Knows a senator
at Michigan, but for recreation he does
get his fingers into a miscellany of pies.
First year he made Phi Eta Sigma and
pledged Pi Lambda Phi, later becoming
corresponding secretary of the frater-
nity. In September he went out for the
Technic, first working in Accounts,
then Circulation, and this year becoming
Business Manager, for which job his
motto is apparently "Variety is the spice
of life." He has also been Ticket Chair-
man and Financial Chairman, respective-
ly, of the last two Slide Rule Balls; is a
member of the Engineering Committee on
Professional Practice; is second vice-
president of A.l.Ch.E.; and is a national
associate in A.I.M.E.
In order to graduate this June, Bob
has attended two summer sessions, the
last at U.C.L.A., which he says is sceni-
cally much better than Michigan but
scholastically, of course, not in the same
class. His Sophomore summer Bob spent
as a National Park Service government
engineer in the Blue Ridge Mountains,
laying underground utility lines (he
knows a senator). At present he holds
an assistantship in metallurgy. Her-
man's main interest is, in fact, non-
ferrous metallurgy, and after getting a
Bachelor's in Chemical Engineering this
June, a Bachelor's in Metallurgical En-
gineering next February, and a Master's
the following June, he would like to go
to work in that field.
THE TECHNIC RAMBLES
monument
After passing it several times a day
for a seemingly countless number of
days on our way up the diagonal from
the Engineering Buildings, curiosity won
out and we made an investigation of
that broken off shaft to the east of the
main library. Great was our dismay
when the inscription turned out to be
in Latin. Not having a Latin student
handy, we made a rather inadequate in-
vestigation on our own. The result
showed that the monument commemo-
rates four professors: Reverend Joseph
Whiting, Professor of Greek and Latin,
who died July 20, 1845; Dr. Douglass
Houghton, Professor of Chemistry, Min-
eralogy, and Geology, who was drowned
in Lake Superior on October 13, 1845;
Reverend Charles Fox, Professor of
Agriculture, who "passed on" July 24,
1854; and Dr. Samuel Denton, Regent
and Professor of the Theory and Prac-
tice of Medicine, who died August 17,
1860. The rest was too much for us,
and the aid of any engineer who knows
Latin would be appreciated.
This investigation started us off, and
the Spanish mortar back of the Library
was the next victim. Rumor has it that
it came from the Morro Castle, but we
know definitely that the Class of 1899
put it there in memory of the Michigan
men who fought in the Spanish Ameri-
can War.
is it modern?
In 1895 Professor Fred N. Scott of
the English department asked his stu-
dents in a rhetoric class to collect all the
slang expressions used by students. As
a result, about 800 different slang terms
were handed in. Many of these terms
may still be found in the students' "non-
Websterian" vocabulary. Professor
Scott put these terms into a descriptive
classification for the edification of the
public.
For example, the student of 1895
used the following expressions to denote
inebriation: "plastered," "pretty-well-
oiled," "pie-eyed," "tight," "pickled,"
"high," "stewed," "cackled," "canned,"
"happy," and "bazooned." Some of
these are familiar to the student of to-
day. Other expressions describing ine-
briated persons included: "teedup,"
"shot," and "corked."
Hardworking students were denoted
by such terms as "shark on stilts" and
"cooler": and those not noted for
their brilliance were labeled "duffers,"
"chumps," or "screws."
Professor Scott found that Webster
was regarded as inadequate to express
enthusiasm or to praise the elegance or
fineness of something. As a result the
students used such words as "scrump-
tious," "woozy," "jolly," "slick," and,
under a botanical heading, "peach."
According to the survey some other
current expressions used in 1895 were:
"chiselly," "josh," "goner," "frosh,"
"greasy grind," "flunk," and "p.d.q."
(pretty damn quick).

J. ANDERSON ASHBURN. EDITOR-IN-CHIEF RICHARD M. ADAMS. MANAGING EDITOR

AT A recent banquet we were seated
opposite two professors both of
whom are prominent in campus affairs.
One is noted for the liberality of his
ideas and the other takes an active part
in the control of student affairs. They
were indulging in the favorite pastime
of reminiscing. Soon they were talking
about how "in their day" students were
not pampered as they are now, how it
was felt that they were capable of find-
ing suitable rooms and molding their
own lives.
This came as a startling revelation
to us. For one of these professors is
largely responsible for the "pampering"
to which they referred. It set us to
doing a lot of thinking about the whole
problem of relations between the stu-
dents and the University.
We recalled how last summer when
we were tabulating the returns on the
Second Technic Survey we found a
number of alumni who, when asked to
make recommendations, replied suc-
cinctly "Eliminate Paternalism." And
we recalled how as freshmen we entered
the University fired with enthusiasm at
our new found freedom only to discover
that we live in a modified dictatorship.
Along about midyear that fatal de-
pression hit us, as it hits all freshmen,
and we wanted to chuck the whole damn
University overboard and go somewhere
—anywhere else.
But this is a phase that passes and
eventually nearly all freshmen become
reconciled to, and many really like, the
University. Vet there is never a bull
session that does not in time turn to
student affairs and the iron hand with
which they are supposedly ruled.
In looking at the matter we tried to
be fair and consider both sides. We
have reached the conclusion that the
authorities always try and generally
succeed in doing what is best for th:
student. Their error lies not in th"
things they do but the way in which
they do them.
Almost invariably in dealing with
students it is forgotten that they are
the same students who are being taught
dynamics or philosophy in the class-
rooms. Almost invariably they are
treated as children and told to do or
not to do things. They can hardly be
blamed for rebelling. To present an
example:
In the fall of 1937 the students
petitioned that the day after Thanks-
giving be made a holiday. As we under-
stand it the petition was presented too
late for consideration by the Regents.
This year, we understand that the
petition was considered and denied.
That was all. Just denied.
The students naturally felt that the
holiday was justified. They reason that
the University is presumably run for
their benefit, that they help support it
directly through tuition, and in varying
extent indirectly through taxation.
Logically they reason that therefore.
if they wish to spend Thanksgiving with
their families, they should be permitted
to do so. To this rational argument the
University returns a bureaucratic, im-
personal "No."
The authorities should have given an
equally rational reply. They should
have met the petition on fair grounds
and given justification for their action.
If they could not have done this they
should not have denied the petition.
This may probably be considered a
more or less typical example of the way
in which the University generally acts.
They control our affairs by appealing
to our fears rather than to our reason.
They use the simple "You can't do
that" which one uses with children,
rather than the "That is unwise because
. . ." which one uses in dealing with
men.
We do not feel that penalties should
be abolished. They are naturally neces-
sary. We only ask that in their dealings
with us the University be fair and
square, give their reasons for what they
do, and meet us man to man.
The attention which wan at- other course, then perhaps some
Tin' attention which was at-
tracted l&gt;\ the editorial in the Feb-
cuarj Technic &lt;&gt;n lighting condi-
tions in the College of Engineering
baa clarified the issue upon one
score. Comment from both gradients
and facult) was notable for its
unanimity. We could find no in-
stance in which the claims of the
editorial were contested.
Coupled, however, with this ar-
gument upon conditions which one
professor called "horrible, was the
fatalistic belief that the I niversirj
bas no monej to make improve-
ments.
Wc believe that a Universit)
which could so quickly contribute
its share to the many dormitories
recently built on the campus can
and must find funds to improve the
lighting facilities. If there i- no
other course, then perhaps some
Cook, or Baird. or Kaekbam can
be found who knows that sight i-
priceless: who realizes that while
caviar is nice, a starving man
usually prefers a crust of bread.
This is not the first time that
students have complained about
the poor lighting conditions and
probably not the last. That the
situation bas not been remedied
before is partly the fault of the
TECHNIC, the other campus publi-
cations, and the student bodv in
general. For we have been satisfied
with sporadic attempts, with curs
ing the University in bull sessions
and with complaining to the folk-
at home. We must do more thai
that. If our complaints are
enough and long enough, we
hope in lime to have them be

The Department of Engineering Mechanics undertakes problems that are funda-
mental to all branches of engineering. It not only acts as a service department, intro-
ducing the students to the engineering problems that they will pursue further in
other departments, but is now also a degree-granting department with its own cur-
riculum leading to the Bachelor's degree as well as to the Master's and Doctor's
degrees.
Students in this field will study, beyond the elementary courses in Statics,
Strength of Materials, Fluid Mechanics, and Dynamics, additional problems in Vibra-
tion, Theory of Elasticity, Stability, Advanced Dynamics, Photoelasticity, and Advanced
Stress Analysis. Advanced courses in mathematics and physics augment the general
requirements for this kind of work.
Graduates with such a background are equipped to go into the research labora-
tories as well as the general engineering and design departments of the various in-

SIMPLIFIED BALANCING
HOW about balancing a ;o-n&gt;n generator rotor rurnin*
at ~\t&lt;oo rpm? No, not on the end of your chin or any.
rhint; like that, hut balancing it until its vibration is less than
three ten thousandths ol an inch—or one-tenth the diameter
of a human hair' Not so easy, you say? Well, a little while
ago you would have been right, lor the balancing of a large
rotating machine was a long-drawn-out procedure, |&gt;crhaps
requiring the removal ol the rotor Irom the machine.
But today there is a G-E portable instrument that does the
job simply, ijuickly, and under actual npcraring conditions.

times be balanced in as lew as three runs--a far cry from the

WEATHER MAKERS
CALIFORNIA'S weather has always been a source ol
pride to the natives, but, when it comes to acruallt
*king the weather conditions you want, the G-F. engineer
the West Lynn Works are in a class by themselves.
These engineers produce temperatures ranging from 40 below
zero F to 160 above and a humidity ol roo per cent if so de-
sired. But they really aren't trving to compete with Call
lornia. The excuse for all this weather-making is the
of watthour meters. For G-F. engineers want to be sure
meters are capable of accurately recording the amount
electric energy consumed under varying conditions of fe
perature and humidity .
To insure this, the meters are tested at temperature*
extreme than they would ever normally encounter an
atmospheres saturated with moisture. Such tests, made
\uung college-trained engineers, assure reliability.

M. M. BORING, Engineering General
Department, General Electric Co.
IFEEL strongly that the engineering
curriculum in the colleges should not
be extended beyond the four-year period,
at least for the majority of the students,
and I will try to give you some of my
reasons as to why I make such a definite
statement.
First: It has been my experience in
contacting many thousand young engi-
neering graduates that the majority of
the young people who naturally take en-
gineering find it necessary, due to finan-
cial reasons, to at least partially support
themselves while in school. Without
question, we find many more self-sup-
porting young men of high quality in
the engineering colleges than in any
other. I do not believe that the indus-
try should require these young people
to make a further financial sacrifice by
extending the period required for an
engineering degree.
Second: A very large percentage of
young men who graduate from the en-
gineering colleges associate with com-
panies who have so-called Cadet
Courses. These men, by the nature of
these associations, will be required to
put in from one to three years additional
study under any conditions, and a sur-
vey of the material included in the
Cadet Courses will indicate that a cer-
tain amount of cultural and economic
education is included.
Third: From many surveys that have
been made among the colleges, it has
been found that approximately 25 per
cent of the engineering graduates even-
tually take up sales work and only about
25 per cent follow more highly technical
phases of engineering. For those men
who enter sales, manufacturing, service,
and similar vocations, I am convinced
that the four years of college is ample,
and that these men should be permitted
to obtain a large practical experience as
early as possible so that they will have
ample time to grow in the profession.
The addition of two years of economics,
engineering, or so-called cultural sub-
jects would be of little or no value to
this large group of people.
Fourth: One of the major difficulties
that we find with present engineering
education is that there is little or no
engineering material in the first two
years. Many young men, who were
The question of extending the engi-
neering curriculum has been the sub-
ject of increasing discussion for a
number of years. In December, 1939,

tional educators, engineers, and stu-
dents.
highly stimulated toward engineering in
the high school course or in the first
year of college, even now tend to lose
interest because of the fact they are
apparently taking abstract subjects that
have no direct bearing on their future
jobs.
I am convinced then that the intro-
duction of two years of so-called cul-
tural courses as a pre-engineering period

RICHARD M. ADAMS, '40E
would cause even greater difficulties in
this connection. After all, industry,
is continually crying for more economics
and more culture, is probably looking
for the intangible natural spark that is
inherent in the man. I do not believe
that class room courses alone can create
the thing that we call culture.

IT is quite probable that no problems
concerning the engineer's curriculum
have, for the past several years, been
given more attention by the faculty or
have become the subject of more de-
bates and discussions on the various
engineering campuses, than those arising
from that fundamental consideration:
"How many years should the engineer-
ing course require?"
In analyzing the various members of
our engineering staff, it appears, first,
that the great majority are well grounded
in their fundamentals after completing
the standard four year course. However,
since the knowledge gained by comple-
tion of such a course only represents a
small percentage of the present day re-
quirements of practicing engineers, it is
quite obvious that the average student
would benefit little by a six year course,
as the major part of his training must be
gained from actual experience in the
particular industry with which he be-
comes connected.
Conversely, there is, of course, a small
percentage of each engineering class
composed of those destined for executive
positions, most of whom seem to antici-

and prepare themselves by proper choice
of electives. It is, in my estimation, this
minority group, which makes use of its
engineering ability as a stepping stone
to something still higher, that might wel-
come a six year course, as in the case of
Master's Degree, Doctor's Degree, etc.
Certainly such additional courses as
pertain to these "junior executives"
should be offered to, but not required of,
those who, in most cases, would not be
particularly interested and, conse-

quently, would get but little out of them.
Possibly, the degree of B.S. should be
conferred upon four year students, and,
perhaps E.B.S. (Executive Bachelor of
Science) on six year students—the last
two years of this course being elective.
W. L. RODMAN, Dean of Dept. of
Engineering, University of Virginia
ground in this most essential fundamen-
tal. Some additional time might well be
devoted to extending training in math-
ematics beyond the calculus point now
so commonly regarded as a stopping
place. More and better instruction in
English should be assured. The work in
economics could well be strengthened.
Something like political science and gov-
ernment would be a very useful addition
to most curricula. A specialized course
in history with the emphasis on the
history of engineering rather than on
wars and rulers would
be of immense value.
Some basic course in
psychology could well
be added. Personally, I
do not feel that in the
regular engineering
course much in the na-
ture of business courses
should be required. It
would be preferable, in
my mind, for the busi-
ness courses to be taken
in post-graduate work
by those who definitely
were tending to the ad-
ministrative side in the
program of engineer-
ing. In this enlarged
program there should
be nothing of the char-
acter of high specialization. Such work
should be cared for in post-graduate
courses.
It seems probably true that until the
majority of institutions offering engi-
neering are found willing to adopt such
a program, there will be little hope of
bringing engineering education to this
higher level of accomplishment.
APARTICULAR end in view would
be not to increase the technical
content, but rather to make it possible
to include in the enlarged program more
of the humanities and a better funda-
mental grounding in the preliminary
basic subject matter.
While six years for the course would
be in many respects quite desirable, I
feel at present that if a five year pro-
gram should be developed it would be
markedly superior. Certain details of
such an extended course might well, in
my judgment, care for some of the fol-
lowing subject matter. The presentation
of chemistry should be revised to pro-
vide an elementary physical chemistry
content in place of the classical year's
course in so-called general chemistry.
More time could be well devoted to
physics to provide a stronger back-

TT is my belief that the advocates of
this lengthening of the engineering
curriculum are accepting a wrong prem-
ise from which to argue. I believe this
is particularly true in the State of New
York, where legislation has been pro-
posed to require two years of letters
and arts work as preliminary to engi-
neering courses. This requirement is on
the assumption that letters and arts
work will give the engineering student
that which he now lacks. I have been
much interested, in inquiring from my
letters and arts friends, both in teaching
and out, as to the degree of breadth of
view and cultural appreciation which
they had at the end of their sophomore
year, and I have found a unanimous
feeling that they had extremely little, if
any.
The move to require this two years of
letters and arts work is inspired by an
analogy with the legal and medical pro-
fession. In looking over figures on oc-
cupations of the graduates of Rensselaer
of thirty or more years ago, I find that
about fifteen per cent reply that they
are consulting engineers. These are the
only ones of our graduates who are in
any way analogous to lawyers and doc-
tors in professional practice. The eighty-
five per cent are in administrative work
primarily, and in many other kinds of
occupations in connection with industry
where they are no more professional
men than are the graduates of a letters
and arts college who likewise go into
positions in industry, finance, and busi-
ness.
To base the extension of our curricu-
lum upon this analogy of fifteen per cent
of our graduates is most decidedly let-
ting the "tail wag the dog." I think we
need to be more realistic with regard to
the purposes of our engineering training.
It is not primarily professional in the
sense that are medicine and law. It is
primarily training men to fill the needs
of the productive business of the coun-
try, and our curricula and the time we
require, if we are realistic, should be
based upon these needs.
Further, I am very strongly of the
opinion, based upon a lifetime of ob-
servation from both sides of the fence
(educational and business), that too
long a period in an academic atmosphere
is more of a handicap than a help for
that large portion of our men who are
going into business. It is of vital im-
portance that our graduates get into
their productive work at the time when
they are young and anxious to fit them-
selves into the circumstances which sur-
round them. To require any longer pe-
riod than we now do is not only wrong
economically but wrong psychologically
for our students. In this, of course, I
do not include that small number who
are going into research work or into spe-
cial occupations that call for graduate
work.
Keenly do I recognize the fact that
every interested teacher would like to
see his students better prepared for the
decisions he must make throughout his
life and for good citizenship and lead-
ership, but I believe the remedy consists,
not in demanding more of the student's
time than the present four years, but in
constant intelligent effort to improve the

four-year period. Every curriculum that
is five years old, and every course that
is of similar age, is out of date and
loaded with dead wood. My belief is
that our remedy should be sought in dil-
igent search for an increase in efficiency
in the time which the student now is
required to give to obtaining an engi-
neering degree.
F. D. McHUCH, Executive Editor,
Scientific American
THE aim to bring engineering into
closer alignment with certain other
professions, such as medicine and law,
is laudable in theory. Engineering is no
mere trade school subject, but rather one
which is entitled to a prestige equal to
that of some professions which now en-
joy high repute. Yet, in my opinion,
there are a number of factors far more
important to engineering than merely
improving its "social position" by some
compulsory increase in the number of
years of preparation.
Engineering is a working profession.
Many youngsters with a scientific turn
feel that this will give them a livelihood
at not too great a cost in money or time.
Students with limited means see in it
early self-support or even support of
parents or families. They know, too,
that if further capital is forthcoming or
more time is available for work-way
courses, post graduate studies may be
carried on in any one of many univer-
sities. It is obvious to all that if such a
progressive boy has the necessary spark
of genius, he will make the opportunity
for more years of study and will make
a personal reputation regardless of the
prestige of his profession.
Engineering is, however, much more
than a boy's interest in machinery,
transits and compasses, telescopes, and
carburetors. Too many boys, poorly ad-
vised by non-engineering parents and
high school teachers, enter engineering
because they are adept at repairing the
electric door bell or mother's electric
iron. Too late such boys often find
ahead of them years of labor with higher
mathematics, struggle over drafting
boards, rough life in construction camps,
or apprenticeships in laboratories and
factories—work for which they have lit-
tle or no inclination. Consequently, vast
numbers of them complete their college
courses, and then turn to automobile
selling, small manufacturing, general
drafting, or a variety of other jobs
where engineering is of comparatively
negligible value. (I know many grad-
uate engineers from my own class of
over two decades ago who have drifted
into non-engineering work.) Some of
these types of work, such as writing, for
example, require a great amount of
further study and wide experience
which could never be obtained under
any curriculum.
There is no question but that a
broader cultural background is valuable
to the engineer, yet this is attainable af-
ter the engineer has graduated, is more
mature, and knows belter what he wants
out of life. It is the exceptional boy who
knows definitely in his adolescent years
what he wants, and to me it seems some-
thing less than fair to predicate cur-
ricula on the demands of these few and
coincidentally make the going vastly
more difficult for the less gifted ones.
From a practical standpoint, I am
wholly in favor of retaining present en-
gineering curricula while at the same
time enlarging upon the philosophy of
he will be called upon to face after he
leaves the narrow confines of the Uni-
versity. I believe that under the present
set-up a man is given sufficient training
in the principles, fundamentals, and
methods of engineering, as well as a
considerable amount of detailed informa-
tion, most of which is usually forgotten
after the last examination in the course.
The arguments for an increase in
length of the engineer's college educa-
tion on the "cultural" basis are un-
sound—unsound for two reasons. In the
first place, one cannot become cultured
by way of the "catalogue method"; that
is, the method indulged in by about forty
percent of the Literary students. Using
this method, the student leafs through
the official bulletin and picks out certain
cultural subjects; then, he goes through
the course half-heartedly and comes out
supposedly cultured. An expanded en-
gineering curriculum, I believe, would
tend to go in that direction.
Secondly, the engineer possesses more

cultural studies so that the graduate
may develop his cultural background in
the measure best suited to the life his
mature judgment opens up for him.
HENRY R. CLAUSER, '40E
T T SEEMS to me that another year or
-L two added to our formal engineering
training would merely supply us with
more material to forget. The generally
accepted opinion is that the primary
purpose of an engineer's education is to
teach him how to think logically, and
to give him the proper approach and
methods of attacking the problems which
culture than he realizes. I think that his
ignorance on this score is due largely to
his brothers across the campus, who have
led him to believe that an engineer is a
vulgar, culture starved, slide-rule goon.
But in reality the majority of engineers
do have an inclination towards some
cultural activity, and follow it on their
own initiative. The acquirement of cul-
ture is a slow, progressive process. It
cannot be obtained by enrolling in a
course. Therefore, I cannot see much
point in requiring a man to remain in
school another year or two in order that
he may be saturated with a lot of super-
ficial culture. Afa

angles. It is particularly interesting be-
cause of the widespread knowledge re-
quired for a scientific application of pro-
tection technique.
Lightning is one of the chief causes
of interruption of service and failure of
electrical apparatus, so a most logical
approach is to learn more about natural
lightning. Through extensive observation
in some cases only about three-quarters
of the journey with a velocity of 20 to
140 meters per second. A considerable
amount of data has been made available
concerning voltage, currents, the multi-
ple character of some strokes, the di-
ameter, length, and electrical wave
shapes set up by direct lightning strokes,
and the effects of induced lightning
strokes.
Statistical studies of lightning cur-
rents expected in service have been ob-
tained through the use of small pieces
of cobalt steel having a high magnetic
retentivity. These "links", as they are
called, are placed in proximity to trans-
With a 30-foot lightning bolt produced
by charging up huge capacitor banks in
a parallel connection and causing them
to discharge by a system which auto-
matically effects a series connection, the
engineer has a laboratory discharge
which has in many respects the charac-
teristics of lightning. Standards have
been set up on this basis in order that
persons working in this field can "talk
the same language." Several kinds of
artificial lightning have been accepted
as standard means of making electrical
tests not only on protective apparatus,
but on the apparatus to be protected as
well.

and testing programs in this country
and abroad a considerable amount of
data have been amassed on this subject.
It has been found, for example, that
lightning strokes are started in the
clouds by a feeble "leader stroke" which
finds its way through a series of faltering
steps toward earth. There may be as
many as a hundred such steps before the
leader stroke reaches the earth. The
velocity of propagation of this leader
stroke is about one-sixth the velocity of
light. Upon reaching earth the main
lightning stroke current, which may be
several thousand of amperes, flows up-
ward.
This main stroke current proceeds
from the earth to the clouds completing
mission line conductors or tower legs
of known cross section, and by measur-
ing the residual magnetism set up in
these links by natural lightning, de-
termination of lightning stroke current
and lightning current phenomena is pos-
sible. Other schemes involving paper or
photographic film have been used to
obtain data of this sort.
Assuming that the engineer knows all
about lightning, which he doesn't, there
remains the problem of seeing what it
will do under a given set of experimental
conditions. To actually apply scientific
methods to protection problems, artificial
lightning generators such as those in-
stalled in Steinmetz Hall at the New
York World's Fair have been devised.
Having lightning at his command is
only part of the engineer's problem. He
must know what happens while lightning
is striking. He must have a sense of
time that takes into account not hours,
minutes, and seconds, but he must rea-
son in terms of millionths and tenths of
millionths of seconds. For consideration
of this manner the cathode ray oscillo-
graph has been a valuable tool. The first
application of the oscillograph to the
study of protective apparatus was in
1925 when Messrs. McEachron and
Wade applied a machine of the Dufour
type to the study of lightning arresters
and transmission line insulation. It was
discovered very early that insulation
does not always fail when the maximum

voltage is applied to it, but that the
matter of time of application is exceed-
ingly important.
Knowing about lightning and having
voltages as high as 10 million volts avail-
able, and the means of studying the ac-
tion of this voltage in terms of millionths
of seconds, a vast field of scientific ven-
ture is unfolded. The behavior of in-
sulations, protective devices and entire
electrical systems may be studied as
systematically as an expert might take
apart a specimen with the aid of a
microscope.
There is an additional factor, how-
ever. A protective device must be able
to protect itself, at least in all but the
most severe conditions, and even in
these cases if possible. The device should
normally constitute an open circuit, or
draw a negligible amount of current
from the system at normal voltage, yet
it must become almost a short circuit
when an overvoltage due to a transient
such as might be caused by lightning,
travels over the lines. For applications
of this sort the chemist and ceramic en-
gineer have developed suitable materials
which when applied properly, yield a
satisfactory solution. Such materials as
lead oxides, aluminum oxide, and silicon
carbide have this necessary non-linear
resistance characteristic. Combinations
of materials have been made which have
excellent characteristics.
One of the materials used for light-
ning arrester construction is called Thy-
rite. This is a ceramically bonded silicon
carbide structure which decreases its re-
sistance instantaneously as the applied
voltage is increased. An arrester for 12,-
000 volt service, comprising a network
of spark gaps and Thyrite has, at rated
voltage, a resistance of several million
ohms. This resistance is reduced to only
a few ohms during a lightning stroke
current approximating 10,000 amperes.
This resistance change of a millionfold
takes place during only a very few mi-
croseconds.
When the line voltage returns to nor-
mal on this type of lightning arrester the
resistance of the structure is increased
to a few hundred ohms until such time
as the alternating, current goes through
the next zero which may be a matter of
several thousandths of a second. The
arresters must then revert to their origin-
al condition and be ready for further
protective service.
Since spark gaps are used in most
lightning arrester circuits, a knowledge
of the characteristics of these gaps in
regard to their sparking is of importance.
Of equal importance is a knowledge of
what characteristics are required to
maintain an unstable power arc across
these gaps so that the arrester will clear
itself of the power currents after it has
drained lightning currents harmlessly to
ground. This objective is exactly op-
posite to that sought by the welding en-
gineer whose job it is to establish an ex-
tremely stable arc. A lightning arrester
must act as a high-speed circuit breaker
which will short-circuit an electrical cir-
cuit on the appearance of a sudden over-
voltage and still be capable of interrupt-
ing this short circuit within one-half cy-
cle of power system current.
In order to determine the limitations
or safety factor involved in accepting
any design, it is necessary to test the
design to destruction under power sys-
tem voltage. Under these conditions the
destructive forces encountered are re-
stricted to a concrete test cell where the
danger of flying parts, fires and hot
metal will be minimized.
The behavior of apparatus subjected
to heavy impulse currents is to a great
extent the same kind of an investigation
as that mentioned above, but using
heavier artificial lightning bolts. Im-
pulse currents in excess of a quarter of
a million amperes are available. The
value of such a test becomes more
significant when it is realized that the
highest lightning stroke current ever
measured was about 200,000 amperes
and that the average lightning stroke
current passing through lightning ar-
resters obtained from hundreds of meas-
urements on transmission and distribu-
tion circuits is less than 1500 amperes.
Only a small percentage of the arrester
discharge currents measured in distribu-
tion systems to date exceed 25,000 am-
peres.
Utilizing a unit construction, station
type arresters have been built in this
country to serve system voltages from
2300 volts to 287,000 volts. As the
length of the structure increases, the
problem of keeping the voltage uniform-
ly distributed across each unit becomes
more important. For arresters of 100,-
000 volts or more, standard units are
used and an electrostatic grading shield
is provided. This grading shield some-
times takes the form of a large cage-
like arrangement covering the high volt-
age end of the arrester. The presence of
this shield serves to equalize the voltage
across the units in the stack and is
particularly effective in reducing the
voltage stress on the units at the top of
the arrester.
Equipment for testing thyrite light-
ning arresters is designed to produce a
surge voltage of five million volts. The
illustration at the top of this page shows
a typical lightning generator on test at
Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Similar ap-
paratus is installed in Steinmetz Hall at
the New York World's Fair. Another view
shows a group of arresters of this type
installed in the field. These arresters
are of a special design and are installed
at Boulder Dam, Nevada.

*■ ical industry within the past decade
have received such wide publicity and
discussion as has the announced produc-
tion of a new synthetic fiber, which has
been given the name of Nylon. Advance
notices have mysteriously proclaimed
that the ingredients were coal, air, and
water, and left the general public won-
dering how these three materials could
be mixed to gi,ve a thread. Actually, of
course, coke-oven by-products, nitrogen
and oxygen from the air, and water are
the starting materials which are used.
From the chemical standpoint, the
patents issued in respect to the matter
cover the reactions of rather long chain
diamines with rather long chain dicar-
boxylic acids, thus:

which in some respects resembles the
structure of natural silk. The molecular
weight may be 100,000-200,000 or even
higher.
While the discovery of such fiber
forming compounds is a matter of great
interest and much promise, it must be
realized that the reaction would be in-
dustrially valueless if the necessary
raw materials were commercially un-
obtainable. While no definite informa-
tion is given in the patents as to the
exact chemicals used, adipic acid, sebacic
acid, pentamethylenediamine, and hex-
amethylenediamine are mentioned. Ten
years ago, these compounds were of no
commercial significance. At the present
time, quantities of sebacic acid can be
made by the pyrolysis of castor oil.
Adipic acid, produced by hydrogenation
of phenol and pyrolysis of the resulting
cyclohexanone, is available at low cost.
The technique of producing the diamines
seems to be a secret, but it is possible
to hexamethylenediamine by the reduc-
tion of esters of adipic acid to the cor-
responding alcohols, followed by subse-
quent amination with ammonia. Penta-
methylenediamine can be produced from
pyridine, which is readily available at
relatively low cost. Ammonia, of course,
is synthesized directly from hydrogen
and the nitrogen of the air. Phenol and
pyridine are obtainable directly or in-
directly from coal by-products. It is safe
to say that the economic success of Ny-
lon production will be due in no small
way to the increasingly low costs of
production of the necessary reagents.
The details of the actual procedure
employed in the synthesis of Nylon are
not available. The patents describe some
ways in which the reaction may be
carried out, but little positive informa-
tion is offered.
The product of the reaction is ob-
tained as a tough, horny, material, which
melts to a clear, white, sirupy, liquid.
The processing of this material for the
formation of textile fibers makes use of
a distinct departure from the methods

threads. Cellulose acetate and cellulose
nitrate are spun from solutions of these
compounds in volatile organic solvents,
which evaporate and leave a fine strand.
Viscose, likewise, is spun from a solu-
tion, into a hardening bath. Nylon,
however, is spun directly in the molten
condition, hardening on cooling, and so
complicated solvent recovery systems
may be dispensed with. The long mole-
cules of Nylon, which may be con-
ceived of as long "chains," emerge from
the apertures of the spinning nozzle in
helter-skelter arrangements, twisted,
tangled, and knotted. As such, the thread
has considerable elongation, but low
strength. It was found that by inducing
a tension in the semi-liquid thread the
chains could be arranged parallel to the
axis of the fiber, with a consequent in-

thing like four hundred percent.
The finished product is to be made
available, eventually, in a number of
forms—fibers, sheets, tubes, rods, and
so forth. The uses to which it may be
put are many and varied. Textile fabrics
probably offer the greatest opportunity.
Cord fabrics for tires are a possibility.
Nylon leaders have been used on fly-
lines successfully, it has been reported,
although no data has been presented as
to the size and number of trout success-
fully lured and landed. It is also claimed
that an experiment, conducted in Flor-
ida, showed that twice as many fish
were caught in a net made of Nylon as
in a net of common cord .... But it
sounds good. The first commercial use
of Nylon was as a bristle material for
tooth brushes. The bristles prepared
synthetically have a much lower water
three times as strong as cotton. It has
higher elastic recovery, i.e., elasticity.
Silk, when stretched to twice its original
length for three minutes, wet, showed
thirty-two percent recovery, while Ny-
lon, under the same conditions, showed
eighty percent recovery. Its wet strength
is slightly higher than that of silk, its
moisture absorption somewhat lower. In
resistance to chemical attack it is much
superior. It is satisfactorily colored by
the type of dye developed for use with
cellulose acetate.
It is interesting to note that the ap-
pearance of this new plastic is due in
great measure to something of a depar-
ture from the general American method
of conducting research. Almost all con-
cerns have found it profitable to indulge
in research laboratories; in fact, a
thorough research program is, today, a
necessary adjunct of any organization
worth its salt. Most of these research
laboratories are run on a "practical"
basis; that is, their organiaztion is
directed to the solution of some immed-
iate problem, and matters of "theoreti-
cal" interest are left, so far as possible,
as a field in which college professors
may graze. Within the last two decades
or so increasing importance has been
placed, by concerns who are financially
able to stand it, on the pursuance of
investigations which have, apparently,
no immediately practicable applications.
It was in such a scholastic environment
that Nylon came to commercial life. For
many years the laboratory which fath-
ered it was engaged in matters of purely
"theoretical" interest, and no attempt
was made to make the organization pay
its way. One of the phenomena studied

Its greatest anticipated field of appli-
cation, and the one for which it has re-
ceived its wide-spread publicity, is as
a substitute for silk in hosiery. For cen-
turies silk has been the fabric without
peer for those who could afford it, valued
for its superior strength, both wet and
dry, its freedom from wrinkling, and its
sheen. During the twentieth century its
place has been taken, in a great measure,
by cheaper "artificial silks," such as
cellulose acetate and viscose rayon. The
hosiery market, using upward of forty
million pounds of silk annually, has re-
tained its preference for silk, shying
away from cheaper and less durable ma-
terials—the artificial silks are much
weaker than the natural product. Nylon,
however, compares very favorably with
silk. It is about thirty percent stronger
in tension than natural silk, and almost

INITIATIVE is an overworked label
for quality much in demand today.
When a Superintendent or Chief En-
gineer says he wants, a subordinate with
initiative he knows what he means.
He is not seeking a dreamy thinker
with pyrotechnical suggestions but no
carry-through. He wants a ramrod who
can take a given idea and push it home.
As a seasoned executive he wishes to
draw upon the reserve of enthusiasm
which young men, however inexperi-
enced, bring as their contribution to pro-
gress. An accumulation of knowledge
and first-hand experience enriches an
older man's mental capacity and en-
ables him to view new ideas from a
lofty perspective. It is because of this
ability to correlate, to find flaws, to rea-
son soundly that his value to the com-
pany as an administrative officer rather
than a first hand performer increases
through the years. More and more it
becomes his function to direct, to criti-
cise, to arbitrate rather than to do the
"spade work" on original study and re-
search. Because of his advanced mental
development, ideas can be presented to
him in digested form. His ability en-
ables him to grasp quickly a concise
presentation of bare essentials, stripped
of the maze of confusing, irrelevant and
extraneous material. His work starts at
an intermediate point.
For the original "spade work" in all
fields, engineering in particular, there is
a premium on youth. Like the sophomore
on the football team who just can't be
downed, the young man in business has
a distinct attribute to offer. Blessed with
limited experience, ofttimes he doesn't
know enough to "know" that something
can't be done. Blithely unaware of many
of the complicating factors, not infre-
quently his investigation and his new
ideas, while immature, do point the way
to a novel method, a procedure which
when modified by correlation with exist-
ing practice, ultimately proves to be a
great step forward.

Being "blessed with limited experi-
ence" cannot, of course, be taken too
literally. No boss, however patient and
interested he may be in the development
of young men, is going to tolerate a bar-
rage of "fool questions" or "scatter-
brain" ideas.
There are always pressing demands on
a boss's available working time. It must
necessarily be conserved for the im-
portant work, not needlessly wasted on
the non-productive side-line. Yet from
his vantage point of experience, the
boss's best function is to help others
think correctly; not to do their thinking
for them. It is to further this purpose
that he hires "technical brains" just as
he procures the other materials for use in
his department. True, certain prelimin-
ary instruction and training are regarded
as valuable and necessary. But beyond

Around an oil derrick a cat line hoist that doesn't func-

so easy to combine the needed strength and service
capacity with simplicity and lightness.
It is not easy. But it has been done—by the use of a
modern material for the hoist housing, a Molybdenum
(0.65% Mo.) iron. The strength and toughness of this
iron safely permits light sections. And it also helps
keep construction simple. The fine, close grained
structure permits the machining, in the housing itself,
of surfaces sufficiently smooth to serve as outer races
for the drive and drum shaft roller bearings. Prema-
ture wear or Brinelling of these races is forestalled
by the hardness of the iron.

left to his own good discretion.
How then is enthusiasm and its pro-
duct to be "dished up" to the boss? In
school the corresponding etiquette is
fairly standard practice. The format of
reports, problems, and examination
answers is denned by specific instruction.
Professors are paid to teach and are
sincerely interested in the development
of their pupils. Being conscientious they
spend much time with the least promis-
ing men and plough heroically through

Technical Brains
Paid to think correctly
the sloppiest reports. For in this manner
they as professors fulfill their obligation
to teach and help all who come before
them. Perhaps too much of a professor's
working time is used up by the incon-
siderate talker, the rambling extrovert,
and the slow plugger students who drop
in at the office and stay too long. But
it is that desire to help and encourage
every type of student that makes a fac-
ulty man worth his salt.
It is his job to prepare each man, to
the best of his ability. The selection
process may start in college but it is
properly deferred until later. Only the
first dividing lines can be drawn among
men and their special abilities. These
at best are purely tentative and are of-
ten disproved by later demonstration.
In industry, however, the emphasis is
differently placed. The demand is for
results, final results, that show up on
the profit and loss statement. Naturally
a boss is interested in his men. His prob-
lem is not, however, that of giving every
man a broad all-round education; it is
to fit each one into the groove where his
services will be of greatest value, and to
help each man to do his particular as-
signment most effectively. The complete
misfit, the time-waster, and the non-
performer are sometimes transferred or
more often discharged—in the interest
of efficiency, and in
fairness to others whose
ultimate progress de-
pends upon the net ac-
complishment of the
organization.
The man who wishes
to merit consideration
for advanced training
from his boss must
therefore demonstrate
his capacity to learn.
The manner in which
his first assignments
are handled determines
his right to counsel and
instruction for greater
responsibilities.
Seldom does such
counsel come out in
general discussion. It is
generally administered
almost unconsciously
in a specific discussion
centered about the
final stages of a speci-
fic job. The young man
must therefore lay the
ground work. He must
prepare himself for
each such interview
and be ready to do his part.
The essential facts, digested to the
best of a young man's ability, docu-
mented with necessary data—these are
the requisites for the preliminary presen-
tation to the boss.
Although "preliminary" in sense of
time, the assignment should be handled
as though the result or summary were
to be deemed a final one. One must con-
struct thoroughly even if the structure
is to be demolished by criticism. A
thorough preliminary study insures a
thorough analysis and clarity of think-
ing. A busy administrator has no time
for visionary plans, random guesses, and
excuses for short-cuts, nor does he have
the patience to wade through pages of
unnecessary data however neatly pre-
sented. He must have the facts. He will
surround himself with men who can give
them to him in the form he wants them.
The early assignments can perhaps be
handled in semi-routine, impersonal
manner. As time goes on, however, the
scope of the assignment becomes broader
—in keeping with a man's supposed ad-
vancement in ability and grasp of the
subject matter. The man whose ad-
vancement will continue with accom-
panying increase of responsibility and
emolument is the man who distinguishes
himself with the ability to characterize
each job with a "trade mark" of his
own personality. That trade mark must
be one of common sense, dollar sense,
and thoroughness.
The common sense requisite is ob-
vious. The dollar sense must be grasped
early or one may never even hope to
realize the first rung on the ladder
toward administration and management.
More and more technical decisions are
being made on the basis of an econ-
omic balance sheet. But perhaps most
important is the basic need for thorough-
ness. A man's reputation for thorough-
ness is the basic assurance that his boss
won't himself have to do the job all over
again. A thorough analysis once cor-
rected can be regarded as final. An in-
complete analysis can be corrected in
the same way on the boss' desk, but
the blue-pencilled report may still be
less than half done.
Instead of being final, it has to be
completed and the added part again
submitted for study and criticism. All of
this is needlessly time consuming. Re-
ports must be thorough.
Important, too, is the basic need for
results within a given time. All the bright
ideas in the world and all the thorough-
ness of analysis are of little use if they
remain locked up in one's cranium, or
noted on a scribbled memorandum in
one's desk-drawer. Splendid technical
educations; extension and night courses
in business methods and personality de-
velopment—cannot be of value to one's
employer unless they are exercised daily,
in the right direction and before the
right people. The firm is paying for re-
sults, not the mere capacity to perform.
Through the medium of speech and
the printed word ideas must be brought
to life, analyzed and dramatized.
The first report, being the brain child
of a mind "blessed with inexperience"
may be completely wrong, will almost
always be obviously immature. Most
men shudder when they read back in
their writings of earlier years. But if

THE CITIES
MEN BUILD


TJROM THE EARLIEST times man has en-
deavored to create communities for
reasons of safety, comfort and fellowship.
But as he built his towns and cities he
faced new difficulties. None of these had
greater bearing on his well-being than
the removal and disposal of waste. To
this day the sanitation of cities has re-
mained one of the most pressing prob-
lems of urban life.
Yet here again modern chemistry is
giving material aid to sanitary engineers
who are meeting this municipal problem
in a truly remarkable manner.
Raw sewage is about 97 per cent water
and 3 per cent organic matter. The basic
task is to extract the organic matter from
the water. The solids must be precipi-
tated in settling tanks, then coagulated —
causing the organic particles to cling
together. These primary processes are
necessary so that the coagulated sewage,
or sludge, can be dried and disposed of
either as fertilizer or by burning.
For these processes modern practice calls
for the use of Dow Ferric Chloride and
many sewage disposal plants are de-
signed accordingly, including the South-
west Plant recently completed in Chicago,
the largest activated sludge plant in the
world, with a capacity of 400,000,000
gallons a day.
Dow Ferric Chloride has proved to be a
remarkably efficient conditioning agent.
Engineers favor it also because it permits
a much simpler design for disposal
plants and assures a minimum of chem-
ical and operating costs as well.
In this contribution to sanitary engineer-
ing we find another practical example of
the far-reaching value of Dow's chemical
developments.

Now that March 29th has passed, we
can tell this tale without further damag-
ing the Crease Ball ticket sales. It con-
cerns a poster displayed in the Law Club
loudly proclaiming that one jimmy joy
would provide the musical ammunition
to offset Slide Rule's WOODY HER-
MAN. Some brave soul in the Quad-
rangle, who evidently hadn't spent the
adequate number of months searching
through musical propaganda columns to
determine the status of J. Joy and his
retinue, had penned the puzzling ques-
tion, "Who in hell is he?" As always,
the lawyer's logical brain provided a
response as another ticket buyer wrote,
"Nobody. That's why we've got him."
fire drill
When fraternity initiations swing into
their last night, the pledges usually have
been divorced from any cockiness with
which they may have started. We were
all the more surprised, therefore, to
learn of a pledge who broke over the
traces in the closing hours of "Be Kind
to Actives Week."
The actives had discovered a fire in
the living room and the neophytes were
seeking valiantly to extinguish the blaze
by crawling back and forth from the
basement to secure mouthfuls of alum
water. After numerous trips, the fire
seemed to burn brighter than ever, prob-
ably because of the industrious work of
the actives, who built it up while the
fire engines were retanking.

At long last one pledge saw the futility
of it all. He crawled slowly up to the
full pitcher of water as though he were
about to pass out, then suddenly jumped
to his feet, grabbed up the pitcher, and
galloped up the stairs before the actives
realized what was happening. Reaching
the first floor, he ducked through the
darkened music room, gracefully vaulted
the intervening sofa, and tossed the
water on the fire. He poured only long
enough to make sure his efforts had been
successful. Then he placed the pitcher
on the hearth, calmly walked out to the
center of the room, and assumed the
angle.

TIMKEN BEARINGS
The fundamental characteristics of the TIMKEN
Bearing, arising from inherent features of its design, make this bearing
eminently suitable for every bearing application in every kind of
mechanical equipment. In your future years as an engineer, bearing
selection will be one of your many important responsibilities. The more
you learn about bearings now, the easier your task will be.

RADIAL LOAD


END-THRUST
RESULTANT LOADS
The .most important feature of the TIMKEN Bearing is its
basic tapered principle, introduced by Tim ken in 1898 and
never superseded. This enables the bearing to carry all types
of loads—radial, thrust or both together in any combination
—without auxiliary supports of any kind, (such as thrust
plates or thrust washers).

To assure true rolling motion and thus provide maximum anti-
friction efficiency in operation, the bearing is so designed
that lines projected along the tapered surfaces of the rolls
and races meet at a common apex on the axis of the bearing.

0
Rolls are kept in exact alignment with respect to the races
by two area contact of the large roll ends with the undercut
rib of the cone (inner race).
A scientifically-designed and accurately-perforated cage keeps
the rolls properly spaced around the cone so that each roll
carries its proper proportion of the load.
For more than 41 years a constant process of engineering refinement has been going on,
resulting in the perfected TIMKEN Bearing of today—a product of one of the world's
largest and most famous engineering-manufacturing organizations.

adequate thought is given to analysis,
if the primary investigation be sufficient-
ly thorough—the production will by no
means be a total loss, even if it serves
no greater purpose than to clarify one's
analysis and point the way toward an-
other attempt.
No errors can be made by the man
who does nothing on his own initiative.
How much better off is the man who
makes errors—errors of commission, not
omission—errors which can be caught
and corrected and by means of each of
which he learns, and in the process of
which he performs many errorless jobs
which prove of real value to his em-
ployer.
The aggressive individual who seeks
things to do and does them, is the one
who by doing prepares himself for the
greater responsibilities, and the day
when ultimately he himself will, like the
enthusiastic sophomore grid-star, gradu-
ate to be a "morning-after quarterback"
on the davenport with the Sunday paper.
From his comfortable desk in the head
office he will pass on the performance
of a new generation of aggressive, en-
thusiastic sophomores banging their
heads against a heavy line, eventually
forcing an opening.
Viewing the "play" in retrospect after
the effort has been made, of course, he'll
be able to suggest an improvement, a
better way for the next "play." The man
who has such a critical "morning-after
quarterback" for a boss is the luckiest
fellow in the world. It makes for an
unbeatable combination. One creates to
the best of his aggressive ability to build
a complete, thorough structure. The
other, exercising a review capacity re-
jects the failures, catches the flaws and
reconstructs a workable plan. The effec-
tiveness of such a system explains much
of our American progress and achieve-
ment. Its success depends in a large part
upon the enthusiasm and "push" of to-
day's generation of new men who will
take their places in industry, with in-
itiative, which makes youth dynamic and
productive, not merely effervescent.
PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE
An engineer who has had some experi-
ence in actual practice since graduating
is quite often faced with the problem of
a project which he does not feel quite
willing to undertake alone, although he
does feel that he is capable. Still, he
may hesitate to call in anyone else to
assist him for fear of an excessive con-
sultant's fee, or for fear of an inexperi-
enced assistant's incompetence. Hence,
he has to face a situation that seemingly
has no solution. But he must either give
up the job, probably with serious finan-
cial loss, or find an answer to the prob-
lem.
As usual, a five dollar award will be
presented to the person writing the best
solution to the problem presented be-
low. The answers are judged by a fac-
ulty board, and the final judgment will
be based on reasonableness and recogni-
tion of the factors involved. Answers
should be addressed to the "Contest
Editor," Michigan Technic, 3036
East Engineering Building, Ann Arbor,
Michigan, and should be postmarked not
later than April 30. The winner will be
announced in a later issue.
The Problem:
A young engineer has survived some
good experience and is entering private
engineering and contracting in a small
town. Soon there arises a project which,
as a superintendent, he would not hesi-
tate to build. Neither would he hesitate
to design any part of the structure in-
volved, but he does fear to take on the
whole project. If, now, he calls in a
consulting engineer, he fears that there
will be no profit for him in the job;
neither does he care to place his confi-
dence in a draftsman-engineer whom he
might secure.
This situation frequently arises, and
is leading to State Engineering in some
cases, and to unsatisfactory work in
others. How might the young man fairly
pay for the service he requires and still
retain the job and gain in the respect
of the community?

the formation of large molecules by the
chemical combination of many small
ones and a mass of knowledge was ac-
cumulated regarding these items: how
chain length affected fiber strengths,
evaluations of chain lengths in terms of
molecular weights, studies on the orien-
tation of chains, and studies on general
fiber structure. When new compounds
were discovered, methods of getting the
most out of them were available. Nylon
was one of the discoveries, and it will
probably do its share towards making
the pursuit of "theoretical" subjects
both practical and profitable.
On the commercial production end,
present plans call for the investment of
about eleven million dollars in two
plants, one for manufacturing, one for
spinning operations. This represents one
of the greatest outlays of capital made
on a process which is so fresh from the
laboratory and semi-commercial units.
The new plants will represent the finest
in modern industrial engineering design,
relying heavily on the use of automatic
processing equipment. Production will be
light at first, then increasingly greater—
after it has been proved that the boys
were correct in their heat-transfer coeffi-
cient calculations.
The first year's production will be of
the order of four million pounds, or
about ten percent of the present silk
demands of the United States. If the ma-
terial lives up to expectations, it is en-
tirely possible that it will largely sup-
plant natural silk, unless, of course, the
price of silk should be pegged by the
Japanese government below the cost of
production of its rival. At the present
time silk sells for about $3.50 a pound,
and it has been estimated that it cannot
well go below $2.00 a pound without
seriously affecting the Japanese econ-
omy. Anyway, it is probable that with
large scale production, Nylon can be
manufactured at a cost to meet such
competition; business men in general
are not in the habit of investing such
healthy chunks of money in an enter-
prise without taking into account some
of the more obvious moves and limita-
tions of their competitors. In any event,
the land of the Rising Sun is bound to
feel the pinch, one way or the other.
And little silkworms will not have to
be boiled alive—or even born.

oil under water
In search for new fields of oil, the oil
companies have literally gone out to
sea. In California, large numbers of
wells have been drilled from the extreme
ends of piers stretching out into the wa-
ter. However, in Galveston Bay they
have gone even further.
Seismographic surveys covering 236,-
000 acres on the floor of Galveston Bay
were made. The work was done by crews
living in a houseboat and working from
special barges over 12 feet of water. A
buried dome was discovered, and the
first wildcat well drilled on this dome
became a discovery well at the depth of
6,030 feet below the bay floor. Two
more wells were drilled from pile founda-
tions, as the first had been, because of
the shallowness of the water.
However, it was found advisable to
change the method of drilling. By the
new method, a large barge providing a
drilling platform is filled with water and
sunk over the prospective location of
the well. The drilling is done from a
rotary table above the surface of the
water. The maximum depth of water
over the entire work area is 12 feet, and
when one well is completed it takes only
from 12 to 18 hours to lift the barge and
move to a new location.
The discovery well is about one mile
from the shore, and others are from
three-quarters of a mile to two miles out.
gyro patrols
Extensive studies have been made of
the possibilities of protecting merchant
shipping by the use of autogyro patrols.
At the present time these studies should
prove of value to the merchant marines
and navies of neutral, as well as warring,
nations.
Modern autogyros can operate from
platforms no greater than 40 by 60 feet.
Platforms of this size can be installed on
the decks of most sea-going craft. These
would enable surface vessels to carry
patrols of two or three ships so that
there could be constant protection from
the air. Tests with conventional aircraft
show that visibility is available to a con-
siderable depth below the surface of the
sea. Thus a 'gyro patrol could easily
locate mines or submarines and destroy
them with depth charges or bombs.
The suggestion has also been made
that an autogyro carrier could be used
for the protection of merchant shipping.
An old tanker or freighter could readily
be converted for this use at not too great
an expense. The autogyro would be
equally well suited for this type of ship-
ping protection.

The largest and fastest car unloader
ever built has been installed in San-
dusky, Ohio. Of lift-and-turn-over type,
it is built to handle 120-ton cars at a
rate of 45 per hour or 90-ton cars at a

are used in the mule, cradle, and run-
back tracks to eliminate the necessity
for brakemen. The electrical equipment
is designed to handle the full capacity

a major piece of equipment is out of
service.

dick adams
When he was ten years old, Dick
Adams spent three months in England.
This brief association with things Brit-
ish probably accounts for the fact that
he is now Morals Chairman of the Delta
Upsilon fraternity.
As a freshman he distinguished him-
self by being one of the leaders of a sit-
down (they were popular then) strike in

Morals Chairman Adams
"He's Plenty Good Enough for Me"
Starbuck's during "hell week." It should
be unnecessary to add that the strikers
were met with outstretched arms and
given a warm welcome upon their return.
During that same year Dick became a
member of the Stump Speakers Society
and won his Intramural Sports Emblem.
The next year he circled the Union in
a cab on the night of Black Friday
awaiting the opportunity to slip unno-
ticed past the pantless freshmen into
the Union, and the next day took a ter-
rific beating in a vain attempt to save
the flag.
In the last two years things have come
thick and fast. Dick was first Features
Editor and this year Managing Editor
of the Michigan Technic, Secretary,
then Treasurer and Convention Repre-
sentative (Lincoln, Nebraska) of D. U.,
member of Vulcans, the Engineering
Council, Engineering Ball this year,
Slide Rule Ball in both senior and junior
years, Director of the Bureau of Student
Cooperation, and finally General Chair-
man of the Senior Ball. At this impres-
sive list of reasons for not studying,
Dick waves his Tau Beta Pi key.
Which leads us to add that Dick
studies aero engineering on the side, is a
student member of I.Ae.S., and is aiming
for a job in aircraft power plants.
Dick has other and rather far-flung
interests, however. We might even men-
tion that they extend from the Atlantic
to Lincoln, Nebraska (scene of the
aforementioned D. U. convention). Yet
there are indications that his interest has
become more localized since he heard a
certain very attractive junior girl sing
"He's Plenty Good Enough for Me" in
the recent J. G. P.
Among the high spots of Dick's career
was a flying trip to Ames, Iowa, last fall
for the annual convention of the Engi-
neering College Magazines Associated.
A busy two-day session ended with a
midnight dash back to Chicago to see
Northwestern play Wisconsin. This trip
was concluded with dinner at the Palmer
House and a night flight home.
All of which tells you very little about
Dick Adams, the collector of swing and
classical records; the man who continu-
ally swears off smoking and then goes
around bumming cigarettes from his
friends; and the man who has made the
best damn Managing Editor The Tech-
nic has had in many a year.

Diesel engines! Those two words ex-
press the central theme of Professor Ed-
ward T. Vincent's professional life, for
he has been working on the design of
Diesel engines since the days he spent in
His Majesty's Dockyards.
Born in Gillingham (it's pronounced
"Jillingham"), Kent, England, he had
a long and varied education. After prep-
aratory school, he took a four year
engineering course in His Majesty's
Dockyard, Chatham, during which he
was awarded Admiralty prizes. Two
years at the Gillingham Technical Insti-
tute were followed by post-graduate
work at the Imperial College of Science
and Technology in London. While there,
he gained further honors, including the
Tyndall Prize in Physics of the Royal
College of Science and the Whitworth
Scholarship, under which he conducted
three years of research on Diesel en-
gines.
After holding several positions in His
Majesty's Dockyard and at the Admi-
ralty Engineering Laboratory, Vincent
accepted a position as Chief Experi-
mental Engineer for Messrs. William
Beardmore and Company at Glasgow.
While there, he had charge of the de-
velopment of the first aircraft Diesel
engine built in Great Britain, used in
the dirigible R-101.
To take a job as Research Engineer
for the Emsco Aero Engine Company in
Los Angeles, he crossed the ocean in
1928. Incidentally, Professor Vincent
had taken time to get married in 1917,
and when he sailed, his wife and four-
year-old son came along. (Today that
son plans to be an engineer, but is
"pretty busy" starring on the University
High School swimming team.) Among

their first impressions of this country
were the higher room temperatures and
the rougher and slower railroads.
After another move, this time to take
over as Chief Engineer of the Diesel
Engine Division of Continental Motors
Corporation, he became Professor of
Mechanical Engineering at the Univer-
sity of Michigan in 1937.

before settling down to the university
grind, he went on an American Boy
freighter cruise to Alaska and, that same
summer, took a trip to the Panama
Canal. And so, having visited both
northern and southern extremities of
the continent, he arrived, in September,
1936, at what is probably somewhere
near halfway between—Ann Arbor,
Michigan. He came to study Chemical
and Metallurgical Engineering.
As a Freshman, Larry drew two
blanks -he went out for the Technic,
and joined the Glee Club. Neither of
these ventures lasted, but apparently
they did not deter him from the greater
things to come. More important, how-
ever, he started to fly. He now holds a
private pilot's license, and still takes ad-
vantage of every opportunity to get into
the air.
Larry spent his first summer going to
school, then returned for the usual quiet
sophomore year, followed by a period
of work in the cold processing shop of a
steel mill. As a Junior, he served on the
J-Hop Committee and the Engineering
Council, and last summer he attended
the R.O.T.C. Camp at Aberdeen, Mary-
land. This summer Larry plans to go to
school again, taking his degree in Au-
gust, after which he hopes to get a job,
probably in the field of steel fabrication.

rT^0 shoulder the responsibilities of a
X great college of engineering is no
easy task. To carry the weight of our
major problems, our petty grievances,
and our small bickerings requires a
man of great ability, courage, and per-
severance.
Michigan has been very fortunate to
have had a succession of deans who
have mastered their duties and have
conferred many honors upon our alma
mater. Deans Emeritus Cooley and Sad-
ler, and the late Dean Anderson, will all
live long in the memory of students and
com q
faculty alike. Their records are not
easily paralleled.
Into the position which demands
more than the best a man can give, will
come Dean Ivan C. Crawford of the
University of Kansas. His pleasing per-
sonality, his friendly attitude toward
students, and his administrative ability
assure his success here as a truly great
dean of engineering.
To the man who will lead us for
years to come, to the man we know
we will come to love and admire, we
offer our heartiest welcome.
Ifou'LL 4jave to Wait
TWICE each year, freshmen engi-
neers have a good laugh at the ex-
pense of their classmates in the "Lit
School." They spend no hours pouring
over catalogs and filling out innumerable
schedule cards. Classification in the En-
gineering College is simple and quick.
It is merely a matter of choosing the
right blue-printed schedule, and takes
only a few minutes at the most.
But during the sophomore year, en-
gineering students begin to doubt that
engineers are more efficient on this score.
Classification, then, does not go so
smoothly: and it is even worse during
the junior and senior years.
Students in the academic school must
have their elections approved in advance
of classification. They must work out
their schedules and fill out a number of
forms in advance. Then they make a
trip to Waterman Gymnasium and, un-
less they have unusually tough luck, are
through in an hour or so.
The engineer does not have to bother
with the preliminaries. He pays his fees
at the gymnasium, but must still be
classified. Where he reports for this
depends on his year and department.
and when depends on the "classification
number" he has received.
Before classification, each student de-
cides what courses he will take, and ar-
ranges a schedule. But sometimes h.'
selects courses for which he does not
have the proper prerequisites, or makes
other mistakes. Sometimes he goes for
advice to a faculty member, but often he
does not.
At classification, the engineer fills out
blanks, and presents them to his classi-
fier. After examining the student's rec-
ord since entering the University, he
may not approve the elections. After
any problems have been ironed out and
the schedule checked, more forms are
filled out; then the schedule is tele-
phoned in to the central office. When
any student's program needs to be
changed, it delays all those following
him in line.
The most frequent cause of delays in
classification is the closing of sections.
Often, when he finds a section closed, a
student will have to rearrange his entire
schedule. With up-to-the-minute knowl-
edge of the open and closed sections, he
can avoid further trouble: but this
knowledge is not always available. With
the situation changing from minute to
minute, and with the student body split
into small groups, it is difficult to keep
this information available.
But an even worse fault is in the
allocation of classification numbers.
This has been a matter of "first come,
first served," and has led to hours of
waiting in line to get an early classifica-
tion number.
At first glance it would seem that
classification might follow immediately
after registration, thus allowing three
days instead of one and one-half for it.
But engineers, unlike others, receive
their official reports for the preceding
semester before classifying. These could
not be prepared by Thursday morning.
Neither can much be done about
closed sections. A better communication
system might help, and might be de-
vised. Also, it would help if the practice
of closing sections temporarily could be
better understood and used.
Great savings in time would probably
result if it were required that the courses
elected were approved by a faculty mem-
ber in advance. Questions of what
courses should be taken would then arise
only in case of unexpected failures the
past semester. Classification material
could be distributed in advance, saving
time on classification day.
But the most annoying and easiest to
remedy of the faults of the present plan
is in assigning classification numbers.
Why not follow a scheme of alphabetical
distribution, just as in registration?
This simple change would eliminate
waiting in line; would share the good
and bad numbers fairly, since the order
rotates completely every two years: and
would avoid a rush at one period and
slack at another. If an individual has a
special reason, such as a job, to need an
early classification time, that could be
arranged. The change would be easy to
make, yet very valuable.
The matter of improving the system is
at least worth serious consideration, for
it is far from satisfactory as it now
stands.

Looking Northeasterly from the Camp across the Hoback valley
The 1940 session of Camp Davis, open to students of surveying and geology, will
begin on June 17 and end on August 9. The camp occupies a site near the south end
of Jackson Hole in northwestern Wyoming. The clear days and cool nights of this
region provide an ideal climate for field work. A considerable area near the camp
is clear of trees and brush and has a topography varying from gentle slopes to rugged
mountains.
The camp is in the Valley of the Hoback River, 20 miles south of Jackson and
about 75 miles south of the Yellowstone National Park. It is on the highway con-
necting the Lincoln Highway at Rock Springs, Wyoming, with the Park. The work of
the camp is arranged to permit a three-day trip to the Park, as well as week-end
trips to nearer points of interest.
Camp residents are housed comfortably in permanent buildings provided with
running water, electric lights, and a modern sanitary system. The cost for the eight
weeks' session is about $150.
Inquiries concerning the camp should be addressed to Professor Harry Bouchard,
College of Engineering, Ann Arbor, Mich.

400 TIMES HIS OWN WEIGHT
A MAN could lift lour 100-ton freight cars if he were pfo-
* portion:!tely as strong as a new Alnico magnet assembly
recently developed in the General Klcctric Research
Laboratory.
The greatly increased strength ol the new magnet is due to
a special mounting, which permits the magnetic flux to pass
through many air gaps instead ot the usual two in bridging
Irom pole to pole. This makes possible a more efficient
utilization of the magnetic energy. In recent laboratory
tests a magnet weighing only one quarter ot an ounce was
able to support 69 pounds -about 4400 times its own weight.
This new development, although not yet commercially avail-
able, broadens the Held of permanent magnet applications.

rN his selection of the 20 outstanding men ami women ot
1QJ9, Durward Howes, editor ot " America's Young Men,"
honored two General EJectrk leaders: Philip I). Reed and
watharine B. Blodgett.
Mr. Reed has been with General Klcctric since 1926. H«
received his engineering degree from Wisconsin in 19:1 and
his law degree from l-'ordham University three years later.
In 19^7 he became the assistant ot Gerard Swopc, President
of General Electric. Mr. Reed is now Chairman of the Boact
ot Directors.
Miss Blodgett was grailuatcd from Bryn Mawr in 191".
received her M.S. degree from the University ot Chicago,
and spent the next six years in the General Electric Research
Laboratory in Schenectady. In 1924 and 1925 Dr. Blodgett
Studied at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, Kngland,
where she received the degree ol Doctor ot Philosophy.
Returning to the G-E Research Laboratory, she has since
been engaged in the study of molecular films.

2,000,000 HORSES
TT* VEN in its heyday the Wild West would hardly ha\
'tried stopping a stampede ot 2,000,000 horses. Yet the
job of stopping 2,000,000 horsepower ot electric energy has
been assigned to the General Klcctric breakers installed at
Boulder Dam, anil they do the job in 1/20 ot a second. And
the relays which trip these breakers are even more versatile,
tor it takes them only 1/200 of a second to locate trouble and
trip the proper breaker.
The power developed at Boulder Dam is carried to ttm
Angeles at 2X7,000 volts —the highest voltage in the world
in regular service. Two transmission lines, running side by
side, are used to span the 380 miles. To protect these lines
required the development ot circuit breakers capable ot inter-
rupting one and a halt million kilowatts ot power.
Student engineers, recent college graduates taking the G-E
Test Course, had the responsibility of testing these circuit
breakers in the Philadelphia Works ot General Klcctric.

GENERAL» ELECTRIC


What with temperatures ranging up to 1000° F. and
high stresses, the bolts used in much oil refinery
equipment have no sinecure — and the failure of a
single bolt may cause plenty of trouble.
That is why Chromium—Molybdenum (SAE 4140)
steel is being more and more widely used for high
temperature bolting on reaction chambers, pumps, etc.
This steel meets ASTM Specifications A 193-37 T.
At the elevated temperatures encountered it has all
the requisite physical properties, including good
creep strength.
Chrome-Moly (SAE 4140) and other Molybdenum
steels are meeting many of the special problems of
refinery service with dependability and economy.
These steels and their applications are described in
our technical book, "Molybdenum in Steel". A copy
will be sent free on request from any interested tech-
nical student.

The House of Yesterday and Today
Patterned by tradition
j.
4fou.5lng
By
WILLIAM B. STOUT
President, Stout Engineering Laboratories
T X THE industry of building railroad
•L vehicles, no one is better posted in
the traditions, background and market-
ing of railroad vehicles than railroad
men: but the new beginnings of light
weight and internal combustion railroad
design did not come from the railroad
man, but from outside engineering
groups.
In the paint industry, no one knew
more about paints and varnishes than
the paint people, but pyroxylin finishes
came from outside experimentation, not
from the paint industry.
In the photographic business, no one
knew more about photographic chem-
istry and processes than the photo-
graphic companies who spent millions
in attempting to solve the color pho-
tography problem; yet the results came
from two outside men who were neither
chemists nor photographic experts.
The engineer is attacking
the housing problem from
the sociological viewpoint.
And so the list might go into scores
of examples where industry became sat-
isfied, froze its assumptions and thus its
research into a hide-bound routine and
stagnated until some outside force forced
it into action.
This same attitude has been in
"houses" from time immemorial until
now. For the first time in all history en-
gineering has now taken up housing in
a serious way and has started new
things.
The engineers are already designing
for the new homes, heating plants, air
conditioning, sound proofing, cooking,
kitchen arrangements, materials, stress
analysis, and the like—while the archi-
tect, unless he turn engineer, is being
relegated to the building merely of the
mentally satisfactory shell.
All thinking starts from assumptions
and all new thinking can only start from
new assumptions.

Prophet Stout
Starts from assumptions
The architect thinks—not in terms of
the housing problem, fundamentally—
but of a problem concerned with bricks-
and - mortar - stone - concrete - wood - glass-
shingles - lath - plaster - tiling - slate-copper
MAY, 1940

and the like. He thinks in terms of bed-
room - living room - kitchen - pantry - attic-
cellar-joists-scantling-siding-etc.—and of
carpenters-plumbers-electricians-lathers-
plasterers-foundation men-diggers-union-
ists and other ilk.
Naturally an architect must have a
fee for his work and if the house he de-
signs be under $5,000 in cost, his fee is
so small as to be uninteresting to him
unless it be for a mass production roy-
alty type of thing—a type of contract
that the engineer is even more familiar
with than the architect.
Let there be no doubt that for genera-
tions the architect will be in control of
the "house" business so far as the build-
ing of union-made shells is concerned.
But the serious problem of "housing"
for those who cannot afford even $1,000
for a house, who even then cannot afford
to be in one permanent location or tied
down to one locality, but whose prob-
lem is living primarily—this problem
will be solved by engineers in spite of
architects, rather than because of them.
Because of the demand of this most
important working group of civilization
rather than by any politically solved,
architecturally minded, financially un-
limited house project of the political
area of organized house ignorance, the
result will be reached.
An engineer is research minded. He
thinks in terms of the solving of the
problem, not in investigation to prove
that he is right. If the thing works, it is
good, though it may have no element of
tradition in it. If it does not work, then
he must redesign to make it work, irre-
spective of personal opinions or beliefs.
Facts only count.
While we do not like the trailer and
many of the cheaper trailer communities,
yet the class of people now occupying
these better trailer communities is indi-
cation that there is germinating a new
type of housing—not a solution in it-
self, but from which will come, by the
development of the dwellers themselves,
a new type of housing commensurate
with their demands and also their
pocketbooks.
In the higher aspects of architecture
and beauty of design, engineering is
bringing a new form in our various
World's Fairs. These forms are not de-
signed by architects, but have been cre-
ated by "stylists" who have been forced
to have architects' names signed to their
papers in many cases; but from them in
these World's Fairs is coming a new
type of semi-temporary building.
We may not like some of the aspects
of enameled sheet metal store fronts, of
multi-colored building designs of garish
nature, but the answer is that they sell
and also sell goods.
Night lighting effects, spectacular
showmanship, will work in a sales build-
ing for a short time. Then in a year or
two a new front must be put in to
change the aspect and the selling ap-
proach. So the blue sheet metal enam-
eled front is torn down and a purple
composite board front is put on to again
perform a sales function until the
weather takes its toll.
One reason why these temporary busi-
ness buildings are necessary is that our
business centers are now moving and
changing location from year to year.
Parking is impossible, to the embarrass-
ment and great expense of the old es-
tablished down-town stores.
Cities are reforming in shape; an op-
portunity due to the automobile, and
this reforming is engineering.
In this change, buildings and locations
are temporary and designs must fit the
requirements.
What is coming, no man knows, but
in the housing and the new buildings, en-
gineering will be dominant and mere
architects and many of the old rackets
of the building trade will be conspicuous
by their enforced absence.
A technical age is advancing on the
political age, and when all things are
done right, neither labor, nor humanity,
nor new industries or old may fear for
the future under such a regime. -V&gt;

THE MICHICAN TECHNIC


other industries, the chemical en-
gineer is called on for research,
development, and manufacture.
TO BELIEVE that any large indus-
try could survive without the serv-
ices of every branch of engineering to-
day would be almost as foolish as to
believe it could survive without the serv-
ices of any engineering. Air transport,
just as an example, could not exist with-
out aeronautical and mechanical engin-
eers to build the planes, electrical engin-
eers to provide communication, civil
engineers to build fields and hangars,
and chemical engineers to produce fuels.
Nor could steel be made through the
work of metallurgists alone. An interest-
ing example of the blending of many
skills to render one service is the relation
of chemical engineering to the commu-
nication industry.
The development of telephonic com-
munication to its present state has
necessitated the solution of many engin-
eering and research problems. To a
large degree this development has de-
pended on constant improvement of the
many types of apparatus utilized to pro-
vide telephone service. For this reason
the materials in telephone apparatus
must be carefully studied, and in this
work chemical and metallurgical engin-
eers have had an important part. To
illustrate the type of problem with
which these engineers deal in telephone
research, a few of these materials prob-
lems will be described.
It would be difficult to mention a ma-
terial available to commerce which is not
used either in the telephone plant or in
manufacturing the necessary apparatus
and supplies. A dial telephone office
contains hundreds of relays, cables, con-
densers, automatic switches and the like,
all of which must perform faithfully
over long periods of time with a mini-
mum of maintenance care and attention.
In placing and completing a dial call in
one of our large exchanges, hundreds of
relays are operated to actuate over a
thousand electrical contacts. If a long
distance call were made instead, say
from New York to San Francisco, more
than a thousand additional electrical
contacts would be utilized. To fulfill
their purpose satisfactorily many of the
relays must meet split-second require-
ments as to speed of operation and re-
lease. In their construction alone we
find a variety of different materials used
to provide the electrical and magnetic
circuits, spring members, electrical con-

tacts and insulation. To illustrate
further the utilization of materials, lead
is a major constituent in cable sheath,
in storage battery plates and grids and
in solders; copper in conductor wires
and in springs; zinc in die cast parts;
aluminum in diaphragms, light weight
structural members and in condenser
cans; platinum, gold, palladium and
silver in electrical contacts. In magnetic
materials we find silicon, manganese,
chromium, aluminum, tungsten and
molybdenum in addition to the well-
known ferromagnetic metals, iron, nickel,
and cobalt. Similarly with non-metallic
materials, paper serves as insulation on

lied compounds as insulation for wire
and in submarine cable. Plastics are
used in molded telephone apparatus,
such as the handset, as a base for fin-
ishes and special insulating enamels, and
as a dielectric medium. Textiles, coal,
ceramics, organic and metallic finishes
and other non-metallic materials all find
their way into extensive use.
Obviously for the many and diverse
applications of materials, many problems
must be solved and substantial research
programs undertaken to develop new
materials, and to improve existing ones
as required. Such problems provide a
fruitful field for the work of both scien-
tists and engineers, which may be illus-
trated best by a hypothetical example of
the development of a new material. Let
us say, for example, a new paper con-
denser is required with specific electrical
characteristics, and of a smaller size and
with a longer life than the present unit,
and further, that such units cannot be
made from present materials. Analysis
of the problem may reveal that a ma-
terial with higher dielectric constant and
lower power factor than the present ma-
terial is needed. This problem, which is
typical of many, may be approached
from two points of view. In one ap-
proach various dielectric materials are
obtained and used in making experi-
mental condensers, whose electrical char-

acteristics would then be measured, and
promising materials evaluated by life
tests under conditions which duplicate
in so far as possible actual service con-
ditions. This approach to many prob-
lems has resulted in important develop-
ments. The other approach, which is
coordinated with the one just described,
attempts to solve the problem from the
basis of more fundamental knowledge.
In this method, dielectric media them-
selves are studied and the factors of im-
portance in determining dielectric con-
stant are evaluated, and dielectric con-
stant, for example, is associated with
molecular structure. Such work may re-
veal promising clues to be followed and
a completely new class of interesting
compounds discovered. Such new ma-
terials would then be used in making
condensers and the resulting units eval-
uated by comprehensive tests. The new
hypothetical dielectric might show such
promise that it would be necessary to
produce it on a semi-commercial scale,
utilizing it in limited plant trials, and
finally if these tests proved successful,
to produce it in sufficient quantities to
satisfy the demand for it.
A few examples of actual develop-
ments may serve further to illustrate the
general considerations outlined above.
Lead alloy sheathed cable represents
one of the largest single investments in
a telephone system, inasmuch as about
95 per cent of the total
wire mileage is contained
in lead or lead alloy
sheath. Because of the
extensive utilization of
cable, a continual study
is made of cable sheath
alloys, of means of im-
proving the present sheath
and of the reason for
sheath failure in the field.
Lead and lead containing
3 per cent of tin were
early sheathing materials.
These were replaced later
by a sheath of lead con-
taining 1 per cent of anti-
mony. More recently an
alloy of lead containing
.03 per cent of calcium
was developed which lab-
oratory tests have indi-
cated to be superior to the
1 per cent antimony
sheath under certain con-
ditions and this material
is now being evaluated in
field installations.
To illustrate how de-
velopments in one phase of work may
lead to unexpected applications, a re-
sume of work on storage batteries may
be of interest. Storage batteries used
in telephone central offices are made
with lead-antimony grids. Since central
offices contain large numbers of elec-
trical contacts which are subject to at-
mospheric corrosion and tarnish, an-
alyses of the air in central offices
were made in connection with tarnish
studies. This work led to the discovery
of stibine in storage battery gases. This
finding and other theoretical considera-
tions led to a trial in storage batteries
of the lead-calcium alloys, previously
studied for cable sheath. As a result of
this work, a new grid material of lead-
calcium alloy was developed, which has
made possible the development of a
much more efficient battery for power
uses, with a substantially smaller self
discharge rate than batteries constructed
from lead-antimony grids.
Several developments in the field of
rubber technology are of interest. Mix-
tures of gutta percha and balata are
ordinarily used as an insulation media
in submarine cables. For this applica-
tion, the material is subject to drastic
electrical requirements, particularly in
view of the extensive use of high fre-
quency methods of transmission. It was
known that by removing the resins from
these mixtures, the specific conductance
and dielectric constant could both be
drastically reduced, but only with some
sacrifice in the thermoplastic properties
which are of importance in the fabrica-
tion of the cable. The gutta percha-
balata mixtures were used extensively
for telegraph cables, but were not com-
pletely satisfactory for telephonic com-
munication over many miles of cable.
By using the proper proportions of
hydrocarbon wax and purified rubber in
de-resinated balata, an improved sub-
marine cable insulation was developed
which had a lower conductance and di-
electric constant and a higher plasticity
than previously used mixtures. These
improvements extend the frequency
range for carrier current transmission
and permit the transmission of messages
by submarine cable for much longer
distances and at higher speeds than were
possible before.
At the present time, as many wires
are placed underground as is possible.
This is of importance from the stand-
point of appearance and because such
wires are less subject to damage by the
elements. For this purpose a special
12
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


can be continuously extruded and vul-
canized on wire and which meets the
severe insulation and transmission re-
quirements for the application. To do
this, the compound is so processed as to
reduce the osmotic absorption of mois-
ture, which destroys the insulation char-
acteristics of ordinary rubber com-
pounds.
Another rubber development which
might be mentioned relates to the de-
velopment of special compounds for rub-
ber insulated telephone cords. Difficulty
has always been experienced in making
satisfactory soldered connections to such
cords because of corrosion products on
the tinsel conductor caused by sulphur
used in the rubber compound. With the
advent of the solderless type of fitting,
difficulty in making a satisfactory elec-
trical contact was also experienced for
the same reason. A new compound was
developed which contains only 0.2 per
cent of sulphur. With the short curing
time of the new compound and the ab-
sence of free sulphur in the finished
product, this difficulty was eliminated.
Moreover, the mechanical and aging
characteristics were greatly improved
and a textile braid was eliminated with
a substantial cost reduction.
In the field of plastics, many problems
are encountered which require detailed
study and extensive testing for their
solution. For use in telephone apparatus,
in general the material must have good
mechanical and electrical properties and
must be capable of being molded satis-
factorily. Thermal and climatic effects
are of importance also. Field experience
has shown that failures of certain plastic
parts increase indoors when the humid-
ity decreases over substantial periods of
time, as for example during winter heat-
ing, and that certain cellulose acetate
parts are subject to permanent shrinkage
when exposed to low humidities. Prob-
lems such as these require extensive
study and proper facilities for molding
experimental parts for test and evalua-
tion.
In view of the diverse material re-
quirements, a considerable amount of
effort must be directed towards the writ-
ing of specifications. This work requires
a knowledge of the uses to which the
material will be put and of the require-
ments it must meet. It pre-supposes a
knowledge of the properties of a wide
variety of such materials secured from
different suppliers and from different
sources. This requires comprehensive
tests before selections are made and

Looking for Trouble
Leads to unexpected applications
specifications written. The specifications
are usually written in terms of the prop-
erties desired and will include other fac- •
tors such as chemical composition when
required. In such work due considera-
tion must be given to having an ade-
quate source of supply, to cost considera-
tions and many other factors. In all
cases it is the aim to avoid the inclusion
of unnecessary restrictive factors which
might limit the supply and increase the
cost.
These considerations apply in a gen-
eral way to problems encountered in
telephone research. It should be empha-
sized however, at this point, that the
applications of chemical engineering are
not limited to research activities alone,
nor even in research to the above type of
work. We find, for example, in the
manufacture of telephone apparatus an
extensive application of chemical engin-
eering principles and here the engineer
may apply his knowledge of the basic
unit processes such as drying, humidi-
fication, and heat flow to advantage.
Frequently it happens that a given in-
dustry may utilize certain types of ma-
terials so extensively that a constant
search is made for new materials of the
type desired or of methods for improv-
ing existing materials. This is true of
many of the materials utilized in the
telephone system. This involves much
work of a fundamental nature in order
clearly to understand the problem, and
much work in which practical considera-
tions predominate. It is in the latter
field that the chemical engineer can best
utilize his training, since he is well suited
to attack those problems which require
application of fundamental scientific in-
formation to the materials problem of
industry. Our engineering progress de-
pends to a large degree on the develop-
ment of new materials which permit
engineers to improve and reduce the
cost of our industrial processes, prod-
ucts, and services, and so long as this is
true the chemical engineer will continue
to have a part in this phase of our in-
dustrial development.- ■y^

century and a half's effort on
the part of hundreds of engineers has
borne fruit in the form of a prime
mover which changes the heat energy
of combustion gases directly into rotary
motion without all the complexities ac-
companying the modern steam plant.
Throughout this time many schemes
and experimental plants were developed,
all of which, except one, were imprac-
tical. The things which had these early
workers stopped time and again were:
a lack «of knowledge of the thermody-
namics of combustion gases, the failure
of the available materials for rotor
blades to withstand the physical and
chemical action of gases at temperatures
around 1000 degrees F., and the lack of
an air compressor with a high enough
adiabatic efficiency so that the turbine
could turn it and still have some energy
left for power generation.
The exception to all these failures was
the explosion turbine perfected by Dr.
Holzwarth in 1905, which did develop
some useful power. His work, carried on
by others, contributed greatly to the
development of the continuous gas tur-
bine by providing a large amount of
valuable information on thermodynam-
ics. However, his explosion turbine was
not generally adapted because it in-
volved not only a gas turbine unit but
also a complete condensing steam power
plant which was complex and expensive.
The highly touted gas turbine has
definite limitations, but recent im-
provements have made it a serious
contender for power generation duties

which could still be machined readily.
The third, and most difficult, problem
was solved only after years of research
on the axial flow compressor, which had
been known for years as unsuccessful.
The application of the latest knowledge
of aero-dynamics resulted in a compres-
sor of much higher efficiency than had
been attained in the old centrifugal
compressors.
A typical present day gas turbine unit
consists of a reaction type rotor coupled
to a 24 stage axial compressor. Air
enters the compressor from the atmos-
phere and is compressed to about 60
pounds per square inch gage. Leaving
the compressor at 370 degrees F., one
quarter of it is used in the combustion
of the fuel in a chamber mounted above
the turbine, and the remainder is by-
passed to cool the combustion gases to
the turbine inlet temperature of 1000
degrees. The gas-air mixture is then
expanded through the turbine, and the
discharge gas, containing about 260
BTU per cubic foot, is passed through
a heat interchanger to heat the air as
it leaves the compressor before entering
the combustion chamber.
For starting, an electric motor, fed
from an outside source, brings the entire
unit up to 25% of normal operating
14
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


speed. Then the fuel is lighted and the
fuel supply gradually increased. The
combustion gas produced develops addi-
tional torque in the rotor which brings
the set up to full speed, and the start-
ing motor is disengaged by an over-
running clutch. The starting process
takes only five minutes.
A speed governor connected to the
fuel supply controls the turbine. The
inlet temperature varies with the fuel
supply, and thus the power developed
changes. At a certain designated maxi-
mum speed an emergency governor
opens a valve which by-passes part of
the gas around the turbine. Since the
rotor and compressor are connected by
a solid coupling, their axial thrusts are
neutralized and the need for dummy
pistons is eliminated.
In this country the rapid develop-
ment of the gas turbine came along
with the Houdry process of catalytic
cracking of heavy crude oils to obtain
gasoline. This process requires large
volumes of heated air to re-activate the
catalyst by burning off the coke and
carbon deposited on it. The resulting
combustion gases, at a pressure of 50
pounds gage and temperature of 900
degrees, are expanded in a gas turbine.
In this case, the combustion chamber
of the ordinary gas turbine is replaced
by the entire process itself, and the
power developed operates a generator
which supplies current for other uses in
the refinery.
The first gas turbine axial compressor
set for the Houdry process was built in
1936. It is rated for 40,000 cubic feet
of air per minute and at full load re-
quires an input of 4400 KW. The gas
turbine develops an output of 5300 KW,
leaving a surplus of 900 KW which is
taken out as electrical energy. The ac-
tual installation includes a reduction
gear coupled to the end of the compres-
sor, an A.C. generator, and a starting
motor. This particular unit has been in
practically continuous operation for
three and one-half years.
Although the original purpose of such
units was the supplying of air for the
Houdry process, the generation of power
as a sort of by-product made them tur-
bines in every sense of the word. It was,
then, a short step to a gas turbine built
for power generation exclusively. Sub-
stitution of a simple combustion cham-
ber for the extensive process resulted in
rapid invasion of the power producing
field by this novel prime mover.
The urgent need for a highly efficient
compressor came from the fact that if
the product of the adiabatic efficiencies

of the gas turbine and compressor is
53%, the power surplus is zero, or just
enough energy is developed to drive the
compressor. The efficiency of the gas
turbine is about 86'/&lt;, that of the axial
compressor about 85' v, and their prod-
uct is 73'/' ■ The corresponding over-all
thermal efficiency of the turbo-compres-
sor unit is \lr/&lt;. If the exhaust gas is
used to pre-heat the air, this efficiency
is increased to 21%. Raising the inlet
temperature to 1200 degrees boosts the
efficiency to 22r'r, but considerable more
research will have to be done on blade
materials and blade cooling before this
temperature can become standard.
A self contained gas turbine power
plant for 9000 KW, including rotor
and compressor, combustion chamber, a
starting motor, and lubrication system,
occupies 3600 cubic feet. A steam plant
of similar capacity, consisting of a boiler
and all its auxiliaries, a complex water
treatment unit, a condenser, pumps, and
cooling towers, occupies many times that
space, and costs initially at least five
times as much.
Another advantage of the gas turbine
is its independence of water supply,
since its working medium, air, is omni-
present. This opens up interesting pos-
sibilities in desert applications, where
water is limited and fuel oil or natural
gas cheap. The absence of water sug-
gests use as the main propulsion ma-
chinery for movable power plants, loco-
motives, and ships. And out of recent
events abroad has come yet another
application — installation in bombproof
tunnels, where water supply is uncer-
tain, space at a premium, and low cost
essential. The purpose here is to pro-
Axial Compressors
Efficiency of 85%
tect the power supply of a city against
possible airplane attacks.
Although the gas turbine has an in-
herently lower efficiency than the Diesel
engine, it burns a much cheaper fuel
oil. All the gas turbine sets now in use
are burning oil or gas, but definite
promise is shown from an experimental
plant operating on powdered coal.
In addition to the Houdry and power
generating applications, several others
are being developed. One consists of a
turbine operated by blast furnace gas
and used to drive blast furnace blowers.
In the eternal quest for higher effi-
ciencies engineers have already com-
pounded the gas turbine. The optimum
speed for the highest generator efficiency
is not the same as the speed for maxi-
mum compressor efficiency, and so two
gas turbines have been provided with
a common combustion chamber; one
turbine drives the compressor at the best
speed for economical operation and the
other drives the generator at constant
speed. The thermal efficiency of the
combined unit is 22% at full load.
Despite the many advantages of the
gas turbine it is not immediately tak-
ing over the power production of the
country. There is still a lack of experi-
ence; more data must be gathered on
the effect of high oxygen content gas
on blades at 1000 degrees and higher,
and the blades must be cooled more
efficiently. When the operating temper-
ature can be raised to 1500 degrees, the
steam power plants can begin to worry.
Until then, in moderate sizes, the gas
turbine will win wide and varied fields
away from other prime movers because
of its uncontested advantages.

pose the long and animated history of the College of En-
gineering, four stand out—its four Deans. A fifth Dean will
join this select group and begin to contribute his share to
Michigan's engineering tradition when Ivan C. Crawford takes
office officially on July 1.
Born in Leadyille, Colorado, in 1886, Crawford entered the
Uni%'ersity of Colorado in 1907, and graduated four years later
with a B.S. degree in civil engineering. Until 1923 he was con-
nected with the faculty of that university. In 1923 he was
made Dean of the College of Engineering at the University of
Idaho, where he remained until he became Dean at the Uni-
versity of Kansas in 1937.
But his experience has by no means been confined to uni-
versity campuses. His practical experience has included work
for three railroads and a power company. He saw active serv-
AS A NEWCOMER—a tenderfoot,
• in Western parlance—and at the
invitation of the Editor, the writer ad-
dresses this letter to the present genera-
tion of Michigan engineers.
Of course, he is familiar in a general
way with the long and outstanding rec-
ord of engineering at the University of
Michigan. First among state universities
to adopt this new-fangled curriculum,
Michigan went into the project whole-
heartedly and since the beginning has
maintained engineering education on a
relatively high plane. But I am sure that
Michigan engineers of this and other
generations are fully aware of the part
played by their alma mater in this field,
and are not in need of reminders.
The outsider, however, on first coming
in contact with the College of Engineer-
ing, is impressed by several character-
istics of the College and its alumni.
Perhaps comment in this connection
would be of interest. One of these dis-
tinctive features is the liberal curriculum
which has been in effect for a consider-
able number of years. Noteworthy is the
emphasis placed on English and English
literature.
The loyalty of Michigan men to their
alma mater is another characteristic
claiming the attention of the outsider as
he meets the sons of this institution per-
forming their work as professional en-
gineers throughout this country. Not
only are they loyal to their alma mater
—-they have faith that in the future it
will be of even more importance as an
educational center than it has been in
the past.
Members of the engineering faculty
have participated widely in the actual
practice of engineering, and are known
throughout the United States as com-
petent practitioners in addition to being
teachers and textbook writers.
After viewing the situation from all
sides, any outsider would quickly come
to the conclusion that a young man in
search of an engineering education
should feel himself fortunate in being
able to attend the University of Michi-
gan. Not only is the opportunity pres-
ent to secure an excellent technical edu-
cation through the outstanding facilities
and faculty of the College of Engineer-
ing, but there are also many oportuni-
ties in this great University for the
student to enrich his preparation for life
in almost any direction he may desire.
In reflecting on the situation at Michi-
gan there passes before the mind inevit-
ably the conditions which obtained dur-
ing the earlier days of development of
engineering education in this country.
During the lifetime of men now living,
the requirements demanded of an indi-
vidual for success in engineering and the
manner of entering the engineering pro-
fession have undergone revolutionary
changes. At the time the first engineer-
ing studies were added to the Michigan
curriculum, by far the greater portion
of engineering work performed in the
United States was done by men who did
not have the benefit of formal engineer-
ing education. Their work was based on
a background of experience and not on
experience plus scientific training. Even
years after Michigan became well known
as a center of engineering education
many men rose to the top of the pro-

two years he was State Engineer in Idaho. He was associate
consultant on studies of the Columbia River drainage basin,
and was associated with M. S. Ketchum for two years in work
on the Structural Engineers' Handbook. From 1935 until 1938
he served on the Board of Directors of the American Society
of Civil Engineers.
But it is not because of his technical achievements alone that
Michigan engineers are looking forward to their association
with Dean Crawford. Slight as was the acquaintance we made
with him at the Engineering Banquet, we were able to know
that he will come to be admired and loved for his personality
and friendliness, as have our Deans in the past.
The Technic takes pleasure in presenting the following let-
ter from Dean Crawford to Michigan students:
fession without benefit of university
training. About the beginning of the
century, perhaps slightly before, the ma-
jority of young men entering the engin-
eering field began to come from tech-
nical schools. Now we find that only
rarely do they enter this profession with-
out formal academic training.
With the passing of the years has
come more clearly the realization that,
in addition to the attainment of tech-
nical proficiency, the engineer very fre-
quently must assume the position of a
leader in industry and business.
That this day of leadership is already
here may be inferred from the following
remarks which were made by Dr. Karl
T. Compton of the Massachusetts In-
stitute of Technology during the course
of an address at Northeastern University
in October, 1938: "We are told in a re-
cent study sponsored by the Society for
Promotion of Engineering Education
that graduates of engineering or tech-
nical colleges are many times more likely
to be found in positions of authority
than are graduates of other types of col-
leges or than non-college men. For ex-
ample, of the 235 college trained presi-
dents in leading American industries,
151 were trained in engineering or tech-
nical colleges, and 84 in colleges of all
other types. When we consider the fact
that the number of graduates of other
types of colleges is many times greater
than the number from engineering col-
leges these numbers are even more strik-
ing. They indicate that the probability
of a man trained in engineering becom-
ing president of an American industrial
organization is 10 to 20 times as great as
the probability for a man of different
college training."
A limited acquaintance with the alum-
ni roll of Michigan engineers brings
forth clearly the fact that many of these
men have been leaders in industry, in
education, and in their communities, in
addition to having furnished strong lead-
ership in their own technical fields. More
than a few have distinguished them-
selves in research work.
Problems galore confront the young
engineer at the time he leaves college.
Not the least of these is a determination
of how to use his spare time most profit-
ably. The Founder engineering societies
have interested themselves actively in
this problem. Without doubt the engin-
eering colleges of the country will eag-
erly cooperate in a program designed to
guide young engineers along the path-
way to professional recognition and si-
multaneously point the way to additional
cultural training which will make life
more satisfactory and enjoyable to the
individual, and enhance his usefulness
to society as a whole.
Much has been said in recent years
about the lack of opportunity for youth.
Employment records of American engin-
eering colleges indicate beyond any rea-
sonable doubt that the opportunity for
young men trained in engineering meth-
ods and science is as great as ever.
The writer expresses appreciation for
this opportunity to make his bow before
the student body of the College of En-
gineering. He looks forward with pleas-
ure to an association with the students,
alumni, and faculty members of this
College.

torches, but today the tip consists of
three overlapping concentric nozzles,
the cutting nozzle innermost, the heat-
ing nozzle around it, and the compressed
air jacket around both. The common
oxy-acetylene cutting torch can be used
to depths of 10 ft. Beyond this, how-
ever, the compressed air hood is needed.
The compressed air pressure should be
one p.s.i. for every two feet of depth;
about 10-15 p.s.i. greater than the water
pressure at any depth.
Using the air shielded torch, the diver
lights and regulates his torch before go-
ing under water, then orders the com-
pressed air to be turned on. The work
of the operators is very difficult on ac-
count of the strength required to hold
the torch against the part to be cut,
and the deafening noise caused by the
escaping gas amplified by the resonance
of the metallic helmet.
Another method of shielding the flame
is to use a jacket of burnt gases. This
is provided by surrounding the flame
as it leaves the tip by a metal cylinder
integral with the tip and having an in-
side diameter about 9/10 the diameter
of the gaseous jacket naturally around
the flame. This compresses the flame
slightly and makes it more stable. The
length of the cylinder is about 2/3 the
length of the flame. The water does not
affect the flame, and the tip may be

This method was first used in 1908,

depends on the fact that a flame is in-
sulated from the bulk of the water in

jet is shielded. The shield is essential,
also, because without it the heat cannot
be localized.

In operation, since acetylene is not
satisfactory except in shallow water,
underwater torches for deep cutting are
nearly always operated with hydrogen.
There seems to be no depth limitation,
cuts having been made as deep as 130
feet. With this torch, the oxygen and
hydrogen gas pressures are directly pro-
portional to the depth up to 100 feet,
and probably also for any greater depth,
though this has not been ascertained.
When using this torch the diver ignites
the hydrogen and draws the flame 4
inches long. The oxygen valve is opened
until the flame is 1 inch to 1V&amp; inches
long, and has a blue color with a yellow
brass tube containing the powder. This
tube is closed by a rubber stopper
equipped with a ring so that it may be
taken off at the desired time. The fitting
equipped with springs allows the light-
ing tube to present its aperture to the
tip, and to be pushed back during cut-
ting to be out of the way.
Underwater gas cutting torches have
been successful at depths from 8 feet to
130 feet, the lower limit being imposed
by the diving outfit rather than by the
torch. Cutting just beneath the surface
of the water is impossible because of the
disturbance in the water. Steel up to

There are several methods of under-
water ignition, one of which is the use
of a pilot flame. This is a small, mov-
able torch burning acetylene or hydro-
gen from a tip in which the combustible
is first mixed with oxygen to give a
simple preheating type of flame. This
tip is surrounded by what looks like
another tip, but is merely a protecting
chamber for the flame to burn in, leav-
ing only the end of it protruding for
ignition purposes. In using this igniter,
care must be taken to keep it below the
cutting torch when the latter is in use,
to avoid exploding the unburned gas
bubbles arising from the cutter. Electric
spark igniters using an alkaline solution
battery (10 volts, 45 amperes) which
will withstand repeated shorting, are
also used.
A third method is to use powders
which ignite spontaneously upon contact
with water. These include ferro-cerium,
calcium phosphide, and sodium metal.
These powders are used in an ingenious
device which is composed of a movable
fitting equipped with springs attached
to the torch, and which is attached to a
visibility and other working conditions,
though sixty feet per hour can be main-
tained on steel % inch thick, which is
somewhat slower than manual cutting
in air. However, under some conditions,
it was found that higher speed could be
attained underwater than in air, because
the oxygen pressure is higher and the
surrounding vapors were supposed to
exert an insulating effect. Holes Vn inch
in diameter can be cut in steel up to
four inches thick, and gas consumption
is four to six times greater underwater
than in air. In some torches the gas
pressures are regulated automatically
through a connection to the diver's
helmet.
A curious fact about preheating un-
derwater is that while the preheating
time in air is proportional to the plate
thickness, underwater a sheet 1/16 inch
thick requires about the same preheat-
ing time as a plate IV2 inches thick, be-
cause the heat in the thin material is
more rapidly transferred to the water
than in thick material.
Underwater cutting can also be done
with an electric arc, using what is known
as an oxy-electric torch. The arc pre-
heats the metal and provides a jacket
of gas around the oxygen jet or jets
which issue from the hollow electrode.
The electrode may be either of carbon
or metal. Some men claim that the
torch is neither economical nor prac-
tical, but it has been found that the
oxy-electric torch is applicable to any
depth, is relatively simple and rugged,
but is slow; the electrode must be re-
placed at relatively short intervals, and
the shape of the nozzle (the end of the
electrode) is not controlled.
The graphite electrode, twelve inches
long, is usually rectangular in section,
and is pierced with two holes for the
oxygen. In some designs the holes are
lined with brass tubes. The electrode is
held in an insulated handle carrying a
shield, and its average life is thirty min-
utes. A long arc is drawn to form a
globule of vapor which overcomes the
difficulties due to the electric and ther-
mal conductivity of the water. In fact,
it serves a purpose similar to that served
by the compressed air or burnt gas
jacket in the gas torch. Current leak-
age is further prevented by taping the
electrode to the end. With an arc Y±
inch long (220 amperes, 55 volts), the
kerf or cut is V-i inch wide. This torch
will cut cast iron l "'s inches thick at the
rate of four to six inches per hour. Iron
wire in this case, in the oxygen tubes
facilitates cast iron cutting. To reduce
shock hazards, D.C. is used instead of
A.C. Other performance tests show that
the torch has been successfully used on
steel piling; twelve standard 14-inch
steel piles % inch thick with a thickness
of four inches of steel and concrete at
the joints being cut in an eight-hour-
day at a depth of eight feet, using 300-
600 amperes and only 50 volts, and an
oxygen pressure of 90 p.s.i.
Instead of a graphite electrode, a slag
covered and varnished hollow steel elec-
trode 32 inches long has been used. It
is 0.32 inch outside diameter and 0.16
inch inside, and uses 150-180 amperes,
55 volts D.C. The electrode in this case
is inclined to the surface unless holes
are to be cut. The cutting speed is only
1/5 to % of the speed of the oxy-acety-
lene underwater torch, but the speed of
the oxy-electric torch is 4 to 5 times
greater underwater than it is in air.
The electrode must be positive to
prevent the formation of an explosive
mixture of hydrogen and oxygen. The
electrode is gradually consumed during
the cutting, at the rate of 1.2 pounds of
electrode to 2.5 pounds of metal re-
moved. Of course there are no ignition
problems with this torch, the arc merely
being struck and drawn as in air. -VR

DOWMETAL
THE METAL THAT TRAVELS

One can always spot experienced
travelers. As the saying goes—they travel
"light." They have long learned that
excess baggage — needless weight —
hampers the progress of the journey.
Present progress in modern transpor-
tation is prompted largely by a realiza-
tion of this truth. Needless weight is
being shunned as a shackle on speed —
a penalty on pay load —a waster of power.
To avoid useless weight, designers now-
adays are turning to magnesium, because
magnesium "travels light." It is fully
a third lighter than any other metal in
common use, yet strong and durable.
Magnesium has been made available by
Dow in a series of low-cost alloys known
as DOWMETAL*. Each contains from 90
to 98 per cent magnesium, each is formu-
lated to stress a special quality.
When, as in DOWMETAL, you find both
unique lightness and abundant strength,
you have come pretty close to answering
a designer's prayer. And you feel you
are still closer when you learn that there
are well developed methods for the fabri-
cation and assembly of DOWMETAL.
No wonder DOWMETAL is growing so
rapidly in favor for incorporation in
airplanes — also in trains, trucks, buses,
tractors.
Just so in other industries—the making
of tools, vacuum cleaners, typewriters
and many other varied products where
lightness and strength are factors of
importance — DOWMETAL is in ever-
increasing use.
As the metal that "travels light,"
DOWMETAL is in truth carrying American
industry far along the road of progress.

For getting themselves sucked in on
skin games and gags, nothing can com-
pete with the eternal Greek. Legion are
the tales of the successful p/anks pulled
on the various local chapters.
Nobody seems to know the origin of
the one which not so long ago captured
several fraternities and sororities around
town. They learned that there was a
blind boy over in the University Hos-
pital for whom the leading cigarette
companies had agreed to buy a Seeing
Eye dog if he could collect three hundred
thousand empty cigarette packages with-
in a given time.
Diligently they set to work collecting
wrappers, and containers were placed
around the houses for the mounting
piles, as students smoked themselves red
and searched the streets for throwaways.

The volume of wrappers had grown to
the point of being quite a problem be-
fore it was learned that it was all just
so much bunk.
Somewhat along the same line, but of
a more serious nature, was the photog-
rapher who moved into many a house,
took portraits of all the members, prom-
ised a leather-bound volume containing
the pictures as a gift to the house, and
walked off with liberal orders from the
brothers.
The pictures were sent C. O. D., and
no further sign was seen of either the
album nor the photographer.
tempus tempus
Into the category of famous last ac-
tions goes the act of the unfortunate
whose watch was gaining more than he
knew. The eleven o'clock class was drag-
ging on to a close as his appetite grew
apace. The prof, apparently oblivious
to the passage of time, lectured smoothly
on.
When the watch in question registered
two minutes past noon, the owner could
stand it no longer, banged his book shut
with that "don't-you-know-the-class-is-
over" air, and started to close his note-
book.
The prof, caught in mid-sentence,
jerked out his watch and checked the
time; then glaring at the culprit, said:
"According to my watch we still have
five minutes. Isn't that right?"
The last we saw of the student his
scarlet forehead was sinking quietly
through the floor.
thwarted
We have always admired those people
who, no matter how frustrated, could
think of something to say. Consequently,
our hat is off to the Theta Xi who cov-
ered his chagrin on the Pi Phi porch
the other night.
It was his first date with the girl, and
as they reached the end of the walk she
murmured good night and hurried up
the steps. As she reached the door, he
stopped her with the question:
"Hey, do you know Ken Doherty?"
She turned, and with a puzzled frown,
shook her head.

"Well, you should. He's our track
coach, and I hear he's badly in need of
new sprinters."
incidental intelligence
For too long a time Frank Oakes,
Night Manager of the Union, had had
his nose to the grindstone. Sensitive
from this ordeal, he smelled fire one
night last week and worriedly set out in
search of it. From cellar to attic he
combed the building, but he seemed to
get neither closer to nor farther from
the conflagration.

Imagine the blow to his prestige when
an alert member of the house staff
pointed to his cork tip cigarette, lit at
the wrong end. Better try going to bed
nights, Frank.
only yesterday
Which brings us to the close of this
year's attempt at puerile humor. We
think it only fair to tell you that the
best gag of the year was just censored
by our erudite editor whose eye was
cocked in the direction of the Dean's
office.
Some few eons ago we conceived the
idea of this column (who said it was
with the New Yorker's help?) and since
then we have written it, with one change
in the partnership, for sixteen issues.
Whether or not the reading of it has
brought you a moment's relaxation, it
has led to many all-night bull sessions
that were a sight to behold.
But our turn is done, the wide world
beckons, and so, with our annual low
bow to Bob Gustafson, Burr French,
and Bill Collamore, who contributed the
other features, we bid you an affection-
ate farewell.

n intimate knowledge'of the design,
unctions and application of the TIMKEN
apered Roller Bearing ^will'be one of your most
valuable assets when your student days are over, for
more TIMKEN Bearings are used in modern mechanical equip-
ment of every kind^than any other anti-friction bearing.
By acquiring a thorough understanding of the tapered bearing
principle and its possibilities now, you will be in position to
solve any bearing problem you may encounter in the future.
The success of the TIMKEN Tapered Roller Bearing depends
upon four basic elements of design. These are (I) True
rolling motion. Timken engineers assured this by making
all lines coincident with the tapered surfaces of rollers
and races meet at a common point on the axis of the
bearing. (2) Positive alignment of rollers under all loads.
This is made possible by 2-area contact of the large
ends of the rollers with the undercut rib of the cone
(inner race). (3) Accurate spacing of the rollers
around the bearing by means of the Timken one-
piece perforated cage so that each roller carries its
proper share of the load. (4) Ability to carry all
loads—radial loads, thrust loads or any combina-
tion of both, due to the fundamental principle of
tapered construction.

TIMKEN Bearing and its uses write for a copy

andy ashburn
One day late in the summer of 1919
the Ashburn home in Winston-Salem,
North Carolina, reechoed to the lusty
howls of the third addition to the Ash-
burn clan—one J. Anderson, the boy
who was destined to fill one-third of the
May "Presents" page in the current
series of the Michigan Technic.
While on his way to this glorious goal,
Andy dabbled with a multitude of things.
At an early age, he became so impressed
with a traveling Chautauqua Magic

Prestidigitator Ashburn
Likely to get into a rut
Show that he ruined his father's Sunday
derby, the next day, while trying to
duplicate with the real McCoy the ma-
gician's egg-swallowing hat trick. Noth-
ing daunted, but with obvious parental
misgivings, Andy delved deeper into the
art, joined the International Brother-
hood of Magicians, and walked away
with two out of nine first prizes from
their international amateur contest.
While in high school, he continued his
magic, ran the half-mile on the track
team, captained the debate team, and
won second place in a state-wide decla-
mation contest.
Then, looking over the higher educa-
tional scene, he chose to come to Mich-
igan to study Aeronautical Engineering.
Upon closer observation, and a year's
close contact, he changed to Engineer-
ing-Business Administration, and will
graduate from that department this
June.
As a freshman he won a first and a
second in the interchapter Sigma Rho
Tau speaking contests, joined Kappa
Sigma fraternity, and went out for the
Technic Subsequently he held office
in Kappa Sigma, became Sigma Rho
Tau's representative to the Engineering
Council, organized the Movie Club, was
tapped by Triangles, and started to
monopolize extra duties on the Tech-
nic At the end of his junior year he
surprised no one by consecutively knock-
ing off Editorship of the Technic, Vice-
Presidency of the Engineering Council,
and membership in Vulcans. He filled
his extra time with being on the Engi-
neering Ball Committee, a member last
year and Chairman this year of the
Slide Rule Ball Committee, Chairman
of the Bureau of Student Coopera-
tion, Toastmaster and power-behind-
the-throne of the All-Engineering Ban-
quet, and enough of a student to weigh
down his key chain with a Tau Bete
Key.
Last summer Andy revelled for a full
week in free admission, free parking,
entry at the head of mile-long lines, and
the courteous service of a dozen head
representatives of the different displays
at the World's Fair. The guy had got-
ten himself a press pass as Editor-in-
Chief of the Michigan Technic
His Ann Arbor residence is conven-
iently out in the wilderness of western
Ann Arbor, so he drives a decrepit
Model A to class every day, or did till
"Vesnic," the Model A, took a nose dive
into a swamp during spring vacation.
So then on the basis of a juicy post-
graduation job, he mortgaged his future
and now has a 1940 version.
Personally, he's an avid Camel smoker
(his dad's in the business), dotes on
concerts, lectures, plays, seldom dates,
speaks in dreamy terms of the "girl
back home," is an eloquent speaker, and
is the real reason why the Technic
has made this year one of the best in
its history.
There's only one thing that worries
us about the guy: we wish he'd vary
his activities; he's likely to get into a
rut!
professor cannon
"He's from Missouri." Anyway, he
was born there and was a resident the
first seven years of his life. He received
a diploma with the inscription, "Joseph
Henderson Cannon," from the high
school in South Bend, Indiana, in 1901.
After that he went to Purdue and stud-
ied electrical engineering. While at Pur-
due, Prof. Cannon made Tau Beta Pi.
and was a charter member of the Purdue
chapter of Eta Kappa Nu. He was a
member of Alpha Tau Omega Frater-
nity.
Prof. Cannon's first job was with the

done for the Commonwealth Edison

in that organization naturally ceased
when he married in 1923. He is a mem-
ber of the A.I.E.E., and was Chairman
of the Detroit-Ann Arbor Section in
1923. The Society for the Promotion of
Engineering Education also includes his
name on its roll. He is interested in
golfing and is a member of the Ann
Arbor Golf and Outing Association.
For leisure time activities, Prof. Can-
non prefers reading and playing bridge.
Incidentally, we were informed that the
probability of getting a hand of all one
suit is equal to 13! divided by 52! For
that reason, Prof. Cannon is inclined to
scoff at some of the news he has read in
bridge columns in the newspapers.
Most of his summers have been spent
either teaching or working. The sum-
mer before last he spent building a yard
for his home out by the Arboretum. He
is interested in traveling and may spend
this coming summer in that way. He
spent a very enjoyable time in Europe
the second semester of the academic
year 1932-33, visiting Great Britain and
most of the countries on the continent.
Prof. Cannon discovered a new pleasure
three years ago when he and Mrs. Can-
non drove down to Florida with the
swimming team over the Christmas va-
cation, and they made the trip the fol-
lowing two years and intend to do it
again next year. He likes to drive, but
avoids excessive speeds because of "old
y2Mv2."
In general, he believes that an exten-
sion of the present engineering curricu-
lum would be a good idea, but not to
more than a length of five years. How-
ever, he also believes that a shorter
course of, say, two years, could be
installed successfully for those students
who do not do such good work, but who
nevertheless stay on for a full four years
in order that they may complete their
course. If some sort of a degree could
be granted to these men at the end of
their second year, they would then be
relieved of their self-imposed obligation
of "sticking it out."
doug tracy
Doug says he was born and raised in
Minneapolis, but a little investigation
proved that he was really born in Hop-
kins, Minnesota, which, after all, is a
suburb of Minneapolis.
Proverbially, destiny lies in the stars,
and young Douglas Tracy really started
to uncover his destiny at the age of
eleven. Because he possessed a telescope
and an intense interest in astronomy,
he was referred to by Minneapolis pa-
pers as the "city's youngest astronomer."
After playing football in Minneapolis
high schools and graduating in June,
1935, Doug took "time out" and hitch-
hiked to New York. There he got a job
as an ordinary seaman on an outgoing
freighter, thus starting an around-the-
world tour. Through the medium of
freighters and tramp steamers he worked
his way around the world with a good
portion of the south seas on his itinerary.
Back from his little jaunt, Doug worked
successively in a hotel, as a bricklayer's
helper, for an electric power company,
and for a phone company.
After this variety of occupations, Doug
settled down as a freshman in the "Lit
School" of the University of Minnesota.
His intentions at that time were to be-

Globe-trotter Tracy
A home ahead of a sailboat
come a full-fledged astronomer. To help
realize these intentions, he worked in a
department store afternoons and eve-
nings. However, "the best laid plans
gang aft agley," and towards the end
of his freshman year Doug's family
moved to Detroit. As a result, he en-
tered Michigan in the fall, this time in
the Engineering School with intentions
of becoming a Chemical Engineer. Last
fall, however, he changed to Metallur-
gical.
The last two years have been busy
ones for Doug. His junior year was
spent on the Union Executive Council,
as chairman of the committee which or-
ganized the Congress Cooperative House,
and in organizing the Student Book Ex-
change. He was also elected to Tau
Beta Pi and Vulcans. This year Doug
has been secretary for both A.I.M.E.
and the Men's Congress.
After graduation this June, Doug has
a job waiting for him with the Chase
Brass Company in Cleveland. Inciden-
tally, he will be married shortly after
graduation, which probably accounts for
the fact that he places a home ahead of
a sailboat on his shopping list.

PRACTICE
This month several real problems that
confronted one of the greatest American
City Engineer-Managers are described.
The reason this man became great was
because of his understanding of human
nature and ability to direct human
forces to the ends he desired, while al-
ways cementing firmer friendships.
His forethought was unusual, and
plans for winter storms were made so
perfectly in the summer that there
seemed to be no important storms in the
city, and later in the state where he
served. Assignments of men and equip-
ment were planned months ahead. Their
success in meeting storm emergencies
called forth the respect of the entire
citizenry, and particularly of his em-
ployees, who came to boast of "our
Chief."
This month, as usual, a five-dollar
award will be made to the person pre-
senting the best solutions to the prob-
lems below. Entries should be addressed
to the "Contest Editor," The Michi-
gan Technic, 3036 East Engineering
Building, and should be postmarked not
later than May 30. Judging will be
done by a faculty committee.
The winner of the March contest
was Joseph Anton, '40E.
The Problems:
You have the job of engineer for a
city, and find yourself surrounded by a
fine group of fellows, yet almost every-
thing is wrong with the organization.
Most of the employees have political
ties, and cannot be handled roughly.
One of the troubles is that several
crews of men are doing the same kind
of work in various parts of the city, and
the cost of equivalent work varies
widely.
In general, the qualifications of the
office help and field foremen is not what
would be desired. Most of these men
are doing their best as they perceive it.
It is apparent that promotions and
new jobs must be passed out in accord-
ance with the laws of patronage—yet
the argument of qualification weighs
greatly when it can be presented.
The men are paid each month, and
many of the lower paid group are heav-
ily indebted to loan sharks who keep
up an almost constant clamor for as-
signments of wages.

THE TECHNIC EXPLORES
new copper
After ten years of research and de-
velopment, at a cost running into seven
figures, a new type of copper has been
perfected. Known as "PDCP," it was
created to meet the need of the electrical
industry for a copper of superior char-
acteristics. Designed for dependable
performance under present day demands
for high speeds and less space, its out-
standing characteristics include greater
conducting power, ductility, fatigue re-
sistance, and surface quality.
This improved metal is made without
melting from electrolytic copper, which
is plastically converted by tremendous
pressure in a reducing atmosphere at
elevated temperature into smooth, dense
copper bar, rod, strip, or other desired
commercial shapes.
The only solid copper in the world
which is not melted subsequent to the
electrolytic purification process, the in-
trinsic purity of electrolytic cathode cop-
per is not only retained but greatly
enhanced at the high temperature of the
reducing gas used in the process. Sur-
face imperfections due to the casting
process and slivers and oxides developed
during the process of hot-rolling are the
cause of many failures in performance.
The new method, by eliminating not
only the casting process but also the
hot-rolling, makes possible the produc-
tion of a sliverless and dustless copper
surface.
This copper is especially adapted for
use in high tension and submarine ca-
bles, refrigeration and air-conditioning
installations, and high-frequency and
high voltage transformer windings. It is
also particularly applicable for services
where severe vibrations are a problem,
such as in airplane and electric locomo-
tive wiring where a single broken wire
may cause considerable damage.
comment
The last few weeks in aeronautical
circles have been full of comment on the
new Grumman Skyrocket. Departing
from the traditional stubby, chesty fu-
selage of the fighting biplane which has
been made famous by the Navy, the
new Grumman Skyrocket is a mid-wing
monoplane.
This single-seated fighter is powered
by two 1,200 horsepower Wright mo-
tors. A study of new air-fighting tech-
niques on European battlefields resulted
in this design, which is expected to fill
a vital spot in aviation. Constructed to
carry two heavy guns (to pierce new
airplane armor), the plane also has a
nest of machine guns. The armament
is located in the ship's nose between the
two motors so that there will be no
necessity of firing through the propellors.
Furthermore, although performance fig-
ures are a military secret, experts guess
that this addition to aeronautical ad-
vancement has a maximum speed of be-
tween 425 and 450 m.p.h.
conductive insulator
Rubber, the perennial insulator, as-
sumes a Dr. Jekyll-Mr. Hyde role un-
der a recently developed process which
produces rubber with a high degree of
electrical conductivity without impair-
ing its desirable physical properties.
This conductive rubber could find
wide usage in fields where a non-rigid
conductor was desirable. Conductive
rubber provides for the discharge of ac-
cumulated static charges derived from
air, roads, and other types of friction.
A few of the possible applications in-
clude: flooring, mats, and boots in ex-
plosives factories; rolls, belts, and con-
veyors in the cotton and paper indus-
tries where electric charges would cause
cohesion of the sheets; high voltage
cables to eliminate corona discharge;
and as a conductive core for X-ray
cables.
old gun made new
The old French 75mm. gun, made
famous in the last war and adopted by
our army, has recently had a "face lift-
ing" job performed on it. This gun.
many of which we have left after World
War I, was known for its fire power
against the enemy.
The modern rearmament rush has in-
troduced* new heavy weapons which
were outmoding the old 75. This brought
about some thinking by our army ordn-
ance officers, who did not wish to scrap
the large number of these guns that we
had on hand. The first rejuvenating step

wheels and replace them by pneumat-
ically tired wheels with roller bearing
axles. This increased the mobility of
the gun from the old maximum of fifteen
miles per hour to forty or fifty miles
per hour by fast truck. Probably the
greatest changes were brought about
when a new carriage was designed. The
new split rail type carriage is made of
welded alloy steel which replaces the old
cast iron and riveted iron plate type.
This split rail carriage has made possi-
ble a great amount of the modernization
of the gun. The gun's maximum tra-
verse has been increased from six to
ninety degrees, and it may now be ele-
vated anywhere from zero to ninety
degrees.
Improvements in the shell, such as
improvement of ballistic balance and
better streamlined shape, have also been
made. These, coupled with the improve-
ments in the carriage, have increased
the range of the gun from the old max-
imum of 7,000 yards to a maximum of
13,000 yards. Due to its easy change
of traverse, the 75mm. may be used
against the new fast moving tanks, if
the necessity arises.
inspection
Once in a while one hears of someone's
being ''stuck with a lemon" in the pur-
chase of an automobile. It is to guard
against such misfortunes that car manu-
facturers hire an average of one inspec-
tor for every eight factory employees.
It is estimated that more than 2000
separate checks are made during fabri-
cation and assembly—about 1600 on the
chassis and 475 on the body.
Nearly 100 inspections are given to
the steering system alone, and the most
tested single part—the cylinder block—
requires more than fifty separate dimen-
sional checks. Engines are mounted on
test stands and connected to dyna-
mometers to be broken in and checked
for power development, quietness, and
smoothness. Gears are run under heavy
loads and the resulting sound measured
with decibelmeters.
Important points are "checked and
double-checked." The steering assembly,
for example, is tested for camber and
toe-in by a fixture which, in turn is
checked twice a day by master gages.

One for Eight
Check and double check
Furthermore, in the floor of the inspec-
tion line is set a swiveled steel plate
which, when a misaligned* pair of front
wheels rolls over, swings to one side
ringing a bell. Finally, of course, come
the actual performance tests of the as-
sembled units.

i want to go back
Probably none of the present crop
of students ever had personal contact
with Joe's, but Michigan grads and un-
dergrads still sing "I want to go back to
Michigan" with a lump in their throats,
for Joe's is a Michigan tradition which
has been immortalized in this song.
Joe Parker's was located on Main
Street just north of Washington. It was
a favorite rendezvous and hangout for
everybody in the college except fresh-
men. According to custom, freshmen
Home
for the
Aged
Their
birthplace
lives in song
were not allowed in Joe's until Cap
Night, and after everything was over
that night, they would make a dash for
the place to get their first view of the
forbidden territory.
Dewitt C. Millen, 'OS, recalls that Joe
used to serve a lunch for fifteen cents—
potatoes and a good steak or something
—from 10 A. M. until noon every day,
and students used to eat there more
than at any other place.
All the star athletes and B. M. O. C.'s
used to belong to a group called the
"Friars' Club," whose memory is per-
petuated in the "Friars' Songs" of today.
Joe served them in a building across the
street. It became traditional for every-
one to carve his name and class numer-
als on the tables. When a table was all
carved up, Joe would varnish it and put
it on the wall. Then the students would
start carving up a new one. These fancy
jobs of carving may still be seen, for
after Joe died several years ago, the
tables were hung upon the Union Tap
Room walls, where they are today.
legend
In the spring a young man's fancy,
etcetera. If your fancy should find you
walking or biking some nice spring day
about the environs of Ann Arbor, you
might head down West Huron to the
corner of Arbana Drive. For the old
decaying windmill down there is the
embodiment of romance. The legend of
this Ann Arbor landmark runs like this:
Well over one hundred years ago,
Herman, the son of a German baron,
fell in love with Gabrielle, the beautiful
daughter of a French banker. Every-
thing went smoothly until Germany en-
tered the Napoleonic wars. This caused
a widening breach between the families.
Herman refused to fight Napoleon, and
when a summons came ordering him to
appear before the general, he fled to
to some nearby hills.
On one of these hills stood a windmill
where Gabrielle and Herman met at
night. She would steal away to await
her lover on the balcony of this mill. It
was there that Herman hid for three
days while soldiers hunted for him and
Gabrielle brought him food. Finally he
decided to go to America and come
back for her some day.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


money or friends, but in ten years he
became rather well known as a builder
of houses. In 1835 he received news of
Gabrielle's death. Years later, after he
had come to Ann Arbor, he was asked to
build a windmill on the edge of town.
The finished windmill was an exact re-
production of the trysting place on the
hills of Germany except for one small
detail. When Herman built the mill, he
made no doorway to the balcony. Even
today one may see the remains of this
tribute to Gabrielle, with its still un-
attainable balcony.
air intake
For a number of years we have noticed
a rather odd looking, hexagonal, brick
structure behind the Michigan Union.
Some exploration uncovered the fact
that it is the air intake for the Union's
ventilating and air conditioning system.
The air is sucked in by means of fans
and the temperature within the structure
is very low, even in the summer. The air
from the fans is passed through metal
screens to remove the dirt. These screens,
or filters, are changed once a year. In
passing over the cold metal screens,
the air loses some of its water vapor,
and this is rectified by shooting steam
into the air coming from the filters,
thus serving the two-fold purpose of
heating the air and bringing about the
desired relative humidity.
Certain parts of the Union wing are
air conditioned, an so special treatment
is given to the air going to those rooms.
The air is passed first through the metal
screens and then through spun glass. It
receives a more carefully controlled
humidity treatment, and since the heat
for the rooms it goes to comes only from
the air, its temperature must be made
sufficiently high so that it will enter the
rooms at about 72° Fahrenheit.
ancient
Only the older members of the faculty
will remember the "old library," for it
was in 1916 that the present library was
built. According to history, the "old
library" differed from the new one in
more than just physical appearance. In
those days girls were coy and men were
bashful, with the result that men stu-
dents sat on one side of the reading room
and women students on the other. Later
years saw the discouragement of this
practice and the present freedom of seat-
ing became the custom rather than the
exception.
Probably the best description of the
"old library" was made by Dr. William
W. Bishop, who likened the library to a
Mississippi steamboat—the rotunda, the
prow; the towers, the smoke stacks; the
book stacks, the rear paddles. In one of
these towers was a famous set of chimes
modeled after the chimes at Jesus Col-
lege in England.
The library was covered with a coat
of dignity-lending ivy, and because of its
central location was one of the best land-
marks on the campus. But the center of
interest in the "old library" was the
famous "whispering gallery." The slight-
est whisper on one side of the passage-
way of this gallery, which was located
on the second floor, could be distinctly
heard on the other side. This condition
was due to the circular and enclosed
effect of the gallery.
One of the many incidents related
about the gallery concerns the Ypsi girl
who had a "blind date" on campus.
While in the gallery, she whispered to
her girl-friend about her feelings toward
her "date." Unfortunately "the date"
was on the other side of the gallery.

IN February, and again in March, the tainly available at the time when most
Technic pointed out the many de- of the buildings were constructed or first
ficiencies of our lighting system, indicat- wired, but it was never utilized,
ing their serious effect on our most sen- This condition strikes a note of irony,
sitive organs—the eyes. It was also since this University is one of the great-

Archilectural Forum
Effective Lighting
All available knowledge must be used
pointed out that an institution of the
reputation of the University of Michigan
cannot afford to allow poor illumination
to continue to exist.
It seems to be not generally realized
that the problem is not a new one. In-
dications are that the shortcomings of
our illuminating system were appreciated
as long ago as fifteen years. The un-
looked for situation took root whenever
the buildings were erected. No one cap-
able of designing effective lighting sys-
tems was consulted to determine the
practicability of the various artistic de-
signs and attractive placements of the
luminaires. Some knowledge was cer-
est seats of learning in America—includ-
ing knowledge of effective lighting meth-
ods and equipment. One of our major
themes is social consciousness—consid-
eration for the health and happiness of
humanity. Paradoxically, a deplorable
situation is allowed to exist that is un-
favorably affecting the physical well-
being of every individual on campus.
In addition, courses in illumination en-
gineering have been offered for years.
And some action has been taken.
Students returning from Spring Vacation
were agreeably surprised to find new
and brighter lighting in the first floor
study hall of the main library. Installed
by B. &amp; G., it certainly is a step in the
traditional ''right direction."
Unfortunately, steps like the above
will win no races for the older buildings:
such steps can never be taken. As has
been mentioned on this page before, it
is impossible for cables, laid and de-
signed many years ago, to carry one watt
more of electric power than they now
are passing. In addition, a host of in-
dividual problems are presented in sci-
entifically lighting the drawing rooms,
library, offices, and class rooms of the
West Engineering Building, for example,
which was built in 1903. And only a
person trained in such matters is compe-
tent to solve these difficulties.
A scientific approach must be taken
toward the solution of the lighting prob-
lem. It is essential that all the available
knowledge on the subject be put into
practice for the benefit of those who use
the facilities; otherwise that knowledge
cannot justify its existence, and the time
and effort spent on its gathering are
wasted. A complete lighting survey
should be conducted by someone espe-
cially trained for the work—an illumina-
tion engineer. Only in that way can a
totally unbiased report be secured, free
from the influence of either radical or
ultra conservative notions.
There can be absolutely no substitute
for a critical survey by a technician.
The indiscriminate changing of bulbs
and lighting fixtures in many cases will
only aggravate an already admittedly
inhumane situation. So, let us move for-
ward as other colleges have done, using
our engineering skill to utmost advan-
tage for the benefit of those who must
work and live on these premises.

NETWORK TELEVISION
GENERAL ELECTRIC engineers passed another mile-
stone on the road to large-scale telecasting when
they recently demonstrated to the Federal Communications
Commission the feasibility of network television.
Until a short time ago it was not thought possible to transmit
television farther than the horizon. Recently, however,
General Electric put into operation its new relay station,
picking up programs originating in New York City—129
miles away, more than a mile below the line of sight. The
New York programs are then retelecast over General Elec-
tric's Schenectady television station W2XB to homes in the
Schenectady-Albany-Troy area.
FOR OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT
GRADUATES from seven colleges, five of them also
graduates of General Electric's famous Test course,
were among the 22 G-E employees who were given Charles A.
Coffin Foundation Awards this year for accomplishments
which reflected outstanding initiative, perseverance, courage,
and foresight.

James R. Alexander, Jr., U. N. C. '24, received recognition
for perfecting equipment (developed by Arthur W. Burns,
who also received a Coffin award for his work) using an
"electric eye" to control temperatures in cement manufac-
ture; Florian A. Arnold, Purdue '25, for designing automatic
welding machines used in making fractional-horsepower
motor stators; William S. Bachman, Cornell '32, for im-
proving tone reproduction in broadcast receivers; James E.
Beggs, Purdue '31, for developing a loop antenna for radio
receivers; Eugene VV. Boehne, Texas A &amp; M '26, and Leonard
J. Linde, South Dakota State '29, for developing a high-cur-
rent circuit breaker which does not use oil as an insulating
medium; Kenneth K. Bowman, Kansas State '26, M. A.
Edwards, Kansas State '28, and Francis Mohler, V. P. I.
'26, for developing Amplidyne controls for high-powered
motors; Adolph F. Dickerson, Texas A &amp; M 'io, for lighting
the Golden Gate International Exposition; and Simon H.
Weaver, Purdue '03, for developing a heat stabilizing treat-
ment for steam turbine shafts.

PHOTOGRAPHING LIGHTNING
PHOTOGRAPHING lightning is almost like trying to
turn around and face yourself. By the time you've turned
around, you're not there any more. But while nobody has yet
been able to look himself in the eye, General Electric scientists
have photographed lightning and recorded the wave shape of
lightning strokes.
With a high-speeil cathode-ray oscillograph and a high-speed
camera installed in the tower of the Empire State Building
in New York City, Dr. Karl B. McEachron, a former G-E
Test man, directs the study of the characteristics of lightning.
The lightning stroke itself "pulls the trigger" and puts the
complicated mechanism into operation in one-millionth of a
second.
Records obtained in this way help General Electric engineers
to build electrical equipment that laughs at lightning —
keeps the lights on and the factories running when thunder-
storms come.

Tool Wear and Chip Form
IT HAS been observed that, when
cutting brittle metals like cast iron
and free-cutting brass, the chips are re-
moved with very little distortion. Brass
chips are broken into fairly equal sizes,
whereas cast-iron chips are
broken and crushed into
particles of various shapes
and si/.es from lumps to
dust. As a result, the tool
normally fails by abrasion
on the Hank.
When ductile metals
are cut, the cutting edge
of the tool is protected
by a small built-up edge
which is the medium for
separating the chip from
the bar being machined. The surface
finish is formed, not by the cutting
edge of the tool, but rather by the built-
up edge itself. Further, because of this
built-up edge, the chip slides over the
tool face, causing it to become grooved.
During the progress of formation of
this groove, the forces on the tool are
reduced to a minimum when the tool
has an optimum lip just prior to com-
plete failure. In commercial practice the
tool would be removed for regrinding
just prior to the complete
breakdown.
The questions of chip
formation and tool wear
are basic factors in the
study in which the Uni-
versity's Department of
Metal Processing is now
doing much research for
various industrial firms.
Extensive facilities and
equipment in the Univer-
sity laboratories are avail-
able for all types of research studies, in
this and other fields. We welcome your
inquiries as to how we might serve you
in connection with your research prob-
lems, and, further, solicit your visiting

JOHN E.
EMSWILER

THE Department of Mechanical En-
gineering lost an able head and
every engineering student a friend and
counselor when death ended the career
of Professor John E. Emswiler on Sep-
tember 23. In ill health for two years,
and on leave of absence from his teach-
ing duties during the last year, he had
been an active and popular member of
our faculty since 1906.
He was born on a farm in Lebanon,
Illinois, on February 13, 1880, attended
small town schools in Ohio for his early
education, and went to high school in
Martinsburgh, Ohio. In 1899 he en-
tered Ohio State University to study
mechanical engineering. After receiv-
ing his B. S. degree in 1903, he went to
work for the Cooper Engine Company
of Mount Vernon, Ohio, as a drafts-
man. Remaining there for six months,
he left to take the General Electric
"Test" course, a training period for
engineering school graduates. Finding
in 1906 that he had both the desire
and the opportunity to teach, he came
to the University of Michigan as an
instructor in mechanical engineering.
His advance was rapid: assistant pro-
fessor in 1911, associate in 1916, full
professor in 1918, and head of the De-
partment of Mechanical Engineering in
1937. He was married in 1913 to
Cecile Dixon, and had three children,
a son and two daughters.
Professor Emswiler was the author
of a great many technical papers dur-
ing his long professional career. His
research in ventilation and his work on
heat power and steam turbines have
made him widely known. He was the
author of a textbook on thermodynam-
ics which has been used here for sixteen
years and has been published in three
editions. When still active on the cam-
pus two years ago, he was working on
a project to determine the effect of
wind direction and velocity in deter-
mining the temperature on inside sur-
faces of buildings.
In addition to all this work, Profes-
sor Emswiler rendered further service
to the University by serving on several
committees, including the Standing
and Executive Committees. Until the
time of his illness he was active in many
societies: the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers, the Society for
the Promotion of Engineering Educa-
tion, the Detroit Engineering Society,
and the American Society of Heating
and Ventilating Engineers. Also, he
served on the Faculty Advisory Board
of the Technic for many years, and
was affiliated with Tau Beta Pi, Phi
Kappa Phi, Sigma Xi, the Masonic
Lodge, and the Inverness Country
Club. Still he found time for occasional
relaxation in golf and faculty rifle
shooting.
A good teacher and a good friend,
Emswiler was admired and loved by
students and faculty. He will long be
remembered by the many friends he
leaves behind.

Not as difficult to use as some
people believe, the interferom-
eter merits more widespread use.
THE INTERFEROMETER
By
WM. L. FINK, '23E and
L A. WILLEY
Aluminum Co. of America
THE interferometer is an old tool
which has been used by physicists
for a variety of purposes. It has been
used for measuring lengths with pre-
cision, for accurately measuring the
wave length of light, for measuring
refractive indices, and for measuring
the density of gases. Although ap-
paratus has been on the market and
methods have been described in the
literature since the latter part of the
nineteenth century, the interferometer
is not used as extensively by metal-
lurgists, chemists, and engineers as one
would expect. This is probably at-
tributable to a widespread misconcep-
tion that the interferometer is difficult
to use, and that the observer must
look through the instrument constantly
for the entire duration of the test,
counting fringes as they pass. A de-
scription of the method of using inter-
ference measuring apparatus for pre-
cision measurement of changes in
length will show how simple and con-
venient the method really is.
Before describing methods and ap-
paratus, the fundamentals will be re-
viewed briefly. Figure 1 is a schematic
representation of the formation of in-
terference fringes from the optically
flat surfaces of two quartz plates placed
at a slight angle to each other (in the
drawing the wave length and conse-
quently the angle between the plates
are greatly exaggerated). A beam of
light passing downward through the
quartz plates is partially reflected at
the lower surface of plate A and par-
tially reflected from the upper surface
of plate B. The reflected waves from
A and B are shown by dotted and
dashed lines respectively. It is evi-
dent that at points such as c, g, and
k, where the space between the re-
flecting surfaces is one-fourth, three-
fourths, one and one-fourth wave
lengths, et seq., the two reflected
beams will be in phase, and bands of
light will be formed. At points such
as a, e, i, and m, where the space be-
tween the reflecting surfaces is 0, one-
half, one, one and one-half wave
lengths of light, et seq., the two re-
flected rays will be 180° out of phase,
and there will be an absence of light,
or dark interference fringes.
From the simple relation shown in
Figure 1, it is evident that the distance
between the two quartz plates at any
point (e.g. at an index point etched on
one of the quartz plates) could be
calculated if the number of the fringe
and the wave length of the light were
known. For example, at the third
fringe, the distance between the plates
is 3 times the wave length of the light
divided by 2. Assuming that helium
yellow light is being used with a wave
length of .0005876 mm., the distance
between the plates at this point would
be .0008814 mm., or in general terms,
d = ~ where d = distance, n = fringe
number, and A=wave length. In
other words, a suitable light source, an
apparatus for viewing the fringes, a
method for determining the number of
the fringe, and a table giving accurate
wave lengths for the existing condi-
tions, are all that are necessary to
measure accurately the length of a
specimen separating two quartz plates.
The determination of coefficients of
thermal expansion will be used as an
illustration of the application of the
interferometer method just described.
One of the specimens used for this
purpose is shown by itself and between
the quartz plates in Figure 2. One of
the legs of this specimen is approxi-
mately 0.003 mm. longer or shorter
than the other two (approximately 5

held at a slight angle to each other.
This produces approximately twelve
yellow fringes in the field of view. This
interferometer is placed in a small
electric furnace, and interference
measuring apparatus is used for view-
ing and measuring fringes.
This interference measuring appa-
ratus, unlike many of the instruments
which have been used, does not neces-
sitate constant observation and count-
ing the fringes as they pass the index
point. The fringes in the field of view
can be identified at any time by
measuring the distance from the index
point on one of the quartz plates to
the nearest fringe in three or four
different fringe systems which are vis-
ible simultaneously. The fringes can
then be identified by reference to
tables.
Since one might not expect that such
a simple procedure would identify the
fringes, there will be given a brief
explanation based on the assumption
that the light source is a helium Geis-
sler tube. The four fringe systems
which are used are related to each
other, as shown in Figure 3, which
covers distances from 0 to 0.010 mm.
The helium yellow fringes are used for
calculating the distances, and the
numbers of the yellow fringes are given
below the lines representing the yellow
fringes in Figure 3. In general, the
red, green, and blue fringes do not
coincide with the yellow fringes. For
example, the tenth yellow fringe is
0.80 of a fringe beyond the eighth red
fringe, 0.71 of a fringe beyond the
eleventh green fringe, and 0.94 of a
fringe beyond the eleventh blue fringe.
The decimal parts of the red, green,
and blue fringes are indicated adjacent
to each line representing the yellow
fringes. It is evident that Figure 3

would have to be extended many fold
to show the recurrence of the same
combinations of fractions. In other
words, if the distance between the
quartz plates is known approximately,
the number of the yellow fringe can
be quickly identified by reference to
the proper section of a table giving
fractional values. For example, values
are given in Table I for the region in
the vicinity of 5 mm., which is used
in the work being described. If it is
known that the specimen is approxi-
mately 5 mm. high and observation
shows that the yellow fringe nearest
the index point coincides with 0.97 of
a red fringe, 0.84 of a green fringe, and
0.19 of a blue fringe, reference to Table
I shows that the number of the yellow
fringe in question is 17,011. This cor-
responds to an air space of 4.9975 mm.
(i.e., length of specimen).
The instrument is able to measure
to the nearest 0.01 of a fringe if the
quartz plates are ground with sufficient
accuracy. In other words, the meas-
urement of the distance should be
made with an accuracy of =*= 0.005 of
the wave length or ±0.0000028 mm.
(28 A).
The use of the interferometer for
determining coefficients of expansion
has several important advantages. The
determination of coefficient is made
with very high precision even when
the specimen is very short, e.g. a few
mm. in length. The use of a small
specimen makes it easy to avoid tem-
perature gradients in the specimen,
which are very difficult to eliminate
when long specimens are employed in
mechanical dilatometers. Moreover,
the interferometer method eliminates
all mechanical gadgets with their at-
tendant lost motion and differential
expansion. Also, the only load on the
specimens is the weight of a small
quartz plate, so that creep is avoided
until high temperatures are reached.
There are many applications where
the interferometer can be used to ad-
vantage. For example, it can be used
for studying phase changes which occur
within an alloy at different tempera-
tures. It can be used in the accurate
determination of modulus of elasticity,
or in the measurement of creep. If
the advantages of the method and the
ease with which the determinations
can be carried out were more generally
appreciated, the use of this method
would be more widespread.

Without looking in a haystack,
you can find a needle to suit
your phonograph and your budget.
POUTING
THE WAY
By
CORDON OSTERSTROM, '43E
MOST persons who own home pho-
nographs have often wondered
which of the several types of needles
they should use. The answer is not
always an easy one, for there is no one
needle suitable for all applications.
Selecting a type is a little engineering
problem involving several variables,
one of which is the unpredictable
human element. It will be assumed in
this discussion that the needles are to
be used with ordinary pick up arms
operating at point pressures of two
ounces or more, and with common
shellac disk records.
The needle tip slides along in a
rather shallow, laterally modulated
groove which has a carefully designed,
rounded bottom. The groove bottom
is not absolutely smooth, for besides
the roughness inherently introduced by
the pressing machine, a fine abrasive is
mixed with the record material. It is
the task of the needle to follow accu-
rately this groove, whose engraved
modulations usually represent a sound
frequency range of from 80 to 4,000
cycles per second.
If the needle is to move from side to
side several thousand times each second
in order to follow the high frequency
vibrations of the groove, it must have
a tip that is smaller than any of the
curves it must trace. Yet no needle
ground to a sharp point can work prop-
erly in a record groove. The sharp,
conical point of new, cheap needles is
too small to fit snugly. The needle tip
can follow a curved path best if it has
a ball point whose diameter is the
same as the width of the groove.
The sharp point has a additional
disadvantage. It has such a small
bearing area that pressures of several
thousand pounds per square inch exist.
Such high pressures will cause the shel-
lac record material to flow, and distort
the modulations of the groove. The
fine point does not exist for long, how-
ever, for the abrasive in the record
quickly wears it away. The trouble is
that the curved groove walls form
cylindrical surfaces on the sides of the
point, which have razor-sharp front
edges. These immediately begin to cut
into the curves of the groove. The
cutting increases progressively as the
shoulders form in the thicker portions
of the needle. If satisfactory record
life is expected, the use of sharp pointed
metallic needles of any type is to be
avoided. If they must be used, ex-
treme care should be taken to see that
they are not used for more than one
side. Unfortunately, the sharp pointed
needle is the cheapest and most popu-
lar needle on the market, but is the
least satisfactory.
The ball point has a larger contact
area, and wear is much slower, both on
the needle and on the record. The
quality of the ball point needle is
judged, among other things, by the
hardness of the tip. The harder the
tip, the better the record and needle
life will be. The cheapest grade of
needle of this type is made of high
grade, hardened, carbon steel, just as
the pointed needles are. This needle
is fairly cheap, is rugged, and can be
expected to last for two playings. Cer-
tain alloy steels may be employed to
give a needle that has a much harder
tip. The life of the point is increased
to a few hundred playings, but the
price is higher. These needles, if used
properly, are best for rough-and-
tumble automatic changer arms, where
the needle is frequently dropped with
considerable violence on the record.
The tip may also be made of an ex-
tremely hard jewel, such as a sapphire
or diamond. Depending on the quality
of the jewel, such needles will safely
last from 2,000 to 5,000 playings. There
is a certain danger in the use of such a
hard tip, for if it should become
chipped, the sharp edges formed might
ruin a record in a single playing. They
must be handled with care and in-
spected frequently to see that no dam-
age has been done to them. For this
reason it is not a wise plan to use a
jewelled stylus in ordinary changers, or
where careless persons will handle
them. But the jewelled stylus will
give the best results of any needle if
handled with care; the long life of its
ball point is assurance that the choicest
of shellac pressings will be fairly safe.
Thorn needles become worn in the
same manner as the plain sharp pointed

constant supply of new blood and
new ideas, and some means must be
provided to train young men to become
the executives and technicians of the
future. To accomplish this, the idea of
the Chrysler Institute of Engineering,
now in practical operation, was con-
ceived.
Once a year men who have graduated
from accredited colleges of engineering
are brought into the corporation for a
three-year training program. These
men are selected by a group of execu-
tives, who comprise the entrance com-
mittee. This committee interviews a
dozen or so men at each of the better
engineering colleges, and picks those
qualified.
The function of the three-year pro-
gram is to help the student become
orientated in his surroundings, and to
acquaint him with every phase of the
engineering involved in the designing
and building of automobiles. He has
had little opportunity for much ad-
vanced training in his chosen field of
Many industries have come to appre-
ciate the fact that the graduate of the
four year engineering curriculum has had
only a broad training and is unprepared
to render valuable service to the particular
company hiring him. As an attempt to
solve this problem, training courses for
the young graduate have been established
by some industries. These post-graduate
programs take various forms and go by
various names. This year the TECHNIC
will present descriptions of the courses
used by some of our country's major com-
panies. This month we are leading off
with the Chrysler Institute of Engineering.
specialization, so the only requirement
of the student is that he know basic
engineering fundamentals, and that he
know them intuitively rather than just
by definition.
The young engineers are successively
moved through the laboratories and
departments of the Engineering Di-
vision, spending from two to four
months on each assignment. During
the first year the student divides his
time among the drafting training and
production drafting departments, the
experimental garage, and the resident
engineer's office in one of the produc-
tion plants. On design problems the
student learns the practices of the
automotive design departments. Ex-
perience in the experimental garage
enables him to become familiar with
the company's products, since his work

structural design saves
time and material.
LIMIT DESIGN
\\ 7HEN, in his conquests, Caesar
* * wished to carry his invasion into
Germany, his engineers bridged the
Rhine. They did an extremely credit-
able job, having for materials nothing
but the forests of Gaul. They did not
take time to draw up blueprints or
send an order to the steel mill. Prob-
ably they did not even calculate the
maximum loads their bridge would
have to carry, and certainly they did
not investigate the stresses in the
timbers.
Luckily for Caesar, there were no
hundred-ton locomotives to take across
the Rhine, nor did it matter if the
navigation of the river was blocked
temporarily. Such problems confront
engineers today when they plan im-
portant bridges.
Yet these, perhaps, are not the most
difficult problems the designer faces.
Almost any imaginable structure could
now be built—provided enough money
were available. But since money is
usually scarce, it is important to get
the most structure per dollar, and de-
termining how to do this is frequently
the engineer's hardest job.
For this reason, the work being done
by Professor J. A. Van den Broek of
the Department of Engineering Me-
chanics promises to have as far-reach-
ing effects on structural engineering as
any development in recent years. His
Theory of Limit Design is not com-
posed completely of new ideas; it has
actually been used in the design of
some structures for years; but it has
never been organized and brought to
the attention of engineers in this coun-
try before.
The Theory is built upon the stress-
strain relationships of structural steel,
which are somewhat unusual. When
tested in tension, it behaves elastically
By
GEORGE W. WEESNER, *41E
until a stress of about 30,000 psi. is
reached (line AB, F'ig. 1). Stresses are
directly proportional to strains, or rela-
tive changes in length. When released,
it will return to its original length. But
near 30,000 psi. the "yield point" is
reached, and a permanent, ductile de-
formation begins. Strains up to forty
times the elastic strains may take
place, with no increase in stress (line
BC, Fig. 1). Then, gradually^, stresses
rise to a maximum, and finally decline
before the material breaks, as it is
strained further. Qualitatively, the
stress-strain curves for material in com-
pression and shear are similar.
Structural steel can be broken. It
is broken in the ordinary tensile test.
But structures virtually never fail be-
cause the steel breaks. Long before
breaking, the material will have reached
its elastic limit, or compression mem-
bers will have buckled, and excessive
deformation will have destroyed the
usefulness of the structure.
In ordinary design practice, it is in-
tended that no part of a structure shall
ever reach its yield point stress or its
critical buckling load. Yet, in actual
structures, there may often be some
localized yielding of material, with no
damage to the structure as a whole.
It is for this reason that a ductile
material is used, and only ductile ma-
terials could be used.
A good example of localized yield-
ing may be found in an ordinary rivet
connection. If a single rivet could
hold 10,000 lbs. before yielding, our
common sense would tell us that a
four rivet connection like that in Fig.
2 could hold 40,000 lbs. This would
not be true if steel were not a ductile

lbs. and the force in the members was
40,000 lbs., the force in the upper
member between A and B would be
30,000 lbs., while that in the lower
would be 10,000. But unless there had
been a slight yielding, the distance be-
tween the rivets would be the same in
both members. Since stress is propor-
tional to strain, the forces in both
would have to be the same: 20,000 lbs.
Each end rivet would carry 20,000
lbs., and those in the center would
have no load. But a rivet begins to
yield when its load passes 10,000 lbs.;
the end rivets would yield enough to
distribute the load between all four.
Being ductile, they do not break, and
continue to carry their share of the
load. The localized yielding has done
no damage.
The Theory of Limit Design applies
this principle to entire structures of
the redundant, or statically indetermi-
nate type. Such structures include
built-in beams and continuous beams,
arches, and many types of trusses.
The stresses in them can be determined
only by analysis of the elastic de-
flections when loaded. For example,
a rectangular frame with diagonal
cross-bracing is kept from changing
shape by the two diagonals. Just how
much of the loads each diagonal carries
can only be learned by studying the
elastic behavior of the entire structure.
One diagonal, if large enough, would
suffice; there is one extra, redundant
member.
The Theory of Limit Design as-
sumes that as long as a single member
of such a structure (one diagonal in
this case) is still acting, the structure
has not failed. Stated formally,
"When in a well designed and especial-
ly properly detailed n-fold redundant
structure, n members are stressed to
their elastic limit, or up to their critical
buckling loads, the deformations in-
volved are of the order of magnitude
of elastic deformations until an (n+1)-
th member has reached its elastic limit
or its critical buckling capacity."
In the frame mentioned, a force
tending to deform it would put one
diagonal in compression and the other
in tension. The compression member
would begin to buckle when its critical
load was reached. But when a com-
pression member buckles, it does not
lose its capacity to carry some load; it
has merely reached a maximum load.
So long as the stress in the tension
member is below the elastic limit the
frame cannot deform enough to be
damaged. Only when both reach their
maximum loads does the structure fail.
Actually, any beam is a redundant
structure, for an infinite number of
fibers act together to restrain its bend-
ing. Conventionally, no part of the
formula, and it is about 10 per cent
greater in an average I-beam, f being
the same in both cases.
A beam with its ends built into walls
might be considered to act as a canti-
lever from each end, and as a simple

A tower or a problem?
beam may reach its elastic limit, and
triangular stress distribution results
(Fig. 3a). The resisting moment de-
veloped is M = —, where f is the maxi-
c
mum stress, I the moment of inertia,
and c the distance from the neutral
axis.
If the bending moment applied to
the beam increases so that f reaches
the elastic limit, the beam will not fail
immediately. A stress distribution like
that in Fig. 2b will result. The de-
flection will not be damagingly large
as long as any fiber in the beam re-
mains below its elastic limit. The
largest possible resisting moment is
developed when the stresses are as
shown in Fig. 2c. In a symmetrical
beam, this is M = 2fAy, where Ay is
the static moment of half the beam's
area about the center, which is the
neutral axis. In a rectangular beam,
this resisting moment is 50 per cent
greater than that given by the first
beam across the span. Any one of
these actions would support loads; the
other two are extra, and merely add
strength. Thus the beam is twice re-
dundant. An analysis of such a beam,
uniformly loaded, by the Theory of
Elasticity shows that at each end of
the span there is a negative bending
-Wl2
moment, M=—jj—. At the center,
Wl2
the positive moment is M = -r—. De-
24
signing conventionally, we set the re-
. . fl
sisting moment, —, equal to the maxi-
Wl2
mum bending moment, -y^-. But the
capacity of the beam is only half uti-
lized at the center. The Theory of
Limit Design tells us that it makes no
difference if the elastic limit loading is
passed at the ends, so long as it is not
passed at the middle, too. The beam
can carry an overload without dam-

load that would cause complete failure
is nearly 45 per cent greater than that
at which the first yielding takes place.
If the beam is loaded to full capaci-
ty, permanent deformations will occur.
If the load is removed, these defor-
mations will cause residual stresses.
These are of such a nature that, if the
load is applied again, the beam be-
haves as an entirely elastic structure,
and no further ductile flow takes place.
However, if the beam is subject to re-
versal of stress, bending in one direc-
tion, then the other, the limit loads
cannot be so great as where no reversal
is encountered. The residual stresses
would act in the wrong sense for re-
versed loads, and yielding would take
place repeatedly. This would lead to
failure. The problems involved in
Limit Design for such loading are
rather complicated, and will not be
discussed here.
Above, the limit loads which will
cause failure of structures have been
investigated. Obviously, it would not
be sound engineering to expect any
structure to carry its greatest possible
load as a normal thing. This would
leave no margin of safety for overloads
or defects in the material. So, in de-
signing by this Theory, the expected
loads are estimated, just as they would
be in any case. If a factor of safety
of, say, two is desired, then these ex-
pected loads are multiplied by two. A
structure is designed which will have
this extra-large quantity as its limit,
or failing load.
In addition to saving material, the
Theory of Limit Design will save the
engineer's time. When elasticity is
assumed, involved analyses of deflec-
tions must be made to find the stresses
in various parts of a structure. In
some cases, these computations might
take weeks. But when Limit Design
is used, one need only be sure the
strength of the structure as a whole is
great enough for the loads; the stresses
in individual parts do not matter.
The savings of time and material,
together, which may be obtained in
some types of structures, should great-
ly reduce costs, and should prove to be
of great value to designers.

POINTING THE WAY
needles do. There is not much danger
from the shoulders formed, because
they are too soft to cut, but large
cylindrical areas are formed immedi-
ately after the needle is put into serv-
ice, which prevent proper tracking and
introduce distortion. It is claimed by
some that the high coefficient of friction
of the soft needle tends to erase the
groove modulations, but the most seri-
ous objection to these needles is their
nuisance value, as they must be re-
sharpened each time they are used.
Much of the objectionable scratch
noise in most records is of higher fre-
quency than the upper recorded limit
of 4,000 cycles. In order to reproduce
properly all of the tones on the record,
it must vibrate with equal efficiency at
all frequencies from 80 to 4,000 cycles.
Yet, if the minimum of noise is to be
transmitted, the resistance to vibra-
tion should increase abruptly at 4,000
(Continued from page 12)
cycles. This is the ideal frequency
characteristic which the vibration ten-
dencies of the needle should approach
as closely as possible. This ideal is
never reached in practice, but good re-
sults may be achieved by the use of
elaborate cut-off networks in the elec-
trical circuits accompanying the pick
up.
The needle must have low mass in
order to be able to vibrate easily at the
higher frequencies. The higher quality
needles are designed with this in mind.
A thick, heavy needle cannot respond
well to rapid vibrations. For this rea-
son, the better needles have carefully
designed light, thin areas. In jewel
tipped needles, the tip is held in a light
shank of aluminum. The shank of this
needle is designed to give the proper
frequency characteristics. Some non-
metallic needles show an especially
sharp drop in response at about 4,000
cycles per second. Thus they have
very low scratch.
It is easy to see that the purchaser
should consider the advantages and
limitations of all the various types of
needles. The connoisseur who gives
his fine records the best possible care
will probably find a sapphire needle
will give the best results with a mini-
mum of wear. Those who trust their
records to an automatic changer will
find that they can get the longest safe
service from a round point alloy steel
needle. Sharp pointed carbon steel
needles can be used by those who do
not mind rapid record wear, high noise
level, and changing needles often. One
should choose a needle to fit his own
particular requirements. But once
they are in service, they should be
properly used. Only then can satis-
factory phonograph operation be ap-
proached.

marketing problems, but it has; or the

I have cited these three products as
having a bearing on electrical develop-
ment. You may be interested to know
why and how. The answer is: either in
their manufacture or use, or both, these
products are explosive.
Pyroxylin lacquers are made of flam-
mable materials; the finished products
are flammable, and their use may re-
sult in explosive atmospheres. The
manufacture of synthetic silk is at-
tended by explosion hazards. Many of
the new anesthetics are highly explo-
sive. These conditions require that all
possible safeguards be used to prevent
explosions.
Ordinary electrical devices and ap-
pliances are unsuitable for locations in
which these explosive conditions exist.
Electrical research, though less
spectacular than other kinds,
often underlies their success.

NO INDUSTRY in the world is
making faster progress or taking
greater strides than the electrical in-
dustry. Not only are electrical engi-
neers and designers improving generat-
ing, transmission, and utilization ap-
paratus, but other industries in their
forward efforts have turned to elec-
trical men for assistance.
In the field of research the chemical
industry has stolen the spotlight, largely
because of the many novel and radi-
cal ways in which the results have
affected our daily lives or the goods we
wear or use. However, in many in-
stances these achievements, in other
than the electrical field, could not have
been accomplished without the aid of
electrical science and invention.
One would hardly expect the market-
ing of a new kind of lacquer to have a
direct bearing upon the manufacture
of electrical conduit fittings, but it has;
or the advent of a new synthetic silk to
give designing, manufacturing, and
During the past few years there have
been developed several hundred de-
vices to meet these new requirements.
They include lighting fixtures, switches,
plugs and receptacles, motor control-
lers, circuit breakers, junction and pull
boxes; in fact, every item necessary for
a conduit wiring system.
At first it might seem that the prob-
lem could easily be solved by enclosing
the live parts in vapor- or gas-tight
enclosures—in fact, this was tried at
first. However, it was soon apparent
that this method was ineffective; the
gas would get in.
In these circumstances, the enclosed
gas would be ignited by an arc or a
high temperature. The resulting ex-
plosion usually ejected flames or sparks
at joints or shattered the enclosure.
The surrounding gas laden atmosphere
would become ignited and life and
property thereby endangered. Insur-
ance companies and other interested
parties came to the conclusion that the
use of vaporproof fixtures and fittings
offered very little protection in hazar-
dous locations. New rules were in-
serted in the National Electrical Code,
covering such installations.
For locations where flammable gases
are the hazard, explosion-proof ma-
terial is now required. As a result, all
enclosures for electrical conductors,
switches, controllers, lamps, and even
motors are housed in cases having
flame-tight joints and walls of sufficient
strength to withstand the internal pres-
sures produced by an explosion.
These pressures frequently are as
high as 150 pounds per square inch, and
the Underwriters' Laboratories, Inc.,
who test all such devices, require a
factor of safety of four. Some must be
built to withstand 600 pounds per
square inch.
Obviously a lighting fixture must
have a glass globe surrounding a lamp
bulb. This means that the glass globe
must have sufficient strength to hold
against four times the explosion pres-
sure. Incandescent lamps produce
heat, therefore the design of the fixture
must be such as to prevent the external
temperature of any part of the fixture
from closely approaching the ignition
temperature of the atmosphere. Then,
too, the fixture must be as efficient,
from an illuminating standpoint, as the
safely requirements will permit.
The Underwriters' Laboratories
established temperature limits and per-
missible joint widths and clearances,
but at the outset very few data were
available as to expected explosion pres-
sures and probable temperatures.
Therefore, it was necessary to proceed
largely by the trial and error method.
In the case of switches, the problem
contained fewer unknown quantities.
Nevertheless, the behavior of a switch
in the open and in a tight enclosure
may be quite different.
Circuit breakers, when opening un-
der short circuit conditions or under
heavy loads, release considerable en-
ergy which increases the pressure ob-
tained from the exploding gas. There-
fore, the data secured from an enclosure
of similar volume, but not housing an
arcing device comparable to a circuit
breaker, proved unreliable.
I can quote no statistics, but from
observation I am confident that ex-
plosions and fires from electrical causes
are quite rare in buildings wired in
accordance with the rules for hazard-
ous locations contained in the National
Electrical Code.

REQUIREMENTS MET AND MONEY SAVED
Cast iron distributor gears for automotive engines
have several recognized advantages. They are quiet,
wear well, and are comparatively inexpensive. The
problem is to produce a cast iron with the necessary
wearing qualities and yet keep it machineable.
Several automotive engine manufacturers are now
obtaining the necessary strength (50,000 p.s.i.) and
hardness (250-300 B.H.N.) — and eliminating machin-
ing difficulties—by making distributor gears of Nickel-
Chromium-Molybdenum iron. The machineability of
the iron is largely a result of its Molybdenum content.
By specifying this machineable iron, engine build-
ers can meet distributor gear requirements with re-
gard to noise and wearing quality — and save money
doing it.
Full technical details concerning Nickel-Chromium-
Molybdenum iron and other cast irons serving the
automotive field with efficiency and economy are

night crawlers
Dean Walter B. Rea and the Ann
Arbor police force, perennial sources
of material for this page, collaborated
early last summer and produced this:
Late one Friday night one of the
Dean's vigilant neighbors reported to
police headquarters that a prowler was
lurking about the house. A radio squad
car with two patrolmen was rushed to
the scene to apprehend the trespasser.
Stalking stealthily around the side of
the house, the officers pounced on the
prowler—who turned out to be our
austere dean himself, out hunting for
night crawlers with a flashlight.

The dean is not alone among uni-
versity officials in behaving queerly at
night, though. At a southern univer-
sity recently, the Dean of Women, re-
turning home about two-thirty one
morning, passed in front of a boys'
dormitory. "Hello, Ida May," famil-
iarly shouted a student. The rest of
the boys put their heads out the win-
dow just in time to see the lady run
and crouch behind a bush that was
slightly too small to conceal her.
hats off!
Summer school students usually
seem to enjoy that session. We sup-
pose they learn something, too. But
we know of a fellow who had some
troubles during the past summer, and
we're sure he learned something. He
learned not to spar with his mental
superiors. For last summer a King of
Practical Jokers was crowned.
It all started in the usual way—
something playful, and not at all harm-
ful. The two swapped back and forth
REFL
two or three times, and then Pete had
an idea.
But in some way Don found out the
spark-plug wires on his car had been
mixed up. He hadn't any occasion to
use the car for a couple of days. When
he did finally decide to go someplace,
all the boys in the house gathered at
the windows. Don started the car,
and drove off calmly.
But it wasn't long before Don came
back, on foot. He didn't look exactly
happy. "Is Pete around?" he asked
sullenly. They supposed he was; did
Don want to see him? "Oh, . . . No,
I guess I won't. I'll let my lawyer see
him."
Of course everybody wanted to know
what happened. But Don was a good
guy, it had all been meant in a spirit of
fun, and he didn't want to get anybody
mad at Pete by telling. That couldn't
last for ever, though; gradually it
leaked out. Don had got just around
the corner, there'd been a sort of ex-
plosion, and the car was at the garage.
The bill would be about forty-five
dollars.
Don never spoke to Pete about it.
But of course the other fellows told
him. Forty-five dollars hurt a good
deal for a fellow who was working his

way, but of course Pete was going to
make it square, and tried to tell Don
so. Whenever he mentioned it, though,
Don just said he was leaving that up
to his lawyer.
And so the weeks wore on. And
when school was over and Pete had
left, Don commented to one of the
other boys. "Maybe I'll send him a
postcard sometime and tell him that
nothing ever happened to that car."

it may be true . . .
A big brawny linesman on the foot-
ball team of one of our eastern uni-
versities had been taking a terrific
beating from an even bigger and
brawnier opponent. Time and time
again he had bucked that opposing
guard, only to be tossed aside, bruised

and bleeding. And with every such
disastrous clash he became more and
more humiliated and determined on
revenge. Finally, when the dust of
one play had cleared away, he was
found with his teeth clamped firmly in
his hated enemy's leg.
Naturally, for such ungentlemanlv
conduct he was banished from the
game. He walked slowly toward the
bench, dumbly awaiting the expected
verbal lashing of his coach. Instead,
came this from the mentor: "Why
Mike, how could vou forget todav is
Friday?"

Last month the Gargoyle had its an-
nual baby. Like the infant New Year,
this immature child confidently prom-
ised all sorts of good things for the
coming year. In smooth phrases that
belied its age, it tried to pull the old
razz-ma-tazz play on the supposedly
naive freshmen. It painted in glowing
terms what they would expect to get for
only one dollar. This went on for
sentence after sentence, even as this.
Standing out in all the build-up was
this—the Garg will come out with a 52

'HEN you receive your diploma and
enter upon your career as a mechanical engineer
you will find a sound knowledge of bearing design
and application one of your most valuable assets.
Wherever wheels and shafts turn, every piece of

president
In this month's catalogue of inter-
esting people we have one of those
fellows that has the durndest habit of
getting himself elected president of
something-or-other. He is Ed King,
and comes from Elsmere, X. Y. Even
in the dark, remote days of high school
he was President of his senior class and
Editor of the yearbook.

Ed King
Headaches were adventure
In his freshman year, he affiliated
with Phi Gamma Delta, and became a
member of the Frosh Frolic Committee
in the first semester. Second semester
found Ed trying out for the 'Ensian,
an activity which he carried through
the end of last year, and becoming a
member of the Glider Club. Next year,
he was on the Honor Committee of the
Engineering Council, and was elected
to the Soph Prom Committee. He was
also active in Les Voyageurs and the
I. Ae. S., and at the end of the year,
was initiated into Triangles. During
his junior year, he was President of
Triangles, served on the Engineering
Ball Committee, and was tapped by
Yulcans. This year, Ed is President
of Vulcans, Vice-President of the En-
gineering Council, Secretary of I. Ae.
S., and President of Phi Gamma Delta.
Ed's big interest is aviation, from
the engineering standpoint and also
from the flier's standpoint. He has
been interested in gliders for some time,
and, if you were visiting his room, you
would see on the wall a piece of fabric
from the glider in which he cracked up
at the National Glider Meet at Elmira,
New York, a few years back. He
wasn't hurt. The only crackup in
which he was injured was when he fell
off the Triangles lapping truck—that
time he broke a wrist. This last year,
Ed took the C. A. A. flying course and
received his pilot's license in June.
Ed has spent his summer months
mainly in industrious pursuits. Dur-
ing the past summer vacation, he
worked in Chicago and in Cheyenne,
Wyoming, as a junior engineer with the
United Airlines. Previous to that, he
sold advertising space in the City
Directory in Elsmere for three sum-
mers. In the summer between his
freshman and sophomore years he
drove out to California and back with
Jack Harwood. They made the "voy-
age" in an old flivver which gave them
many headaches, otherwise known as
"adventure," during the six weeks of
the trip. Incidentally, Ed and Jack
have been staunch pals ever since they
first dabbled in freshman politics to-
gether.
Just in case you haven't guessed it
by now, we might mention that Ed
King is enrolled in the Aeronautical
Engineering Department, expecting to
graduate next June at the age of 21^.
His plans for after graduation aren't
too settled, but he would like to go into
airlines operation or take a try at sales
engineering.
metallurgist
For a man who claims never to have
done anything spectacular during his
life, Prof. Richard Schneidewind has
led an existence of more than the usual
interest. Born in Manila, Philippine
Islands, on December 16, 1900, his
parentage includes pure German stock
on his father's side and ancestry of
Spanish origin on his mother's. While
he was still very young his parents
came to the United States and settled
in Detroit, in the vicinity of which he
has lived most of his life. Three uni-
versities claim him as an alumnus
Wayne, Chicago, and Michigan; how-
ever, his three degrees were all acquired
at the U. of M., where he is now an
assistant professor of Chemical and
Metallurgical Engineering.
The first example of our professor's
now famous modesty came to light when
he was attending the University of
Chicago. Because he was taking senior
chemistry courses, he became eligible
for a teaching fellowship in this de-
partment. After a university examiner
had completed a very comprehensive
test of Schneidewind's chemical knowl-
edge, he threw up his hands in despair
when he learned that his subject was
only eighteen years old. "What are
you doing here?", he demanded. And
the future Michigan professor could
not answer that question.
That twelve letter name has caused
him no end of trouble. For example,

trial experience, having worked with the

baker as an analytical and process con-
trol chemist. To learn more about
casting processes he spent one summer
working in a specialized foundry. As a
research engineer in the Department
of Engineering Research he devotes
the largest part of his time to work on
metallurgical problems and is well
known throughout the United States
for his work on the properties of mal-
leable cast iron. A few years ago in
his zeal for research he was seriously
affected by poisonous fumes while in-
vestigating methods of chromium plat-
ing and was forced to take an extended
vacation to recover. His latest project
is a new sintering process which has a
commercial application. The American
Society for Metals, American Foundry-
men's Association, and the American
Society for Testing Materials all keep
him busy on their various committees.
In addition, his name appears among
the members of Sigma Xi, Iota Alpha,
Alpha Chi Sigma, Phi Lamba Upsilon,
Vulcans, and Triangles.
Considering his modesty and vast
store of knowledge it is not surprising
that Prof. Schneidewind is one of the
most popular professors, especially
among the freshmen, whose under-
standing friend he is and always will be.

Look behind the scenes of most any
major campus event during the past

man with a black cigar. Penetrate the
heavy smoke and there is Charley
Heinen, a Broadway press agent dis-
guised as an engineer. But he can't
fool us. Anybody who can make this
sophisticated campus swallow the stuff
he has concocted from out the miasma
of that cigar has press agent's ink for
blood and bright lights going around
in his head.
Investigation of his origin reveals
that New York City was the scene of
his first publicity stunt—that of an-
nouncing his birthday by a series of
vociferous squalls. Before the Broad-
way stamp could be irrevocably ap-
plied, his father's business took the
family to Mexico, Germany, and va-
rious parts of the United States. His
father German, his mother Spanish,
Charley speaks both languages fluently.
He went to elementary school only
four years, skipping grades or being
tutored for the rest.
His devotion to things extra-curricu-
lar had its origin way back in high
school, where he played varsity foot-
ball, was sports editor of the paper and
yearbook, headed the German club and

People who edit or publish books are grad-
ually coming to understand that The Ann Arbor
Press offers the best service as well as the advice
and knowledge of book printing which make a
book look like a book.
It requires years of careful study and training
as well as painstaking selection of personnel to
fit a plant for the printing of good books. An
ordinary printing plant handling other forms of
printing may never reach the point where its pro-
duction of books can be called commendable.
Paper alone offers a vast field of careful study
and selection. A lifetime may be profitably spent
in the study of type faces. A pressman may
spend years before he can carefully prepare a
makeready. A proofreader is not "born" such,
but is "made" by years of hard work. Binding
is a profession by itself and is half the art of bcok-
making. Among Michigan printers it is The Ann

camera guns
The greatly increased speeds of
modern military aircraft have made
aerial gunnery increasingly difficult.
These difficulties are due not only to
the tremendous speeds at which both
target and firing platform are moving
but also to the intricate maneuvers in

which they participate. Because of
this our air service is resorting more
and more to the use of camera machine
guns for the training of pilots.
At the present time two types of
camera machine guns are in use, one
for fixed installation and the other for
movable installation. The movable
camera gun looks like a standard
Browning or Colt aircraft machine
gun. On the other hand the fixed
camera gun, although operated like
the ordinary fixed machine gun, bears
no resemblance to a real machine gun.
It is mounted above the wing near the
leading edge.
The camera is easily loaded with
film and its operation is extremely
easy. The camera starts to operate
as soon as the trigger is held down.
In the case of the movable gun the
pressure of the thumb controls the
camera while the fixed gun is oper-
ated by handgrip pressure on the trig-
ger switch attached to the airplane
control stick.
A rotary disk shutter is used and a
small glass engraved with concentric
circles is located between the shutter
and the focal plane. 16-millimeter film
is used and the film magazine has 25
feet or 700 exposures. The recording

the watch and data card at the instant
of exposure.
The use of these cameras in mock
combat has proved effective even at
high speeds.
snap rivet
A recent development in the world
of fasteners has given industry a
"bachelor's button" in the shape of the
snap rivet. This new invention is a
spring locking button and fastener
stud which may be substituted for the
present high speed nuts and screws.
Giving a finished appearance, the
fastener stud has a head and shank
like the average rivet except that the
shank is tapered toward the end and
finished with a number of parallel ring
grooves. The spring locking button,
which can be made in any shape
circular, rectangular, or diamond, is
made of thin sheet steel or alloy with
locking lugs extending inward from

Riveting's now a snap
opposite edges of the shell. These
locking lugs grip the rings on the
shank of the stud and are so designed
that the fastener will not loosen from
vibration.
drafting camera
A new process by which engineering
drawings can be reproduced photo-
graphically to any desired scale has
revolutionized drafting room procedure
at the Glenn L. Martin Company.
Chief advantage of the new process is
a tremendous saving in time which
has been a major factor in bringing
mass production methods to the con-
cern's factories.
A gargantuan camera is used to copy
drawings as produced by draftsmen.
After the negative has been developed,
the image is projected back onto a
sensitized aluminum sheet (any kind
of surface will do metal, wood, cloth,
or paper) in the exact scale required.
Thus drawings which formerly re-
quired days of redrafting can now be
reproduced in a few minutes to any
desired scale. There is a tremendous

imp,
Camera saves days and dollars
saving not only in time but also in
drafting costs. The Martin Company-
saved over 880,000 last year. Further-
more, the availability of numbers of
exact scale drawings leads to better
coordination and incomparable effi-
ciency in plant production. For mak-
ing scale models, the process is in-
valuable. A few twists on the camera
and any fractional scale can be ob-
tained, again saving weeks of redraft-
ing.
The whole process is applicable to
many other industries with correspond-
ing speeding up of engineering work.
By overcoming the bottleneck between
drawings and production, the new
process has provided us with an in-
valuable aid to industrial mass pro-
duction.

team and vice president of the Senior
Class. As a result of all this he was
graduated with the highest honors in
the history of the school.
Scorning the vapid life of a publicity
man, Charley went to work for Chrys-
ler in 1934 and entered the night school
of the Chrysler Institute in the De-
partment of Mechanical Engineering.
His work there did not go unnoticed,
for in 1938 he was awarded a S5,0()0
Walter P. Chrysler scholarship. So he
entered the University of Michigan as a
sophomore in Chemical Engineering
and quickly joined up with Sigma Rho
Tau, A. I. Ch. E. and the Union staff.
That Spring Triangles and Mimes
came a-tapping at his door.
During his Junior year he made
things hum around the Union as Co-
Chairman of the Activities Commit-
tee, pledged Sigma Alpha Epsilon, of
which he is now chapter secretary, and
served as SPT's Engineering Council
representative. With Spring came ap-
pointment as Secretary of the Union
and election to Vulcans and Michi-
gamua.
Remember the little dancing men of
'39's ice carnival? And the Silver King
of last year's, with his cartwheels for
those of us smart enough to follow the
trail? And especially "Lee Grant, '43."
Way back before Black Friday this
Grant was sending out bulletins to the
Freshmen, asking for a united Fresh-
man Class and casting aspersions on
the origin, character and strength of
the Sophomore Class. The antics of
this self appointed leader of '43 made
news every day. He tricked the Thetas
into having a tea in his honor. Finally,
after some irate sophomores had literal-
ly scalped a couple of freshmen while
looking for Grant, the news leaked
out—Lee Grant was really the lead in
the Union Opera and the whole episode
was a typical Heinen publicity stunt.
For diversion Charley plays tennis,
golf, and football and likes to read and
travel. At home (Royal Oak, Mich.)
he takes four newspapers and has even
read the telephone book. Claims it's
interesting, too! He is proud of his
little brother, who is a brain trust and
another Ty Cobb. When Little Brother
was two, Chuck knocked him out show-
ing him how to tackle. But Charley's
really a gentleman, though, and doesn't
make a habit of hitting babies.
classes are attended two years, from
September to June. The material and
instructions are provided by specialists
from the various departments, and
regular examinations are given, prob-
lems assigned, and notebooks graded.
During the third year the student pre-
pares a thesis on some subject in the
field of automotive engineering in
which he has had opportunity to make
personal observation and investigation.
Upon successful completion of the
course, the graduate is awarded the
degree of Master of Automotive En-
gineering, and may be assigned to a
department in the engineering division.
His record in the course and the evalu-
ation by the department heads to
whom he has been assigned are the
basis of judgment. During the three-
year period the student receives a
salary of adequate range, increased
during the second and third years.
The advantage to the student of
this institution is two-fold. It eases the
difficulties usually encountered in the
transition from the college atmosphere
to more realistic surroundings, per-
mitting a more gradual orientation. It
also provides him with advanced train-
ing along the lines of most practical
benefit to him, and enables him to de-
termine the kind of work he will find
most interesting and profitable. The
corporation benefits from the estab-
lishment of a reserve supply of young,
competent, and highly trained engi-
neers for future leaders of a finely built
and extremely complicated engineer-
ing organization.

cap night
It must have been about 40,000
years ago when a glacier did some face-
lifting around the spot where Ann
Arbor was to stand. As a result
Sleepy Hollow, the ravine back of the
University Hospital, was formed.
The first students of the University
failed to recognize the opportunity, and
it wasn't until the 1900's that the Hol-
low began to show signs of life. Ac-
cording to the Old Timers it was in
Sleepy Hollow that the freshman-soph-
more games were held. And it was in
Sleepy Hollow that the famous Cap
Nights were held. It was then that
the frosh of years ago would hurl their
badges of inferiority, their pots, into
the huge bonfires built in the center of
the hollow.
The Cap Nights, which came about
the middle of May, just after the class
games, were eagerly awaited not only
by freshmen but by everybody in the
University. At about 7 p.m. the parade
would start down North University
Avenue. First the seniors in caps and
gowns, followed by the juniors, sopho-
mores, and freshmen, in order. There
would be speeches by alumni, faculty
members, and students; music by the
Varsity Band; songs and cheers by
everybody. Then the frosh would be
informed that they were "now at the
end of the period of suspicion and at
the plane of toleration" and the pots
would be used as kindling, the crack-
ling of the flames drowned out by
cheers. Afterwards, the students would
snake-dance back up State Street and
around the Campus.
The Cap Nights were well attended.
Frequently the President was there,
and there were always several profes-
sors and a couple of deans to speak to
the gathered crowd. As many as 5,000
spectators watched the festivities. At
Cap Night the late Professor Wenley
of the Philosophy Department once
told the freshmen, "Everybody knows
that a philosopher does not know as
much as a sophomore and I congratu-
late you on having reached that plane."
The class games consisted chiefly of
the bag fights, relay races, and the
tug-of-war across the Huron. The bag
fights were the free-for-all of the day.
Equipped with short pieces of rope,
the frosh and sophs would go after
each other. Two or three members of
one class would try to "cut out" a
member of the other class, tie him up,
and take him to their "camp." The
class with the largest number of cap-
tives would emerge victorious. Not
infrequently ribs and even skulls were
cracked.
However, interest gradually waned,
and Sleepy Hollow has gone back to
sleep for many years. In fact, ore
walking there today might easily im-
agine himself in the Sleepy Hollow
Washington Irving made famous. But
who knows; it may be that some fresh-
man class of the future may again
awaken echoes in this natural amphi-
theatre, and Sleepy Hollow may again
ring with shouts reminiscent of former
student generations.
grand old man
This college year marks the end of
forty years of service to the University
of Michigan by Fielding H. Yost, the
Grand Old Man of Michigan. Leader
of the still-talked-of "point-a-minute
teams," he will retire next spring on
the advent of his seventieth birthday.
As a result Michigan alumni and
friends from all over the country are
already planning to come to the Yost
Testimonial Dinner on the evening of
October 18th. Originally planned by
the "M" Club, it has become the
activity of all alumni. The banquet
will be held after the Michigan-Illinois
football game. To accommodate those
who would like to pay their respects to
Coach Yost the banquet hall will be
in Waterman Gymnasium.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Last spring two lions wandered onto
the campus and took possession of the
entrance to the University museum.
However, their coming didn't arouse
the interest that their living incarna-
tions would have received, for these
two are "here to stay" in the form of
black terrazzo.
When the University Museum was
first built the Director, then Dr. Alex-
ander G. Ruthven, visioned the plac-
ing of two sculptured animals on the
tively accurate model measurements
were taken and amplified to full size.
A figure of wood, wire and plaster of
Paris was constructed. An inch of clay
was applied to this frame and the
modeling finished. As the model was
light, it was taken to the Museum en-
trance to study the flow of line and
distribution of light and shadow.
After the modeling of the lion had
been completed, a reinforced plaster of
Paris mold was made over it; into this
mold the terrazzo was firmly tamped
and allowed to harden. After a few

These symbols of courage guard the museum
plinths at either side of the entrance.
The African lion was naturally men-
tioned in the discussion of which ani-
mal should be used for this purpose.
However, it was felt that an American
animal might be found possessing
equally fine qualifications. Finally,
after exploring nearly the whole mam-
mal range of North America, it was
discovered that the Puma was a native
of Michigan. Almost extinct, the Puma
is a most colorful member of the cat
family. Alert and defiant in certain
situations; reserved, dignified, and
solemn in repose; aggressive when
aroused to anger, he displays many
qualities of character frequently ad-
mired in man himself.
After the selection, a small scale
model of the plinth and part of the
building was built in clay, after which
the lion was modeled in position and
of proportions to conform to its im-
mediate surroundings. From this rela-
days the plaster of Paris mold was re-
moved and the work of grinding down
the surface of the terrazzo was begun.
It took two or more men several weeks
to accomplish this. After completion
the lions were taken to the Museum
where they now stand guarding the
doors of that building.

AND/OR RESEARCH
SPEAKING before the summer con-
vention of the A. I. E. E. in
Swampscott, Massachusetts, Lawrence
A. Hawkins, executive engineer of the
General Electric research laboratory in
ing that rose in its might and destroyed
these monsters."
Mr. Hawkins is not clear on how
we can rise in our might and destroy
these monsters without actually wag-
.... j ...

. preparation for any eventuality
Schenectady, declared that "the fasci-
nating search for truth for its own sake
must be temporarily abandoned and
thought and effort concentrated on the
problems of military preparedness."
He further urged inclusion of en-
gineering and research scientists in the
nation's defense program and main-
tained that since the Nazi juggernaut
was created by engineering, it is only
by engineering that it can be destroyed.
Continuing: "We, who are proud of
our profession, cannot suffer that fu-
ture historians shall say that it was
engineering that caused the blackout
of liberty. Rather let it be said that,
when engineering tools in the hands of
brutal despots threatened the liberties
of the world, it was American engineer-
ing an offensive war on foreign soil.
Regardless of what the American en-
gineer may do, the fact still remains
that engineering methods and develop-
ments, turned in a military direction,
resulted in the annihilating German
juggernaut. And now it is generally
conceded that the logical course is to
devote American engineering talent to
preparation for any eventuality. But
this does not require even temporary
abandonment of "pure" research.
"Pure" research is the name given
research carried on for the sake of
finding facts. Someone else years later
may find practical uses for the dis-
coveries so obtained. This form, popu-
lar before World War I, has since been
largely replaced by the opposite type—
research which starts from a particular
application and works toward an in-
vention. There are very few companies
in this country which sponsor pure re-
search. Those that do maintain fellow-
ships in universities, or else employ a
staff and facilities of their own. Its
unpopularity is due to the unwilling-
ness of industry to expend large
amounts on research not likely to re-
sult in immediate dividends.
The research facilities of this country
are, as a result of the years of emphasis
on "directed" research, well prepared
to turn to fact finding of a military
nature. Much has been accomplished
along these lines during the past few
months. Much more remains to be
done. But the results of such efforts
to the exclusion of all others can be
seen abroad—the exchange of cultural
and humanitarian objectives for virtual
barbarity.
The value of pure research has often
been proven. It accumulates a vast
amount of facts, most of which is made
available by public and private publi-
cation. The discoveries, accidental or
incidental to pure research, are num-
bered among our most important. The
"fascinating search for truth for its
own sake" is an essential part of prog-
ress.
We agree with Mr. Hawkins that
there should be more concentration on
obtaining effective coordination and
use of our industrial resources, both of
materials and of minds, to the end of
complete American sufficiency and pre-
paredness. Faced with this problem
on the one hand, and with the one of
retaining its position as a progressive
leader in every field on the other, the
United States will have to devote en-
ergy to both types of research. There is
room and facilities for both; they can
and should go on simultaneously.

. . iii mi exploratory boring . . . . for measuring the shear,strength . .
Did you ever stop to think how much
you depend on the engineer?
It is of interest to note the increasing applications of the principles of the shear-
ing resistance of soils for determining the bearing strength of soils under existing or
contemplated foundations for structures of appreciable magnitude. Through the use
of a special type of sampler for obtaining undisturbed samples in an exploratory boring,
and a small testing cylinder for measuring the shear strength of the soil, positive design
values are secured with a minimum of effort, time, and expense. From these design
values it is possible to determine accurately the type of foundations essential to the
proper support of the structure to be erected, or the changes necessary in existing
foundations, so that new or additional loads may be safely supported. Technique and
equipment for this type of research investigation have been developed in the Soil
Mechanics Laboratory of the Civil Engineering Department at the University of
Michigan. The Civil Engineering Department is also engaged in other phases of re-
search including model testing of indeterminate structures, analysis of wind pressures
on various types of structures, and on problems relating to hydrology, sanitary engi-
neering and transportation.

SUICIDE LAMPS
ID you ever take up a newspaper and read that someone
committed suicide by jumping off a bridge? That's
what high-intensity street lamps have been doing, too—not
jumping off bridges, but committing " suicide."
Certain smooth-surface street-light reflectors reflect heat
back to the lamp filament, thus raising the filament tempera-
ture to the point ot early "suicide" or burnout.
In an attempt to do something about this, G-E engineers
developed the stepped reflector. The inner surface of the
reflector is broken up into small steps in such a way that light
and heat rays reflected back from the steps just miss the vital
lamp stem. Tests showed that, with a 500-watt lamp, the
temperature at the lamp stem was 275 F less with the new
reflector than with the old one.
The engineers who developed the stepped reflector are
graduates of the General Electric Test Course, open to selected
graduates ot recognized engineering schools.

CHASING SHADOWS
HOW would you like to see carbon dioxide pour out of
a beaker and snuff out the flame of a candle, or cold
water from floating ice flow to the bottom of a glass? By
accident two General Electric scientists recently discovered
a comparatively simple way to force these and other ordinarily
invisible things to show themselves.
It all began one day when a searchlight shining through the
windows ot the G-E Research Laboratory at Schenectady ,
N. Y. started the scientists on an investigation, resulting in
I

J
equipment which gives the inside story of supposedly
visible happenings.
By holding transparent substances in a beam ot light from
water-cooled mercury lamp, variations caused by changes
the index of refraction show up plainly on a screen. It's
something like seeing heat waves rise from a hot pavement
in the summer. Gases, liquids, or transparent solids cast
strange shadows, revealing characteristics unseen to the
naked eye. Although this has been done before with arc
lights, the new method has many advantages.

The two G-E scientists identified with this accomplishment
are Dr. R. P. Johnson, U. of Richmond, '29, and Dr. N. T.
Gordon, Princeton, '13.

PISCATORIAL UTOPIA
NSECT laboratories have been air conditioned, rivets
for dirigibles have been refrigerated so they can be driven
better, and there is even a case where telephone books have
been cooled mechanically to speed the hardening of the glue.
But it was only recently that the first automatic heating
installation designed specifically for the comfort and health
ot tropical fish was put into operation.
Devilfish, sharks, rays, the only porpoises in captivity, and
thousands of other unusual specimens caper gaily around in
their adopted home in the Marine Studios at Marineland, Fla.
There, in huge tanks, the pampered fish live the "life of
Reilly" (the porpoises are fed by hand) in water that is not
only filtered and aerated but is also held at a temperature of
70 F.
Five General Electric oil furnaces do the heating job, holding
the ?oo,ooo-gailon "oceanarium" at a temperature just like
home for the transplanted tropical specimens.
At G.E.'s Bloomfield (N. J.) plant, where air conditioning
equipment is manufactured, is a division ot the General
Electric Test Course. Here young student engineers gain
practical experience in this branch of engineering.

There are two kinds of deferred maintenance on heavy
duty equipment. One is simply that the operator has
a way oi letting things go until major, and expensive,
repairs are unavoidable. The other is due to the in-
herent ability oi the machine to run for long periods
without requiring maintenance.
Manufacturers reduce the effects of operating wear
and tear by building modern materials into their ma-
chines at vital spots. Thus, for example, a builder of
heavy duty material handling equipment for mines
uses Nickel-Molybdenum (SAE 4640) steel for the all-
important drive gears.
The steel can be oil quenched and drawn to produce
a hardness from 400-450 BHN combined with excellent
strength and toughness. Thanks to the combination,
the gears operate for years under all sorts of adverse
conditions.
Practical data on 4640 and other Molybdenum steels
are given in our book, "Molybdenum in Steel," sent to
interested technical students free on request.

A Metallurgical Analysis
In 6 Minutes

The spectrochemical laboratory at the
Rouge plant of the Ford Motor Company
provides an outstanding example of what
can be accomplished through the co-opera-
tion of university laboratories in the solu-
tion of industrial problems. Designed in the
markedly superior to the post-mortem in-
spection analysis to which slow analytical
methods are limited.
Statistical studies of the reproducibility
of results achieved show a probable error of
analysis not exceeding one per cent of the
for the elements Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni etc.
University of Michigan's Department of
Physics and constructed jointly by the com-
pany and the University, this laboratory
has, since its completion over a year ago,
performed faithfully the task of routine
analysis for the composition control of
foundry metals for the elements chromium,
copper, manganese, molybdenum, nickel,
silicon and tungsten.
The spectroscopic technique employed
permits the analysis of a sample to be com-
pleted within an elapsed time of six minutes
after receipt, thus providing a production
control of composition drifts whose utility
for a continuous pouring technique is
content. Such accuracy compares very fa-
vorably with that provided by a good chemi-
cal laboratory. Eleven men, in three shifts,
analyze over eight hundred samples per day
for any or all of the elements mentioned
above in accordance with control require-
ments; personnel and material costs are
moderate.
This is the result of one of the many
researches carried on through the De-
partment of Engineering Research, and is
illustrative of what can be done in the de-
veloping and perfecting of new techniques
in industrial fields. May we assist you in
your problems?

electrical power.
FROM ARC LIGHTS 01
By
BENJAMIN F. BAILEY
Chairman of the Department
of Electrical Engineering
DURING my lifetime a giant new
force has come into the world. To
say that electricity has revolutionized
the conditions under which we live is
putting it mildly. Largely because of
electricity, the world has changed more
in the last 60 years than in the previous
60,000. Only those of us who were alive
in, say, 1880 have any real conception
of what has taken place. The young
engineer may try to imagine a world
without electric light and power, with-
out telephones, radio, street cars, auto-
mobiles and all the manifold comforts
and conveniences we take for granted,
but I doubt very much if he can suc-
ceed. We live in a brighter, better, hap-
pier world because of engineering and
its foundation sciences, physics and
chemistry. In this revolution electrical
engineering has played an important
part.
About 1880 there was considerable
excitement in the city of Detroit—the
first electric lights were to be turned
on. I remember faintly being taken to
Cass Park to see the event. Presently
someone threw a switch and three old
time carbon arc lights burst into full
glory. No one in the large crowd had
ever seen anything like it before and
doubtless many hailed it as the begin-
ning of a new era, as it of course was.
It was the beginning of the electrical
age for this part of the world. Of course
the telegraph was old even at that time,
and the telephone was just starting the
marvelous development which has made
it possible for me, without leaving my
home, to talk with practically any part
of the civilized world. Incandescent
lighting was just in its birth pangs and
the electric street car was only the
dream of a few crazy inventors.
Electric arc lights operating on the
constant current system were just com-
ing into use- In this system the current
was usually 9.6 amperes with about 50
volts applied across each arc, the volt-
age on the entire circuit varying from
nearly zero if no arcs were lighted to a
maximum of about 5000 if 100 arcs
were turned on. Since an electric arc is
inherently unstable, that is (believe it or
not) the voltage needed becomes less as
the current increases, it was enormously
difficult to devise a simple and workable
system. One of our own graduates,
Charles F. Brush, had more to do with
the successful development of arc light-
ing than anyone else. His solution was
to use a series wound generator operated
on the unstable part of its characteristic
to offset the unstable operation of the
arc, a brilliant conception and one
which worked very well.
For the three or four years preceding
1880 a young inventor, Thomas A.
Edison, had been feverishly working on
the problems of incandescent lighting.
The first stumbling block was the so-
called "subdivision of the electric light."
This sounds silly now but it was a seri-
ous problem then and several eminent
scientists in England declared that it
could not be solved. It was easy to see
how a single incandescent lamp could
be operated from a generator (assuming
that it was possible to devise a workable
incandescent lamp) but how would it
be possible to arrange matters so that
any number of lamps from one to the
maximum capacity of the system could
be burned, and the turning on or off of
any number of them would not change
the brilliancy of the rest. Edison pro-
posed several schemes but the simplest
is the one which succeeded and is still

in parallel and feed the system by means
of a shunt or compound wound gen-
erator, driven at approximately con-
stant speed.
The development of the incandescent
lamp alone was enough to give any man
immortality. The difficulty was to find
a suitable material for the filament.
After an unbelievable amount of labor a
fiber of bamboo was found to give a
filament which would burn for 50 hours
was an incandescent lamp. If it looked
about right it was assumed that the
other lights would be satisfactory. The
first ammeter was of the "hot wire"
type. If the wires got so hot they
smelled, the current was too great. It
was a year or two before Edison and
his associates got time to invent and
build accurate instruments.
One serious difficulty was the lack of
any way to measure the energy used by
the customer. Edison's first meter was

These Armington and Sims steam engines,
under the watchful eye of Henry Ford, drove . . .
and the problem was solved for the time
being although of course the lamp has
been tremendously improved since that
time. As soon as the Edison System was
put into operation the doom of the con-
stant current arc lighting system was
sounded, although it managed to sur-
vive for a few years.
On September 3rd, 1882, the Pearl
Street station was opened in New York
and a new era was born. For the first
time in the history of the world, power
and light were available by throwing a
switch. Edison had succeeded in spite
of difficulties which even today seem
appalling. He had to design and build
generators far larger than any pro-
duced up to that time. He took a bold
step when he connected his generators
directly to the engine shaft, thus elimi-
nating the belt. He was forced by the
terms of his franchise to put his con-
ductors underground and had to invent,
design and manufacture underground
cables. Perhaps that seems easy but try
to do it even in the light of our present
day knowledge. Edison could not order
a switch from a catalogue; he had to
design and build it. There were no
commercial voltmeters or ammeters
upon the market. His first voltmeter
an electrolytic cell with two zinc plates
in zinc sulphate. The plates were re-
moved and weighed at proper intervals
and the customer's bill computed from
the gain or loss in weight. Fortunately
Elihu Thompson quickly invented a
meter much like those we use today and
it soon superseded the messy electrolytic
cell.
For a time it looked as if the law of
squares would strangle the new born
infant before it got into short pants.
The trouble was that if Smith lived a
quarter mile from the station and Jones
lived a half mile away, not only were
the wires to supply Jones twice as long
as those for Smith but if the two men
were to receive equal service the wires
would have to be of double the cross
section, and would consequently weigh
four times as much. Obviously this lim-
ited seriously the area which a station
could supply. Edison furnished a bril-
liant solution; the three wire system. It
was very simple: he merely connected
two generators in series and used three
wires, one to the wire connecting the
two machines and one to each of the
remaining terminals. This immediately
increased four fold the area which could
be supplied from a single station and
made the system commercially success-
ful.
The system as above described re-
mained the standard for Edison stations
until the early part of the century, and
other stations were quickly started in
most of the large cities. After my grad-
uation in 1898 I was fortunate enough
to get a job with the Detroit Illuminat-
ing Company, now the Detroit Edison
Company. The plant had been in op-
eration since 1886 and had grown to
what seemed a great size. It was situ-
ated in a brick building on Washington
Boulevard just back of the present site
of the Book-Cadillac Hotel. The boil-
ers and engines were located on the
ground floor and the generators on the
second floor were driven by belts pass-
ing through slots in the floor. All the
generators were of the Edison bi-polar
type, exactly like the one we have in
the laboratory but larger. They were
operated in pairs, each engine driving
two generators. As I remember it, six
of these were (for that time) very
large, developing 150 kw each. There
were a few smaller dynamos, some
being rated at only 30 kw. The total
capacity was about 1500 kw. In the
forty years which have passed since
then the system has grown beyond any
dreams we had at that time. The total
installed capacity is now in excess of
1,000,000 kw and the generators are
mostly of 50,000 kw or larger. Of
course the city has grown but not in any
such ratio as this.
The boilers in the Edison plant were
made by Root and the engines were
built by Armington and Sims. The
largest engines which drove two 150 kw
generators each developed about 400 hp.
Most of the engines were single expan-
sion, condensing, but at least one of
them was rebuilt as a compound engine
while I was there. Shortly after I got
my job with the company the first
direct connected unit was installed. It
consisted of two 250 kw generators
directly connected to a compound en-
gine. The generators had ring wound
armatures and the commutator bars
formed part of the winding, the brushes
making contact from the side.
At this time George Cato, whom I
had known since I was a boy, was in
charge of the dynamo room and the
boss of the engine room was a young
fellow named Henry Ford. He was
rather young for such a responsible job,
being about 35 at the time, but he was
highly respected both personally and for
8
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


many hours on jobs with him and I
never saw a better mechanic. However,
as subsequent events have shown he was
far more than this. He was already at
work on his first automobile and I
heard some vague rumors about it, but,
I am sorry to say, paid little attention.
My hours were from 7 in the morning
until 6 at night with one hour out for
lunch, in other words 60 hours per
week. I am faintly amused when some
people think 40 hours per week is too
much, although I have no desire to go
back to the "good old days" of long
hours and small pay. My salary was
$4.00 per week and probably it was all
I was worth. My principal duty was to
help the man who had charge of clean-
ing the arc lamps. These were of the
constant potential, enclosed type and
had to be cleaned and adjusted at regu-
lar intervals.
Shortly after I succeeded in making
a connection with the pay roll, the Edi-
son Company bought out the Peninsular
Company. Its principal plant operated
arc light circuits and also supplied
single-phase power to the outlying dis-
tricts. I do not remember much about
this plant but I have at least one vivid
recollection. In order to avoid shutting
down one of the arc light generators the
attendant would occasionally grasp a
plug in the switchboard and run as
though the devil were after him, draw-
ing a wicked arc about ten feet long.
The length is estimated; no one tried
to measure it.
At this time we were deep in the
"battle of the systems." On the one
hand we had the direct current system
as invented by Edison and developed by
the General Electric Company and on
the other hand the alternating current
system as developed by Westinghouse.
The direct current system necessarily
operated on a low voltage, about 250
volts with the three wire connection. It
was impossible to use more since incan-
descent lamps operated best on a volt-
age not over 125. This made it impos-
sible to transmit the current economi-
cally any great distance on account of
the great cost of copper. The direct
current system had however a great ad-
vantage in that motors could be oper-
ated on it. The great advantage of the
alternating current system was (and is)
that a current of low voltage and large
amperage could be changed to one of
high voltage and low current by an in-
expensive and highly efficient trans-
former. It could be sent great dis-
tances at high voltage and readily
stepped down at the point where it was
to be used. On the other hand, there
were at that time no motors which
would work on single-phase current. The
war between the rival systems aroused
bitter feelings which we find difficult
to understand today. Edison was in-
discreet enough to put in writing his be-
lief that the alternating current system
would never be successful. There was
great rejoicing in the dc camp when
New York passed an electrocution law
specifying the use of the alternating
current, as a great deal had been said
about the deadly effect of the ac.
Nevertheless, the ac continued to gain
and was used almost exclusively in small
towns where the load density was small.
The dc continued to hold the fort in
the business districts of large cities,
largely because elevators could be oper-
ated on dc but not, at that time, on ac.
Even today this condition still exists
though there is a continual tendency to
displace the dc with ac.
About the year 1900 a new develop-
ment began to make itself felt. About
10 years earlier Nicola Tesla (who I am
no brushes, and is of course much sim-
pler, cheaper, and more reliable than
the dc motor. For most purposes except
transportation (either horizontal or ver-
tical) it is far superior; so much so,
that there are today about 10 ac motors
to one dc motor.
Tesla also invented the polyphase
synchronous motor. By using a rotor
with projecting poles wound with coils
of wire, and exciting these coils with
direct current passed in through slip
rings, the motor no longer slipped be-
hind the rotating magnetic field but
"locked" with it and revolved at a con-
stant speed no matter what the load
(provided it was not great enough to
stop the motor entirely). Even with no
direct current in the field the motor will
carry a small load; and millions of such
motors are used today in electric clocks.
It may surprise you to know that the
electric clock was invented and used in
Cologne, Germany, as early as 1896.
For various reasons it was unsuccess-
ful and dropped out of use for many
years, another invention ahead of its
time.
One valuable feature of the syn-

. . . these 50kw Edison bi-polar dynamos at the
plant of the Detroit Illuminating Company in 1898
glad to say is still with us) had an-
nounced his revolutionary invention of
the polyphase system in which three
wires are used to carry three currents
120 degrees out of phase with one an-
other. By passing these three currents
through three stationary windings a
rotating magnetic field could be pro-
duced and an armature or rotor, wound
only with short circuited turns of wire,
would be dragged around nearly as fast
as the field. This is the polyphase in-
duction motor practically as we have it
today. It has no commutator, usually
chronous motor is the fact that if the
field is over excited the motor will take
a leading current. Tesla knew this and
claimed it in one of his patent applica-
tions. It is said that the patent examiner
at first rejected this claim on the appar-
ently logical grounds that the emf caused
the current to flow and that the effect
could not possibly precede the cause. I
do not vouch for this, but it is a good
yarn anyway.
Polyphase generators and motors were
built and shown at the Chicago World's

able, most vital import.
TIRES AND WAR
By
CHARLES R. TIEMAN, '41 E
WE HAVE been told that Germany
and her Allies are at war with the
British empire, while Japan is still sup-
pressing those marauding bandits on
the "border," and looking toward the
East Indies with gluttonous eyes. What
the future will bring, not even Stalin
knows. But we, the United States, are
vitally concerned with the foreign wars,
particularly those battles of the far
East, for the East Indies produce 98%
of all raw rubber that the United States
utilizes, a large share of all that the
entire world uses. So, if Japan or some
other great power were to blockade
those islands completely, we would be
in an unfortunate situation with respect
to our rubber supply. Loose talkers are
infuriated by the supposition that we
would be totally without supply of rub-
ber within three months. They speak
from their easy chairs or soap boxes
proclaiming the inadequacy of the for-
eign policy or the deuced snail-pace that
congress is supposed to be maintaining.
Similarly, other loose talkers claim
miracles for the great production of syn-
thetic rubbers which is progressing. Such
loose talkers say the job is simple. Just
make tires, boots, gloves — all rubber
articles—of synthetic rubber. This is
possible, of course, but only within re-
strictions; the idea must be treated with
consideration.
The United States annually consumes
approximately 600,000 tons of raw rub-
ber which must be shipped a precarious
12,000 miles from the far East. The
production of artificial rubber in the last
year, on the other hand, amounted to
about 1700 long tons. Experts say that
a period of about two years of highly
concentrated effort would be required in
order to transpose those figures. Such
transposition would require an invest-
ment of from 100 million to 200 million
dollars—about the price of one or two
good battleships. To go to work immedi-
ately and invest such sums in rubber
production would be an untimely action,
for the national defense is dependent
upon the production of other things as
well as rubber. In addition, the rate of
obsolescence of the necessary chemical
plants would be extremely rapid.
The production of the artificial rub-
bers can be considered only as a second
line of defense because of the time re-
quired to get into full production. The
first line of defense is the natural rubber
reserve on hand and the inventories of
rubber goods already produced. There
has been much speculation on the use of
South American production, on wild
rubber, and on the Mexican guayule
shrub. Unfortunately, all these sources
put together would be of no practical
importance even though they were de-
veloped for two years. The rubber
stores include, as of June, 1940, some
270,000 tons of raw stock and finished
goods, 20,000 tons still on the ocean and
20,000 tons laid up on the national-de-
fense stock pile by a barter with Great
Britain. In addition, there is to be con-
sidered reclaimable rubber which ac-
counts for 30% of the industry's total
volume of sales. Without stretching, this
store of rubber can be used to last this
country for about one year. In case of
a national emergency—complete block-
ade of the source in the far East—this
store could be made to last about two
years. For instance, more rubber arti-
cles could be reclaimed, probably up to
60% of the total volume; rubber non-
essentials could be omitted from the
catalogue. Within a two-year period,
the productive facilities of synthetics
would have to be enlarged.
The first line of defense of the rubber
industry will have been set up when in-
dustry and public alike have been edu-
cated to use what they have, and com-
plete plans for future increased produc-
tion of artificial rubber have been
made.
Rubber is a great commodity. The
American public rolls on rubber, sleeps
on rubber, and walks on rubber. In
most of its applications, from battery
casings to raincoats, the garden variety
of natural rubber is unsurpassed by the
artificial, or popularly termed, synthetic
rubber. However, there are three weak-
nesses that the natural product has that
are apparently inherent: loss of strength
in sunlight, deterioration at high tem-
peratures and with age, and swelling
or weakening in gasoline or oil.
Most chemical engineers shudder and
groan over the term "synthetic rubber,"
for the laboratory born products are not
true replicas of the East Indies juices.
The term "elastomer" is preferred in
the chemical industry. Early chemists
produced the basic starting point for
the production of elastomers which is
isoprene, or methyl butadiene, C,HS.
Isoprene looked very well on paper, but
it did not work at all as rubber. Then
came the dawn. The chemical composi-
tion which had been written on the
10
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


laboratory manual was not so important
as the way in which the small molecules
polymerized or combined with them-
selves to form giant molecules.
The elastomers, in general, give a
product about three to five times as ex-
pensive as the orthodox rubber; they
resist age, sunlight, heat, and oil better
than the natural product, while some
have less bounce, and less wearing qual-
ity. One serious drawback of the
elastomers is their higher hysteresis
losses. That is, if a rubber specimen is
stressed, the elastic energy absorbed is
partly given back in rebound and partly
absorbed in heat. For example, a rub-
ber tire bouncing along a road absorbs
shock energy. Part of the energy is
given back in rebound, and part is ab-
sorbed by the rubber in heat. Such loss
in heat is the hysteresis loss. All elas-
tomers absorb more energy to heat than
rubber; hence, tires that support heavy
loads such as artillery, will be seriously
affected, although passenger car tires
would be in no danger. Some people
claim that, as far as consumers are con-
cerned, the defect is not serious since
more experience in fabricating artificial
rubber will yield the knowledge required
to overcome the defect.
The E. I. du Pont de Nemours Com-
pany has put out the only synthetic in
a sizable commercial production. The
company calls its development neo-
prene. The history of neoprene is long,
reaching back as far as 1922 when
acetylene was used to give a basic sub-
stance called divinylacetylene for the
attempt of duplicating rubber.
Later, Dr. Wallace H. Carothers, of
nylon fame, treated monovinylacetylene
with hydrochloric acid to give chloro-
prene. Chloroprene polymerized beauti-
fully under heat and pressure to form a
material somewhat resembling crude
rubber. It differed from isoprene by
having one atom of chlorine in lieu of
one methyl group.
Mechanically, the substance proved
to be equal to rubber in tensile
strength, elasticity, and abrasion resist-
ance, but inferior in shear, and superior
in resistance to age, heat, light, gases,
and oils. Its one big objectionable qual-
ity was a strong acetylene odor. How-
ever it was placed on the market in
1931 under the trade name of Du Prene.
As is typical of most new develop-
ments in the chemical industry, the
product went from laboratory to pilot
plant, back to laboratory, and repeated
the cycle many times. Production and
processing equipment in the pilot plant
would be almost obsolete by the time it
was built.
Neoprene made its debut to the
commercial world in 1937 as a develop-
ment of Du Prene. The advantage of
the new product was its lack of odor.
The price was reduced gradually from
$1.05 to $0.65 per pound. Neoprene
has worked itself into almost all varie-
ties of normal rubber production but
only in minuscule volume. It sells espe-
cially well where it is to come into con-
tact with oil or gasoline; hence, it is
mainly used for gaskets, cable insulation
for machinery, and gasoline hose.
Production is now measured in
pounds, but plans are being completed
for a new $2,000,000 plant which will
have a capacity of 1,000,000 pounds per

rubber tires. Buna, butadiene, isoprene,
or methyl butadiene, whichever you
wish to call it, is the natural building
block for rubber. Butadiene can be de-
rived from almost any vegetable matter
such as molasses, grains, scrap wood, or
potatoes. It may be had from coal
through the coal tars, from the reaction
of coal with limestone, from calcium
carbide reacting with acetylene, from
crude petroleum, natural gas, turpen-
tine, or oil refinery gas. Isoprene is a
gas at room temperature, a liquid at 32
degrees F.
Nazi chemical engineers discovered
that by using sodium metal, isoprene
would polymerize in several days. The
Buna rubber was obtained by sealing
isoprene into tubes with a small amount
of sodium wire. The mixture, kept at
60 degrees F. for several days, polymer-
ized to some extent; then the Buna rub-
ber was precipitated out by the addition
of acetone. The process produced a

LUBRICATION: SCIENCE
By
ARTHUR W. C. DOBSON, '42E
THE wheels of industry revolve on
oil. Obvious, you say? But consider
that two leading authorities on lubrica-
tion have said, in effect, that half of
the world's power is wasted in over-
coming the friction of lubricated sur-
faces. Although there has been con-
stant improvement in lubrication tech-
niques, it must not be forgotten that a
majority of power is consumed in over
age and relatively inefficient plants,
ships, and locomotives which use a large
part of their power to overcome
friction.
If, now, we give proper thought to
this fact, we see that the correct lubri-
cation of engines and machinery is a
problem of great importance, and one
which must be solved by men who are
capable of meeting the challenge it
presents—not only to men of ingenuity,
but also to those with ability to organ-
ize new projects and overcome the in-
ertia of established, incorrect practices.
Much progress has been made since
the days when the engineer merely had
to squirt oil into a few holes now and
then. This is appreciated when we
realize that in the properly designed
automatic lubricating system in one of
the largest public service plants in the
country, generating 30,000,000 kilowatt
hours of electric energy each month, the
total amount of oil consumed for all the
main generating units and their aux-
iliaries amounted to only 300 gal. per
month, or one gallon per hundred thou-
sand kilowatt hours.
Such economy is possible because
exact, correct lubrication details were
written into the specifications. These
details are based on research and ex-
haustive performance tests. An out-
standing example of such research will
be described later.
In cylinder lubrication of steam en-
gines, the oil must be carried to the
rubbing surfaces along with the steam
that drives the engine. This situation
immediately introduces two problems:
first, how to get oil into the steam line
and, second, how to recover it after it
has passed out of the exhaust. The first
has been very nicely solved by the use
of hydrostatic lubricators. However, we
have not as yet any good commercial
method for separating the oil from the
exhaust steam or condensate and ren-
dering it again suitable for lubricating
purposes in cylinders. Therefore, in
order to avoid waste, it is vital that
we get the most lubrication out of the
least oil.

automatic feature is essential, and the
crux of the whole system is the oil
filter. Oil, carrying with it pieces of
metal and dirt and entrained water, is
almost as bad as no oil at all. All the
parts in the system, functioning auto-
matically, should combine to produce
streams of clean, cool oil supplied con-
tinously at just the points where
needed.
Keeping this in mind, let us see how
lubrication research is carried out. In
a bulletin published by the Engineering
Experiment Station at Annapolis, Mary-
land, an exhaustive study of lubrication
of all types is reported. The station
has printed a complete list of the best
lubricants to use, winter and summer,
in all the different parts of all cars,
tractors, marine engines, refrigerating
machinery, and in all kinds of engines
and special bearings. The experiment
station has also developed a numbering
system for classifying oil, similar to the
S.A.E. numbers for classifying steel.
A four digit symbol is used, the first
digit indicating the class of oil, and the
last three the viscosity. Viscosity at
130;F is used for numbers 1 and 2,
and viscosity at 210 F for the rest. The
first digit indicates the class, as follows:
1 Refrigeration oils
2 Forced-feed oils
3 Forced-feed aviation oils
4 Compounded marine engine oils
5 Mineral marine engine and cylin-
der oils
6 Compounded steam cylinder oils
(tallow)
7 Compounded steam cylinder oils
(lard or tallow)
8 Compounded air cylinder oils
For example, 2135 is a forced-feed oil
having a viscosity of approximately 135
seconds at 130 F, 3080 is a forced-feed
aviation oil having a viscosity of 80
seconds at 210 F, and 4065 is a com-
pounded marine oil having a viscosity of
65 seconds at 210° F.
The following table shows the fa-
miliar S.A.E. number and the corre-
sponding Navy Symbol number:
S.A.E. No. Navy Symbol No.
10 2110
20 2135
30 2190
40 2250
50 3080
50 3100
60 3120
70 3150
To compare each of these oils with
every other, on an absolute basis, the
station has also developed an endurance
test, made on a machine designed espe-
cially for the purpose. The apparatus
consists of a journal revolving in a
split bearing, the upper half of which
is forced down by adjustable springs.
There are thermometers recording feed
oil and bearing temperatures, and a
gauge measuring the oil film pressure
in the bearing. A 3.5 hp. calibrated
and metered electric motor drives the
journal, while a separate motor pumps
the oil in continuous circulation. The
journal speed is kept at 2000 rpm, and
the oil film pressure at 150 psi by the
springs, as the test is run continuously
for 100 hours.
This led to a determination of what
is called work factor, which is a measure
of the oil's ability to resist deterioration
under the conditions of the above test.
Work values are assigned, based on
increases in viscosity, neutralization
number, and the carbon residue during
the 100 hour test in the following man-
ner:
Viscosity of the oil before and after
the test is determined at three tem-
peratures, and if it increases more than
a certain per cent, the oil is not ac-
cepted. Reducing the increase in vis-
cosity to a work-value basis, a zero in-
crease is represented by a value of* 1.0,
and an increase between zero and 20'v
or 25f/i, depending on the oil, is repre-
sented by some value less than 1.0.
The following formula is used to com-
pute the work values of increase in
viscosity at each temperature:
Work Value = 1.0 —C X
T Final viscosity — Initial viscosity "I
L Initial viscosity J
where C = 5 for symbols 1075 and
2120 to 2250 inclusive.
C = 4 for symbols 3080 to
3150 inclusive and for
5150 and 5190.
Neutralization number and carbon
residue are each determined before and
after the test, and must not exceed cer-
tain designated values for each oil.
Thus an accurate, quantitative meas-
ure of the lubricating value of the oil
is arrived at, independently of the kind
of machine in which it is to be used.
The solution of the problem of provid-
ing the best possible correct lubrication
for various engines and machines,
which, we have seen, is vitally essential
to a world of dynamic power, is now in
sight.
Armed with data from this test, and
the list that represents the Engineering
Experiment Station's conclusions, a
lubricating engineer should have no dif-
ficulty in providing his plant with an
efficient, automatic, and economical
lubricating system.

among the five members of the Yale
Flying Club when, in 1911, they came
into the possession of their first plane,
an even-then antique Curtiss biplane.
Soon someone had an inspiration—why
not stage an air meet at Yale Field and
charge a small admission fee to swell
the club's coffers? The results were a
capacity crowd and . . . five thousand
dollars in gate receipts. Without further
delay, the tired aviators retired to a
hotel bedroom to relax, spread the
$5,000 on the bed, and split it five ways,
thereafter forgetting the flying club and
aviation.
But collegiate flying, begun only the
year before at Harvard, where jumpy
motion pictures of the Wright Brothers
and the early French experimenters
were shown, was not through. In the
next eight years twenty-four other fly-
ing clubs were organized, and in 1919
twenty-six colleges participated in a
flying meet at Mitchell Field. By this
time Yale had recovered sufficiently to
win top honors.
A serious minded group of delegates
from ten colleges met at Yale in 1928
for the first intercollegiate flying con-
ference. Unhampered by precedents,
they proceeded to set some, guided by
such notables as Amelia Earhart, Sena-
tor Hiram Bingham, and Grover
Leoning. Problems of safety education,
flight training, aviation promotion, and
air meet operation were discussed.
Amherst, Smith, Harvard and Yale
formed the New England Intercollegi-
ate Flying Club in 1934, and, together
with several other colleges, drew up
plans for a national meet. Grover
Leoning offered a trophy, still com-
peted for, to the college that showed the
most activity during the year, coupled
with the best competitive record.
The following year the National In-
tercollegiate Flying Club was born, with
Bill Strohmeier of Amherst as president.
Purdue was the host, and also the win-
ner, of the First National Meet. Since
then, national conferences have been
held each spring in Washington, featur-
ing some spirited presidential elections
and intense rivalry for meet locations.
In 1936, the president was J. B. Hart-
ranft of Pennsylvania; '37, Dan Martin
of Harvard; '38, C. L. Henderson of
Kenyon College; '39, Ed Martin, '4IE,
of Michigan; '40, Larry Zygmunt of
Detroit.
The Second National Meet came to

place. The third meet, at Hicksville
Aviation Country Club, Long Island,
was highlighted by a handicap race
from Hicksville to Suffolk, near the end
of .Long Island. Despite "stinko"
weather, all but one ship out of twenty
starters arrived. The other, a collegiate
Corrigan, climbed above the clouds and
flew east by compass, by airspeed indi-
cator, and by guess and by God, 'til he
arrived at Suffolk. After landing, he
inquired concerning the whereabouts of
the rest of the contestants, only to find
he had landed at Roosevelt Field, ten
miles west of Hicksville instead of
eighty miles east.
The University of Akron entertained
college fliers for the Fourth National
Meet. Kenyon College tied with Stan-
ford for first. Larry Zygmunt captured
second place for the University of De-
troit, and Glenn Brink, as Michigan's
sole representative, won third place for
his alma mater.
The University of Michigan sent Ed-
ward Martin, Daniel Ranney, and the
author down to Gambier, Ohio, for the
fifth meet, sponsored (and won) by
Kenyon College. The superb hospitality
and fine array of prizes are still talked
about by those who attended.
The Lock Haven Teachers College

largest, National Meet. The number of
participating student fliers has been
greatly increased by the Civil Aero-
nautics Authority flight training pro-
gram. The University of Michigan,
represented by nine fliers, won top
honors.
These national meets, generally held
in July or August, are the gala occasions
of intercollegiate flying College fliers
converge from all over the country for
one of the grandest experiences of their
lives. Meets, both local and national,
usually consist of the following events.
The more spectacular events originally
used have been gradually eliminated be-
cause of the dangers involved.
(1) Spot and Bulls-eye Landing
These events involve landing the
plane from various flight positions,

power off, as close to a line or mark as
the pilot's ability permits.
(2) Navigational Races
Entrants are given a map with a
course plotted on it. Each entrant esti-
mates the length of time that it will
take him to fly the course, according to
the speed of his particular plane, the
wind direction and velocity, and the
length of the course. He submits his
estimate in writing to the judges. With-
out a timepiece of any kind he flies the
course, and is timed from the ground.
The pilot navigating the course in a
time closest to his own estimate wins
the event.
(3) Bomb Dropping
Three two-pound sacks of waste flour
are dropped from a minimum altitude
of five hundred feet as close to a mark
on the ground as the pilot is able. The
winner is the one whose average dis-
tance from the mark is the smallest.
Trophies are awarded to the individ-
uals who score highest in the different
events. A trophy goes to the high point
scoring individual for the meet. A team
trophy is given to the team whose ag-
gregate score is the highest. The most
coveted trophy of all is the United Air-
lines award for the team which presents
the best exhibition of safe flying during
the meet.
At a large event such as the recent
National Meet, where there may be as
many as ten planes flying around the
airport at one time, there is always the
danger of collision. Inexperienced
pilots, in their anxiety to hit the mark
in the precision landing events, may
exceed the limits of their plane. How-
ever, traffic is closely regulated during
the time that events are being run off.
A demonstration of decidedly unsafe
flying in any event results in disqualifi-
cation. To date there is no record of a
serious accident in a college flying
meet.
At national meets young fliers have
the opportunity of watching thousands
of flights and landings, and of offering
each other constructive criticism. They
are able to talk over the many details
of flying technique. Veteran fliers
watching the competition often take the
opportunity of impressing the boys with
the necessity for good judgment and
safe flying habits. As a result, most of
the participants go home better and
safer pilots, as well as richer in friends
and experience.

lazybones
Occasionally, in the midst of a good
bull session, we have heard somebody
claim to be the world's laziest man. In
some ways, we sympathize with the de-
sire for that somewhat dubious honor.
But we know we shall never attain it;
and we know, too, that all the claims
we've heard were false. The world's
laziest man is a girl.
She was a freshman in a girl's college.
Like freshmen here, there, or anywhere,
she was required to take gym. And like
all freshmen she didn't like it. So she
had a thorough medical examination,
and found out she had heart trouble,
just as she had hoped. She couldn't
possibly take gym work!

But it wasn't the first time that had
happened at the school; the officials
were wise. She had to take "rest gym"
—come twice a week, and sleep for an
hour.
To us that doesn't sound hard, but
she flunked it!
vocabulary
A few weeks ago we watched with
some interest a storm of protest in the
newspapers of the land. A govern-
ment official had proposed a Depart-
ment of Propaganda; the editors
thought we had entirely too much
government propaganda now.
The thing didn't phase the propa-
gandists. A steady stream of mail
from this and that department con-
tinued to flow into our office. One day,
a press release from the Michigan Un-
RE PL
employment Compensation Commis-
sion caught our eye. It didn't start
with the usual, "Claims for unemploy-
ment benefits last week were down
2.378% from the week previous, and
. . ." Instead, it was headed, "What
do you know about jobs? With what
type of work would you associate the
jobs listed here? This paper ... in-
vites you to play JOB QUIZ."
It wasn't very hard to guess that a
"screen ape" and a "tippler" were em-
ployed in the mining industry- We
didn't think a "swing man" was a
circus performer or musician, either;
he's a sales manager for a dairy route.
A "tip-maker" didn't confuse us with
a book-maker; he works on hats, not
races. We didn't know (till they told
us) what a "banksman" or a "lease
picker" was, but we did know they
weren't in finance or real estate.
But when it came to "naumkeager,"
we were stumped.
competition
While on the subject of jobs, we are
reminded of a recent announcement by
a leading city that civil service has in-
vaded the field of garbage collecting.
In the future, refuse collectors must
pass a strenuous physical examination
as well as a written test. The candi-
dates will be tested and graded on such
abilities as handling ash cans, manipu-
lating 50 to 80 lb. dumbbells, endurance
running with weights, jumping a three
foot hurdle, and fence climbing.

E C T S
Most of this seems quite logical, but
why the hurdling and fence climbing?
An iceman often has to make a quick
get-a-way, but we didn't know . . .
thespians
The ingenuity of the Michigan stu-
dent has often been extolled in song
and story. Here's the latest example:
A group of students had entered a
small place near Detroit for a glass of
beer, but apparently the proprietor was

not used to such clientele, for he eyed
the blooming cheeks and youthful looks
of the boys with considerable suspicion.
After a consultation with his buxom
wife behind the bar, he came forward
and asked if the youths were of age.
Naturally affronted by this insult to
their manhood, the students immedi-
ately went into their act. They ex-
plained that they were U. C. L. A.
swimmers returning from the National
Collegiate Meet at Yale, and were
making a leisurely sightseeing trip back
to California. This particular place
had impressed them very much, as it
seemed to typify the attractive Mid-
dlewest's best small, neat, clean road-
side beaneries. They even asked per-
mission to return the next day to take
some pictures to show the folks "back
home."
Before they left the place, they not
only had been served, but also intro-
duced to the crowd from the dance
floor, receiving a round of applause.
They later explained that this method
was much more romantic (and more
certain of success) than simply proving
they were all over 21.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


ancient history
In 1850, only twenty-five years had
elapsed since the first steamship crossed
the Atlantic, and the first line of passen-
ger railway, ten miles in length, had
been laid but fifteen years. The tele-
graph was a recent invention; electricity
was a plaything, and electrical engineer-
ing was unheard of. It is not hard to
believe that the life of a student in those
days was much simpler than it is today.
The "Joe College" of those days rode to
school on horseback, and the campus
in many ways resembled little more
than a farm. The familiar picture seen
today of students dashing at the last
minute to make their eight o'clock
classes was probably little seen in 1850
as "early to bed and early to rise" was
necessarily the guiding rule of life. Can-
dles and whale oil were the sole source
of illumination in those days and, as a
result, little studying was done at night.
Perhaps the most remarkable thing
about student life at this time was the
low cost of living. Rooms in the dormi-
tories cost $15.00 a year and board
ranged from SI.50 to $2.00 a week. Stu-
dents ate either at public boarding
houses or in private homes, frequently
those of the faculty members.
There was little of conviviality as it
is known today back in 1850. Occa-
sionally, however, some students suc-
cumbed to the beer and wine of the
German townspeople. A certain episode
of an alcoholic nature occurred in 1858
which resulted in a death and several
expulsions from the University. This
served as a restraining influence for
several years. Societies or other groups
often went down to a Mrs. Slack's res-
taurant, where they were served by a
pretty waitress named "Rika," whose
fame lies in the reminiscences of those
undergraduates who were her patrons.
But for the most part the life of the
university was lived in a sane and
wholesome atmosphere.
Mass action has always been a fa-
vorite method of student expression, it
would seem. Shortly after the Civil
War, mass "bolting" of classes was
quite common and drastic measures on
the part of the University authorities
was necessary. At that time, the rule
was that in the absence of the instructor
the class was expected to remain five
minutes after the ringing of the bell.
The burning of "Mechanics" was also
a popular rite, which in its earlier days
celebrated the completion of the course
in physics under Professor Williams.
This was quite an elaborate affair in
which the whole student body took part.
A formal trial was held, but the verdict
was always the same—death. The
printed program distributed at the affair
in 1860 was so obnoxious that President
Tappan rebuked the students for it in
Chapel, attendance at which was com-
pulsory. We presume the Professor
Williams involved at the time of these
occurrences was a different one than
the faculty member we know by that
name today.
One of the most riotous occurrences
in the University's history happened on
Commencement Day, 1878. It was the
first day of the operation of a passenger
train between Toledo and Ann Arbor.
At the end of the train was a flat car
on which was mounted a huge cannon.
A group of students managed to unload
this and bring it up State Street, plac-
ing it just back of the old Law building.
In the midst of the solemn dignity of the
exercises in University Hall someone
touched off the cannon and the report
was thunderous. Windows shook, plas-
ter fell, and President Angell jumped
two feet in the air. Before tranquility
could be restored, the cannon twice
more roared and pandemonium almost
broke loose among the audience.
Gradually, as the years went by,
things quieted down and student life
today is a more or less peaceful affair,
as we all know. No more do we read
in the yearbook such excerpts as we
might find in the yearbook of 1873 . . .
"Fifty-four members of the class of
eighty during their four years in Ann
Arbor have been suspended from col-
lege at least once, one of these, the
soberest, steadiest fellow in the class,
has been suspended twice, and another
fellow of somewhat different character
has been suspended three times."

If the city of Milwaukee has donated

in that city that Jack was born, way
back in April, 1919. While going to
Washington High there, he was on the

swimming team for three years, but de-
cided the competition was too tough
when he matriculated in the Engineer-
ing College in 1937.
As a freshman, he pledged Theta Xi,
and made his presence more widely
known on campus when he made Phi
Eta Sigma. He was nominated for its
presidency. At the election meeting he
was late, but his friends pitched in, and
Jack walked in just in time to be
elected. From that time to the present,
he has been the recipient of one long
succession of honors. Playing in the
band for two years, he was initiated
into Kappa Kappa Psi, honorary musi-
cal society. In the spring of his sopho-
more year he was elected to Triangles,
of which he was ultimately to become
president. This year Jack is represent-
ing Vulcans, high-powered Senior hon-
orary, on the Engineering Council.
After being elected to the Engineer-
ing Honor Committee in his freshman
year, he learned a great deal about the
inner workings of the Honor System.
Realizing the tremendous value of the
system, he has been instrumental in
effecting its adoption in other engineer-
ing colleges in the country. Climax of
his campus career came last year with
his election to the chairmanship of the
J-Hop. Besides doing a bang-up job in
this capacity, Jack gained a great deal
of practical experience in dealing with
people.
Until this year, Jack has been very
active in Scout work. For two years he
was Scoutmaster of a troop here in Ann
Arbor. On campus, he has done con-
siderable work in the Scout service or-
ganization, Alpha Phi Omega. His ca-
reer has had its work-a-day side, too;
last year he was Ruth Ann Oakes' as-
sistant in the Bur-Pat store.
With this enviable record behind him,
it was no surprise when he was selected
last year for one of the highest honors
in the Engineering College, membership
in Tau Beta Pi. But this year he plans
to concentrate on his job as president
of Theta Xi fraternity. When not busy
on the campus, Jack spends his spare
evenings doing Physics and C. E. 2
problems for his fraternity brothers.
Having lived in Milwaukee all his
life, Jack and two other erstwhile stu-
dents decided to See America First the
rough way. In the summer of 1938 they
started out with high spirits, a tent,
two cots, a sleeping bag, and a fifty
buck Model A. Jack wound up 8000
miles later having covered seventeen
states and Pike's Peak. He was par-
ticularly impressed with the driving
morons of Hollywood, a town which the
boys found rather hard to crack with-
out the necessary influence. Once when
they got tired of driving, they all piled
out and took a twenty-nine mile hike
on foot. Jack's biggest personal thrill
was an accidental but exceptionally
rough slide down the slippery, rock-
studded bank of a huge glacier some-
where in Glacier National Park. He for-
got to take a left turn on the way down.
At present, Jack is starting his first
year in the School of Business Admin-
istration as part of the five year com-
bined curriculum. He plans to get his
Master's degree next year, and then
try tp get a position in industry leading
eventually into personnel work.

Coming to Michigan in the fall of

a B.S. in Electrical Engineering. Here
he continued his athletic endeavors on
the gridiron, which have netted him a po-
sition as right tackle in the starting
lineup of the "M" eleven. Kelto says
he has a constant urge for motion, a de-
sire to be active. He has always been
engaged in some sort of physical ac-
tivity, and now he cannot rest without
it. Kelto believes that playing on an
athletic team builds character and
physique, and is a finishing process
which many college students miss. He
considers schools work as extra-curricu-
lar during football season. However,
football has its disadvantages, too.
Most of the technical societies and ex-

are well under way and usually hard to
break into when football season is over,

For this reason, he has not been too
active in campus organizations.
Kelto's ambition is to get some job
after graduation which pertains to his
electrical engineering education. He
does not want laboratory work, nor does
he want to hold a job which demands
headwork entirely, but wants something
which will include work of both the
hands and the head.
Two summers ago, he was a sur-
veyor's rodman, and last summer, was
a dock man for the St. Ignace ferry.
While in school he works in the kitchen
at Delta Tau Delta fraternity. These
jobs which he now holds and has held
point to his determined purpose of get-
ting through college and getting the
kind of permanent job he wants later.
When asked to give his opinion on
several issues, Kelto gave these an-
swers:
"What do you think about the draft,
Rube?"
"Despite the fact that I've registered,
I haven't thought or worried much
about it, but if necessary, I would like
to get in the Air Corps through the
C. A. A."
"From your California trip with the
football squad, how do you think the
East and West compare?"
"I like the West much better. There
seems to be more space and better plan-
ning than in the crowded cities of the
East."
"What are your relations with
women?"
"I have enough to do without cater-
ing to the women, although I do break
down sometimes."
Reuben Kelto was one of the players
who did not get sick while flying to
California. In fact, he actually flew
the plane for a while.

mathematician
Brain-trust in mathematics and wood-
worker de luxe is Donat Konstantin
Kazarinoff. Born in Moscow, Russia,
on February 22, 1892, he received his
preliminary education at the Classical
Gymnasia in Moscow. In 1916, he
graduated from the University of Mos-
cow with a B. S. in Mathematics. He
received a fellowship and stayed on,
gaining experience as an instructor.
From there he became an instructor in
mathematics at the Gymnasia.
In 1918, he left Russia to become an
instructor at Carleton College in
Minnesota. While there he delved into
astronomy and had an article published
entitled, "Photographic Observations of
Asteroids during the year 1918-1919."
In 1919, he came to the University of
Michigan as an instructor in mathe-
matics.
His education did not stop here, how-
ever. He spent the summers of 1919 to
1922 at the University of Chicago. In
1924, he spent his leave of absence at
the Sorbonne of the University of Paris.
The summer of 1928 was spent at the
Polytechnical School at Aachen, Ger-
many. He is truly a student in engi-
neering as well as mathematics, for his
main interests lie in the practical appli-
cations of the science. He holds mem-
bership in The American Mathematical
Society, The American Astronomical
Society, Gesellschaft fur angewandte
Mathematik und Mechanik, and
Sigma Xi.
He has been married since 1924, and
is the father of two children: Olga, six-
teen, and Niki, eleven. For several
years he has been interested in pho-
tography, and his satisfaction comes
from photographing the more difficult.
The harder the picture is to get, the more
enjoyment he gets from it, and compo-
sition can go hang, as far as he is con-
cerned. His array of cameras and equip-
ment is enough to dazzle even the most
experienced cameraman. Working with
sheet metal also consumes part of his
leisure time, for he makes excellent ash
trays, book ends, and other articles from
copper, brass, and iron.
For many years he has been collect-
ing books related to mathematics, and
his collection has grown so large that
he has a hard time trying to find a
place to keep his rare and unusual li-
brary. Finally he decided to make a
place for his books, so he began build-
ing book cases. He has since become
quite proficient in the ancient art of
cabinet making, and he now considers
it his most important hobby. Most of
his time is taken up by his work, how-
ever, and enthusiasm for his work is
overshadowed only by his modesty.

TIMKEN Tapered Roller Bearings
Industry's bearing problems constantly are increasing in number and
importance due to the rapid developments and improvements in machin-
ery of all kinds.
Speeds are going higher and higher. Operating loads—both radial and
thrust—are becoming heavier and heavier. Working clearances of moving
parts are getting closer and closer.
So in order to meet all modern requirements an anti-friction bearing must
be able to do a lot more than eliminate friction. It must also be able to
carry any load or combination of loads that are imposed on it—radial, thrust or both to-
gether—and at the same time hold shafts, gears and other vital moving parts in correct
and constant alignment.
TIMKEN Tapered Roller Bearings have been doing all of these things—and doing them
effectively—for more than 41 years. Today they are used in automobiles, motor trucks,
trailers, streamlined trains and locomotives, steel rolling mills, precision machine tools—in
fact wherever smoothness, accuracy and stamina must be assured.
TIMKEN Bearings are made by one of the world's out-
standing engineering-manufacturing institutions ... a
large and financially strong organization with complete
research, production and testing facilities, including
the world's largest electric furnace steel capacity. TAPIRED ROLLER REARIMG5

very pure but expensive material which
looked and acted like crude, unvulcan-
ized, natural rubber.
Later, an idea whereby acrylonitrile,
styrene or other substances could be
used to co-polymerize with isoprene was
worked out. The product was better
than rubber in many respects.
The U S. Rubber Company added to
the world's knowledge by perfecting an
emulsion process for polymerization.
All raw materials were emulsified in
soapy water, then converted into a
latex-like dispersion by applying pres-
sure. Polymerization time was reduced
from days to hours.
In this country none of the butadiene
types of elastomers are more than on
the edge of commercial production. One
outstanding example is "Ameripol"
which has been produced by the B. F.
Goodrich Company. A small plant now
turns out 150 tires of this substance
(Continued from page 11)
daily. Such tires have been found to
have some superior qualities such as
resistance to age and light, and promise
to wear as well as natural rubber.
Goodyear began research into arti-
ficial rubber some five years ago. From
three hundred elastomer possibilities,
ten were selected for further study. The
selection was complete when the cur-
rent product was originated. The trade
name for Goodyear's product is Chemi-
gum. Having somewhat the same prop-
erties as Ameripol, Chemigum has also
been made into tires with much success.
A totally new kind of elastomer called
butyl rubber has appeared, but no data
are on hand concerning its derivatives or
the productive processes. It is believed
that it is a 100^ petroleum product
made of refinery gases. The brain-child
belongs to Standard Oil; the chemical
industry thinks it is a co-polymer of
butadiene with a derivative of petro-
leum. Since butyl plants as well as the
butyl are the cheapest the trade has
found, Standard Oil thinks that the
price of the artificial can be made equal
to that of the natural rubber.
Artificial rubber production is like a
growing child. Given a few years, it
will be as big as the father, possibly
a little stronger, a little healthier. As
yet, the techniques of processing the
raw products are the real obstacles, for
elastomers do not act the same in fac-
tories as does natural rubber. Further,
experts realize that the high price of the
present elastomers is caused more by the
lack of volume than by any manufac-
turing complexities. Knowing that pro-
duction is only in its childhood, we
cannot say that all would be lost, nor
can we say that we have nothing to
worry about when and if the day of
blockade arrives. There will be much
to do, but it can be done.
FROM ARC LIGHTS ON
Fair in 1893 but did not come into
general use until several years later.
The principal trouble seems to have
been that it was difficult to sell poly-
phase motors since there were no poly-
phase generators to supply current to
them, and likewise, it was difficult to
sell polyphase generators since there
were no motors to use the polyphase
current. Once started, however, the
system grew like a snow ball and soon
was in common use. The polyphase
system quickly proved a serious com-
petitor to the dc system.
We have now covered the develop-
ment of all the essentials of our present
day systems of power development. The
reciprocating engine has practically dis-
appeared and has been replaced by the
steam turbine. Fuel consumption has
been reduced from about 7 lbs. of coal
per kilowatt-hour to about one in the
most efficient stations. Steam pres-
sures and temperatures have increased
to figures that were not even dreamed
of 40 years ago and sizes have increased
until units of 100,000 kw and more are
common. Hydraulic turbines have
(Continued from page 9)
been improved in efficiency and in-
creased in size so that some of them now
rival the steam turbines in output. The
past 40 years have also seen the devel-
opment of the diesel engine to a point
where it is a serious competitor to the
steam turbine in the smaller sizes. The
diesel has kept alive the isolated plant
which for a time seemed doomed, be-
cause of the greater efficiency of the
large central stations.
The increase in the use of electric
motors has been equally spectacular.
They range in output from the tiny
motors driving electric clocks and de-
veloping about ten millionths of a
horsepower to the 25,000 hp motors
driving our battleships. Most homes
have several clock motors, an electric
refrigerator, electric washing machine,
a mangle, perhaps an oil burner motor
or an electric pump and probably one
or more electrically operated kitchen de-
vices. Even radio dials are now some-
times operated by a small motor and of
course almost every family has an elec-
tric motor to start the family car. In
the factory almost every machine tool
has its own motor and it is not too much
to say that the modern mass production
factory would be impossible without the
electric motor.
Much of the progress in the use of
electricity has been made possible
through improvement in the art of
power transmission. A few years ago
20,000 volts was considered high and
the economical transmission of electric
power was limited to about 25 miles.
Today the transmission line from
Boulder Dam to Los Angeles operates at
287,000 volts and it is possible to cover
the 350 miles with only a moderate loss
and without too much investment in the
transmission line. To avoid too great
loss of energy directly into the air at
this tremendous voltage, the conductors
are Ws inches in diameter and are hol-
low. However the electricity does not
run through the hole. It is startling to
consider that a single source of water
power may supply heat, light and power
to an area in excess of 200,000 square
miles and may help to make more bear-
able the lives of many millions of
people.

Tenants at Edison Courts, a 354-unit
low-rent housing project in Miami,
Florida, have hot water night and day
the year 'round, with never a stove or a
furnace. The sun heats it. Result: No
fuel bills, no smoke, no fires on hot
days, plenty of hot water, and more
living space. Reason: The entire heat-
ing apparatus is outside, on the roof.
Solar heating is not new, but the idea
of utilizing the sun's rays to heat water
for domestic purposes has been de-
veloped only in the last quarter of a
century. The system generally employed
is simple. Shallow, glass-covered trays
are built into the roof surface so as to
obtain a maximum of sunlight exposure.
Inside the trays are tubes of copper (an
excellent heat conductor) resting on a
copper base. The tubes run from the
heaters to a well-insulated storage tank,
also on the roof. Water, sun-heated in
coils, is stored in the tanks.
Each heater serves only one family,
and tenants report excellent results.
Only during extremely long periods of
cloudy weather would there be any
shortage of hot water. Because of the
efficient insulation around the tank, hot
water is available both day and night.
The heaters not only provide for the
immediate needs of the family, but also
heat water for central laundry units. So
successful have they proved in Miami
that other housing authorities in the
South and Southwest are studying the
possibilities of using them. The Miami
authority was not experimenting when
it installed the sun heaters in its first
project. They had already had been
installed in some 18,000 private homes
in the city.
fancy nail
A rustproof nail of new and unique
design gives promise of being the solu-
tion to the fastening problem of many
industries where strength, corrosion re-
sistance, and holding power are essen-
tial. In actual tests it outheld screws
of a variety of materials which had
lesser resistance to corrosion.
EXPLORES
The nail is made of Monel and de-
rives its holding power from a series
of annular grooves rolled in in manu-
facturing. These grooves are sharp and
set at such an angle that in driving
they won't disrupt the fibers of the
wood. The nail requires no pilot hole
and may be driven quickly. An ex-
ceptionally heavy head is used, meas-
uring, in the case of the two inch
nail, °f an inch in diameter and ^6
of an inch in thickness.
Another outstanding property of
this nail is that it is permanently rust-

ln&gt; 0
Wedged tight
proof and highly resistant to salt water
and other agents of corrosion. Be-
cause of this it will not produce a
stain to discolor the wood into which
it is driven.
Originally intended for use in the
boat-building industry, the nail was
first tested before a group of naval
architects. For this purpose a special
testing machine was built. The new
nail, which goes by the trade name of
"Anchorfast," was tested along with
several specimens of nails and screws.
Each specimen was driven into steamed
oak and then pulled from the wood by
the testing machine. Results of the
test show that a two inch Monel nail
held up to 840 pounds, a two inch No.

new plastic products
We seem to be entering the "Age of
Plastics." This observation comes when
one analyzes the list of articles made
of plastics. Some of the newer products
are a bilge pump, a boat, and aileron
tabs.
Resistant to the attacks of salt
water, electrolytic action, and corrosion,
an all molded bilge pump has recently
been developed. Molded of a phenolic
plastic, the pump has a toughness that
can take it. The case is accurately
molded and requires no machining.
Capable of pumping up to eight feet
high, it handles 70 gallons pere ampere
hour of battery used. The inlet of the
pump has the screen areas molded right
into the plastic case.
Representing the hobby field is a
model hydroplane molded of a brilliant
red plastic. Light and strong, with an
unusual permanence of color and finish,
this boat is a novelty in the hobby field.
Because of the qualities of lightness
and strength, plastic airplane trim tabs
have been developed for use in the air-
craft industry. The basic purpose of the
trim tabs is to relieve the pilot of un-
necessary forces on the normal flight
controls. The tabs are adjustable from
the cockpit and the setting can be varied
for various conditions of flight, such as
cruising, climbing, and gliding. Plastic
tabs have been found to be superior to
metal tabs in resistance to buckling,
bending, and vibration.
extruded carboloy
Carboloy cemented carbide can now
be produced in the form of tubing, spi-
rals, and round or shaped bars by means
of an extrusion process. This new pro-
cess provides for the direct formation of
the shapes desired, eliminating most of
the customary hand forming operations.
The tubing can now be made as small
as 0.060" outside diameter by 0.030"
inside diameter, leaving a wall thickness
of 0.015". A distinct innovation, it is
now available in lengths up to 20 inches.
The process consists of mixing the dry
powder with a plasticising medium, and
then forming it by extrusion or molding
into almost any shape.
mining without blasting
It may consist of only hydrocarbons,
but it has an awful kick! At least that's
what they are saying in the mining in-
dustry today. As a result of tests made
over a period of approximately two
years, hydraulic pressure is now being
used in place of the usual explosives in
the coal mining field.
Essentially the hydraulic mining
process is simple. A special tube, closed
at the end, is placed in the usual holes
drilled in the coal stratum. The end of
this tube is connected through an elec-
trically driven pump to a storage tank
filled with a special oil. This oil is
driven under very high pressure into the
tube. As a result, the tube expands and
the coal face is broken down. Thus the
coal is broken free along its natural
parting lines without explosion, flame,
or the evolution of fumes or smoke.
The mining tube used is made of rub-
ber with a relatively small hole and a
thick wall. This is covered with a steel
braid that both protects it and prevents
its rupture.
Extensive tests have proved that this
method of coal mining is successful.

OPINION
rebuff
To The Technic:
Do all of your 10,000 readers know
the name of the beautiful steel bridge?
I believe it is the Cooley Bridge, but I
am an engineer only by courtesy.
"And/or" is the jargon of your
ancient enemies, the lawyers. You can
safely say and can even prove that any
statement which can be made with the
barbarous and unpronounceable and-
grunt-or can be better made without it.
The person who wishes to make the first
three of these four statements:
John and James,
John but not James
James but not John,
Neither James nor John,
may say "John and/or James" but
would do less damage to the mother
tongue if he said "John or James or
both."
Sincerely yours,
Norman Anning.
Mr. Anning is right; the bridge on
the cover of the October Technic is the
Cooley Bridge, named in honor of Dean
Emeritus Mortimer E. Cooley. It was
awarded the American Institute of Steel
Construction prize for the most beauti-
ful bridge in its price class when com-
pleted in 1936. A more complete de-
scription was given in the January,
1937 Technic.
And we will agree that "And/Or" in
the title of our editorial is not the best
English. But if he can say the same
thing in as little space any other way,
he's a better man than we are.
We appreciate Mr. Anning's criticism,
whether or not we agree with all of it
wholeheartedly. However, his letter is
too lonely. This magazine is published
primarily for students. Their opinions
on any subject related to the Engineer-
ing College should have a place in it.
Perhaps the most pertinent subject is
the magazine itself. Is it the type of
magazine you want? What could be
done to improve it? We hear suggestions
or complaints occasionally. One per-
son says it is too technical; another,
that it does not contain enough tech-
nical matter. These columns provide a
good forum; let's hear what you have
to say.

STAY BEHIND THE PLOW
WHETHER or not the United
States may soon have to protect
itself from an invasion, no one can say.
Many people think it possible. And
the nation finds itself with an army so
long forgotten that it might now be in-
capable of the task. Public opinion de-
lege. Students are exempt until July,
1941. For those who graduate this year,
that is well enough; our education will
not be interrupted. But underclassmen
may not be so fortunate, for there is no
guarantee college men will not be
drafted after July.

Military Engineer
Soldier Engineers: Would they be
more valuable out of uniform?
mands that our military machine be
greatly enlarged.
Building an army has two sides—re-
lated, of course, yet separate. A war
could not be fought without trained
soldiers. But in a modern war, soldiers
are worthless without proper equip-
ment.
On October 29, one of the greatest
lotteries in history started our prepara-
tion in the first field. 800,000 men
were called for training, to become part
of an enormous military reserve.
Eventually the draft will be quite gen-
eral. It is hoped men with dependents
will be exempt, as will "key men" in
industry. But exemptions will be given
only on good cause.
Immediately, the draft does not affect
any students in the Engineering Col-
Since the value of advanced educa-
tion is widely recognized, there is always
a desire to protect it from such dangers.
Yet, if it is acknowledged that our de-
fenses must be increased, it will be ac-
knowledged that citizens in every walk
of life must make sacrifices. It is neces-
sary for the Army to have specialists in
all the fields and branches of engineer-
ing. In many cases, some of the work
could be done by men taken from engi-
neering colleges, with profitable experi-
ence to the men. And thousands more
are required for less technical jobs
which still require mehanical ability. A
modern army, fighting as it does with
machine power more than man power,
needs men capable of operating the
myriad mechanical devices, to say noth-
ing of men to teach the teamwork
and co-operation so vital to success. So
if the interruption of an education is
necessary for the common safety, indi-
viduals must make sacrifices.
However, training soldiers is not our
only major problem today. The guns
and machines for them to fight with, if
they must ever fight, are yet to be
built. The nation's entire industrial
and economic face is being lifted to ac-
complish this as quickly as possible.
And the problems of equipping an army
are primarily engineering problems. En-
gineers design the equipment. They
build the new factories in which it is
made. They plan and build the ma-
chines to produce it in quantity. They
operate and maintain that machinery.
And more indirectly, but just as vitally,
they build and operate the remarkable
transportation system that is a primary
reason for our industrial strength.
The entire industrial organization of
the country is being rearranged and
strengthened for our present emergency.
This means more engineering and more
engineers. However, it is obvious a
man cannot be exempt from training
just because he has "B.S.E." following
his name. So between an increased de-
mand for engineering and a supply of
engineers decreased by the draft, more
new blood is likely to be needed in the
profession than ever before. Surely, at
such a time, there are powerful argu-
ments in favor of encouraging men to
finish their technical training, rather
than drafting them in the middle of it.
All these things will be known and
understood by the draft boards. The
boards will act according to what they
deem is best for the nation, and we
may feel sure they will not make de-
cisions without weighing the evidence
fully.
We have not been called to camp
yet. And we have good reason to be-
lieve we will not be, so long as it can
possibly be avoided.

What do you think of when you see or
hear the word ENGINEERING?
Some people think of bridges across which they may ride or walk.
Others think of dams impounding large amounts of water, for domestic con-
sumption, flood control, irrigation, power or navigation.
Others of electricity, at the generating plant or being distributed, or being used
to do the work of one thousand slaves per each inhabitant of the United States, at a
cost which the slave could not live upon.
Others of great manufacturing plants, or of great ships adapted to water or
air, or of railroads and highways.
Others of the horsepower in the automobile engine, the gasoline consumption,
the design and manufacture of the gears, springs, crank shafts and so on.
But the above photo shows a device built by Professor Lay and assistants, of the
Mechanical Engineering Department, for obtaining the ideal dimensions and shape
and cushion effect of an automobile seat. The object is to produce a seat which will
provide a maximum of comfort and ease for the driver along with a minimum of
fatigue and diminished capacity for work. The study covered a period of five years
and in addition to the mechanics involved it was necessary to resort to psychology,
physiology and anthropology to reach a satisfactory and practical result.

The fundamental characteristics of the TIMKEN
Bearing, arising from inherent features of its design, make this bearing
eminently suitable for every bearing application in every kind of
mechanical equipment. In your future years as an engineer, bearing
selection will be one of your many important responsibilities. The more
you learn about bearings now, the easier your task will be.
RADIAL i OA[&gt;
v

fhe .most important feature of the TIMKEN Bearing is its
basic tapered principle, introduced by Timlten in 1898 and
never superseded. This enables the bearing to carry all types
of loads—radial, thrust or both together in any combination
—without auxiliary supports of any kind, (such as thrust
plates or thrust washers).

Rolls are kept in exact alignment with respect to the races
by two area contact of the large roll ends with the undercut
rib of the cone (inner race).
To assure true rolling motion and thus provide maximum anti*
friction efficiency in operation, the bearing is so designed
that lines projected along the tapered surfaces of the rolls
and races meet at a common apex on the axis of the bearing.
A scientifically-designed and accurately-perforated cage Iteeps
the rolls properly spaced around the cone so that each roll
carries its proper proportion of the load.
For more than 41 years a constant process of engineering refinement has been going on,
resulting in the perfected TIMKEN Bearing of today—a product of one of the world's
largest and most famous engineering-manufacturing organizations.

ork on industrial problems in acoustics has been going on continuously at the
University of Michigan since 1923. Since sound meters were unknown at that time,
pioneering work in the development of instruments and in the technique of their use
was necessary. This research led to the development of the first instruments capable
of measuring the loudness of sounds and of analyz-
ing a sound into its components.
Studies for the purpose of reducing noise have
been made on machines ranging in size from fish-
ing reels to 5000-horsepower gear units. Practical
means have been devised for quieting a large variety
of machines, such as electrical refrigerators, vacuum
cleaners, electric motors, air-conditioning equip-
ment, and automobiles.
During the last seven or eight years, automo-
tive noise problems have been handled in an increas-
ing amount. A number of manufacturers have brought in problems incurred in the
manufacture of tires, mufflers, intake silencers, bearings, transmissions, and differen-
tials. Work has been done for a number of automobile manufacturers on the general
problem of noise reduction. The great variety of problems
has led to the development of special techniques for meas-
uring and evaluating various kinds of noise and for de-
termining economically feasible methods of reducing or
eliminating them. A systematic study of vibration damp-
ing has resulted in remarkable improvements of the vari-
ous types of sound deadening materials used in the
automotive industry.

Noise reduction research is only one of the many types of re-
search, facilities for which are made available to industry by the |j
University of Michigan through the Department of Engineering
Research. Inquiries are appreciated.

instead of dragging, lie discovered the first principle of the anti-
friction hearing.
Later . . . when he learned to produce steel halls, he had
the basis for the ideal anti-friction hearing. For a ball has no
ends—carries loads from any direction — requires no guidance
other than its grooved path. And . . . rolling between steel race
rings, has less friction than any other form.
To reduce friction! That is one fundamental reason for
using anti-friction bearings . . . for using ball bearings . . . for
using New Departure ball bearings.

in college were the chemists. Chem-
ical engineering had not yet been born
and even chemists were few in number,
much fewer than the students in phar-
macy. On graduation I was fortunate
to get a position as a full-time teaching
assistant in chemistry at the University
of Illinois at a salary of $750 for the
year. Most of my class found jobs in
the steel mills which were then the
largest employers of chemists in the
country. Steel was all made by the
Bessemer process and every quarter of
an hour a new sample would come into
the laboratory for routine analysis. The
most economical method was to divide
the work so that each man devoted his
whole attention to one constituent. One
table was equipped for the determina-
tion of sulfur and another for phos-
phorus, and a chemist stood in front of
each for eight hours, seven days a week
if the mill was running fully, and did
nothing but make the same determina-
tion again and again, month in and
month out,—and all for a standard wage
of $50 a month. The eight hour day
was a concession to the white collar
class. The men working in the mill had
a twelve-hour day.
The requirement of a chemical an-
alysis was relatively new in the steel
industry. The story was current of the
steel salesman to whom a customer com-
plained that he had heard that the sales-
man's steel was higher in phosphorus
than a competitor's. The resourceful
salesman asked if he could examine a
piece of the competitor's steel. When
it was produced, he carefully put his
tongue on the two pieces alternately.
After he had done this a few times, his
face brightened and he said to the cus-
tomer in a triumphant tone, "I knew
that other salesman was a liar. Taste
these pieces yourself and you can tell
that our steel is actually the lowest in
phosphorus."
After three years teaching chemistry
at the University of Illinois, I decided
that the application of chemistry to man-
ufacturing processes was a new and at-
tractive field. There were no specialized
courses in this subject in the United
States, so I went abroad for a year's
study and while there received a letter
offering me the position of instructor in
chemical technology at the University
of Michigan. I accepted gladly, but
when I arrived found that my title
aroused some curiosity on the campus.
The professor who compiled the faculty
lists made a special trip to ask if that

strange title was really correct, and the
assistant secretary who made up the
payrolls was firmly convinced that my
salary should be charged against the

1

Prof. A. H. White
College of Pharmacy and not the Col-
lege of Engineering.
The curriculum in Chemical Engi-
neering was authorized by the Regents
in 1898 and was the second curriculum
to be offered in the country under that
name. The countries of Europe did not
develop courses in Chemical Engineer-
ing until they had found wide accept-
ance in the United States, so the course
on this campus was the second in the
world. The honor of establishing the
first course went to Massachusetts In-
stitute of Technology. These programs
did not arouse any great commotion in
the industrial world or in the Univer-
sity. The dean of the College of Engi-
neering in his formal letter to the Re-
gents asking that the program be estab-
lished remarked that "It is not expected
that the number of students will be
large." The first class graduated in
1904, although one student who trans-
ferred from the course in Mechanical
Engineering graduated in 1903. In the
early years of the department, the spe-
cialized courses were all listed in the
department of Chemistry and there was
no separate grouping of courses in
Chemical Engineering until 1907. In
that year the importance of the new
department was recognized by the ap-
pointment of the writer as Junior Pro-
fessor of Chemical Engineering, and by
the appearance of the courses in Chem-
ical Engineering under their own head-
ing in the bulletin of the Engineering
College on the same footing as the
courses in Civil or Mechanical Engi-
neering. This early and complete rec-
ognition was due to Dean Cooley, who
was a firm believer in the future of the
still infant department and prophesied

department in the Engineering College
—a prophecy which has substantially
come true.
The old chemistry building still stands
in the center of the campus, unchanged
externally, and is now occupied by the
departments of Economics and Pharm-
acology. It was already crowded by
1900, and the new department of Chem-
ical Engineering had to use space where-
ever it could be found. The square
brick tower at the east end of what is
now the Economics Building contained
a large tank which had been a part of
the campus water supply. This tank
was supported on brick piers which rose
through the first floor and were con-
tinued by cast iron columns at that
point. The basement space was used as
a coal bunker. This water tank was re-
moved about 1897 and the space was
made available for laboratories. The
new Department of Chemical Engineer-
ing was assigned the coal bunker which
was cleaned out and fitted up as a lab-
oratory for gas analysis and photometry,
the room on the first floor was used as
a balance room for quantitative analysis,
and the rooms on the second and third
floors were given over to research and
metallography. The assay laboratory in
the basement of the south wing was also
assigned to the new department.
The outbreak of the World War in
1914, with the consequent cessation of
imports of chemicals from Germany,
caused widespread recognition of the im-
portance of Chemical Engineering. The
number of students grew rapidly and
when the United States entered the War
in April, 1917, the demand for trained
engineers caused the depletion of the
staff at the University. Five of the
seven members of the staff listed in the
Announcement of the College of Engi-
neering for 1917-18 were commissioned
in the Army. The writer was given leave
of absence in May, 1917 to join the
Ordnance Department as Captain. His
duties were first in the organization of
metallurgical inspection, and after two
months he was transferred to the Ni-
trate Division which was in charge of
all army projects for fixation of nitro-
gen. He was later promoted to Lieu-
tenant Colonel and when he resigned his
commission in 1919 he was Associate
Chief of the Nitrate Division.
In the spring vacation of 1898 the
writer sponsored his first inspection trip
to Detroit, Cleveland and Toledo. At
the plant of the Libbey Glass Company,
the students were shown the furnaces
for melting glass which were heated by
producer gas—a relatively new develop-
ment. The gas generators were located
on the railroad siding about one hun-
dred yards from the furnace house and
the gas was piped to the furnaces
through uninsulated steel pipes carried
on trestles about ten feet above the
ground. I asked if there was not a large
loss of heat from these pipes and was
told by the foreman in a pitying tone
that everybody knew that you could not
get any heat out of the hot gas and that
it had to be cooled before it would burn
properly. That foreman was costing his
company a good deal more than his
salary.
The story of the coal salesman be-
longs to this period when science was
slowly making its way into industry.
A customer had been studying the com-
position of coal. He asked the salesman
how much ash his coal contained and
was told there was not enough to see:
he asked about the sulphur and was ad-
vised there was not enough to smell:
he asked about the Btu and was elec-
trified to be assured that the coal did
not have a damned Btu in it.
Of later date, and less than thirty
years ago, is the experience of one of
our alumni who was a metallurgist of
the General Motors Company and was
investigating complaints about uneven
and poor quality of forgings which were
being received from a contractor. He
visited the plant and was surprised not
to see any pyrometers, which by that
time had become standard equipment
for measuring furnace temperatures.
The foreman told him in a belligerent
manner that he did not need a pyro-
meter, that he could tell heats without
it. When asked what heat there was in
a particular furnace he looked in, spat
across the floor, and growled: "Well
there's Fahrenheat in there anyway."
Young engineers and also workmen
who now enjoy a forty-hour week find
it hard to realize the long hours which
prevailed even as recently as 25 years
ago. In the summer of 1915 the writer
was employed in a paper mill where the
men on shift worked twelve hours a
day for six days in the week. On Sun-
day the shift which came off after
working all night could look forward to
24 hours of sleep and rest while the shift
which replaced them at seven Sunday
morning worked continuously for 24
hours. Thus each shift worked 84 hours
a week, 72 hours one week and 96 the
next week, the shift coming off the
night turn getting the 24-hour respite
and becoming the day shift for the fol-
lowing week. It was a hard and mo-
notonous life and the 24-hour respite
every two weeks, as one man expressed
it, "just a hole between two weeks work
with no chance even to get drunk be-
cause it was Sunday."
The following summer, 1916, saw the

mill. The mill was a large one and the
only industry in the small town, which
was crowded along a narrow valley with
all the available level ground taken by
the mill buildings. There was only one
motion picture theatre which opened
at seven in the evening, but nothing
else to offer entertainment except the
saloon. With the eight-hour shift the
men had leisure to get drunk, and the
saloon steps were filled at all hours of
the day with men not knowing how else
to spend their time. It was a depress-
ing sight. The writer did not see the
town again until the summer of 1919.
The management of the mill had built
a well-equipped recreation hall and had
found space for an athletic field. The
saloons were closed because prohibition
had come in the war time. Houses and
yards were tidy and the town had gained
immeasurably in self respect.
Less than twenty-five years ago I
talked with the owner of one of the
largest and most progressive tanneries
in Michigan. His father had started
the tannery when he came as a young
man from Germany, and had continued
to tan leather in the way of his ances-
tors. The son had started as a workman
in the tannery as soon as he left high
school, and had learned the traditional
methods. Shortly after he was twenty-
one he went to Germany and visited the
grandfather, who said to him one day,
"Now Karl, you are a man and it will
not be many years before you succeed
your father in the management of the
tannery. I am going to reveal to you
the family secret as to methods of tan-
ning which have been handed down to
us from generation to generation." The
young man received the secret and
promised to guard it, but he told me he
would have thought more highly of it
if it had brought the family more pros-
perity. He returned to his father's tan-
nery and as he assumed a position of
responsibility, he experimented with
modifications of the tanning process and
gradually changed the methods of op-
eration without consulting his father,
who had given up active management
of the business and rarely visited the
plant. One day he did notice something
strange and asked the son about it.
Karl told him that he had found a bet-
ter way of doing some of the operations.
The father was furious, not because he
had been kept in ignorance of the
changes, but because the son had dared
to violate the family tradition.
In 1917 one of our large chemical
companies took a contract to build a
plant for the United States to fix the
nitrogen from the air. This company
represented that it had developed a suc-
cessful process and agreed to proceed in
accordance with its own designs. The
company insisted that the details of the
process be kept secret even from the
government employees, although this
country was at war and the plant was
to supply an important war material.
When the authority of the government
was invoked to force disclosure, it was
found that the design of a plant to pro-
duce 15,000 pounds of ammonia a day
by a process working under a pressure
of 1500 pounds per square inch had
been developed from data acquired in
laboratory equipment which was ca-
pable of producing only three pounds
per day, and had rarely produced that
much. The company had designed the
plant on wholly inadequate data, and
their policy of secrecy was largely to
avoid exposure of their slipshod meth-
ods. The plant was a complete failure.
One of our alumni is now in the re-
search division of this same company.
He is occasionally allowed to attend a
scientific meeting but is under positive
instructions not to discuss scientific
matters on the floor of the convention
nor with individuals. The management
prefers that he should not even indicate
the name of his employer on his regis-
tration card. He is to keep his ears
open but his mouth shut. This corpo-
ration was the subject of one of For-
tune's illuminating studies about a
year ago. Fortune criticized the man-
agement for its policy of secrecy and
unprogressiveness. It stated, "It has
been reluctant to put its vast resources
to use, to take risks, to open up the fu-
ture. Its research policy, confined al-
most entirely to cost cutting, has failed
to create a new frontier; and its finan-
cial policy has failed even to take ad-
vantage of frontiers that have been
opened up by others."
In contrast to this company we have
the practice of the large petroleum and
rubber companies. Twenty years ago
each manufacturer of rubber tires had
ideas as to the composition of the mix-
ture and methods of vulcanizing which
he tried to maintain a secret. I was vis-
iting one of the plants in Akron at about
that period and the Research Director
told me that they were changing their
methods because they had found that it
was impossible to keep a secret for
more than a few months. That morning
one of their men had come back from
a trip to the rubber plantations in Su-
matra and had told him several things
he had learned there about the opera-
tion of their competitor whose factory
was only half a mile away. It was not
long after this that the rubber com-
panies decided that any process which
made tires better improved the business
of all of them. They now interchange
information freely and at technical con-
ventions their representatives take part
in the discussions. The petroleum in-
dustry has a similar policy of exchange
of fundamental information.
So long as secrecy and tradition
reigned in the chemical industries there
was little opportunity for trained men

Chemists were paid $50 a month
in industry. College graduates were held
in little esteem and were required to
spend many years in learning the "art"
before indulging in any attempts to ad-
vance any ideas of their own.
In marked contrast is the attitude of
today. The vice-president of one of our
corporations once said to me: "When I
start a young man in our plant, I tell
him I am going to keep him on that
job not only until he can do it as well as
the older workmen, but until he has
studied it carefully enough to see if he
cannot improve the older operation."
Three hundred years ago the alchem-
ist was primarily a magician and the
mystery with which he enveloped his
operations continued in our chemical
plants until within a generation. The en-
couragement given to younger men and
the liberal policy of exchange of infor-
mation illustrated by the petroleum and
rubber industries have been major fac-
tors in the rise of this country to a po-
sition of leadership in technical devel-
opments. It is an illustration of the
proverb, "The rising tide lifts all the
boats."

engineers ample reason to pause and
consider modern trends in the design of
such structures. It is of vital import-
ance that the true causes of this dis-
aster be determined and that means of
guarding against similar failures be es-
tablished.
Bridges of the suspension type were
apparently in use in prehistoric times;
they represent probably the earliest ap-
plication of metal to bridge construc-
tion, as iron chain bridges were reported
to have been built in China before the
dawn of the Christian era. There have,

structure. The Menai Straits Bridge,
in England, was completed in 1826, and
at that time was the finest and largest
structure of its kind in the world. In
1836 it suffered some damage from the
wind, and in the light of the Tacoma
disaster the following descriptive ac-
count of its behavior, extracted from
the Journal of the Franklin Institute
for 1837, is of interest:
". . . the wind . . . seemed to descend
upon the bridge; and though it pro-
duced no lateral motion, it excited an
undulation in the long line which is sus-
pended between the supporting pyra-
mids, to such an extraordinary degree
that the wave ran from end to end of
the roadway, and measured vertically
not less than sixteen feet, that is to say,
that its crest was in one part elevated
eight feet above a horizontal line, and
its hollow depressed, at another part, in
the same instant of time, eight feet be-
low it."
The design of the Tacoma Narrows
Bridge represents an extreme of slender-
ness and flexibility. Its width to span
ratio was 1 to 72, as compared with the
generally accepted value of about 1 to
35. The ratio of the depth of the stif-
fening girders to the span was 1 to 350
as compared with the more widely ac-
cepted limit of about 1 to 80. Of all
suspension bridges of more than 1000
foot span built since 1924, the most ex-
treme designs had not previously ex-
ceeded a width to span ratio of 1 to
47 and a depth to span ratio of 1 to 209.
It should be obvious from the fore-
going that as compared with all modern
bridges, the Tacoma structure was ex-
tremely flexible, and therefore more sus-
ceptible to oscillation and vibration.
Since the purpose of this unusual de-
sign was to save cost, it can easily be
understood that it was also light in
weight. The wind blowing across a
suspension bridge structure is disturbed
by the cables, suspenders, side girders,
and other structural members, and the
turbulence thus created develops im-
pulses which tend to set up motion and
vibrations. These may be damped by

UNDER SPECIAL SUM

'C O. S.! Disaster at sea!" Newspa-
^ • pers all over the world have copy
for a thrilling story. And inevitably one
finds at the end of such stories of trag-
edy and heroism a prosaic paragraph
telling the dimensions of the vessel and
when and where it was built. Generally
this information is credited to "Lloyd's
of London."
But how many people know there are
two "Lloyds?" One is Lloyd's Register,
which has to do with the inspection and
classification of ships; the other, the
Underwriters, who are concerned with
insurance.
When the middle eighteenth century
marine underwriters began to meet in
Lloyd's Coffee House in London, there
was but one organization. Over their
coffee, these early underwriters dis-
cussed ships and their owners and mas-
ters to arrive at a basis for the pre-
miums to be charged. So that conclu-
sions might be shared by them all, a
private list was printed, "classifying"
the vessels. The owners soon demanded
publication of these lists so they could
find out and remedy defects in their
ships.
With wide circulation of the lists,
standards of structure had to be estab-
lished. Underwriters themselves were
not qualified to judge these standards.
Expert "surveyors" had to be employed
to "survey" (not with transits) vessels,
to determine whether or not they com-
plied with the standards. With renewal
of insurance, rechecks were required.
One or two surveys of new ships dur-
ing construction permitted inspection
without opening up parts after comple-
tion. Thus, the original Register de-
veloped into an organization controlling
construction and maintenance of mer-
chant vessels requiring insurance. This
sort of control may be considered the
definition of "classification," and any
organization exercising it is a "classifi-
cation society."
In 1890, some shipowners and build-
ers rebelled at the absolute control of
the underwriters, which naturally tended
to be over-conservative. They formed a
rival body, the British Corporation, in
which the underwriters had little con-
trol. Naturally worried by this move,
the underwriters reorganized Lloyd's
Register, setting up the present Com-
mittee of Management, consisting of
merchants, ship owners, underwriters,
ship builders, engineers, and chairmen
of the branch committees in other coun-

hard way; America can
profit from her experience.
KICKING THE BLITZKRIEG
By
ARTHUR W. C. DOBSON, "42E
ENGLAND, having been caught
nearly unprepared by Hitler's gi-
ant air force, has been able not only to
hinder widespread bombings, such as
were used to overcome Poland in a few
weeks, but also to build up her own
R.A.F. to a point where it is now taking
the offensive in many cases. This has
been a tremendous task, and every re-
source of that tight little island has
been strained in carrying on its history
making stand against the Nazi horde.
In the first year of blitzkrieg, Britain
found that many unusual problems of
defense arose which had to be solved
without delays and mistakes. The know-
ledge gained from this experience is
concrete and practical, and shows once
again that theories are not worth much
without rigid tests to prove them.
One of the most important means for
relieving the pressure on the first line
pilots of the R.A.F. is the extensive
training of new men in the skills of
wartime flying. The basic training is
of the standard type and is done
for the most part in American planes.
Before he sees active duty, the novice
must spend a good deal of time in the
actual fighting craft which he will be
using. Bomber crews are thoroughly
trained in both high and low flying
bomber formations. They practice
bombing with bombs, and also take
training flights over enemy territory.
Another lesson some Britons have
had to learn is to ignore air raid sirens.
Workers in airplane and motor factories
have been asked to stay on the job, be-
cause a great many potentially produc-
tive man-hours have been spent in air
raid shelters, and the chances of the
Germans hitting any important military
objectives have been minimized by the
alert R.A.F. and the accurate antiair-


course in the recognition of aircraft has
prevented much loss of time because of
false alarms over friendly planes.
Of course, the production problem
would have come closer to being solved
if the British had overcome their con-
servatism and built underground fac-
tories. Any civil engineer can demon-
strate in two flicks of a slip stick that
it would be very difficult indeed to con-
struct factories with the large, unsup-
ported roof areas required in airplane
assembly plants, if those roofs had to
carry many tons of dirt on top of them.
However, since it would be very hard
to make underground factories proof
against a direct hit, the best thing to
do is to build them as strong as is rea-
sonable, set into the ground and cov-
ered with only enough dirt to support
camouflaging vegetation. Such a struc-
ture, impossible to locate at night, is
ideal for Britain, who has thus far made
the air too hot for enemy daylight raids
and photography. There are definite in-
dications that such factories will soon
be built in England.
Keeping production up to standard in
quality and quantity are fundamental
problems of aeronautical and industrial
engineering, respectively. Standards of
quality are largely determined by the
tasks the different kinds of machines
have to do, which are determined by
the quality of the enemy's latest ma-
chines. Thus the matter of overcoming
the enemy's developments by each side
leads them both around in a circle, and
the eventual winner will be the nation
that does the job most effectively, by
a decided advance over previous de-
signs, and by preventing the secrets
of the new design from reaching the
enemy in order to enjoy the advan-
tage as long as possible.
In the long term view this latter
point is equal in importance to the one
of actually making the technological ad-
vances, and can be achieved by having
the pilots crack up their planes com-
pletely if they have to bail out over
enemy territory. Because many German
pilots have not done this, the British
have been able to gather much useful
information about construction, and in
the case of exceptionally well preserved
planes, about performance and efficien-
cies, too.
German planes have some good points
which the British were glad to discover.
A clever scheme, in use on all German
planes, is the painting in a definite color
of all pipes, levers, filters, and controls.
For example, the gas system is yellow,
the oiling system brown, and glycol and
cooling lines are green. This method
of identification greatly speeds up and
simplifies servicing of planes.
Another neat device is a fairing plate
which closes the gap between the slotted
flap and the trailing edge of the wing,
when the former is up, forming a con-
\ ■
tinuation of the wing. In use on the
Junkers Ju 88, it lifts up as the flap is
lowered, and drops down under the
leading edge of the flap, closing the gap
just before the flap reaches its nor-
mal position on the way up. Fur-
thermore, the Ju 88 is flush riveted all
over, carries seventeen instruments, and
its spars are connected with ball joints.
But some of the other German planes
shot down have not been so well con-
structed. Glaring deficiencies in equip-
ment, defense armor, streamlining, and
bracing have been noted in the Messer-
schmitt 109's and the Ju 87 B2 dive
bombers, obviously turned out by mass
production for one way trips.
Another reason for preventing the
enemy from securing planes is to keep
them from finding out the location of
the manufacturing plant. By shooting
down a number of Messerschmitt 110's
in fair condition, the British have been
able to ascertain the origin of every
part and the location of the main as-
sembly plants. This knowledge will en-
able them to strike harder at those
plants than at others where inferior
types are made.
As far as industrial engineering is
concerned, the British have found them-
selves handicapped by the lack of mass
production methods on training ships
which need not be produced along
"Swiss watch" lines. America, however,
is better prepared on that score, already
employing the most efficient production
in everyday industry. In addition, plans
are being made to transfer these meth-
ods to the production of plastic planes.
However, we have much to learn in
other lines. One of the most funda-
mental mistakes we have been making,
and are just beginning to rectify, has
been the almost exclusive use of radial
motors, which give the plane a tubby
appearance and make proper stream-
lining of the nose impossible. In 1925
an airplane maker in England, Mr.
Fairey, bought the license for the Cur-
tiss designs, distinctive at that time for
the '"Eversharp" nose of the Curtiss
Conqueror liquid cooled motor. Those
pointed lines have been in use in Eng-
land ever since, and show up in the
Hurricane, Spitfire, and Boulton Paul
Defiant.
Meanwhile, we in America were build-
ing ships like the Curtiss 77-SBC-4
Helldiver, the Boeing P-12, the Brew-
ster Buffalo, and the Grumman G-36,
which, though good ships in their day,
were all tubby with blunt noses built
around radial motors. Now, however,
with Bell's Airacobra, Lockheed's P-38,
and the Curtiss P-40, all using Allison
liquid cooled motors, we are returning
to the superior pointed nose lines, now
to be found in the best military air-
craft in the world.
The British have interesting opinions
of our highly touted flying fortresses.
The consensus is that the Boeing B-17's
are not new or formidable except that

southern exposure
Last month we went to a convention.
Conventions are notorious for many
things; a combination of representatives
of engineering college magazines and
the University of Arkansas environ-
ment resulted in no breaking of con-
vention precedents. Southern hospital-
ity, as practiced on the U. of A. cam-

we know where the "four out of five"

Consequently, the taxi drivers are often
drafted for services other than ferry-

gentlemen. We heard one story about
some residents of a girls' dorm who had
a hackman bring a load of beer and
sandwiches to their house, where such
refreshment was forbidden. Getting the
good things into the house was no prob-
lem for the driver, when all he had to
do was go to the side of the building

proof
Professors always claim that the "ab-
sent minded professor" is but a figment
of cartoonists' imaginations. Professors
just don't wander about in perpetual
dazes, kissing doors goodbye and slam-
ming their wives.

But we think professors are wrong
about that. Witness the story of one of
our E. M. profs:
The nine o'clock E. M. 4 section was
waiting for its instructor to arrive, when
in came our subject. He started to call
the roll, and was surprised to find no-
body answering to it. A moment's hesi-
tation, a look at his watch. His jaw
dropped three inches, and, muttering
something about "thought it was ten
o'clock," he sneaked out.
seeing red
At a certain small college not far
from here recently, the coeds all ap-
peared in classes attired from head to
foot in red. Naturally, inquiring re-
porters sought the explanation. They
were told that the girls were irked by
the lack of interest among the male stu-
dents in lining up dates for the big
homecoming weekend.
At this same small college, freshmen
girls are early taken in hand by the
dean of women and informed of the
facts of college life. Among the confi-
dential disclosures is the admonition
never to wear red. It "excites the male."
victim
The annual fall elections and initia-
tions for all the campus honor and hon-
orary societies have come and gone. The
hapless neophytes underwent the cus-
tomary back-breaking, knee-blistering
initiation ceremony of the society to
which they were bidden, without com-
plaint. And despite the Daily's semi-
annual protest at the brutality of
engineering initiations in particular,
there was not one casualty among the
pledges. In fact, the only victim of the
whole campaign was the luckless active
member of Triangles who sprained his
knee while trying to get into the awe-
some black robe used in their rites.
same to you
It's a little hard to realize, as we sit
down after a good Thanksgiving dinner,
that the close of 1940 is just a short
way off. So many things will have hap-
pened by the time it gets here. There is
only one thing we're sure won't have
happened: we won't have caught up on
our work. The
first snow that

so long now
will have
come, and the

time this is

if we do have
to work away ahead, we refuse to be
caught napping. Merry Christmas, and
now we're going to quit and write our

1935 with three letters in football, two
in baseball, and the top scholastic hon-
ors in his class.
The following fall, he began his well-
rounded college career at the University
of Michigan, enrolling in the Lit School
as a student of geology. As the second
semester drew to a close, he found him-
self in possession of a Phi Eta Sigma
key and numerals for baseball.
The following fall Harry entered Van-
derbilt University, and during his first
semester there became the regular full-
back on one of the good teams of the
country. It was Carl Hinkle, his All-
American roommate, who helped per-
suade Harry to take engineering. During
the game with Sewanee, Harry mashed
his ankle and had to play the next two
games with his leg in a cast. He says
that his main interest was football, and
he just went to school to remain eligi-
ble, but he ended up with a four-point
average. What would have happened if
he had decided to get good grades?
Harry began the next school year at
Indiana University, but he dropped out
during the spring to play pro baseball
with the Hot Springs, Arkansas, club.
The seventy dollars a month and the
quality of the baseball didn't agree with
him, so in the fall of 1939, he re-entered
the University of Michigan, this time
in the College of Engineering. He be-
came a member of A. I. Ch. E. and was
elected their Engineering Council repre-
sentative at the first meeting he at-
tended this fall, much to his surprise.
For a fellow who doesn't like school-
work, Harry has done all right for
himself, for his 3.8 average was the
highest in the Tau Beta Pi initiate list
of last year. At present he is chairman
of the finance committee of this year's
Union Opera. This fall, Vulcans singled
him out, and he went through the or-
deal of oil and lampblack.
Aside from his extra-curricular activi-
ties, Harry holds down four jobs, work-
ing for his board, grading physical
chemistry papers (he's the man to see),
working in the Engineering Research
Department, and shoveling coal with his
roommate, Archie Kodros.
Harry's main hobby is women, al-
though he says it is more theory than
practice. He claims he knows more
women and has less dates than anyone
on campus—should be seven out of ten
and not four out of five. This year the
opera is going to take it easy on the
women, because Harry says he has a
hard enough time getting dates as it is.
Harry's main ambition in life is not
to be a stuffed shirt, and after gradua-
tion in June, when he will receive a B.S.
in Chemical Engineering, he will go on
being just himself, for the world is full
of stuffed shirts already. Easy going and
likeable, Harry says he's not hard to get
along with as long as he has his own
way. Without a doubt, his popularity is
due to his diplomacy, and love-of-life
attitude, and it was these attributes
which helped him to be elected to the
office of President of the Engineering
College Class of 1940.

It is well for all concerned that builders of marine
Diesels make performance capacity the primary basis
for the selection of materials. Breakdowns at sea or
anywhere else are no fun for anyone, including the
engine builder.
But the demand for reliability can be met and pro-
duction costs still kept where they should be. One
prominent builder, for example, is doing both by
specifying Chromium-Molybdenum (SAE 4140) steel
for a number of parts including bolts, wrist-pins, cyl-
inder head studs, gears, tappets and crankshafts.
The fact that this steel can be treated to develop the
properties necessary for applications having such
different requirements is of value to both builder and
user. It simplifies heat treatment and stockroom pro-
cedures. And, since simplification makes for uniform
quality in the finished parts, it gives added assurance
of dependability.

a future of farming and raising sheep.
Luckily for our engineering school, Prof.
Lay developed a dislike for sheep in any
form. (To this day he can't stand mut-
ton or lamb chops.) However, he did
intend to take up farming as a life work
and, with this in mind, he pored over a
catalog from Michigan State. Before
long the engineering curriculum was
claiming his attention, and soon he was
reviewing his high school work in Ann
Arbor High School. From there it was
just a step to the University of Michi-
gan Engineering College which he en-
tered in the fall of 1910. After taking
"time out" from studying to work for
the Packard Motor Co. in 1912-13, he
graduated with a degree of Bachelor of
Mechanical Engineering in 1915. At this
point he came to a fork in the road. On
one hand he had the opportunity to go
out into business. His other option was
to take the job offered to him of teach-
ing assistant in the Automotive Division
of the Mechanical Laboratory of the
University. Needless to say, he decided
in favor of the teaching profession; and
despite numerous offers of employment
from the business world, he has been
"on the job" ever since. Nevertheless,
he has kept in contact with the technical
advancements of the day through his
summer jobs with industrial concerns.
Prof. Lay's golden teaching oppor-
tunity came in 1917 when he was in
charge of an auto mechanics training
school at the University of Michigan.
During the war period he and his staff
trained 1250 men in four detachments.
After this it was but a step to an assis-
tant professorship in 1919, the job of
associate professor in 1923, and the post
of Professor of Mechanical Engineering
in 1930.
His publications and his memberships
in societies are almost numberless. To
mention a few of the societies, he be-
longs to Sigma Xi, Tau Beta Pi, Iota
Alpha, Kappa Delta Rho, S.A.E., and
the National Highway Traffic Associa-
tion. In addition to that, he is a major
in the Officers Reserve Corps and a
faculty member of Scabbard and Blade.
His engineering research projects are
now flirting with the hundred mark, his
latest being the study of automobile seat
cushions in relation to the comfort of
the driver.
Professor Lay is a firm believer in
the doctrine that the professor must in-
ject personality into his classes. His suc-
cess in following this doctrine is shown
by the reactions of a "Lit" student and
a graduate engineering student. The
"Lit" student took one of Lay's courses
and placed his hearty stamp of approval
on the Lay teaching methods. The grad
student's reaction was that Professor
Lay has the "snazziest" collection of
stories of any prof on campus.

As most of us who have been around
the Engineering College for a little while
well know, the Gargoyle is the arch en-
emy of the Technic. However, just to
fhow our readers how broadminded we
are and that the rivalry is only in fun,
we are presenting this month the "whys
and wherefores" of the life of Paul
Johnson who was appointed Business

Paul Johnson
Sailor and hitch-hiker
Manager of the Gargoyle for this year.
Paul came to the University of Mich-
igan in the fall of 1937 to study Me-
chanical Engineering. That was back in
the days before Class Officers were
abolished and Paul remembers the fun
he had playing with freshman politics
with Ed King and Jack Harwood and
several others of the present senior class.
During that year, he pledged Sigma Phi
Fraternity and was a tryout on the
Michigan Daily staff. In his sophomore
year, he again tried out for the Daily,
but dropped out in the middle of the
first semester in order to devote more
time to his studies. However, Paul ap-
parently could not endure being sepa-
rated from the Publications Building
and, after an absence of only a few
weeks, he returned, this time on the
business staff of the Gargoyle. He found
the Gargoyle required as much work as
the Daily, but still he managed to get
his studying done. In the spring of that
year he found himself industriously
scrubbing the Denison Archway for
Triangles. In his junior year Paul was
Circulation and Personnel Manager of
the Gargoyle. He was also elected to
the J-Hop Committee; and in the spring
he was again running around the campus
doing things, this time for Michigamua.
At about the same time, he was ap-
pointed Business Manager of the Gar-
goyle and was elected President of A.S.
M.E., both jobs for the ensuing year.
However, this fall he decided to resign
his position with the Gargoyle in order
that he might devote the major portion
of his time to the A.S.M.E. and his en-
gineering studies.
While in high school in Grand Haven,
Michigan, where he has lived all his life.
Paul spent his summers working as an
apprentice for a tool and die maker. In-
cluding the summer between his fresh-
man and sophomore years at Michigan,
he spent a total of five summers doing
this type of work. His last two summers
have been spent in summer school. Dur-
ing each summer he continued his work
at the Publications Building, helping to
put out the summer student directory
and selling advertising for the Summer
Daily.
Paul's favorite form of recreation is
sailing, and he has always done a lot
of it at home, entering many of the
races held around Grand Haven. He also
likes to play golf and to travel. During
his vacation periods, he has travelled all
around the country and, incidentally, he
cites Glacier National Park as his fa-
vorite vacation spot. Paul considers him-
self quite a hitch-hiker, and rightly so,
since during the two summers he spent
in Ann Arbor, he never missed a week-
end at home. This feat necessitated a
round trip jaunt by thumb of 350 miles
each time.
Although he claims his later life has
been uneventful, Paul's arrival in this
world was accompanied by a rather dis-
astrous occurrence, for on that day his
father's machine shop burned to the
ground. However, that seems to be the
only time in his life when he was likened
to Joe Btspflk in the "Li'l Abner" comic
strip who gives everyone with whom he
associates bad luck. Anyway, Paul ex-
pects to finish the educational phase of
his life next June when he graduates at
the age of 2l\i&gt;. He plans on going into
factory work, eventually taking up sales
or production engineering.

The Finest Seats - |j CENTS
RECENTLY
subway riders
in New York
were intro-
duced to the lat-
est development
in car seat cov-
ering materials—woven plastic. This
new material results in seats that are
the last word in comfort, cleanliness,
and durability.
A special type plastic, produced by
Dow and marketed under the trade
name Saran, is extruded in rattan-
like strips and then woven. The ad-
vantages of this seat covering mate-
rial are numerous.
It is tough and long wearing—cleans
readily and thoroughly—will not
crack or splinter—possesses the at-
tractive, gleaming characteristic that
makes plastic materials so popular.
Only those confronted with the con-
stant problems of public transporta-
tion maintenance can fully appre-
ciate the decisive value of such a
development. Car cleanliness is a
major objective. Former types of
seat coverings, only partially resist-
ant to absorption, soon became ob-
jectionably soiled and were beyond
cleaning.
Saran, possessing all the non-ab-
sorptive characteristics of plastics,
suffers only surface soiling and is
readily cleaned.
Wearing quality and resistance to
breakage are other important factors
in public transportation seating.
Here, also, Saran is definitely supe-
rior to previous materials, giving
not only long, economical service
but avoiding such difficulties as dam-
age to passengers' apparel, particu-
larly hose.
Undoubtedly, this new advance in
seating will be eagerly employed in
all types of public transportation—
also in theatres and restaurants,
Dow, through its research and de-
velopment work, is happy to be
identified with this new application
of plastics in the betterment of pub-
lic service.

(Continued from page IS)
they can carry a heavy load of bombs
for a moderate range, or a moderate
load for a long range. By British stan-
dards they are poorly armed and their
size makes them easy targets in the air
or on the ground. Their maximum
speed of 268 mph. is too slow to offset
their inadequate defense, and they
would be easily shot down in daylight.
These ships, weighing twenty tons
fully loaded, have a defensive arma-
ment of only five machine guns, all on
hand operated mounts, yet are described
officially as having exceptional defensive
fire-power. They have no tail gun, no
armor, and unprotected gas tanks. It
is almost impossible to hold a machine
gun perpendicular to the fuselage by
hand at 270 mph., let alone try to aim
it properly.
The British are very firm in their be-
lief that nearly all bombers except their
own and possibly the German Heinkels
are sadly lacking in defensive arma-
ment and armor. They contend that it
is no use to send a ship which is slower
than enemy fighters out to do any kind
of job unless it is armored and able to
bring great fire concentration to bear
upon the attackers. It is better to have
a bomber that can carry only one ton
of bombs and is reasonably sure of re-
turning, than one that can carry double
the load but is very vulnerable. This
same principal has been successfully ap-
plied to battleships, which correspond
in the navy to the big bombers in the
air force. With their double or triple
bottoms, compartmentation, and blis-
ters, they are practically unsinkable,
and no destroyer squadron would dare
come within range of their heavy guns
in an attempt to torpedo them. They are
truly floating fortresses; but how can
a bomber with five hand operated ma-
chine guns be looked upon as a flying
fortress, when pursuit ships now mount
eight guns and a cannon in the nose?
In spite of the excellent record made
by the R.A.F., and the technical prog-
ress achieved, Britain must be prepared
to overcome any superior development
which might arise from the minds of the
ingenious and capable German engi-
neers. And many problems currently
need solving, such as the perfecting of
a plane with the same bomb load and
gun power as the Wellington, but half
again as fast, with armored protection
for all vital parts, and cannon to deal
with enemy interceptors which keep out
of machine gun range and use their
cannon.
A device to enable the location of
enemy bombers at night by sound de-
tection would be very useful. Night op-
erations are also marred by landing
crashes when the pilots can't see the
field, necessarily "blacked out." Tricycle
landing gears would prevent much of
this, and in fact, our own Bell Aira-
cobra has one. They are difficult to de-
sign, however, and most planes still use
the old three point method.
A tough problem is presented by the
possibility that the Germans might, as
they say, be producing a bomber which
can cruise at 3,000 feet above the max-
imum ceiling of the British fighters.
Out of antiaircraft range, such a ship
could ferry bombs over to Britain, even
if only very slowly and at the rate of
one or two at a time.
And there arises the possibility of a
fragmentation bomb so made that it will
sweep a wide area close to the ground
and set fire to every aircraft the frag-
ments strike. How much simpler this
would be than having to hit each plane
or an enemy field directly to destroy it.
Many such problems must be solved
to enable any nation to keep ahead of
the enemy, and the necessity of research
must not be overlooked. America should
be thankful that it has the opportunity
to learn so much, and to benefit by Brit-
ain's passing on the knowledge it gained
in the year that it stemmed the tide of
the blitzkrieg.
MDER SPECIAL SURVEY
tries. These committees are only
branches; central control is in London.
In this country, a similar process of
development took place at a later date.
In 1857, American underwriters pub-
lished the New York Maritime Register.
Rival organizations were established, as
in England, but were soon merged. The
American Bureau of Shipping, which,
with Lloyd's Register, classes most of
the vessels in this country, was incor-
porated in 1862. It allied itself with the
British Corporation in 1917, and the
Registraro Italiano and Japanese Ma-
rine Corporation have since been taken
in. While the group is international in
scope, each member is free to deal with
its own problems without consulting any
central control.
(Continued from page 13)
"So what?" may say the practical en-
gineer to this history about naval clas-
sification societies. But some of the
greatest benefits of these societies come
to naval architects and marine engi-
neers. A ship builder, bidding on a ves-
sel which is to be built "Under Special
Survey" (inspected during construc-
tion), knows that the preliminary plans
have been approved by a society and
he may base his bid on these plans
without fear of major changes after he
has started work.
As the working drawings are devel-
oped, they are sent to the Society, where
they are approved or modified. The
steel orders, first sent to the Society,
are forwarded to inspectors at the mills
who test and check each piece. At the
shipyard, surveyors see that the work
is done according to specifications.
Such an organization as the American
Bureau of Shipping, which has many
vessels directly under its observation
through periodical surveys, and is affili-
ated with similar organizations in for-
eign countries, is far better informed on
the structural design of a vessel and her
machinery than any ship builder or
owner. Classification societies will have
more and more importance in the fu-
ture of ship building, as is indicated now
by the fact that the United States Bu-
reau of Marine Inspection and Naviga-
tion repeatedly accepts official approval
of plans by the American Bureau as
evidence of the soundness of the pro-
posed structure.

EXPLORES
geographic soap
Something new in the world of spe-
cialization is Zoned Soap. Recognizing
the difference in hardness of water
throughout the country, the makers
have split up the United States into
zones, according to the degrees of water
hardness. Then a special soap has been
put on the market for each zone.
At the present time there are seven-
teen different soaps, with the degrees of
hardness running from zero (water so
soft soap is almost superfluous) to 50°
in hardness.
Most of the metropolitan areas have
been zoned and the proper soap for that
zone can be purchased. For the rural
communities, the farmer's wife has but
to draw up a two-inch sample from the
well, send it to the factory and receive
the correct soap for her zone.
gas blanket
A new gas, known as "Endogas," has
been developed to protect the surface of
steel parts during the hardening process.
It is made by mixing air with natural
gas, or other inexpensive fuel gas, and
heating the mixture to 1850 "F. in an
electrically heated chamber. By regu-
lating the amount of gas and air enter-
ing the chamber, it was found that the
proper amount of carbon could be sent
along to the heat treating furnace to
balance the carbon in the steel.
The gas mixture answers the demand
by steel manufacturers for an inexpen-
sive atmosphere that will prevent scal-
ing due to surface loss of carbon during
heat treating between 1500° F. and
2300° F. "Endogas," which is inexpen-
sive to produce, will serve very nicely
to prevent these conditions.
phonograph
Swing addicts will be interested in one
of the engineers' latest achievements.
This new machine is really a rejuvena-
tor of old wax cylinder phonograph rec-
ords. The machine transcribes the old
cylinders without the ordinary danger
of scratching away valuable words or
music. Through its use one may hear
the music as it actually sounded many
years ago and not the way the old tin-
horn phonograph squawked it out.
Representing another job for the pho-
to-electric cell, the machine uses a
photo-electric pick-up. This pick-up is
placed on a standard dictaphone ma-
chine. The standard spindle is changed
for one that will fit the commercial type
of old Edison wax cylinder. The pick-up
is in turn connected to a recording unit.
Thus music from the cylinder may be
transcribed to the modern disk type
record.
The device uses a sapphire stylus
which floats gently in the grooves of the
cylinder. As it does this, it sways a tiny
mirror from six to seven thousandths of
an inch thick. This mirror reflects light
rays, received from a tiny bulb, onto a
photo-electric cell which translates the
light rays into sound vibrations.
This machine proves that the scratchy
recordings of the early twentieth cen-
tury were due to the reproducing ma-
chine and not to the record itself. The
horn of the machine was too small to
reproduce the lower frequencies and the
mechanized part could not reproduce
the upper frequencies. As a result the
music would tend to fade in these fre-
quencies. The same records, transcribed
through ti e use of this new machine
and played on modern reproducing
equipment, reveal a far greater range
and a better tone than would be ex-
pected.
acetate yarn
The "strongest yarn in the world"
will soon be produced in a brand-new
plant in Virginia. This yarn is already
being used by England in the produc-
tion of parachutes. The results of tests,
which show that it is three times as
strong as natural silk, indicate that it is
likely to replace Japanese silk in para-
chutes for the United States Army Air
Corps.
Textile men describe it as a "strong
acetate"—in other words a cellulose ace-
tate yarn. By some undisclosed process
this yarn takes on both "wet" and "dry"
strengths claimed to be considerably in
excess of any natural or synthetic fibre.
It can be extruded and spun in prac-
tically any degree of fineness and may
be woven into "sheers" so strong that it
is almost impossible for human hands
to tear them.
magnetic oil filter
Removing all ferrous particles down
to one micron in fineness, the newest
model of magnetic oil filter does excel-
lent work in magnetically "cleaning"
lubricating oils and other liquids. It per-
mits the unobstructed flow of twenty
gallons per minute.
The filter consists essentially of a
two-piece case, two powerful electromag-
nets and a series of grids made of high-
permeability alloy. Magnetic particles
are caught by either the electromagnets
or the grid as they pass by in the liq-
uids. Clearing of the filter is easy since
grid and magnets are nonmagnetic when
disconnected.
rubber bush
The recent publicity given to rubber
synthetics calls attention to the rubber
producing shrub, guayule. In 1931 the
first, and at the present time, the only
factory producing rubber from this shrub
was established. Because the shrub does
not begin producing until the fourth
year, the project didn't begin to show
definite results until 1935. However, ex-
periments have shown that in emergen-
cies this shrub would prove valuable as
a home source of rubber. Thriving in
desert-like ground it could be easily pro-
duced in the Southwest. As yet, this
means of getting rubber has not found
popular backing for it now costs from
25 to 30 cents a pound as compared
with the current market price of about
19 cents.
In production the plant is plowed up
and ground under water by the pebble
mill process used in making cement. The
rubber content is washed free and floats
to the top where it is skimmed off. The
plant fibre forms a silt which sinks to
the bottom. According to statistics an

plants to yield some 1800 pounds of
rubber.
Since the United States uses about
600,000 tons of rubber annually, and it
takes four years for an acre to produce
enough guayule to make 1800 pounds,
it would take about 27,000,000 acres or
42,000 square miles of land to grow our
own rubber.
iodine shortage
A considerable shortage of iodine has
developed in Germany owing to the
British blockade, and various measures
are being taken to restrict consumption
and maintain supplies to meet indis-
pensable requirements.
Germany is wholly dependent upon
foreign sources for all of its iodine re-
quirements. Tn 1935, the German gov-
ernment made a special trade agreement
with Chile and the total imports
amounted to 228,500 kilograms as com-
pared with 57,600 for the previous year.
However, their imports have fallen off
steadily since then and reached only ap-
proximately 110,000 kilograms in 1939.
The effectiveness of the British blockade
has today cut these imports to an almost
negligibb amount.
Residues, solutions, and other iodine
containing industrial wastes of the phar-
maceutical plants producing iodine
preparations and of the photographic
chemical plants serve as the principal
sources for the recovery of iodine. Re-
coveries up to 98 and 99 percent have
been found possible. In normal peace
times this recovery might be considered
uneconomic, but in war time such costs
are subordinated to the imperative need
of stretching limited quantities of neces-
sary supplies.
war time product
A new alloy on the market is espe-
cially designed for fabrication into cut-
ting tools. It differs from most high
speed steels in that it has a smaller tung-
sten content. While its hardness and
cutting capacity do not quite measure
up to those of the previously existing
tungsten carbides, it serves very effi-
ciently as an all purpose tool for general
machine shop use.
Tungsten is one of those seventeen
strategic materials the use of which in
all probability will be curtailed in event
of real national emergency; thus the
new alloy can be seen to be a war-time
product. Its tungsten content is 5.0%
as compared with 18.0% hitherto used,
but the reduction in tungsten does not
appreciably impair its cutting quality
nor the ease of handling during fabrica-
tion. Previously, low tungsten high-
speed steels have been subject to severe
carburization during the hardening proc-
ess, but the new alloy may be fabricated
into its finished form without special
precautions.
stratosphere plane
Going up! Making huge strides to-
ward the day when stratosphere flying
will be an everyday occurence, the avi-
ation industry recently developed a
45,000-pound airliner designed for sub-
stratosphere flying.
Because of the importance of this re-
search, a one-tenth size model was built
at a cost of $16,000. A perfect replica
of the 107-foot span airplane-to-be, it
was equipped with four electric motors
driving 14-inch three-bladed propellors
making up to 20,000 revolutions per
minute. The rudder, elevator, and aile-
rons are operated with two more small
motors located inside the fuselage. Re-
mote control was used by research engi-
neers to facilitate the aerodynamical
investigations of the control surface
changes or their deflections caused by
wind forces.
The new ship, cruising at altitudes of
four to five miles above the earth, is
supposed to have a normal cruising
speed of 247 m.p.h., and a top speed of
300 m.p.h., with four engines of 1,250
hp. each.
Old time engines were losing about
half their power at an altitude of 15,000
feet, and the airplane speed was de-
creasing with altitude. However, super-
charged engines with the controllable-
pitch propellors absorbing the full engine
power make it possible to increase the
cruising and maximum speeds consid-
erably.
Openings are located on the leading
edge of the wing through which air is
taken into the superchargers. The super-
charged air is heated and cleansed of
dust, after which it is distributed
through grilles near the floor of the
plane to provide proper air conditioning.
The circulating air is exhausted through
a sensitive diaphragm in the tail of the
plane. When flying at low altitudes no
supercharging is necessary and the air
is by-passed through a vent.
The airtight sealed doors and win-
dows have been designed to hold against
a minimum pressure of 2*4 pounds per
square inch.

awards are offered.
A first prize of $100, and second and
third prizes of $50 and $25 will be
awarded for the design of an airport
terminal building. It sounds simple, but
it is really an interesting and compli-
cated problem. The rapid expansion of
air transportation must be taken into
account, so the terminal will not become
obsolete too soon. The growth of air
express adds to the already perplexing
problem of handling and sorting bag-
gage rapidly. Caring for the thousands
of spectators who visit large air termi-
nals, and keeping them out of the way
of hurrying passengers is an important
question. And not the least of the prob-
lems is that of providing parking space
for twenty or twenty-five planes within
walking distance of the building. The
competition is open to all students of
engineering and architecture. Professor
W. S. Housel can furnish further par-
ticulars of the contest, which closes in
the latter part of January.
Of interest especially to mechanical
engineers is the Charles T. Main Award
of $150 for the best paper on "The
Need and Possibilities of Participation

chanical Engineers. One award of $25

the weight of the structure or resisted
by its stiffness. In the case of the Ta-
coma Bridge, undulations were observed
to occur at relatively low wind veloci-
ties and their amplitude was not directly
proportionate to the velocity or force of
the wind. It has been reported that the
structure had, in fact, withstood higher
wind velocities than that which pro-
duced failure. At the time of failure
the wind velocity reported at Tacoma
was 22 miles per hour. A maximum
of 34 miles per hour for a five minute
period, about twenty-seven minutes be-
fore the bridge failed, was the high for
the morning. This apparently produced
the crucial impulses which synchronized
with the period of oscillation of the
structure to build vibrations up to such
magnitude as to produce failure.
The Tacoma Bridge failed becaus?
its design was inadequate to meet con-
ditions which as yet cannot be com-
puted. It is for such reasons that con-
servative designs follow established
practice and hold to proportions which
will provide material stiffness and sta-
bility. In "A Memoir on Suspension
Bridges" written by Charles S. Drewry
in 1832, it is stated:
"It is a common doctrine that light-
ness is the peculiar excellence of a sus-
pension bridge, but that is a principle
which must be acted upon with discre-
tion, and not taken generally. For a
bridge may be from its size just so
heavy that by being put in motion it
will acquire great momentum, and just
so light and slight, that it will be unable
to resist the effects of its own vibration."

OPES HOUSE
'■ 'WO years ago was an off year. There
had been an Engineering Open
House the spring before, and they were
held only once every two years. Last
done in several laboratories could be ob-
served. Hundreds of guests were con-
ducted through all these exhibits.
Of course, it was a lot of work for

For students in the college
year, one was rather expected and there
was a lot of talk, but none was ever held.
It has been decided that there will be
an open house this year.
Few of the students now in the Col-
lege of Engineering have ever seen an
Open House, since the last one was in
the spring of 1938. It was quite an af-
fair. Invitations were sent out widely,
and as much publicity given to it as
possible. On the weekend when it was
held, extensive displays were set up in
laboratories. Short movies were shown
by some departments; scale models by
some; and the type of work actually
students and faculty. All the exhibits
had to be planned and arranged. The
visitors had to be guided. It took time.
On the other hand, it created a favor-
able impression in many minds. Since
hundreds of high school students came,
it may have been partly responsible for
the nearly. 25% increase in Freshman
enrollment in the fall of 1938. But per-
haps the greatest benefit was the chance
it afforded students to see the work of
other departments.
Plans for this year are not so elabo-
rate. It is not felt the College needs the
type of advertising afforded by an Open
House. Michigan has a nationwide repu-
tation built on the successful engineers
it has graduated, on the faculty, and on
its research.
The benefits of an Open House will
lie in another direction. If it can create
more good will toward the College, well
and good; but the program will be
aimed where its most valuable service
lies: for students in the College.
We upperclassmen, as we begin to
think we know something about the
field we specialized in, tend to ignore all
other fields. We come to "know more
and more about less and less." An Open
House will tend to reawaken interest in
Engineering as Engineering, not just as
Electrical Engineering or Mechanical
Engineering.
Underclassmen know little enough
about any of it. Math, Drawing, Phys-
ics, Chemistry—these are merely the
background of Engineering, the founda-
tion on which it rests. Some underclass-
men have not decided which branch
they want to enter; others are uncertain
of the choice they have made. An Open
House will help orient such students.
It will help acquaint all of us with
our college. How many of us, outside the
Aeronautical Department, have ever
seen a wind tunnel test? How many who
are not Chemicals know anything at all
about the equipment in the Chemical
Engineering laboratories? It will be of
interest and value to have laboratories
opened to inspection and the work done
in the various departments presented.
The Open House need not be a
World's Fair to be successful. Its object
is to show what the Engineering College
is, not how many thrilling exhibits and
displays it can invent. If it accomplishes
this aim, the Open House cannot fail to
be worth far more than its cost in
effort.

Boat building and design was once an art. It is now an application of all the
physical sciences.
A modern ocean liner is a floating municipality. The design of a Great Lakes
freighter or an ocean liner calls for a high degree of engineering skill and knowledge.
There is no phase of engineering that does not enter into the design and construction
of a modern ship.
For forty years the University of Michigan has offered courses in Marine Engineer-
ing and Naval Architecture. It has the only Naval tank possessed by a state univer-
sity. In it models of boats are tested for relative resistance to movement through the
water at various speeds. From data so obtained the speed and fuel consumption of
the actual boat may be accurately foretold.
The photograph above shows the tank, the towing car, and the operators record-
ing the resistance of a model in the water beneath the car. Various models, including
yachts and submarines, are hanging at the left.

MICROANALYSIS
TN ordinary chemical analysis, where material is plentiful,
the work is done on a scale most suitable for obtaining the
results sought. Samples are relatively abundant; they may be
used prodigally.
Not always, however, is the material for test so plentiful. The
General Electric Research Laboratory at Schenectady, N. Y.,
handles the exceptions with its facilities for"microchemistry,"
in which the amount ot test material available controls both
the scale of operations and the strategy of attack. Micro-
analyst Charles Van Brunt, Harvard, '92, of the laboratory
staff is prepared to test material whose limit in smallness is
set only by the refinements of manipulation attainable under
the microscope with the aid of a "micromanipulator."
Seldom does Van Brunt attempt to identify or classify ma-
terials in solution volumes less than a cubic millimeter (about
the size of a pinhead). But to analyze an ordinary drop, as
delivered from a medicine dropper, is comparatively coarse
work for him—near the upper limit of the true microchemica!
range.

FROZEN LIGHT
NHE "late" Baron Munchausen was accredited (by him-
self) with incredible feats among which was freezing the
ring of a bell. Recently, however, General Electric Research
Laboratory scientists at Schenectady, N. Y., outdid the Bar
by freezing light.
In producing this frozen light, G-E scientists submerged
fluorescent plates in a large thermos bottle of liquid air
with a temperature of 320 degrees below zero. The bottle
and the plates were then bombarded by x-rays, exciting the
atoms of fluorescent material on the plates literally freezing
them stiff. When the plates were removed and allowed to
warm up, they glowed with all the colors of the rainbow.
A "bottle" of frozen light was sent to East Orange, N. J.,
where it was unveiled in connection with the ceremonies
marking the premiere of the motion picture, "Edison, The
Man."

RADIO TURKISH BATH
ATS and moisture seem to be the two chief enemies of
radio sets in the tropics. A letter from the Belgian Congo
testifies to the rats; the evidence for the humidity is already
ample. Except for recommending traps, there is little the
(ieneral Electric Company can do about the rats, but the
study ot humidity is right up its alley since G-E engineers at
Bridgeport, Conn., have built a humidity chamber capable of
reproducing the weather conditions of the tropics.
Lamps under water tanks provide humidity by vaporization,
and generate enough heat to maintain a temperature of about
100 F. Humidity and temperature are controlled by time
clocks outside the sealed chamber, while uniform wcatht
conditions are maintained within the chamber by circulatn
Radio receivers placed in this room are continuously gut
jected to conditions far more severe than those of the tropic
until failures occur in the sets. In this way, young engineerir
college graduates enrolled in the G-E Test Course gathe
data which contribute to the improvement of radio, not onl
in the tropics, but everywhere that radios are used.

Microphone picks up sound emanating from the
vibrating plate. . .
IN THE automotive industry in
particular, large quantities of vi-
bration damping materials are used
for quieting the bodies. Some of
these materials come in the liquid
form and are sprayed on, while
others come in sheet form and are
cemented to the panels requiring
damping.
The thick plate method of testing
the effectiveness of these materials,
the method most commonly used
in the automotive industry, was de-
veloped at the University as a part
of its research service to industry. In
this method the material is put on
calibrated plates, which, untreated,
ring like a gong.
They are set in vibration by a blow.
We use a baseball. A microphone
picks up the sounds emanating from
the plate and the electrical impulses
thus induced are transmitted to a
cathode-ray oscillograph where they
cause a spot of light to move up and
down, the motion depending on the
magnitude of the sound. This mo-
tion is photographed on a moving
film. The rate at which the sound
decreases affords a measure of the
deadener.

This motion is photographed on a moving film.

and the Engineering Society of Detroit,
a beautiful new building takes shape.
THE RACKHAM MEMORIAL
By
CHARLES R. "NEMAN, '41 E
THE story of Michigan has been a
story of growth and expansion. Be-
ginning with only forty acres of land,
the University has continually ex-
panded its facilities and its influence.
The latest development has concerned
the University Extension Service,
which makes the facilities of Michigan
available to those residents of the
state who cannot come to Ann Arbor.
The Extension Service of the Uni-
versity will be able to give to the De-
troit area a more complete educational
program when the new. headquarters
of the outpost are completed. They
have been made possible by a very
generous donation.
Mrs. Mary A. Rackham, one of the
Trustees of the Horace H. Rackham
and Mary A. Rackham Fund, follow-
ing the policy of the trustees in using
the funds at their disposal largely for
the promotion of educational facilities,
presented the University with $500,000
to purchase land, and to erect and
equip a School of Graduate Studies,
Detroit Branch. In this building the
activities of the University in the De-
troit area could be adequately housed.
The gift was accepted by the Regents
on March 27, 1939. One of the terms
of the grant was that the building
should adjoin or be located near
another building which had been made
possible by the Trustees of the Rack-
ham Fund to house the administrative
offices and educational facilities of the
Engineering Society of Detroit, thus
making the Extension Service con-
venient for the engineers, that they
might take advantage of the educa-
tional facilities.
Presently, there was conceived the
idea of definitely bringing together the
activities of the Engineering Society
and the University under one roof, and
of extending the project to include an
auditorium with a seating capacity of
1,000, a large banquet hall, and a
library, all of which could be used
conveniently by both organizations.
In accord with that conception, the
Trustees of the Rackham Fund offered
the University an additional $500,000
to cover its share of the cost of the
combined project. This gift was ac-
cepted by the Regents on May 26,
1939.
Under the terms of the latter grant
and of an agreement duly executed be-
tween the owners of the combined
project, the University will own the
central and westerly portions of the
building, including the auditorium,
banquet hall and library, as well as
the land on the westerly side of the
line dividing the ownership of the
building.
The Regents on January 26, 1940,
accepted the University share of
another generous gift of $750,000 from
Mrs. Mary A. Rackham to acquire
additional land for the building site
and to increase the budget for building
construction, landscaping, and equip-
ment.
The joint project will be known as
The Horace H. Rackham Educational
Memorial, in accordance with the terms
of the grants. The building is now
being constructed in the cultural center
of Detroit, across Farnsworth Avenue
from the Detroit Institute of Arts.
The large auditorium, banquet hall,
and library section are the central
dominant features. They are flanked
on the east by the P^ngineering Society
wing, and on the west by the Univer-
sity wing.
The finished building will be 404
feet long. The section housing the
Society will contain such features as a
spacious lounge room, a small audi-
torium, a library, a dining room, and
a kitchen. On the first floor, there is
space for billiards, bowling, and a room
for the activities of the junior members.
With a lounge room, an array of
offices, class rooms, seminar rooms, and
lecture rooms, the University will carry
on the work of the School of Graduate
Studies in the westerly half of the
building.
The large auditorium in the center
is to be acoustically perfect. It is
shaped something like an ellipsoid of
revolution, cut by a plane through its
major axis, and a plane at the rear
through its minor axis. The library
will be a quiet place for work, and will
contain information and conveniences
not ordinarily available to students.
Horace H. Rackham created a fund
to be used for "the benefit of man-
kind." The housing of the University
of Michigan and the Engineering
Society of Detroit under one roof
marks a new advance in the extension
of education to the public. The ar-
rangement will prove efficient and be
of "benefit to mankind."
The Memorial will be a place for
academic theory and the cold practical-
ity of the engineering profession to
mingle. Here, under one roof, is a
great opportunity for theory and
practice to work together for the bene-
fit of the community and the advance-
ment of world knowledge.

ral gas lines high, fouling must
be cleaned out by the Co-Devil.
IMPROVING PIPE LINE EFFICIENCY
By
C. H. M. BURNHAM
Chief Engineer
Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co.
THAT steak you had for dinner last
night was probably cooked on a gas
stove. And if you live in Ann Arbor,
the gas that cooked it came from Texas,
through hundreds of miles of pipe lines.
Obviously, it takes a great deal of
energy to bring natural gas over such
long distances, for it must be pumped
through the lines, just as water must
be pumped through mains. Natural
gas is a fluid, and in being transported
through the long pipe line systems,
friction impedes its flow every foot of
the way. Compressor stations, which
represent an important part of the gas
industry's investment, are ''friction
overcomers."
The resistance to flow, which uses up

Most fouling is caused by dirt included during laying
the pressure generated in the compres-
sor stations, follows definite laws of
great importance to the industry. The
flow of gas through a straight, level,
uniform pipe is dependent on the
length of the line, its diameter, the in-
let and outlet pressures, the specific
gravity of the gas, its flowing tempera-
ture, and the coefficient of friction.
Naturally, the
length of a line and
its diameter can-
not be changed, once
the line is built.
Neither, for prac-
tical purposes, can
the character of the
gas be regulated.
Transmission econo-
mies can result only
from close attention
to the operating
pressures and the
efficiency of flow, if
sub-normal, of the
pipe lines.
The efficiency of
flow is defined as
the ratio of the
quantity of gas
flowing through the
line to the quantity
which would flow
through a perfect
carrier — smooth-
walled, uniformly
round, straight, and
level, without joints
—under the same
conditions. The effi-

the coefficient of friction. Since the flow-
through a gas line is a function of the
inlet and outlet pressures, it is apparent
that the efficiency of flow has a direct
bearing on operating pressures, and,
therefore, on the power required.
At very low velocity and pressure,
the flow of gas in a pipe line is laminar,
or viscous—one layer slides upon
termine whether or not he has reason-
ably high flow efficiencies in his sys-
tem? He cannot inspect a pipe that
is underground. A flow test is the only
sure means of determining flow effi-
ciency.
It is necessary, of course, to deter-
mine how much gas a 100 per cent
efficient line would carry. Various

Weymouth's equation is not a smooth

"f" is not dependent on the diameter

another, and friction losses are very
low. However, commercial pipe lines
are operated at velocities high enough
that flow becomes turbulent, except
for a thin layer next to the wall
(Fig. 1).
If the height of rough projections
from the wall is less than the thickness
of this viscous layer, the flow efficiency
is not much affected. However, the
viscous layer is usually a very few
thousandths of an inch thick, and sur-
face roughnesses may easily protrude
more than this. If they do, they
seriously impede the flow and lower the
efficiency (Fig. 2).
Ordinary commercial pipe line is
fairly smooth. It tends to grow
rougher with age, however, as deposits
of sand, dirt, and corrosion products
collect. Surprising as it seems, twice
as much power may be required to
pump the same quantity of gas through
a rough pipe as through a smooth one
of the same dimensions.
But how is the gas engineer to de-
smooth pipe flow, and one may be
chosen.
The fundamental gas flow formula
which forms the basis of most pipe line
equations is:

f = Coefficient of friction.
It is with the coefficient of friction that
we are primarily concerned, since foul-
ing of our gas lines influences "f" long
before enough roughening particles
could pile up to affect the diameter.
Until recently, the gas industry has
The formula selected should give
due recognition to the Reynolds num-
ber, R; it should allow for the fact that
the coefficient of friction is not only a
function of the diameter of the pipe
and various qualities of the gas, but
of the mass velocity of the stream as
well. Unless this precaution is ob-
served, flow tests made at different
rates of flow or in different lines will
not give comparable results, since the
Reynolds numbers will be different.
In 1932, Nikuradse published a form-
ula recognizing this. However, it is
not convenient for use in finding the
flow, since a "cut-and-try" solution is
necessary. Benjamin Miller, in 1936,
derived another expression for "f",
based on Nikuradse's work. Substi-
tuted in the original equation, it gives:

let, "Q" can be found with little
difficulty.
Charts plotted on log-log paper will
simplify the solution of problems, par-
ticularly if complicated pipe networks
are involved. Corrections for devia-
tion from Boyle's Law and for differ-
ences in elevation can be made if they
are warranted.
In testing for the efficiency of a line,
steady conditions of flow and pressure
must first be established. This may
take as much as ten hours. Pressure
and rate of flow are then measured.
The flow of a perfect pipe can be calcu-

To prevent the brushes and rubber

lated, and the efficiency found. Rough
sections may then be located by their
low efficiencies.
The only way to increase the effici-
ency of the pipe line itself is to make
it more nearly like that theoretical
pipe—perfectly smooth inside. And
since hundreds of miles of pipe line
can't be dug up and thoroughly cleaned
periodically, pipeline engineers some
time ago perfected a device to do the
job without disturbing the line. Known
as the "Go-Devil," it was equipped
with scraper blades which removed
extraneous materials as it was blown
through the pipe by a stream of gas.
Recently another type of Go-Devil
had to be developed. A type of fouling
was found which presented a uniformly
rough, dense, sandy surface having the
appearance of coarse sandpaper. Anal-
yses of this scale show-ed it was com-
posed of varying quantities of sand
and iron oxide. Examination of the
surface and degree of bonding between
the wall and this material indicated
these roughening particles could be
removed best by means of steel brushes.
The Go-Devil shown in Figure 3 was
designed to remove this particular kind
of scale.
This latest development has a ten
the by-passed gas stream over and
through the brushes, while the vanes
in front throw the loosened materials
against the pipe walls ahead of the
machine, thereby creating an action
like a sand blast.
The Go-Devil is propelled, by ad-
mitting gas behind it, through gate to
gate sections of the gas line at a speed
varying from 12 to 15 miles per hour,
the line having been previously opened
at the outlet end. As it progresses
through the line, the steel brushes
loosen the dirt and scale which, car-
ried by the gas, are blown ahead and
out of the line. When the device has
completed its run of from 8 to 10 miles,
the line is thoroughly blown to remove
any loosened material that was left
behind.
If some obstruction stops the Go-
Devil, there will be a cessation of the
dust being blown out. A man posted
at the open end watches for this and
communicates with the operator ad-
mitting gas behind the machine. Ordin-
arily, it can be started again by blow-
ing in extra gas. In one job of cleaning
265 miles of line only one "caesarian"
had to be performed, when the Go-
Devil became caught in a drip. In all
other cases of "hanging up," turning
in more gas was sufficient to free it.
The brush-type of Go-Devil is par-
ticularly economical of operation. In
an actual trip over 346 miles of pipe
line, the wear on the brushes was
barely °f an inch. Some 265 miles
of 24" pipe were cleaned in 36 working
days, at an expense of approximately
S60 a mile, exclusive of the gas costs.
There were some costs of replacing
worn rubber tires and an occasional
wheel bearing, but the total cost of re-
pairs was very small.
From this discussion of ways of de-
termining efficiency and of maintain-
ing it at a maximum we may conclude
that it is desirable to find the flow
efficiency of a line as soon as it is
constructed, for two reasons:
(1) It would be an indication of the
practicality of the design, of the ma-
terials used, and of the construction
methods employed.
(2) Determination of the effect of
friction would permit prediction of the
capacity of the particular pipe line
within very close limits.
Of course, such things as bends,
joints and fittings cause turbulence in
the flow, but these factors are constant
after the line is laid. Moreover, their
combined effect lowers the efficiency
only about five per cent. Fouling of
the line is by far the greatest factor
reducing efficiency. The most pre-
dominant cause of fouling is the in-
clusion of dust, sand, and dirt during
construction. Also included here are
materials inadvertently left in the line
and not blown out upon completion of
the work—skids, buckets, shovels, din-
ner pails, and small animals.
Sand also comes from the gas wells
themselves. If such sand strikes the
walls of a pipe previously wetted with
oil or water, a roughening coat may
adhere to the inside wall upon drying.
Corrosion can cause fouling before
and after the pipe is installed in the
line. A section, stored unprotected be-
fore use in the line, will have a rough
coating of oxides formed on the in-
terior walls. After the pipe is laid,
some sulfur- or oxygen-containing gases
may cause a corrosion resulting in con-
siderable roughness.
Because of the increasing number of
natural gas transmission lines in the
country the method of controlling pipe
line efficiency described above should
find wide use throughout the industry.
The low maintenance and operation
costs are insignificant compared to the
tremendous savings obtained when the
flow efficiency is as high as possible.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


jewels for use in the bearings of
electric meters and other sensitive in-
struments far exceeded the supply
when the job was left to mother nature.
The price was further increased by the
expenditure of a lot of time on the part
of experts to test and select only those
stones of high enough quality and
purity to meet the rigid requirements.
In 1904, however, Prof. A. Yerneuil
published a paper on his successful
experiments on artificial reproduction
of rubies, which at that time were
popular stones for jewelry. He pointed
out that the commercial value to those
whose chief interest was in the physical
properties of the stone, rather than in
its beauty, could not be overlooked.
Since then, the synthetic stone has
superseded the natural one for tech-
nical uses. A good bearing jewel
must be uniformly hard, chemically
incorrodable, and able to take a high
polish. The keystones of all these
characteristics are purity and homo-
geneity. Alumina, the chemical name
of the stone, contains a variety of
foreign materials, when it is formed
by natural means, except in rare in-
stances. In laboratory production,
however, by using only the purest
aluminum oxide as a raw material,
and by controlling operating condi-
tions, a very pure stone results.
The importance of purity is not
hard to understand. Inclusions, softer
than the body of the gem, are often
corrodable, and sometimes even liquid.
In any case, they get worn away, and
leave the hard alumina filled with
rough edged pits, which rapidly wear
the steel part in contact with them.
Refinements of Prof. Verneuil's basic
technique have made it possible to
produce, in commercial quantities, a
stone so pure, that even under the
high powered microscope nothing is
visible but a clear, colorless, homo-
geneous expanse.
The process is relatively simple, but
it requires skillful manipulation of the
apparatus to be entirely successful.
The raw material is ammonia alum,
which is calcined at about 1,000° C. to
produce a pure alumina in the form of
a fine white powder. This powder is
charged into a sieve bottomed reser-
voir around which is an air tight jacket,
funnel shaped at the bottom, with an
opening near the top for an oxygen
supply. The oxygen flows around the
container and down into a tube which
leads to an inverted oxy-hydrogen
torch. The reservoir, when tapped at
regular intervals by a small hammer,
allows some of the powder to be
carried down the vertical tube with
the oxygen to the torch directly below
it. The hydrogen tube conventionally
surrounds the oxygen tube and the
flame is produced in the usual manner.
The combustion takes place in a
cylindrical furnace, through the bottom
of which projects a vertical clay rod,
which can be raised or lowered small
amounts by screw adjustments. At the
start of the process, the temperature
is comparatively low, and the drop-
lets of alumina fall through the flame
onto the plane surface of the clay rod,
where they build up a small cone of
spongy structure. Soon the point of
the cone fuses, and a crystal begins to
grow. Then the temperature is in-
creased by manipulation of valves in
the gas lines, and the supply is in-
creased by speeding up the knocker.

duce superior precious stones

GEMS TO ORDER
By
CORDON OSTERSTROM, '43E
When the required diameter, observed
through a window in the furnace, is
reached, the temperature and supply
are kept steady. In the flame at
2,100° C. the crystal grows upward.
To keep its top at the point of maxi-
mum temperature, the rod is lowered.
This must be done by an expert, as
the uniformity of the stone depends
on the correct speed of growth.
When the desired height is obtained,
everything is quickly shut down, and
the stone is cooled slowly in the fur-
nace. The gem thus formed is com-
pletely transparent, but by adding
small amounts of metallic oxides, var-
iously colored specimens may be pro-
duced. The weight of the stone varies
with the color and shape, the heaviest
is about 250 carats.
Fortunately, the product is a uni-
form single crystal, though its cylin-
drical shape does not show it; and may
be split along a vertical plane of sym-
metry without any secondary cracks
or fissures whatever. Furthermore,
once a synthetic stone has been split,
it cannot be split again in any other
direction. In this characteristic it
differs from natural specimens, and it
is believed that splitting a synthetic
stone once gives it a natural equilib-
rium which must be reached before
any further operations can be per-
formed. To reduce the stone to any
smaller convenient sizes, saws must
be used.
In their use as bearings, the stones
are split, and then cut into plates by
high speed copper discs having dia-
mond splinters embedded in their
periphery. The plates, resembling
slices of bread, are then machined fur-
ther in different fashions according to
the type of instrument for which they
are intended.

glycerine have made feasible its
synthesis from petroleum gas.
SYNTHETIC GLYCERIN
GIVE an organic chemist some glyc-
erin and turn him loose in a
laboratory. Chances are the results
will amaze you, for this tri-hydric
alcohol is literally something with
which to conjure. Its unique properties
are making it invaluable in an ever-
increasing number of chemical special-
ties, in addition to its familiar every-
day uses.
Physically, it is a clear, hygroscopic
fluid freezing at 17 degrees C. and
boiling at 290. It is heavier than
water, fully miscible in water and
alcohol, but immiscible in benzene,
ether, chloroform, and most oils.
Glycerin is the major ingredient in
numerous modern synthetic resins and
plastics, to the extent of over 20,000,-
000 pounds a year. Another 20,000,000
pounds are accounted for in the rayon
and cellophane industries each year.
The tobacco processors use great quan-
tities of it as a softening agent; it helps
maintain a given moisture content,
gives sweetness, and improves the
flavor.
And of course, there's dynamite
which used 65,500,000 pounds of glyc-
erin out of the 336,000,000 pounds
produced in the United States in 1939.
But glycerin no longer can be con-
sidered the ''strategic material" that
it was in 1917; it has encountered
many competitors and substitutes in
the explosives field, and the chief use
of nitroglycerin in recent years has
been in dynamite for construction and
mining.
Glycerin finds wide use as an emulsi-
fying and dispersing agent. Sealing
compounds, gasket pastes, rubber lu-
bricants, printing inks, anti-freezes,
perfumery, cosmetics, soaps, shoe pol-
ishes: all contain glycerin. It is an
excellent suppling agent for both
natural and artificial leathers. In
paper making, rubber manufacture,
gas drying, and the textile industry
glycerin is almost indispensable.
When this continually increasing de-
mand for glycerin is balanced against
the fairly constant source of supply—
the soap and fatty acids industry—the
inevitable result is advancing prices.
Glycerin, though a by-product which
would be thrown away were it not
sold, commands a higher price than
the fatty acid with which it was com-
bined. The price of glycerin varies
from 10 cents a pound in normal con-
ditions to 60 cents in war times, averag-
ing about 15 cents over a long period.
In March, 1937, the price soared to 31
cents, and it was nearly impossible to
obtain it at that price. The consumer
blamed it on wars and rumors of wars.
But actually our exports of glycerin
were small.
Faced with an increasing price and
an increasing demand that could not
be met by the saponification and
hydrolysis of fats and oils, chemists
were forced to find other sources. Of
laboratory methods there were plenty,
since this problem had occupied aca-
demic and industrial interests for many
years.
Glycerin is always present in the
fermented mash of sugars. In 1858
Pasteur found 3.5% of glycerin in the
mashes of beers and wines. During
World War I, Germany, although al-
most completely blockaded, supplied
24,000,000 pounds a year of glycerin
from two dozen large plants by the
fermentation of beet sugar. After the
war, work was continued on this pro-
cess in France, England, and the
United States. However, the relative
cost of glycerin from fermentation of
sugars is such that it can be conducted
only as a wartime necessity, or during
peacetime to make up for some ab-
normal shortage.
The most important of the early
By
SEYMOUR A. FURBUSH, '41E
work was that of Grimaux and Lefevre
in 1887-8. They hydrogenated dieth-
oxyacetone in the cold to diethyline,
then de-ethylated this to glycerin.
Their difficulty was obtaining com-
mercial quantities of diethoxyacetone.
In 1934 Darzens revived this work,
and after three years found a new
method for preparing the hitherto rare
and expensive diethoxyacetone on a
commercial scale by condensing two
molecules of ethyl-ethoxyacetate into
the corresponding diethoxyacetone, us-
ing dry sodium ethylate in the presence
of toluene. With the diethoxyacetone
available, he followed Grimaux's pro-
cedure, carrying out the de-ethylation
in an enameled autoclave for eight
hours at 120 degrees C. with four times
the theoretical weight of concentrated
hydrochloric acid.
The present methods of cracking
petroleum discharge considerable
amounts of olefins from the stills, and
these olefins emerge from the de-
butanizer as largely propylene. Start-
ing with petroleum gas olefins, several
methods for synthesizing glycerin are
suggested. One of our major oil
companies has worked out a process
from the basic reactions and is now,
after several years of laboratory work,
operating a pilot plant producing 2,000
pounds of synthetic glycerin a day.
The first and most obvious method
for the synthesis of glycerin is the
hydrolysis of 1, 2, 3-trichlorpropane:

stumbling block, it cannot be prepared

propane which can be easily obtained
by adding chlorine to propylene. How-
ever, it can be made by adding chlorine
to allyl chloride.
Glycerin may be made also by the
hydrolysis of di- or mono-chlorohydrin.
These are made by the addition of
hypochlorous acid to allyl chloride or
allyl alcohol, respectively. So again
allyl chloride appeared to be the key
material, and after many other similar
arguments, it was arrived at as the
most practical starting point for glyc-
erin synthesis.
The chlorination of olefins is fraught
with a great many complications be-
cause of the many different substitu-
tion products which are possible.
Temperature is the key to straighten-
ing all these out, but there was prac-
tically no information in the literature
on the subject. After exhaustive re-
search had been carried out, it was
determined that the chlorination of
olefins (in this case propylene) at 400-
600 degrees C. limited the reaction
to virtually one substitution. At this
temperature there is a considerable
number of mechanical and chemical
difficulties, and the experimenters
found that a sudden complete inflam-
mation of the material resulting in
nothing but HC1 and carbon occurred
rather easily and frequently.

All these possibilities have been
worked out successfully, as has the
electrolytic chlorhydrination of allyl
alcohol. But the actual operating de-
tails are still kept secret.
The hydrolysis of allyl chloride or
glycerin chlorhydrin is difficult because
so many by-products may be formed
by slight variations of conditions, es-
pecially of pH and temperature, dur-
ing hydrolysis. Automatic controls,
operated by tungsten, calomel, and
glass electrodes at various points
throughout the plant were devised;
highly toxic, and it was feared that
the final glycerin might contain toxic
or irritant impurities. But severe tests
found the refined glycerin to be as
pure or purer than U. S. P. glycerin
from fats.
Glycerin has joined ethyl alcohol and
a host of other compounds in the trend
toward chemical synthesis in the place
of fermentation, so long popular be-
cause of the feeling that microorgan-
isms worked long hours at low wages.
High pressure and temperature syn-
theses have given us not only new
compounds but also new prices for old
compounds.
In the final analysis, the real value
of synthetic glycerin from petroleum
gas lies in the possibility of stabilizing
the price of this so widely used com-
modity. The syntheses recently devel-
oped for large-scale production are not
intended to compete with existing

Refining crude synthetic glycerin presents new problems
these in turn regulate continuously
through motor driven valves the
streams of organic chlorides and the
alkali used in the hydrolysis.
The refining of the crude glycerin
by this process presents new features
not found in refining glycerin from fat.
Certain intermediate products, par-
ticularly allyl chloride and alcohol, are
methods to the extent of driving the
price down to unprofitable levels. But
nevertheless, here is a new process
which could produce all of the world's
glycerin needs. Such a process could,
if present units should ever be unable
to meet demands, be used by the
petroleum industry to relieve the
pressure.

date breaker
One of our sophomore engineers had
the unusual good fortune to meet a
likely wench, and soon thereafter called
her up for a date to the Union the
following Friday. She consented readi-
ly, and he was congratulating himself
when his roommate asked whether he
was going to the Union Formal. Why,
no. When? Friday? Ohh!

A brief council of war, then back to
the phone to explain to the eager young
voice (that sounded as if it knew about
the formal) that he had a ticket for
the M-Club dance, and had just found
out it was on Saturday, not Friday.
But she already had a date for Satur-
day.
That Saturday night found him im-
bibing a coke in the Betsy Ross after
a show with some of the boys. He
was just concluding a loud account of
his recent exploit with, "Well, anyway,
I sure was glad to get out of that
damn' formal, etiquette or no eti-
quette," when he suddenly turned
purple as a young woman emerged with
her escort from the adjoining booth
and gave him a look that froze his
blood.
His technically trained brain worked
at lightning speed as he sought a way
out. Recalling some of the unpleasant-
ries of Hell Week, he suddenly saw the
solution. Asserting still more loudly,
"Damn it, you guys, I don't care if
you do take it out of my hide." He
rushed over to the couple and said
nobly:
"They made me do it, but this is the
last straw. I don't mind the paddling
if only I can straighten things out with
vou. Don't worry, though, I can take
it."
With a gesture of calm acceptance
of his fate, he threw back his shoulders,
and strode back to his seat while the
now admiring female was dragged
away by her disgruntled escort.

If you are good at ancient history,
you probably remember the wreck on
the Michigan Central just before school
started last fall, when somebody put a
spike on the rails. You remember he
was caught.

You probably don't realize, though,
that the Ann Arbor police force just
succeeded in preventing another sabo-
teur from committing a crime.
A senior in the Transportation De-
partment worked for the New York
Central system last summer. Shortly
after the wreck, he and a friend were
down at the station, inspecting the
damage, as well as spying out the meth-
ods of operation of that great terminal.
Before they left, they couldn't resist
the temptation to lay a penny on the
track so a train would flatten it out.
Some conscientious citizen witnessed
the act, and called in the police. The
boys were promptly arrested, and given
a thirty-day suspended sentence.
resolutions
We left school a few weeks ago after
hectic hours catching up on lab reports,
going to bluebooks unprepared, and
generally wandering around in a daze.
Then came Christmas shopping, and
Christmas vacation, and that left us in
more of a daze than ever. So, when
New Year's came around, we broke
our usual custom and made some reso-
lutions. Among them were:
Not to go to the show the night be-
fore a bluebook. (It lasted two days
after school started.)
Not to cut four-hour labs—they have
to be made up. (We're going to break
that one tomorrow.)
Not to overrun our allowance.
(Lasted six days.)
Not to sleep through our eight
o'clocks. (Broken twice already—we've
had two eight o'clocks.)

One still stands: not to celebrate
New Year's Eve again next year. What
a headache!

"the" senior
If one were to turn to the 140th
page of the Student Directory, the
thirteenth name one would read would
be "Morrison, Robert Joseph, '4IE,
'42BAd." If the reader were a senior
engineer, he would pause for a moment,
for to classmates, that name repre-
sents ''the senior" of the year. Bob's
record shows an outstanding talent for
doing everything; perhaps most out-
standing for making friends in the
process.
Bob's father once attended the Uni-
versity of Michigan, but the war cut
short his studies, and he never gradu-
ated here. He was living in Flint
when Bob was born in 1920. At the
age of four, Bob and the rest of the
family moved to Greeley, Colorado,
where the elder Morrison completed
his work for a B. A. Eight years at
Greeley, and the family took a long
jump to New York City, where they
stopped a year before going on to
Montclair, New Jersey.
In high school at Montclair, Bob's
extracurricular activities had their be-
ginning. At first, they were mainly
sports, and he deeply regrets that he
has not had time for them at college.
Four years of tennis, three of them on
state championship teams, plus three
years of basketball, served to keep Bob
in shape. But just for a balanced diet,
he was also on the varsity debate squad
and was News Editor of the College
High Crier.
Two days after the Morrisons moved
to Trenton in the fall of 1(&gt;37, Bob
started out for Ann Arbor to enter the
Engineering College. The freshman
class elected him its president, and he
served as an Engineering Council rep-
resentative. That year he pledged
Kappa Sigma. In the spring, he was
initiated into Phi Eta Sigma, and he
tried out for the freshman tennis team.
However, a setback by "Mr. Sickness"
forced him to drop tennis, and he
never got around to going out again.
Bob spent the next summer as a
counselor in a boy's camp in northern
Jersey. Back in Ann Arbor, in the
fall, he kept busy on the lower council
of the Interfraternity Council, and as
Finance Chairman of the Soph Prom.
Just to keep in his hand at the gentle
art of studying. Bob attended summer
school in the summer of 1939. On the
basis of this experience he recommends
that everyone take a dose of the same
medicine.
There was another reason why Bob
found summer school valuable: his
own invention, the Arch. Bob con-
ceived this freshman engineers' hand-
book, and published the first one almost
singlehanded in the fall of 1939. Short-
ly afterward, he was tapped for

Triangles. He was no sooner through
with one initiation than another tap-
ping awaited him, from then until he
became a member of Michigamua in
the spring. In between were Tau
Beta Pi, Vulcans, and Scabbard and
Blade. Bob's recognized leadership led
to his election as President of both the
Engineering Council and Tau Beta Pi.
In addition to the above. Bob managed
to find time for the Honor Council,
Student Committee for Professional
Practice, and Bureau of Student Co-
operation.
With all this, one would think Bob's
summer might reasonably consist of a
"time out." Instead Bob divided his
time last summer between the R.O.T.C.
camp at Aberdeen, Maryland and a
position on the engineering staff of
Proctor and Gamble.
This fall Bob has added the position
of Patrons Chairman of the Engineer-
ing Ball and membership on the Men's
Judiciary Council to his already
crowded schedule. Incidentally Bob is
now in the School of Business Ad-
ministration. (The Bus-Ad students,
by the way, were informed this fall
that they would have to drop all
thoughts of outside activities, as their
classes would require "all of their
time.")
According to Bob, there are three
types of senior BMOC's: the first has
done a "helluva lot," the second is do-
ing a "helluva lot," and the third just
hangs on. He continues this philosophy
by observing that juniors usually make
the best promoters for activities. Those
who have been prominent are tired of
it; the ones who are prominent are too
busy; and the "so-so's" haven't the
energy. The juniors still have their
reputations to make, and they will
get behind and push.
It all adds up nicely, until one looks
at Bob himself. He fails to fall into
any of these categories, for he not only
has done but is doing a "helluva lot."

Since the age of ten, Professor Ben-
jamin Franklin Bailey has been dab-
bling with electrical apparatus. It was
at that age that he started construct-
ing telegraph systems, rude telephones,
and other devices. But, unlike other
boys of his day, Ben Bailey continued
his contact with electricity by further-
ing his work in that line of endeavor.
Because he was brought up in a period
when new methods and machinery for
improving industry's efficiency were
needed, he applied his unusual ability
toward the development of electrical
apparatus for that purpose.
After taking a science course in a
Detroit high school, he came to the
University of Michigan to begin actual
work in his profession, which seemed

It is an old saying that "it's a poor workman who
blames his tools". But shop foremen know that even
the best operator cannot turn out precise and well
finished work on a lathe with worn or faulty head-
stock gears.
To make sure of maintained accuracy at this vital
spot, a well-known lathe maker has standardized on
carburized Nickel-Molybdenum steels — using SAE
4815 for drive gears and SAE 4615 for the transmis-
sion gears.
These two Molybdenum steels, in addition to hav-
ing the requisite core strength and toughness, car-
burize to 55-60 Rockwell "C" with minimum distortion.
Consequently proper initial adjustment is simple and
freedom from trouble due to worn teeth is assured
for an extended service period. Thus precision guards
precision for years.
You will find our book, "Molybdenum in Steel",
both practical and helpful. It contains a great deal
of data on modern materials for modern needs. We
will gladly send it free on request to technical students
and others interested.

from that early age of ten to be pre-
destined for him. In the forty years
which have elapsed since his college
graduation, Professor Bailey has made
a number of inventions which are now
in general use and which have proved
themselves of material benefit to
society.
The single-phase capacitor type
motor, completed in 1925, is the most
important of these. The development
of this motor disproved a theory which
had stated that single-phase motors

Professor Bailey
Didn't become a physician
could never have the efficiency of two-
phase motors. This was made possible
when he invented a new capacitor or
condenser to replace the expensive
commercial capacitor of that time.
Automobile ignition and lighting sys-
tems, starting mechanisms for motors
of high starting torque, electrolytic
interruptors and rectifiers, a device for
cooling completely enclosed motors,
and a synchronous motor for electric
clocks are a few of the more important
things which he has either invented or
improved. Professor Bailey's prin-
ciple of invention is to find fault with
and improve what exists. He says it
is a process of analysis and change.
Professor Bailey has held positions
as tester, designer, chief engineer, and
consulting engineer for various elec-
trical manufacturing companies in the
United States. While with a large
manufacturing firm as their chief en-
gineer, he completely redesigned their
line of induction motors, and a-c and
d-c generators. At the present time, he
is kept busy as a patent expert on
various legal cases.
Incidentally, Professor Bailey re-
ceived his B. S. in Electrical Engineer-
ing, his M. S., and his Ph. 1). at the
University of Michigan. He is a Fellow
in the American Institute of Electrical
Engineers, and has membership in
Sigma Xi, Tau Beta Pi, Masons,
Society for the Promotion of Engineer-
ing Education, the National Electrical
Manufacturers Association, and
various faculty committees.
His ancestry on his mother's side is
English, while his paternal ancestors
have been Americans for six genera-
tions back. One of his forbears, Joshua
Bailey, fought in the Revolutionary
War. Both his father and one uncle
were physicians. In one emergency
he helped his father amputate a wo-
man's arm. He didn't become a phy-
sician.
Current economic problems do not
worry Professor Bailey too much, al-
though he would like to see a complete
economic upheaval and reorganization.
He believes that so much gold coming
into the United States is not favorable
because we are shipping out our manu-
factured products and receiving, in re-
turn, this gold which is a materially
impractical substance. A more per-
sonal economic philosophy was ex-
pressed in Professor Bailey's compari-
son of himself to Henry Ford. He said,
"We are both financially sufficient; we
are both wearing the same material
for clothes, but Henrv pavs more for
his."

Just to keep the record straight, be-
cause another fellow on campus has a
similar name, Charley Barker tells us
that his middle name is Leicester, pro-
nounced '"Lester." He was born in
Maplewood, New Jersey but has lived
most of his life in Limona, Florida,
not far from Tampa. Charley began
swimming in the Gulf of Mexico at
eight, but never went out for a team
until his senior year in high school.
At the University of Tampa he made
his first contact with higher education.
After a year there, during which he
participated in freshman swimming
and fencing, he decided that he wanted
to be an aeronautical engineer, and
began looking for a school with a good
aero department. Conquering his fear
of the frigid North, he entered Michi-
gan in the fall of 1937 as a freshman in
the College of Engineering. Apparent-
ly it was a good choice, since Charley
has made out quite well here. A var-
sity swimmer, he has been elected to
Triangles, Vulcans, and Scabbard and
Blade, and is a member of Chi Phi
Fraternity.
Swimming is, of course, Charley's
big extra-curricular interest. He is
best known for the 50 and 100-yard
freestyle events, although he is no
mean backstroker. In his sophomore
year he took first place in the 100 and
tied for first in the 50 at the National
Intercollegiate Meet. He also won
the Big Ten 150-yard backstroke, and
was elected to the All-American Swim-
ming Team. He remembers Michi-
gan's victory over Yale in the 400-yard
freestyle relay% when both teams broke
the existing world's record, as his most
thrilling race.
Charley gives credit for Michigan's
sensationally strong swimming teams
almost wholly to Matt Mann's coach-
ing, since he believes the material Matt
gets is about average.
Charley spent last summer in Ann
Arbor taking the primary C. A. A.
course, and is now taking the advanced
training. With that and swimming and

Charley Barker
Feared the frigid North
studying, he has little time to himself.
When he graduates in June, Charley
will go to Fort Custer for six weeks to
get his commission as a reserve officer
in the Corps of Engineers. After that,
he is not sure just what he will do.
If he goes into the Army, he hopes to
get into the Aviation Corps; if not,
he would like to do some work such as
aviation design.

MAY MADNESS
There once was a Viking
Discovered at hiking
Along on a hot summer day.
Through some kind of slip
He had mislaid his ship,
And so, he was thumbing his way.
ELMER
Elmer Henry Dinkus—
He wasn't very bright,
For when he did arithmetic,
He never got it right.
He couldn't even figure
When the train was due;
And so, the thing that happened
Was sad but also true.
The engine took off Elmer's legs,
The cars removed an arm;
But otherwise, I'm glad to say,
He came to no great harm.
In fact, he found arithmetic
No longer was a chore.
He was better off, in fractions,
Than he ever was before.
TOO FAST
We live too fast. Our days are full of
tension;
To rush about, is everyone's defect.
The looking glass deserves the highest
mention,
For sometimes we do pause there,
and reflect.
We used to jog about by horse and
buggy,
Or even stay at home in case of rain.
Today, in weather hot or cold or
muggy, ^
We zip along in air-conditioned train.
By subway and by cab we make
connection—
Or if we miss the boat, we're very
sore;
We lose our tempers if we miss one
section
Of the brass-and-leatherbound
revolving door.
We grow impatient with the elevator;
It stops so much, the average speed
is low.
Perhaps that's why we like the
escalator—
The damned thing is forever on
the go!
By clock and watch we run our nervous
races,
From ticks to chimes we make the
minutes whiz;
And every day, as more clocks show
their faces,
The more of time we have, the less
there is.
MORE SURREALISM
The table sat around the chairs,
The fire was in the fat;
And where the tree grew on the pears,
The liver ate the cat.
The picture ran around the frame,
A tenor sang some bass,
And while the difference was the same,
He stood upon his face.
The organ, tugging at its chord.
Was starting all its stops,
And when the sawdust came aboard
The bottom spun the tops.
FISHING
Pulling out at sunrise when the fog is
on the bay,
Chugging past the inlet where the little
wild ducks play,
Going on a fishing jaunt to last the
livelong day.
Stopping by a bass hole just to make
an early cast,
Bringing in a big one before the mist
has passed—-
Fearing, hoping, wondering how long
our luck will last?
Trolling down the long stretch and
staying close to shore,
Catching just one pickerel and trying
to catch more,
And watching how Old Sol climbs up
to go about his chore.
Tying up at noontide on a tinted strip
of sand,
Frying fish on embers whose flames the
breeze had fanned,
Eating long and hearty ere the hunger
pangs are banned.
Cleaning up the dishes while thinking
of a swim,
Skipping stones on water just to see
how far they'd skim,
Stripping for a hasty plunge and dress-
ing with a vim.
Launching into afternoon to try the
copper troll,
Using quite a heavy spoon to play the
minnow role,
Bringing in a salmon trout to prove we
make the goal.
Pulling in at sunset when the calm is
on the bay,
Coming past the inlet where the little
wild ducks play,
Coming back to camp from fishing all
the livelong day.

quiet, please!
Just about the quietest spot in the
world is the new sound proof "listen-
ing laboratory" recently completed in
a large eastern factory right in one of
the main operating aisles. The new
laboratory, used as an inspection
chamber for household refrigeration
units, is the only sound proof chamber
in the world that is not completely
sealed from the outside when in use.
It is constructed in the form of a
labyrinth consisting of a series of wind-
ing passage-ways with 90 and 180
degree turns. Near the middle of these
passages is the actual sound proof
chamber. It is a 21,000 pound "float-
ing room," supported by twenty steel
springs. Thus it is free from any plant
vibrations, which are a constant source
of noise.
The walls of the room are one foot
thick, comprising eight layers of con-
crete, tile, dead air space, rock wool,
and airplane type felting. The laby-
rinth walls are six inches thick, made

W estittg homt
The ear is better
of concrete with a sound absorbing
surface. These passages exclude most
of the sound.
Final tests, made with sensitive noise
meters, show that the noise level of
the laboratory is 31 decibels. This may
seem high, but compare it with some
other places. The ordinary quiet home
has a level of 45 decibels, an executive
office, one of 50. The noise level of
the factory surrounding the room is
85 decibels. The gurgle of water in a
small fountain, or loud whispering
average between 40 and 57 decibels.
Conversation has to be carried on
in whispers, a normal talk gives the
effect of shouting. It is so quiet that
the sound of breathing resembles a
small air bellows in action, and the
snap of fingers sounds like a pistol
shot.
The refrigerator motor and compres-
sor units, carried through the labyrinth
on an endless chain conveyor, are
tested, not with noise meters, but by
inspectors. These men are chosen for
their exceptional hearing ability.
As each unit passes before a small
sounding board, the inspector bends
close and listens. If it fails to meet
the specifications, it is sent back for
re-adjustment.
Human ears have been called on to
perform this inspection because sound
meters have been found incapable of
giving correct readings on this type of
work. The inspectors, because of their
acute hearing and the extreme silence
of the room, can detect small variations
in the sound of the running motors.
liquid wood
The chemist has long been producing
solids through the mixture of liquids
but the procedure was recently re-
versed when a process for liquefying
wood was developed. The wood is
subjected to high pressures in a sealed
tank.
The steam from the boiling wood
can be separated into all the primary,
commercially valuable chemicals that
form the original wood. These raw
materials hold great promise for future
synthetic organic chemicals. One of
these chemicals may be substituted for
coal as a raw material in the manu-
facture of nylon.
flat engine
Aircraft producers are rapidly ap-
proaching the ideal of the "flying
wing." As the drag of the landing
gear, external supports, and even the
fuselage is being reduced, it becomes
increasingly important to eliminate the
drag of exposed engine nacelles.

wing. One manufacturing company
has produced a suitable "flat" engine,
which may meet the demands of our
military and naval aircraft.
The engine has twelve cylinders, six
on each side of the crankshaft. The
overall height is only 37 inches, as
into the makeup of trucks and auto-
mobiles.
Hundreds of detailed drawings—a
bundle of blueprints weighing not an
ounce less than 186 pounds —outlined
down to the minutest detail the way
the Army experts of the Rock Island
arsenal wanted the tank built. From

The "flat" engine is only 37 inches high
Scientific American
compared with the 49 to 54 inch diam-
eter of the conventional radial, air-
cooled motor. Its size and low frontal
area allow it to be mounted within the
wing. The airplane designer will have
to overcome a shift of the center of
gravity toward the rear, but this should
not be too difficult. This flat engine
is liquid cooled, of course.
wooden tank
Suppose you had to build tanks for
the Army, huge twenty-five tonners,
nine feet high and eighteen feet long.
Each had to be as powerful as a loco-
motive and engineered as delicately as
a Swiss watch. Would you take time
out to build a life-size, working model
out of wood?
An automobile manufacturer faced
with a major defense assignment did
just that, as a check and double check
on S100,000 worth of preparatory en-
gineering work—work that kept nearly
200 men poring over plans and blue-
prints from early morning until mid-
night for weeks on end.
Essential part of the tank order was
to provide a plant capable of turning
out these "land battleships" in volume
day after day, five each in an eight-
hour shift, or as many as 14 daily in
three-shift operation. That meant a
new plant laid out for maximum effi-
ciency; it meant new specialized ma-
chinery designed to turn out the many
powerful, elaborate parts as exact and
interchangeable as the parts that go
the specification data the production
men and engineers of the automobile
company had to develop the machinery
requirements and plant layout—a pro-
gram ranging from armor plate to
transmission gears—in such shape that
months later, when millions of dollars
of equipment had been assembled, the
tanks that rolled off the line would
work perfectly.
With so much at stake, an absolute
check on accuracy of the designs for
each part was essential. The blueprints
had been developed to varying scale
depending upon the part involved.
Some were full size, some half, some
quarter scale. So the order was given:
build a tank out of wood.
Pattern makers took the Army blue-
prints off to the pattern shops, and
quickly carved each portion of the
tank out of wood to the specified
measurements. Varnished, sanded and
varnished again to satin smoothness,
the parts were brought together and
assembled.
These preliminary steps revealed
that the designed parts would mesh
perfectly, that it would be unnecessary
to change important dimensions, that
no time would be lost in reworking
metal or refitting parts when produc-
tion got underway.
Now plant erection and provision for
the supply of parts to be made out-
side could be undertaken. At last it
was possible to set dates and make
commitments to deliver honest-to-
goodness metal tanks as ordered.
At that stage the "dummy" tank
was dismantled, so that machine tool
makers could determine and develop
machines to shape steel parts into a
likeness of the wooden pattern.
This is the secret of mass production.
It is the art of turning out thousands
of parts all so exact that any set of
them can be assembled into a perfect
product.

TUE A NUMBER
AMONTH hence some of the engi-
neering students are going to dust
off their portable radios and dig out their
seldom used playing cards. Armed with

You'll have to wait
these distractions, they will arise in
the cold, gray dawn and form in line
before a locked door in one of the engi-
neering buildings. Many of them will
do this without bothering to ask why,
despite the fact that there are more
congenial times and places for playing
bridge and listening to the radio. They
are sure of only one thing, they have to
get a low classification number.
Freshmen, of course don't have to
worry about numbers. All they have
to do to classify is to choose the correct
blue-printed schedule. But in the fol-
lowing three years they find classifi-
cation a considerably more
irksome procedure. And the
part of it that is most an-
noying and inefficient is the
system of securing the num-
bers that tell them when
they will be able to arrange
their schedules.
Last year some groups on
campus decided it was time
something was done about
the problem. Triangles,
junior engineering honorary
society, investigated the
existing system of classifi-
cation in general, and rec-
ommended some changes
which removed a few of the
objectionable features. In
April the Technic sum-
marized the bad points and
suggested several improve-
ments.
One of the greatest time
savers would be the require-
ment that all courses elected
be approved in advance by
a faculty member. This
would require short con-
ferences for each student;
these conferences could be
distributed among the facul-
ty and be spread out over
the latter half of the semester, thereby
working no hardship on any one pro-
fessor. Classification material could
then be distributed in advance.
Probably most important of all, a
different system of allocating classi-
fication numbers is needed. For ex-
ample, why not follow the scheme of
alphabetical distribution used for regis-
tration? Waiting in line would be
eliminated, high and low numbers
would be shared fairly since the order
rotates completely every two years,
and periodic rush and slack times would
be avoided. However, this method,
admittedly ideal, is not used because
of the great amount of bookkeeping
which would be required.
The only alternative, then, is the
idea adopted by the Department of
Mechanical Engineering last year—
drawing the numbers from a hat. That
is, just before a reasonable hour in
the morning, all the mechanicals of
one class met in a classroom, and pre-
cisely on the hour the door was locked.
The men present were counted and a
corresponding number of numbered
slips placed in a hat. Then each stu-
dent in turn drew one of the slips,
wrote his name on it, and returned it
to the professor in charge. From these
slips the classification lists were made
up.
Practically all students are willing
to gamble on their numbers, if they
don't have to get up at five in the morn-
ing. And so this method has been
favorably received in the Mechanical
Department. The Committee on Clas-
sification intends to try it out once
more on the mechanicals before recom-
mending it to other departments, par-
ticularly to the Chemical from which
come the most complaints.
If you aren't satisfied with the wax-
it's being done now in your department
(and most of us aren't), there's still
time to do something about it before
classification for the second semester.
It's entirely up to the students to pro-
vide the driving force for this sorely
needed change by expressing their
opinions to their classifiers and espec-
ially to their department heads and
members of the Classification Com-
mittee. Here's a chance for a big
improvement in our college. All we
have to do is ask for it.

Research sefup in a corner of the Electrical Machinery Laboratory

Oscillogram of Rotor Bar Current showing various frequency components
Among its other functions, the Department of Electrical Engineering conducts extensive research work. Above is shown apparatus
which has been developed to find out what is happening inside the rotating element of an induction motor.
The induction motor is the simplest form of electric motor, and the rotating part in these motors is usually a "squirrel cage."
This consists merely of a rotating body of laminated steel sheets with copper bars passing through punched holes. These bars are not
insulated; they are in direct contact with the iron and they are connected together by circular copper rings at both ends of the rotor.
In spite of the extremely simple construction of this rotor, what was really happening in it was a mystery until recently. This
came about through the obvious difficulty of placing a measuring instrument in a circuit consisting of heavy copper bars and rings. However,
a method has been developed by which we can determine what happens in any part of the rotor bar; and incidentally, the currents differ
markedly depending upon what part of the bar is considered. The oscillogram shown above will indicate the intricate nature of the
currents. For the first time a designer of these motors is given an accurate picture of what is really happening inside.

One of the first was in Douglas County, Nebraska,
which recently installed a number of G-K trans-
miners and receivers.
Among those responsible for many of the G-K
developments which have made two-way FM pos-
sible are I. R. Weir (Rose Poly, *2i) and H. P.
Thomas (Harvard, '25)—transmitter engineers;
and W. C. White (Columbia, "12) and K. C. De-
Walt (Iowa, '27)— vacuum tube engineers.

GREASED LIGHTNING
^HIRTY-ONE hundred revolutions a minute
is lightning fast all right. But when a
rearing revolving at that speed makes more noise
than a boiler factory and coasts to a stop in 12
conds, then it's time to look for a good lubricant.

There's a catch though; the bearing is a part of an
x-ray tube and operates in a high vacuum.The
tendency of oil and grease to vaporize under th&lt;
conditions makes it impossible to use ordir
lubricants.
So G. K. X-Ray Corporation engineers Atl
(Oregon State, '29), Filmcr (Armour Tech, '31),
and Wilson (College of F.mporia, '31) set to wot"
and developed a new lubricant—barium. When a
thin film of this metal was applied to the bearing,
its speed rose to over 3500 rpm, the noise of
operation was materially reduced, and the coasting
time was increased to eight minutes.
The benefit of these young men's research is not
limited to the x-ray field alone, for their findings
will apply equally well in all cases where rotating
devices operate in a vacuum.

GARGANTUAN GARAGE
IK Burlington Railroad officials would give their
permission, you could drive their Twin
Zephyrs into the newest kiln of the Permanente
cement mill in California and still have enough
room left over for a large freight car.
This cement kiln, one of the largest pieces
rotating machinery in industry, measures 4&gt;o by
14 feet. It will be used in furnishing 6,ooo,c
barrels of cement for the construction of Shast
Dam.
The kiln will be driven by a 200-hpG-K motor
the largest ever built for this purpose and repre-
senting an innovation in design as well as size.
The big motor was tested by young engineering
college graduates taking the General Electric Tc
Course at Schenectady.

Bearing wisdom for young engineers
The more you know about tapered roller
bearings the more efficient and valuable you will be
when you enter the field of practical engineering.
Specifying bearings is one of the mechanical engineer's
most difficult and responsible jobs, but a thorough
knowledge of the design, application and advantages
of TIMKEN Tapered Roller Bearings makes it one of
the simplest.
Every bearing problem you ever are likely to be faced
with in any kind of machinery can be solved by the
proper selection and application of TIMKEN Bearings,
because these bearings combine every bearing require-
ment—friction elimination; radial, thrust and combined
load capacity; and ability to hold moving parts in cor-
rect and constant alignment.
Now—while you are studying—is the time to learn about
TIMKEN Bearings. Write for a free copy of the Timken
Reference Manual; no better text book is available.

VIBRATION DAMPING BY THICK PLATE METHOD
Within the past five years tremendous strides
have been made in the quieting of automobiles,
railway cars, and other vehicular bodies through
the application of vibration damping materials,
commonly termed sound deadening materials.
A material typical of that commonly used
in 1936 models gave a record, as obtained by
the University of Michigan thick plate method,
well over six feet long, indicating relatively poor
damping.
The records for the material typical of those
used in the 1938 models were less than one-
tenth as long, indicating improved sound dead-
ening.
The material typical of the 1940 models
again shows improvement, the record again be-
ing appreciably shortened.
That the end has not been reached in the
ability to dampen is indicated by the thick plate
record of a special treatment developed by the
University research staff. This treatment makes
the plate so dead, acoustically speaking, that
when the ball strikes it, it sounds like a lump
of soft putty hit with a fist.
One of the phases of the University's re-
search service to industry is the development
of new and improved products.

A shiny key is not the insignia
of a mutual admiration society.
MEMBERSHIP II
HONOR SOCIETIES
By
WALTER C. SADLER
Associate Professor
of Civil Engineering
"LJTONOR societies generally have the
*• expressed purpose of marking in
a fitting manner those who have con-
ferred honor on their Alma Mater by
distinguished scholarship, or leadership
in extra-curricular activities.
While it is true that the original con-
cepts of certain groups were rather nar-
row, these have been gradually broad-
ened down through the years, with the
result that membership requirements
of today include scholarship, person-
ality, leadership and general aptitude
for probable success. Individual soci-
eties place their own relative emphasis
on these various factors. It is indicative
of a growing strength that many of these
societies, some of which have been in
active existence for over a half century,
are continually raising their own mem-
bership standards.
Contrary to some popular opinion,
honor fraternities are in no sense "self-
adoration" societies. The election of
new members is treated most seriously.
Eligible classmates are privately investi-
gated for weeks prior to election, and
the election meeting itself frequently ex-
tends into the wee hours of the morning,
with brothers in the faculty invited to
preside to insure an impartial selection
of the finest class possible.
Undergraduate membership in an
honor society is very valuable. The as-
sembling together of any group with a
common interest is bound to develop
most pleasant relationships and lasting
friendships. These benefits are present
in all professional societies, it is true,
and to that extent justify the existence
of any society. However, it is probable
that the average honor society offers
a little more intimate friendship, and
therefore a little more effective means
to fully appreciate one's classmates.
There is another value, however,
which is frequently overlooked. Ev-
erybody has his own shortcomings and
this certainly applies to members of
honor societies. An apparently brilliant
student may have accomplished his fine
academic record through an untiring
determination to make the most out of
studies, with the result that his social
development has been sadly neglected.
A second type may be endowed by na-
ture with the social graces, with a re-
sulting unbalanced interest in such ac-
tivities. Again, a fine technical scholar
may have only a casual interest in the
purely research or production phase of
engineering, but possess real promise in
the business side of engineering work.
Undergraduate membership in an active
honor society offers a rare opportunity
of rubbing elbows with many different
personalities and has an advantage of
inestimable value. These personal con-
tacts may not of themselves be conclu-
sively profitable, but they do offer a
wonderful opportunity for the wide-
awake and alert member who is grad-
ually developing that mature concept of
social relations which he will experience
upon graduation. In fact this particular
characteristic is present also in the mod-
ern social fraternity and is possibly one
of the strongest justifications for mem-
bership in that type of organization.
The question is frequently raised as
to the advantages of membership in an
honor society, after graduation from
college. It is quite possible that the
membership in any college organization
is of but limited value in securing a job
and particularly in holding one. How-
ever, college alumni, generally speaking,
look back upon, their undergraduate
days with pardonable pride particularly
in the matter of incidental membership
in an honor society. With the passage
of years, it is quite possible that they
unconsciously expand in their own mind
the standard of admission to the honor
society in which they were elected. But
irrespective of this, experience indicates
that alumni look upon the average re-
cent graduate, with a membership in
an honor society, as having accom-
plished some worthwhile things in col-
lege and as offering promise of success.
They respect him for his capacity to
concentrate as well as his mental de-
velopment and matured personality. A
person trying to evaluate the importance
of honor societies should consider this
aspect.
In conclusion it might well be noted
that the initiation ritual of an honor so-
ciety carries the very important advice
to the initiate that his election must not
be considered as the accomplishment of
a goal, but rather merely as a milestone
indicative of a capacity and determina-
tion to succeed. Above all, honor mem-
bership does not insure a breathing spell
for one to rest upon his oars, but rather
a deep seated obligation to dig in and
make the most of one's resources, what-
ever the calling.

Broadest, next oldest field
of engineering, Mechan-
ical still develops rapidly.
Pennsylvania Railroad Mutual Magazine
IT STARTED WITH STEAM
IN 1764 at the College of Glasgow, a
young man names James Watt was
called upon to repair a small model of
an atmospheric steam engine, the prin-
ciple of which had been discovered some
fifty years before by Xewcomen, I'apin,
and others. This incident led to a series
of developments in the steam engine, as
well as to the design of other mechani-
cal equipment which resulted a century
later in the designation of that kind of
engineering as "Mechanical.*' Before
this time, and in fact until the begin-
ning of the 19th century, the term "en-
gineering" referred to the building and
operation of equipment for military pur-
poses. About the year 1828 "Civil En-
gineering" was made a separate branch
of engineering, applying to the building
of roads, docks, etc., and including the
operation, construction, and use of ma-
chinery for purposes not distinctly mil-
itary. Not until fifty years later were
further sub-divisions made, so Mechan-
ical Engineering was probably the first
division to be recognized as distinct from
Military and Civil. In later years came
Mining, Marine, Chemical, Electrical.
Architectural, Aeronautical, and the
other specialized fields.
In the early days Mechanical Engi-
neering was concerned largely with the
development and use of the steam en-
gine and its application to pumping, lo-
comotion, and the driving of mill ma-
chinery. Today it includes the genera-
tion and use of heat and power from
fuels, the design, construction, and ap-
plication of machinery for industrial
purpose, machine movements, mechan-
ical transmission, and the study and ap-
plication of efficiency methods in fac-
tory operation. In this field are included
such sub-divisions as Combustion,
Steam Power, Heating, Ventilation and
Air Conditioning, Internal Combustion
Engines, Automobiles, Hydraulic Ma-
chinery, and Machine Design, but there
is not now, nor can there be, any sharp
line of cleavage between Mechanical and
other major branches of engineering.
Only 150 years have elapsed since
Watt, Murdoch. Hornblower, and others
were struggling with the problem of
By
RANSOM S. HAWLEY
Chairman of the Department
of Mechanical Engineering
building a boiler that would generate
steam safely at pressures above atmos-
pheric, and an engine that would func-
tion with pressures as high as 10 pounds
gage. One of the most serious problems
in engine operation was the making of
steam tight joints. All sorts of available
materials, such as putty, soft lead, iron,
cement, rope, felt, and various mixtures,
were tried. Little was known of the
combustion of fuels or of the expansive
power of steam. Progress was necessar-
ily slow but these early experimenters
had unlimited perseverance and grad-
ually but surely the steam boiler and
engine reached a fairly high state of
perfection in the latter part of the past
century. Then followed the develop-
ment of the steam turbine, the water
tube boiler, the stoker, and pulverizer.
Today we have modern power plants
with boilers operating at all pressures
from atmospheric up to 3200 psi. and
with steam temperatures as high as 900
to 1000' F. Single units are in opera-
tion generating a million pounds of
steam per hour and delivering this steam

capacity with almost no interruptions.
In many plants a kilowatt-hour of elec-
tricity is being generated for each pound
of coal burned. Needless to say, this
could not have been accomplished with-
out corresponding developments in the
fields of Physics, Chemistry, Electricity,
Metallurgy, Mechanics, Shop Methods,
etc. In this connection it is interesting
to note that about 130 B.C. Hero in-
vented a rotating device similar in prin-
ciple to our present reaction turbine,
but nothing much was done about it
until 2000 years later.
Perhaps even more spectacular is the
development and use of the internal
combustion engine. From the crude ker-
osene engine of 50 years ago we have
now the modern efficient and dependable
units using the Otto or Diesel cycle,
built by the thousands for automobiles,
trucks, airplanes, ships, locomotives,
power generation, crane and shovel op-
eration, and similar equipment. It
should be mentioned here that Rudolph
Diesel, to whom is attributed the dis-
covery of the Diesel cycle, was born as
recently as 1867 and that most of the
improvements in the modern Diesel en-
gine have been made in the last 25 years.
It is interesting and rather amusing
to recall a few of the predictions made
only 35-40 years ago by prominent en-
gineers and professors at the time some
of us were taking our engineering
course. I recently dug up an old set of
notes on boilers and steam engines and
found that the water tube boiler might
eventually be a serious competitor with
the fire tube type: that the steam tur-
bine might be improved in time, so as
to be as economical as the Corliss En-
gine; that the centrifugal pump was
not likely to be used for boiler feeding
or other high pressure work; that the
kerosene or oil engine was very unre-
liable, difficult to start, and required
rather expensive fuel; that a speed of
60 miles per hour could be attained by
a locomotive but only for short periods
of time, and even if such an engine were
built, no one could drive it at that speed.
Today the above mentioned high pres-
sure boilers are fed by motor driven
and turbine driven centrifugal pumps
of the multi-stage type. Water is raised
from deep mines by the same type of
pump with high efficiency. We drive
along our highways at 60 to 80 miles
per hour, fly through the air at much
higher speeds in machines equipped with
the very efficient internal combustion
engine. We glide along rails at 100 and
more miles per hour in trains pulled by
locomotives powered by steam, the
Diesel engine, or the electric motor.
Perhaps no phase of Mechanical En-
gineering holds greater interest than the
modern factory with its maze of auto-
matic machinery for processing, machin-
ing, transmission, and handling. A visit
to a steel mill or to an automobile plant
is likely to leave one in a confused state
of mind. In the one we see enormous
mills taking huge billets of steel like so
much putty and rolling them into bars,
rods, plates, and rails. In the other huge
presses form these plates into auto
bodies, tops, and fenders in a single op-
eration. We go to our grocery store and
buy a package of cornflakes for a few
cents. Over in Battle Creek a single
machine automatically forms, fills,
weighs, and seals these packages at the
rate of 28 a minute. Automatic ma-
chines take in various kinds of raw ma-
terials and turn out finished parts in
such quantities that electric or weight
counting is necessary. A machine has
been designed to grade oysters in four
Shasta dam. It runs at 550 feet per
minute, carrying 1100 tons an hour
over streams, highways, and railroads.
History was made in 1807 when
Robert Fulton's steamboat churned its
way up the Hudson River to become
one of the first commercially success-
ful power driven vessels. For years
after, all loading and unloading of
steamships was done by hand, some-
times requiring several days after the
vessel docked. Today huge cranes and
other dock equipment perform the same
operations in a few hours. The latest
development is the self unloading steam-
ship which carries its own unloading
equipment for bulk materials. Last
summer I witnessed the unloading of a
freighter carrying 10,000 tons of coal.
It arrived at 10 P.M and anchored in a
harbor which had no dock equipment.
Thirty minutes later a conveyor boom
160 feet long had been swung out and
the machinery started. At 6 a.m. the
10,000 tons of coal was on the dock and
the freighter was on its way.
Air conditioning is a new phase of

sizes at the rate of 100 per minute. In
many of our modern plants me-
chanical conveyors, overhead trolleys
and mono-rails are timed to bring parts
in regular sequence to assembly lines.
Nor are these operations confined to
factory buildings. Out in California
a 36-inch belt conveyor ten miles long
has been put in operation during the
last year to deliver aggregates from a
preparation plant to the site of the

days some of us had the daily task of

of sitting in front of one of these affairs,
toasting one side while freezing the other

TEACHING THE GRADUATE
THE scope of the steel industry is
broader than is commonly realized.
Although predominantly a processing
and manufacturing industry, it is also
in part a mining and transportation in-
dustry, and in some cases includes ship
building and steel construction divisions.
The making of steel is a highly tech-
nical industry, offering special oppor-
tunity to engineering graduates. Its
diversity calls for specialized training
both in operation and general admin-
istration. While practical experience
still counts and always will, leaders are
being drawn more and more from col-
lege and university graduates.
The Bethlehem Steel Company has
for many years carried out a policy of
providing special opportunities for col-
lege graduates of promising ability to
obtain practical experience to fit them
for posts of responsibility. As far back
as the late 1890?s, one or two graduates
each year were given opportunities to
observe the operations of the various
departments. This came to be known
as "looping." In 1922, a plan was estab-
lished whereby each year a group of se-
lected graduates began their careers
under an organized system of training.
The Loop Course is open only to grad-
uates of the year in which the course
is held, who are seeking permanent em-
ployment. While no specific qualifica-
tions for entrance can be enumerated, it
is preferred to consider men who have
shown the qualities which make for sue-

cess. An outstanding record in scholar-
ship, leadership in extra-curricular ac-
tivities, and other evidences of initia-
tive, are well recognized indexes to fu-
ture accomplishment.
Before each class is organized, the
number and kind of opportunities for
placements are determined. Kach can-
didate is obliged to decide on the type
of work he desires, whether production,
sales, mining, or other. While many
Many corporations feel that engineer-
ing graduates need specialized training in
their line of work, and have organized
training programs. Here the TECHNIC
presents the second of a series of articles
describing such courses.
services and administrative departments
look to these training classes to fill va-
cancies, by far the greatest demand
comes from the operating divisions. For
these operating opportunities and also
for sales, technical graduates are desired.
The general purpose of the loop train-
ing course is to give the new employee
an understanding of all phases of the
company's activities. It helps some men
determine for which line of work they
are best fitted. For men who have de-
cided definitely where their interests
are. the course offers a background and
an opportunity to obtain a comprehen-
sive view of the operation of a modern
steel plant.
The course is divided into three gen-
era] parts. The four week training per-
iod at Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, is
taken by all members of the class. The
second phase differs, depending on what
department each man is to enter. The
third phase consists of actual training
on the job.
The first four weeks of training are
spent largely in the plant at Bethlehem.
An extended lecture course covers most
of the important features of the com-
pany's plants, properties, products, op-
erations, policies, and activities. The
men, under the supervision of the oper-
ating superintendents and their assist-
ants, visit various divisions and subdi-
visions of the plant. During the course,
the members of the class selected for
sales and production in steel plants and
other divisions are made acquainted with
the opportunities which then exist on
the various plants and divisions.
The men originally selected for steel
production are, at the conclusion of the
first four weeks, assigned as regular em-
ployees of the steel plants located
throughout the country. Each plant
conducts a training course for the men
assigned to it, similar to that employed
at Bethlehem. This second period, in
addition to being educational, enables
the management to make observations
that will lead to the placement of the
newly acquired graduates in positions to
the best interests of the company and
of the individuals. The procedure at
shipyards and mines follows closely that
of the steel plants.
After the men selected for training in
the sales department conclude the first
four-week period, they remain at the
Bethlehem plant for several months,
studying the basic operations of the in-
dustry, from the treatment of raw ma-
terials through the basic rolling of steels
and finished products of that plant.
Following this, they begin a tour of the
various home office product sales divi-
sions. Then they are taken on a tour
of the company's other steel plants.
Here emphasis is placed on the study
of the manufacture of all finished prod-
ucts. Following the visits at the plants,
they are tentatively assigned to the
home office product sales divisions.
Those who win assignments in such de-
partments as purchasing, accounting, in-
dustrial and public relations, and de-
velopment and research, pursue a course
of training within these departments.
Progress of loopers on the job is care-
fully followed. Every effort is made to
develop the abilities of the men, and
to make possible their advancement and
success.

the stratosphere will go the
air transport of the future.
STRATOSPHERE FLIGHT
By
CHARLES W. RANSON, '42E
ABOVE the earth are two definite
- layers of atmosphere. The tropo-
sphere, nearest the earth, extends up-
ward to an altitude varying between
30,000 and 45,000 feet. In this region,
vertical wind motions are common. The
temperature at the top varies between
-58 and -75° F.
The other layer is the stratosphere,
which extends from the troposphere to
an altitude estimated to be 150,000 feet.
It is believed there is a vacuum above
this height. In the stratosphere, wind
motions are predominantly horizontal.
Professor Auguste Piccard, during his
stratosphere balloon ascensions, found
that there were different strata of winds
blowing in various directions at differ-
ent levels. It is his opinion that swifter
and more uniform winds will always
be blowing in the stratosphere, and that
the airplane pilot of the future will be
able to select with certainty the alti-
tude and wind best suited for his jour-
ney.
The temperature of the stratosphere
is almost constant and slightly warmer
than the coldest troposphere tempera-
ture.
Due to the weight of air surrounding
the earth, the atmospheric pressure at
sea level is 14.7 pounds per square inch.
As altitude increases, this pressure de-
creases, with a corresponding falling
off of air density. These two functions
of altitude, pressure and density, have
an important bearing on altitude flying,
which will be explained further on. It
will suffice here to say that in order for
man to fly at high altitudes, it is neces-
sary for him to be enclosed in a heated,
airtight cabin where the air is under the
same pressure as at normal altitudes.
Medical tests show that a sudden change
to the low pressures of high altitudes
causes what divers know as the "bends;"
resulting in their case from a sudden
drop from higher
pressures to atmos-
pheric pressure.
Doctors have
found that in the
pressure of an alti-
tude of 43,000
feet, men can
neither think nor
behave rationally.
At 18,000 feet,
air density is about
one-half that of
sea level, and there
man has difficulty
in getting sufficient
oxygen, even with
very rapid brea-
thing. At 25,000
feet, an oxygen
mask is almost a
necessity, although
men have climbed
27,000 feet up
Mount Everest
without special equipment. Our present-
day airliners are limited to altitudes
under 12,000 feet, for above that alti-
tude many passengers feel discomfort.
The amount of water vapor in the
air decreases as the air gets colder; con-
sequently, at 25,000 feet, storm clouds
are rare and are so centralized that they
are easily detected and detoured. At
33,000 feet, clouds are seldom encoun-
tered, though on one occasion very thin
clouds were reported to have been seen
at an altitude of 36,000 feet.
Speed is the major reason for flying
at the higher altitudes. At the lower

Equipment used in high altitude research
Aero Digest
levels, speed has almost reached its
limit. Because of air drag, a great deal
of power is needed to drive a plane at
400 m.p.h.; accordingly, unless a much
more powerful engine is developed, this
speed may prove to be the practical
limit for sometime to come. There is
a way, nevertheless, that speed can be

power, and that is by reducing the drag
by flying at higher altitudes where the
air is thin.
With constant power, the airspeed in-
creases about 1.3 per cent every 1000
feet gain in altitude. The present alti-
tude record of 53,937 feet represents an
airspeed increase of about 70 per cent.
The increased economy of flying at
high altitudes is the result of more rapid
speeds without an increase in fuel con-
sumption. For example, by flying at
39,000 feet, a long journey would take
about half the ordinary time, with a
fuel saving of 50 per cent. In addition,
increased speed would attract more pas-
sengers to air travel and there would be
greater distance lapses between servicing
of planes. Also, greater accuracy of
schedules would be maintained, by
cruising above the storm strata. It is
apparent that long flights only will b?
economical, since time and power are
expended in climbing to the upper air.
One designer has estimated that it would
be economical to climb 30,000 feet for
a trip of 600 miles. This estimate varies
with airplane design, however, and also
with such factors as headwinds and
payloads. It should be remembered that
some of the excessive fuel consumption
of climbing is counterbalanced when
the pilot in his approach to the term-
inal uses a power glide to bring his
ship in from about a half hour's dis-
tance away.
By flying at high altitudes above the
dangerous mountain areas and above
the "weather," the fine safety records
of the commercial airlines would be im-
proved even more. With multimotor
airliners, the possibility of simultaneous
motor failure is very slight, but if such
a thing were to occur at 30,000 feet, a
glide to any point within 90 miles would
be possible. At high altitudes, the danger
of icy wings is reduced to unimportance
because of the low humidity. Celestial
navigation is quite likely to be the vogue
in transoceanic and other long distance
stratosphere flights, and "blind flying"
need prevail only during ascent and
descent.
Flying above the weather, in heated,
pressurized cabins that greatly reduce
noise, would add greatly to the passen-
gers' comfort.
Before analyzing the engineering
problems that must be solved before
stratosphere planes can become a prac-
tical reality, it would be advisable to
know of the steps already taken toward
that goal by aircraft manufacturers.
The Army Air Corps led the way for
pressure cabin altitude flying in August,
1937, when they purchased a specially
equipped airplane known as the Lock-
heed XC-35. This plane has windows
an inch thick, and an inner cabin of cir-
cular cross section design that will with-
stand an outward pressure of 15 pounds
per square inch. A blower or super-
charger, driven by the engine exhaust,
pumps air into the cabin. At an altitude
of 25,000 feet the air in the cabin can
be as dense as the atmospheric air at
12,000 feet. The plane has flown suc-
cessfully at altitudes up to 30,000 feet.
The Boeing 307 was the first com-
mercial transport plane designed for
substratosphere flying. It has a cruis-
ing altitude of 20,000 feet. Dual engine-
driven cabin superchargers maintain a
pressure at 20,000 feet equivalent to
that of 8,000 feet. Either of these su-
perchargers alone is capable of main-
taining the cabin pressure. Nine Boeing
307's are now in routine service. The
giant Douglas DC-4's have pressure
cabins so designed that at 18,000 feet
of altitude an equivalent pressure of
8,000 feet may be maintained. A Cur-
tiss-Wright substratophere transport is
also ready for production.
We will now consider a hypothetical
design of a stratosphere airliner, built
to fly at altitudes of 30.000 feet or
more.
The first problem is the strucural de-
sign of the airplane. The details, of
course, are beyond the scope of a short
article and must be dismissed with a
remark. Stratosphere planes will en-
counter temperatures ranging from
+ 100 to —75° F., and therefore metals
of different coefficients of expansion will
have to be selected and joined with
great care. Likewise, adequate al-
lowance will have to be made for struc-
tural flexibility.
Since the cabin walls of this "aerial
submarine" will have to withstand
heavy outward pressures, the best cabin
design is circular in section, tapering,
with hemispherical ends. This design
gives almost uniform tensile stress. The
designers of the CW-20 obtained a cir-
cular cross section cabin effect, but re-
tained the convention of greater depth
than width in the fuselage cross section
by means of two nonconcentric arcs,
with the floor functioning as a brace at
the lines of intersection. It is interesting
to note that static flight tests of the
Boeing 307 have proved that cabin su-
percharging adds to the structural
strength of the cabin, because of the
internal air pressure. The windows will
be laminated glass about one inch thick,
heated with electric wires embedded
near the outside surface to prevent the
formation of frost during climb or de-
scent. To keep the cabin air tight, it
will be necessary to use packing where
the cables and control rods pass through
the walls. Perhaps a better plan is the
use of an electrical control system. A
valve will be placed in the cabin blower
apparatus to prevent the escape of pres-
sure if the blowers should cease func-
tioning.
The present methods of making air-
tight joints of sheet metal for cabins
is to place a strip of glue-saturated fab-
ric between the edges of the sheets, and
then rivet them together. This method
will probably be replaced by seam weld-
ing. Apparently the best way to seal

the cabin door will be to have it open
inward, and to have rubber strips be-
tween the door and the frame. The
most convenient method of testing for
cabin leaks is to pump air into the cabin
under a pressure equal to the estimated
safety factor, and then watch for bub-
bles in a heavy exterior coating of soap
lather.
It is fortunate for stratosphere flying
that the composition of air remains un-
changed even at extreme heights. In
consequence, no oxygen tanks are nec-
essary, for to maintain a sufficient sup-
ply of oxygen, it is only necessary to
pump air into the cabin by supercharg-
ers. In climbing, as the plane reaches
10,000 feet, the air valve will be sealed
and the cabin superchargers will be
started, maintaining an equivalent pres-
sure of 10,000 feet from then on. Purity
of the air will be assured by a supply
of 10 cubic feet of air per minute per
person. The spent air will be valved
back to the outside. Proper humidity
will be maintained by artificial means.
The superchargers supplying air for the
cabin are driven by the engine, either
through a gear drive or by an exhaust
turbine. As the planes become larger,
the trend in cabin supercharging will
probably be toward blowers driven by
small, lightweight gasoline engines lo-
cated in the baggage compartment, and
installed in duplicate. A centrifugal
blower has been developed which spins
at a rate of 40,000 r.p.m., whose tones
are of such high frequency as to be in-
audible. Another possibility for a cabin
supercharger is a large, light-weight,
gear-driven bellows placed in the wing.
Should the superchargers fail, there
would still be enough air in the cabin
to suffice during a power glide to lower
levels. A tank of compressed oxygen
could be carried as a precautionary mea-
sure.
The temperature of the outside air
will have reached at least zero when
the plane is at 20,000 feet. The air in-
side the plane, however, will have been
so warmed by the compression process
that very little other heating will be
necessary. As the plane gains altitude,
it will be necessary to heat the air by
electric coils or steam radiators. The
Boeing 307's use the latter. The sun
may play an important part in the
heating. An experience of Professor
Piccard's will serve to illustrate. In his
stratosphere balloon ascension, although
the atmosphere temperature fell to
—60 F., the inside temperature of the
black gondola rose to 104° F., due
entirely to the absorption of heat from
the sun and earth. Probably the most
feasible way to capture this heat from
the sun and earth is to develop black
aluminum alloys. Paint would increase
air resistance and would weigh too much.
A single coat of paint for a plane the
size of the DC-4 would weigh 485 lbs.
The horsepower of a gasoline engine
is about halved at an altitude of 18,000
feet, where the air density is approx-
imately one-half that of sea level, and
a 500 h.p. engine will produce only 60
h.p. at 40,000 feet. Since constant en-
gine power is dependent upon a full sea
level charge of air in the cylinders, it
becomes necessary as altitude is in-
creased to pump air in with a super-
charger. The relationship between
power and altitude is shown by Fig. 1.

ordinary supercharged engine. C rep-
resents an engine supercharged by a
supercharger designed to give constant
boost up to 20,000 feet and equipped
with a variable-pitch propeller that
maintains constant speed. A portion of
the increased horse power is due to the
reduction in back pressure against the
cylinders as atmospheric pressure be-
comes less. Since superchargers are so
essential to stratosphere flights, let us
examine the two common types used,
namely the mechanically driven and the
exhaust driven. The Roots super-
charger, which appears to be a less de-
sirable type, will not be discussed.
The mechanically driven super-

blower geared to the engine drive shaft.
Acceleration imposes such severe stresses
upon the gears that slipping clutches
have been designed to absorb the shocks.
Despite this improvement, stresses are
still high and probably limit this type
of supercharger to altitudes under 30,-
000 feet. In some instances it is nec-
essary to use two blowers in tandem in
order to get the desired compression.
The engine power consumed in driving
the blower and in mechanical friction
losses amounts to about 20 per cent of
through a pipe to a series of nozzles
which direct the gases against a turbine
wheel, which is on a common shaft with
the centrifugal blower and causes it to
rotate. The turbine speeds can be reg-
ulated by diverting the gases through
the regular exhaust pipe. This type has
an advantage over the other in that
there are no gears and that the speed
of the blower is independent of engine
speed. The exhaust driven super-
charger has another advantage in that
the ratio between the exhaust pressure
and the pressure of the atmosphere in-

the total output. The geared super-
charger must be throttled at low alti-
tudes to prevent engine overloading be-
cause of the power required to compress
air at sea level density. This increases
the time required for the climb. An-
other disadvantage is that the constant
speed propeller causes an inflexible
speed range for mechanically driven su-
perchargers. The German Daimler-
Benz designers have solved this prob-
lem with a hydraulic supercharger drive
which automatically controls the blower
speed.
Regarding the exhaust driven super-
chargers, the engine waste passes
creases with the altitude, thereby increas-
ing the speeds of the supercharger with
ascent. The disadvantages of the tur-
bine superchargers are that the engine
responds sluggishly to the throttle be-
cause of the inertia of the turbine wheel,
and that the high operating tempera-
ture of the turbine wheel creates a spe-
cial metallurgical problem.
Returning to cabin supercharging,
since the speed of the exhaust driven
supercharger varies with the power out-
put of the engines, much power will
have to be consumed in descending from
high altitudes in order to maintain cabin
pressures. The cabin, then, should be
supercharged by the mechanical type
of supercharger or by blowers driven by
small, independent engines.
Another problem confronting engi-
neers is that of engine cooling. Unfor-
tunately, as an airplane engine gains
altitude, there is a greater loss of effi-
ciency in the cooling system due to low
density of the air than there is gain in
efficiency resulting from both the colder
air and the higher velocity. A larger fin
area might solve the problem of the air-
cooled engine, and a liquid having faster
circulation could be used more efficiently
in the liquid-cooled engine.
The comparatively recent develop-
ment of the constant-speed, variable-
pitch propeller has become one of the
greatest aids of stratosphere flying. This
propeller is one that, attached to a gov-
erned motor, changes its pitch to meet
the stress of varying air loads. As the
air become thinner, it takes bigger
'bites" of air in order to absorb engine
power.
For the best efficiency the propeller
should have maximum diameter. How-
ever, the diameter is limited by weight
requirements and the fact that at tip
speeds above 9/10ths the speed of sound
there is a sudden drop in efficiency.
Since the speed of sound is greater at
the low temperatures of the stratosphere,
propellers will have a smaller diameter
than is used for lower level flying. It
may be necessary to use four bladed
propellers, even though their general
efficiency is lower.
Air becomes a less efficient insulator
with increase in altitude, and much
greater air gaps are needed to insulate
given voltage in the stratosphere. Spark
plug trouble and magneto failures have
often been reported above 25,000 feet.
These difficulties can be solved only by
complete artificial insulation or by use
of the Diesel engine.
The low pressure of high altitudes
lowers the boiling point of gasoline
enough to cause fuel loss by evapora-
tion, so tanks will have to be streng-
thened and sealed, or else a less volatile
blend developed. Again, the Diesel en-
gine might solve the problem.
In conclusion, it is safe to predict
that the amount of time required to
bring about financially practical strato-
sphere flying will depend entirely on
the time spent on research. As always
in the history of aeronautical progress,
new difficulties will arise, but they will
be no more insolvable than those which
confronted such men as the Wrights
and Glenn Curtiss.

Developing better apparatus of many
kinds at lower cost is a continuous process
in the Bell System. It plays a major part
in making your telephone service the fin-

one of many cases in point:
Above you see two telephone loading

spaced at regular intervals along tele-
phone circuits. They reduce electrical
losses... help to bring your voice through
clearly, strongly over long distances.
Through the years, engineers at Bell
Telephone Laboratories have succeeded
in making these coils smaller and smaller.
In so doing, they have greatly reduced
the cost per coil, which ... multiplied by
the millions in use in the Bell System's
nation-wide network . . . has helped to
keep the cost of out-of-town service low.

Anyhow, we heard about a fellow
who was hired as a carpenter. They told
him where he was supposed to work,
but they didn't tell him what to do. He
was afraid to stand around idle. So he

started carrying a stack of lumber from
one side of a building to the other.
Shortly the pile was all moved, so he
started carrying it back again. Just
then he noticed a couple of men stand-
ing by, watching him curiously. He
walked over to them.
"Yeah," he said, "you've caught me.
You're right, I'm no carpenter. I never
had a hammer in my hand before. Go
on. Fire me!"
"We can't fire you," one of them re-
plied, "we're your helpers."

English professing, according to some
friends of ours, is one of those things
into which some men are pushed. Once
in the English professing game, they
find it is not necessary to go crazy over

Proof of the above statement is pro-

that one of our illustrious professors

The best way to learn to make a
speech is to speak before an audience.
But a fair sized audience is hard to get
in a speech class. So one of our Engi-
neering English profs requested that
each student bring a guest to one of the
speech-making sessions.
To guarantee an audience of both size
and quality, the professor further offered
a sure "C" to each student bringing a
male guest, and an "A" for the lucky
ones who brought a girl.

Every single noon he waited for her

through the Arch, and he fairly beamed
as he fell in beside her. Moreover, it
took him a full two blocks out of his
way each and every noon to see her to
her door.

But that's all there was to it. Her
phone never rang, bringing dance bids
from him. They never got together over
a coke. And so soon she began to won-

The reply of this unimaginative lit

It was a lit school exam—essay

of seeing an architecture student's sketch
of a "Power Generating Plant." It was

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


A LITTLE DOES A LOT
Experience in many foundries is proving that good
gray iron plus a little Molybdenum will do many an
exacting job — and do it economically.
Liners on the steam valve chest oi a high pressure
pump — a difficult application at best — are a case in
point. The manufacturer makes them of good quality
gray iron to which is added 1.00 % Molybdenum. They
are oil quenched and drawn to a hardness of 40-45
Rockwell "C".
He thus meets the difficult requirements for wear
resistance at operating temperatures and general reli-
ability, and does it with better than average economy.
You will find our book, "Molybdenum in Cast Iron",
helpful. It contains complete data on the various
Molybdenum irons used in modern foundry practice
and is sent free on request to technical students and
all others interested in learning more about modern
materials for modern needs.

key man
Sometime when you are in the north
end of the West Engineering Building,
you will see a well-dressed, important
looking gentleman carrying a brief case.
It won't be strange, for the Electrical
Engineering Department is located in
that part of the building, and that is
where Chuck Tieman spends a part of
his time.
If you stop to talk to him for a while,
you might learn some interesting things
about him—if you can get him to talk
about himself. Though born in Detroit.
Chuck can't remember living anywhere
but in Royal Oak, Michigan. He claim?
to have gone to school under the Royal
Oak System—which we presume means
he was educated with an oak switch,
though we are not sure why.
One of the surprising things about
Charlie is that he never went in for ac-
tivities in high school—well, he was on
the debate team, of course. In the sum-
mer of 1934, Chuck entered Wayne
University. He dropped out at the end
of the summer, and went to work in a
printing shop. His hobby was radio,
and he soon got an operator's license
and a job as an assistant operator at
station WEXL in Royal Oak. He re-
turned to Wayne for the school year
of '35-'36, when his dislike for English
teachers developed into deep-seated
hatred. During the spring of that year,
he started work for the Square D com-
pany, and because of his job, he cut an
English class one day. The professor's
wrath took the form of an "E" for the
semester.
Charlie continued the job, and let
school go the next winter. He found
troubles in industrial life, too. He tells
how he spent three days trying to teach
a girl to use a pair of pliers, when his
boss took over the job. The boss spent
another three days at it, and the girl
still couldn't handle them. Also Charlie
was left out of work for three weeks be-
cause of a sit-down strike. He's not a
Union man himself.
In the fall of 1937, Chuck entered
the University of Michigan. As a trans-
fer, he went out at once for the
PRESENTS
Technic, Sigma Rho Tau, and the Glee
Club. Sickness caused him to drop out
in the second semester, and when he had
recuperated sufficiently, he took a job
as a sailor on the Great Lakes. Back in
Ann Arbor in the fall, Chuck continued
his activities, and spent a great deal of
time in connection with the Congrega-
tional Church and Guild. He joined the
A.I.E.E., and was elected its vice-chair-
man at the third meeting he attended.
He claims not to be a politician.
His Junior year found Chuck as II-

Chuck Tieman
Claims not to be a politician
lustrations Editor of the Technic, and
the early part of it saw his election to
Eta Kappa Nu and Pi Tau Pi Sigma.
In the second semester he became Edi-
torial Director of the Michigan
Technic, and was initiated into Tau
Beta Pi and Vulcans. He was elected
Chairman of A.I.E.E. and under his
leadership this year has been one of the
organization's most successful. Last
spring, too, Chuck pledged Alpha Kappa
Lambda Fraternity.
As if holding an office in HKN, being
Chairman of A.I.E.E., and Editorial
Director of the Technic were not
enough to keep a conscientious student
busy, Chuck has recently added a board
job to his activities. To top it all, he
has never been known to miss a Choral
Union concert, an Oratorical Society lec-
ture, a tea-dance or a President's Tea.
Chuck devotes most of his spare time
to his hobbies. Bowling is one, and
photography is another. If photographic
equipment does not suit him, he makes
his own—such as his automatic print
timer.
He is a bit of a traveling man. A
Christmas vacation in Florida recently,
and a trip to a convention in Arkansas
are among his pleasant memories. Cali-
fornia is his next ambition—he hoped
to go there this Christmas, but the trip
had to be postponed.
Four years in the R.O.T.C. and a
summer in Camp Custer have rather
sharpened Chuck's taste for Army life,
and he has toyed with the idea of a
career in the Army. His real ambition,
however, is to get into a small electrical
manufacturing business of his own, pref-
erably on the West Coast. And he us-
ually gets what he wants, eventually.
highwayman
Prof. Walter Emmons was born and
raised in Hope, Rhode Island, which,
he says, has its name because the people
there are ever hoping for an increase in
population. It is "the smallest town in
the smallest state." After ten years of
Hope he went on to Providence, where
he later attended Brown University.
When he graduated from Brown, Prof.
Emmons decided he wanted to continue
his studies in highway engineering; and
so he went to Columbia for his Mas-
ter's degree, thus preventing us from
making further puns about the town
names in Rhode Island.
Reminiscing about his days as a buck
private in the last war, Prof. Emmons
recalled his first day "in the ranks." The
company sergeant, after assembling the
company, asked any men who had had
calculus to step up to the front. Pri-

THE MICHICAN TECHNIC


Lodern machine design, encountering combination loads,
intensifies the need for truly accurate and permanent location of
revolving parts. Yet sound and economical construction in many
instances does not indicate the use of two or more bearings to
resist both radial and thrust loads.
Designers and engineers meet this situation readily, effec-
tively and economically by specifying the ball bearing. For the
ball bearing—and only the ball bearing — will properly resist
loads from all directions and in all combinations.

TWO JOBS—ONE BEARING
Big advantages in economy of
manufacture and machine per-
formance result from the use of
the Angular Contact Double Row
ball bearing which was originated
by New Departure to resist both
radial and thrust loads.
Today automobiles, trucks, trac-
tors and machinery of many kinds
depend upon bearings developed
by New Departure from this orig-
inal dual purpose "new depar-
ture."

vate Emmons, anticipating some sort of
advancement, eagerly stepped forward
with about a half dozen others—only to
be promptly sent off to peel potatoes!
After that, he learned that the best way
to get along in the army is to make one-
self scarce at all times. Originally sent
to Texas, he was assigned to the Radio
Officers' School at Columbia University
when the war ended. While there he
was quartered in the Union Theological

Seminary in New York City. This was
not quite as soft as it sounds, for he
had to do setting up exercises with no
coat or blouse on in the middle of Riv-
erside Drive wintry mornings at 5:30
A.M.
An expert on bituminous road ma-
terials, Prof. Emmons has worked for
the highway departments of the states
of Pennsylvania and Michigan and for
the Pittsburgh Testing Laboratory in
Alabama. He taught for a while at
Texas A.&amp;M. and came to the Univer-
sity in 1927 from the U.S. Bureau of
Public Roads. At present, he is Asso-
ciate Professor of Highway Engineering.
He is the Secretary-Treasurer of the
Association of Asphalt Paving Technol-
ogists, a member of the American Con-
crete Institute, A.S.C.E., A.S.T.M., the
Engineering Society of Detroit, the
American Road Builders' Association,
the Ann Arbor Board of Public Works,
and is faculty advisor of the Transpor-
tation Club here.
Prof. Emmons' biggest enjoyment is
to watch students develop as they pro-
gress through college. He believes that
most all students possess sufficient abil-
ity, but that many are deficient in per-
sonality. He thinks that the student
should try to develop a ''pleasing indi-
viduality," not by copying somebody
else, but by developing those character-
istics which will make him liked as an
individual. Continually surprising him,
is the fact that a good many graduates
reach important and responsible posi-
tions within a comparatively short time,
frequently only five years, after leaving
the Engineering College.
In December and January of the first
semester, Prof. Emmons spent a four
weeks vacation driving through Mexico
with his family. He enjoyed his vaca-
tion immensely and found the Pan-
American Highway to be excellent, both
as to construction and as to scenery.
The most noticeable souvenir of the
trip is an unusual pictorial calendar oc-
cupying a prominent place in his office.
There were some stale Mexican ciga-
rettes, but the writer finished those off—
solely in the line of duty.
outdoor man
What does a bear do when he comes
face to face with a human? Pete Brown
can answer that one: The bear runs
away about as fast as he can.
Long before the episode with the bear,
Peter F. Brown was born in Galesburg,
Illinois, and he spent his early years
leading a safe, normal life in the small
town. While in high school, Pete was
manager of the school paper and was
elected to the presidency of his senior
class.
Because he had seen a lot of Mich-
igan while visiting his sister here, Pete
decided it was a good school, and en-
tered the university in the fall of 1937.
During his freshman year he pledged
and was initiated into Sigma Chi, and
he spent a semester on the Technic.
During his sophomore year, he concen-
trated on Union activities, and his ef-
forts were rewarded, for he became a
member of the Union Executive Council
in his Junior year.
In the fall, he was elected to Tri-
angles. He was Director of Student
Elections and a member of the J-Hop
Committee, so it's no wonder he was
tapped by Vulcans the next spring.
This year, Pete is secretary of the
Men's Judiciary Council and president
of Sigma Chi. In June he will graduate
with a B.S. in Chemical Engineering,
and from there will probably go into
sales.
This sales stuff is not new to Pete,
for he spent one summer selling port-
able air-conditioning units. The only
hitch came when the summer turned out
to be one of the coldest ones in years!
The rest of Pete's summers have been
spent in the great outdoors—he ha&gt;
been going to camp for the last eight
years, two of which were spent as a
counselor at the Wisconsin State
V.M.C.A. Camp, and two more leadinu
canoe trips in Canada.
Two summers ago Pete and a buddy
of his planned a 3200-mile canoe trip
starting in the Canadian Northwest Ter-
ritory. They planned to take 75 days
on the trip, and the food had to be sent
up there by dogsled the winter before.
They contacted the Hudson Bay-
Company, and they were advised not
to take the trip because the country up
there was not well enough known. Con-
sequently, by orders from their parents,
the trip was not made, much to Pete's
disappointment. He has had some ex-

citing times on these canoe trips, shoot-
ing rapids minus a canoe and waking up
in the middle of the night to find a bear
standing over him.
Aside from the outdoors, Pete's great-
est enjoyment comes from reading. He
used to play tennis, but now is just golf-
ing and bowling—says he's too lazy.
Easy-going and likeable. Pete ha?
little to worry about upon graduation—
his order number is 7,948.

No longer is the season regarded as too
formidable for outdoor recreation. The
advances of medical science and chem-

controlled temperatures, washed air,
and proper humidity in our homes,
theaters, offices, and store buildings at
reasonable cost and with a minimum of
labor. All this has been made possible
by the development of automatic fuel
burning equipment and by other me-
chanical and electrical control devices.
Let me repeat that credit for these
developments should not be given to any
one branch of engineering. Forty years
ago the common metals used in the
fabrication of practically all machin-
ery were wrought iron, low carbon steel,
and cast iron. Special parts were either
cast in sand molds or wrought by hand.
Metallurgy has since supplied a wide
variety of alloys, making possible lighter
parts and higher speeds. High rotative
speeds called for something other than
plain bearings so ball and roller bear-
ings were developed. Higher speeds also
caused vibrations and therefore balanc-
ing became necessary. Mathematics and
mechanics solved this problem. But
high speed machinery also called for
high speed drives and these were sup-
plied by the electric motor and the
steam turbine.
Any survey of Mechanical Engineer-
ing, however brief, should include a new
phase commonly referred to as Indus-
trial. While most frequently associated
with the Mechanical Engineering field
it is equally applicable to all industrial
and manufacturing processes. This
deals with shop and factory methods,
time studies, economics, plant admini-
stration, equipment maintenance, and
similar subjects. It is a very natural
result of the production and sale of man-
ufactured articles in large quantities,
close competition in many fields, and
the practical necessity of making im-
proved articles more cheaply.
Possibly the young mechanical engi-
neer graduating today will not witness
so many outstanding changes during his
career as have occurred in the last 40
years. If he does, he must elect to fol-
low only a few and accept the rest on
faith because it will be impossible for
him to be altogether familiar with the
passing parade in this widely diversified
field.

fireless locomotive
The idea of running a locomotive on
steam drawn from an insulated pres-
sure chamber, charged at intervals by
stationary boilers, dates back as far
1864. The first real practical applica-
tions of the idea came after 1875 when
this type of engine was used for street
railways in New Orleans, Louisiana, and
Crescent City, New Jersey. These first
locomotives were very similar to the
The only requirement is a power plant
nearby capable of supplying steam at
125 psi, the established minimum pres-
sure.
The U.S. Navy has recently installed
one of these engines at the Charleston
Navy Yard which is charged with steam
at 160 psi and operates for eight hours
on two full charges and two partial
charges. Even though the fireless loco-
motive is limited to use in switch yards
it is becoming increasingly popular be-
has been made of corrosion-resistive ma-
terial.
inspection
In a recent article in Factory Man-
agement and Maintenance, Mr. E. H.
Schaeffer, Industrial Engineer, points
out that by application of simple arith-
metic to the frequently met problem of
inspection, a considerable decrease in
costs may be realized.

modern types except for their diminu-
tive size. These early engines were
charged with hot water under high pres-
sure while the later models are charged
with superheated steam. The steam
condenses in the water in the chamber,
raising its temperature until it boils.
The resulting saturated steam is used
to drive the locomotive. Thus the fire-
less locomotive is really a heat storage
unit rather than a steam storage unit
and it is the large amount of heat which
the superheated steam imparts to the
water that makes this method so prac-
tical.
Various other revivals of this fireless
locomotive have occurred between 1874
and the present time mainly because of
its adaptability for switch engine use.
cause it is economical, safe, clean, and
silent.
aquaknot
Even the most amateur of the clan
of sportsmen knows that the faster th?
current of a stream the greater will be
the fishline's deflection from the ver-
tical. On the basis of this simple prin-
ciple the "Aquaknot," used for mea-
suring the speed of a boat, was recently
developed.
It consists essentially of a sinker and
a line attached to the arm of a scale
which has been accurately calibrated
and designed to measure speeds up to
ten knots. Of simple design, the "Aqua-
knot," with the exception of the sinker.
In most cases where parts are man-
ufactured or purchased in quantity, 2rv
allowable defectives is a reasonable ex-
pectation. Particularly in the case of as-
semblies consisting of several component
parts, the per cent defectives in any lot
will be higher than this figure, thus ne-
cessitating some system for eliminating
the excessive defectives. The thoughtless
solution to the problem presented would
be to inspect final assemblies 100/V.
However, by the application of common
sense, the following formula, applicable
to most such cases, was arrived at.
The formula is quite simple:
P=percentage of pieces in each pack-
age to be inspected
D=percentage of total pieces defective
within any lot

defective (2 in this case")
D-N
Then P=
D
The application and understanding of
this formula are likewise simple. After
some experimentation, the following
system was adopted:
1. Determine the percentage defec-
tives in any lot (D) by inspecting 5/V
of the total pieces in the lot.
2. The number of additional assem-
blies to be inspected varies with the
percentage of defectives determined in
(1.). For instance, if in a given lot of
assemblies inspection reveals a total of
4% defective, only 50% of the assem-
bled units placed in each box are in-
spected. Thus, in a box of 100 units,
without inspection four units might be
expected to be defective. However,
under this system 50% of these (two
units would be discovered by inspec-
tion and removed, leaving only two
parts defective, which is the allowable
2%. The system is consistent with the
formula, since:
4-2 1
P= = — = 50%
There were many cases where 100%
inspection of small parts is necessary
and, of course, this system would not
apply. But in most cases it does hold
true. Yet, in spite of its simplicity, this
plan is not yet used every time it might
be.
midget truck
Although it's small it may become
an important cog in the modern mili-
tary machine-to-be of the United
States. In fact military men predict
that the new midget truck will do the
work of the motorcycles and sidecars
used so effectively by German "Panzer"
divisions.
This new truck stands only slightly
over three feet high, and its entire length
is only 81 inches. Yet each truck is
capable of carrying three men, an anti-
aircraft gun and light field pieces across
country at nearly 60 miles an hour.
Weighing only 1,700 pounds, this
pygmy truck has a four-wheel drive
which enables it to climb better than
tanks. If its rear wheels are bogged in
mud, the front wheels will drag the ve-
hicle clear. Each truck will have a four-
cylinder, 42 horsepower motor with an
auxiliary transmission and gear provid-
ing six forward and two reverse speeds.
As a result of their size and weight

examined, of course; and another type
of record—extra-curricular activities—
is also checked.
Employers feel that, on the whole,
students who have taken part in ac-
tivities^—publications, technical soci-
eties, sports—are likely to be more val-
uable employees than those who have
not. So the students who have get first
choice of the best jobs.
This in itself should be enough reason
why every normal student should give
some attention to extra-curricular ac-
tivities. And, of itself, it does attract
many men to them. But, on examina-

sponsibilities. No one is naturally en-
dowed with that ability; it is one which
must be developed. Almost every sort
of activity places responsibility on the
shoulders of its members, and they leave
better able to carry it than when they
entered. For this reason, men who have
been in campus activities are likely to
be more valuable than those who have
not.
0%'er a long period of time, probably
the most far-reaching effect of activities
is the way they help a student develop
his personality. Whatever line of work
a man goes into, he is going to be asso-
ciated with other men. If he is going to
be successful, he must get along well
with them. He must sell his ideas and
he must "sell himself." This is true
whether the job is in production work
on the floor of a factory, or in the
executive offices in Wall Street.
College years are formative years.
Personalities change rapidly during this
period. Most develop and improve, of
course; some few may be damaged. To
be successful in activities, as well as in
a real job, it is necessary to get along
with one's associates. How this is done
can be learned only by experience. In-
centive is present and yet if minor fail-
ures occur now and then, they are not
so serious as they may be later. On the
other hand, if a student allows himself
to ignore his fellows and spend all his
time in work, as some do, it is likely he
will be less able to get along with
people after four years of college than
before.
All this is looking at the effect of ac-
tivities on material success. How are they
likely to affect personal happiness? With
most people, happiness must grow pri-
marily out of friendships. While in
school, the activities provide a wide cir-
cle of acquaintance, and thus fill those
years with more enjoyment. After col-
lege, if his experiences have taught him
how to make friends more easily, he
should be able to enjoy all his associa-
tions and contacts more.
Some students who realize the many-
advantages of participation in extra-
curricular activities still do not enter
them. They feel that they came to
school primarily to get an education,
and the time required by an activity
might interfere with that. One answer
to that objection is in examining the
ranks of the best scholars; quite fre-
quently indeed they are also the leaders
in campus affairs. Apparently, then, ac-
tivities have not jeopardized their work.
Another answer is that activities are in
themselves an education: an education
in dealing with people, one of the most
valuable, if not the most valuable, of
all educations.

Creep testing room in the metallurgical laboratories
Nowadays one would not think of specifying metals for special types of service without securing all available information regarding
their behavior under the conditions to which they will be subjected. Tension, compression, shear and other mechanical tests are always
useful but do not give a sufficiently complete picture in all cases. The petroleum industry, for instance, frequently subjects metals to
continuous stresses at elevated temperatures. In the creep testing laboratory, metals are subjected for long periods of time to steady
loading at these higher temperatures and measurements of the "creep" for each loading and temperature are recorded for study. Under
some conditions a given metal will elongate a certain amount and during the elongation will become strain hardened (hardening through
deformation) to such a degree that it will sustain the load indefinitely. Under conditions of higher loads or higher temperatures it will
continue to elongate until failure occurs. Such information is of great value in the design of equipment to be used in many industries.
Students of the Engineering College of the University not only learn from experimental data arrived at in laboratories as indicated
above, but from preliminary courses in mathematics, physics and chemistry they are able to discern the reasons for the results obtained
and to plan and execute further researches.

'HEN an airplane catapult hurls a plane

EYES FOR DEFENSE
PEQPL£ in and around Schenectady, N. V.
are looking up these nights, watching the
beams from giant searchlights being rested at the
General Klectric plant. In other parrs of the world
whole cities huddle underground, while sirens wail
and bombs crash but rhese Americans watch
hout fear. The sharp fingers of light sweeping
across the sky are reassurance, symbols of
Searchlights are not the only defense items
being built in Schenectady and in the other plant?
of General Klectric. Great steam turbines
under construction, totalling millions of horse

navy; intricate controls will direct the operation
of warships, tanks, planes, and guns; radio equip-
menr will facilitate communication on land and
sea and in the air.
And playing a vital part in these defense prep-
arations are Testmen, young student engineers
just off the campus, whose responsibility it
to test these machines.

You will have a lot of bearing problems to solve when
you get into the field of practical engineering. Don't wait
until you come up against these problems to find out
about bearings. Study the subject now.
By acquiring a thorough knowledge of the basic principle,
scientific design and application of the TIMKEN Tapered
Roller Bearing you will be able to meet any bearing re-
quirement in any kind of machinery—for TIMKEN Bearings
not only eliminate friction; they carry all loads—radial,
thrust or both together; and hold moving parts in correct
and constant alignment.
More TIMKEN Bearings are used in mechanical equipment
of all kinds than any other kind of bearing—from modern
machine tools where the most exacting precision is de-
manded, to huge steel rolling mills where terrific loads
and shocks must be carried.

told how to study. This
is how they really do it.
FOR STUDENTS ONLY
Edited by
BURR J. FRENCH, '42E
REAMS of paper have been devoted
to the subject of study; long lec-
tures on this art have been served up
to countless generations of students;
and "bull sessions" have often revolved
about the topic of a "maximum of
learning with a minimum of effort."
And yet we feel that, in general, the
student has been neglected as an
authority on the why's and where-
fore's of study. Whether he follows it
or not nearly every student has his pet
theory on the subject of studying.
Often he has found a time-saving de-
vice—a means of "stopping the clock.1'
With this in mind we sought to tap
this field of thought. The result is
now ready for the consumption of the
student body of the College of En-
gineering. A touch of professional
authority has been added by Professor
A. D. Moore, who consented to assist
us in our quest of knowledge. The
Technic hopes that you may find the
following both of value and interest.
PROFESSOR A. D. MOORE
HABITS. Learning takes place
within a collection of study habits.
Your habits are good, bad, or indiffer-
ent. Results vary accordingly. De-
velop effective study habits.
WORRYING. Worrying is a habit.
It is learned, like any other habit.
Eliminate worrying from your study
situation. Refuse to worry at the study
desk. If you must worry, worry some-
where else.
INTEREST. Little interest, little
learning. If you wish, you can become
interested in practically any field of
study. Take any steps necessary to
develop interest in a subject.
TOOLS, CONDITIONS. The
skilled professional can do fine work
with poor tools. The amateur (you

A. D. Moore
Practiced what he preaches
are an amateur at each new thing
that comes up) needs the best tools
and conditions obtainable.
SUCCESS. In learning, "nothing
succeeds like success." Arrange to be
successful at once, in some way, when
tackling an assignment. Put your desk
in order. Dust it. Count the assigned
pages. Do anything, no matter how
piffling, to achieve success at the be-
ginning. It conditions the attitude.
ATTACK. Except for non-techni-
cal reading, give every assignment the
quick preliminary "once-over." See
what's there in the aggregate, and then
get down to details.
REACTING. You learn the re-
actions you make. No reacting, no
learning. Reacting demands an active,
not passive, study attitude. Use pen-
cil and paper. Make notes. Sketch.
Outline. Underscore. Make marginal
notes. React.
OUTLINING. Become skilled at
outlining. Make outlining a study
habit. Use it (often in extremely
simple form) while studying, to guaran-
tee that you are reacting. Preserve
such outlines for review, recall.
RECALL CARDS. New words,
new phrases, new ideas—note these on
the edges of cards. Below put mean-
ings. Expose the edges, try to recall
the meanings. Then check.
UNFAMILIAR ELEMENT. In
an assignment, pick out the unfamiliar
(or new) elements. In your review
and recall periods, present these to
yourself first. How? Through out-
lines, recall cards.
LEARNING AND FORGETTING.
Break up the total time for an assign-
ment so that there is some study, some
review, some recall—and some time
left for recall tomorrow, next week,
next month. To use it all up at once,
in "study," is to invite speedy for-
getting.
MEMORIZING. Build up a fine
memory for the things you need. But
don't do it by "memorizing." With
proper study methods, remembering
"happens."
SCALE. You could learn to do your
work on a billboard or on paper of
MARCH, 1941
9


nearly all of it on 8.5 by 11 paper.
Standardize on that; pretty much stick
to it.
LEGIBILITY. Garbled pronuncia-
tions, fuzzy curve lines, bleary writing
— these are bad forms of expression.
They directly affect learning. Be defi-
nite. Be legible. Keep on improving
neatness.
FATIGUE. People differ. Calibrate
yourself. Find your limits—how late
you can go and still do well, and when
to stop.
AND FINALLY. Read a book.
Read to find the above items expanded
or those not even mentioned in this
500 word outline. Read Jones, Im-
provement of Study Habits, 112 pages,
or Bird, Effective Study Habits, 247
pages.
BLAINE B. KUIST, *41E
Member of Tau Beta Pi, ex-school-
teacher.
The all important thing in study is
to be able to recognize what one does
not know—then do something about
it. That amounts sometimes to giv-
ing myself a mental bluebook—digging
out important questions on the sub-
ject, then testing myself by trying to
answer them completely. Occasional-
ly, working a basic problem from
scratch brings the dusty corners to
light. At other times, a few questions
put to the instructor help—in spite of
what I believe his reactions to my
apparent ignorance will be. When
some fundamental throws me for a
loss, I try to strike up an acquaintance
with it "tout de suite," so there will be
no embarrassment when we meet again.
In class and in study I always look
for important things, the facts that
are worth remembering, then make a
special effort to learn them. Confi-
dentially, it is hard to find one im-
portant thing all semester in some
courses. Details in lecture and text
were put there to be understood, not
memorized. That is one reason I re-
strict my notes to a bare minimum,
aside from the fact that it is easier
and more profitable to listen than to
write like mad during a lecture. Only
new ideas are worth recording, ideas
that have to be referred to again to be
thoroughly understood. Whenever I
write anything outside of class, it is
on scratch paper which goes in the
basket soon after it is written. It
helps to lean on the memory.
I don't spend a great amount of time
on review immediately before a blue-
book or final, because I either feel I
know the stuff, or am willing to take
the risks on what I don't know and
haven't got the interest to dig out.
That is true for "analytical" courses
at least, but I'll have to crayfish a little
on that statement for memory and
formula courses, that are jammed full
of details. A good healthy review
about three days before, and again
the day before, does lots of good.
This isn't the best method, but it is
the one circumstances usually force
me to use.
Throughout the whole semester, I
have to choose the things to put the
time on. There is not enough time in
any student's schedule to spend all
the time that should be spent on all the
subjects, so something has to be par-
tially neglected until crucial moments
like bluebooks and finals.

Blaine Kuist
The library may be desirable
As for environment during study, I
prefer my room with plenty of light,
air clear of smoke at least to the ex-
tent that I can see the opposite wall
without kicking a hole in the fog, all
references within easy reach, all bull
sessions out of reach, and a couple of
roommates doing their darndest to imi-
tate clams. A reasonable amount of
chatter and noise does not bother—
if there is a door between them and
me. The "reasonable amount" is a
variable quantity, too. For efficiency
plus in study it should be no greater
than the noise a "4" makes as it slides
past the "2" on a slipstick. If going
is easy, the racket could exceed that
of kids' day at the circus before I
would move out to the library. (P.S.
I haven't retreated yet because of
noise.)
Now, study in the library is often
necessary and even desirable for an
assortment of reasons. It is a good
place to study, or a glorified date
bureau, as you will. Anyhow, it can-
not be said that time spent there is
not worthwhile. It all depends on who
is sitting next door as to what the
object of concentration is.
Sleep is a good thing, too, but not
in the classrooms. If a class is worth
going to it is worth full attention.
On the whole, I do not believe the
students have the time to practice
scientific methods and really be thor-
ough about this business. And, after
all, some outside activities deserve
attention, too. It all reduces to a
matter of producing when the heat is
on and slowing down to a normal pace
in the breathing spells.

This is the second of two essays
written by the authors. When we first
looked at the subject, "How Should
One Study?", we both agreed that the
first word was superfluous, and we
proceeded to write on that basis. The
worthy editors, however, assured us
that we were mistaken, and that they
really considered us authorities on how-
to get a maximum out of a minimum
of study. The words "minimum of
study" made a fine impression on us,
so we launched a research program on
the subject. We owe a deep and last-
ing debt of gratitude to the many fine
engineers at the P-Bell on the night of
January 5, and to the cute blonde
who was ever so helpful, for their
contributions to this paper.
To acquaint us with the general
subject of study, the editors asked us
to cover several of the following points:
1. Where—Both of us think our room
is the best place. If possible, lie on
a couch or sit in a rocking chair, but
if you must get something done, use the
desk. Be as comfortable as possible.
The library, we believe, has too many
interesting things to read—and to look
at. 2. When—Anytime may be all
right, neither of us has tried it before
ten o'clock at night. We find the
best hours are twelve to three—there's
not much else to do. 3. Studying

activity; possibly studying is too; but
like alcohol and gasoline, they should
not be mixed. Confidentially, if you
can get the date, take it.
We were also asked to slate our
methods of study, and comparative
success with "memory," "formula,"
and "analytical" courses: 1. Memory
courses: Success—poor. Appreciation
—poor. Amount learned—very little.
We both feel that they are of use to
us only in discussion sessions. Since
they must be studied, we feel that the
ideal way to study them is to learn
small amounts regularly. In common
with most engineers, neither one of us
has tried this. Heinen tries to write
down the points he considers essential,
or thinks he will be asked. If he has
time, he writes and rewrites them until
he knows them or gets tired. Drick-
amer claims his methods are too hap-
hazard to record.
2. Formula courses: Success, etc.,
same as above. The only difference is
that they are not even good in bull
sessions, since nobody cares whether
you remember that x equals y or not.
3. Analytical courses: These are the
type of courses with which we have
had the most experience, and which
teach us the most. In order to under-
stand our attitude toward the study of
this type of course, we feel that we
have to evaluate the impressions made
on us.
Lectures, by and large, very seldom
cover the points that worry us. With
few exceptions they offer only an op-
portunity to play tick-tack-toe, battle-
ship, or to catch up on much needed
sleep. We feel that a mimeographed
outline of the lecture material would
serve the purpose much better. We
think that formula derivations on the
board tend to confuse the student.
Instead of trying to follow the maze
of x's and y's, we recommend that the
student sit back and ask himself, or
the professor if he has the nerve, just
what the fundamental points behind
the algebra are, and if the rest is con-
fusing, disregard it.
We feel that problems are essential.
We have found occasionally that the
mechanics of getting a huge mass of
problems tends to blot out an under-
standing of any one of them. In a case
like this we consider that one problem
done and understood is worth three
handed in from the standpoint of edu-
cation, if not of marks. We feel that
problems should be done before the
discussion or lecture on the subject,
otherwise the mind will not be pre-
pared to handle most of the informa-
tion. A few comprehensive problems
assigned well ahead of time will give
the best results.
Problem sections By and large we
find that problem sections in which the
whole class goes to the board are use-
ful in that they give the professor an
opportunity to find out who has done
the assignment. From the student
point of view they are not so useful,
since so much time is spent putting

the problem on the board, too little on
discussion of it.
Discussion—Both of us like to talk.
[Understatement of the month—Ed.]
Furthermore, both of us feel that we
learn most from discussions. But there
is a tendency for class discussions to
become unilateral, which defeats the
method. Students who are being
marked do not care to display their
ignorance. We should like to see dis-
cussion periods which do not affect
the mark. An hour of discussion is
equivalent to three or four hours of
study by oneself in understanding the
fundamentals of the course and in co-
ordinating the approach of the student
and the professor to the problems on
hand.
To summarize our attitude in one
delightfully intangible cliche, we feel
that there is too much working and too
little thinking done in most analytical
courses.
Our actual approach to such a course
is to do a problem. This is the first
concrete step, no matter what we have
read or listened to. We start right in,
without thinking too much about the
problem. We keep on working it until
we think we have a solution. Then we
tear the problem apart in our minds.
We take it to class and discuss it either
with the students or the professor.
Then we read the book, listen to the
lectures, or both. With this done, we
try to analyze the position of the prob-
lem with reference to the course, which
of the fundamentals it has covered,
and how important it is. This analysis
is the most important part of doing
the problem.
Other points which we were to re-
view included:
Group studying -We feel that the

scholastic sense, at

an intense review
is essential psy-
chologists notwith-
standing. For ana-
lytical courses only
the fundamental
principles should
be considered, since
specific problems
and methods only
tend to clutter up
the mind.
It is now three A.M. and we doubt
whether we are fitten' to tell nobody
how to study nohow. We would like
to close by saying that we feel that
under the present grading system
thoroughness is not cultivated, and it
is practically necessary to make a
compromise in one's study habits be-
tween the best knowledge and the
best grades. We think our methods
guarantee the former. We have a faint
suspicion that they do not guarantee
the latter, so we refuse to take the
responsibility for any failures on future
finals, including our own.

fuddled world with its war-mad
dictators, the astronomers are bothered
by another problem which has re-
mained unsolved for many centuries.
That problem concerns itself with the
fundamental cause of sun-spots.
It has been generally accepted that
sun-spots result from whirling storms
produced near the surface of the sun.
This theory was first proposed by Hale.
It further states that the dark color of
these spots is caused by hot gases
which, upon rising to regions of re-
duced pressure, expand and cool.
However, there remains another as-
pect connected with these sun-spots
that seems to some astronomers to be
more than just an unaccountable co-
incidence. You will recall that tides in
the ocean are caused by a force exerted
by the moon. This force is simply a
couple, caused by elliptical bodies
whose equatorial planes are inclined
towards each other, tending to pro-
duce a conical motion about their axes
of rotation. The phenomenon is known
as precessional action.
It is this force, caused by planetary
bodies, that some astronomers believe
is the fundamental cause of all sun-
spots. This idea is not new, for calcu-
lations of the precessional force of the
planet Mercury were begun as far back
as 1862. Recently, Luby at the Uni-
versity of Kansas City, after making a
very detailed study of the problem,
compiled some facts and figures all in
complete accordance with this theory.
As the sun rotates, it causes a centri-
fugal force which tends to maintain the
equatorial belt in the same position.
But the precessional action of the
planets whose orbits make an angle of

reaches a maximum when the pre-

is a maximum. Not all the planets are

enough mass to produce any consider-
able effect. However, when two plan-

from three to eight degrees with the
sun's equator tends to shift the ma-
terial of the solar belt slightly toward
the equator. The nature of preces-
sional action is such that the material
will shift in opposite directions on op-
posite sides of the sun. It is the con-
tinuous interaction of these forces that
disturbs the solar equilibrium and is
what Professor Luby believes is the
ultimate cause of sun-spots.
It has been verified by repeated ob-

Sun spots are now blamed on the planets
their combined precessional couple is
nearly equal to the sum of their sepa-
rate couples, and for two such planets
as Jupiter and Venus this force is ex-
tremely large. Even though the dis-
tances from the planets are large in
comparison with the sun's diameter,
the force exerted by the planets is
highly localized on opposite sides of
the sun and near the meridian on which
the two planets are located. This fact
accounts for the great preponderance
of sunspots between five and thirty
degrees North and South latitude.
Jupiter exerts the greatest preces-
sional couple; and since midway be-
tween the nodes the couple is greatest,
we would expect the period of Jupiter
to be approximately that of the sun-
spot cycle. This proved to be fact, for
the period of Jupiter is 11.86 years
while that of the mean cycle of sun-
spots is about eleven and one-third
years. The slight difference is caused
by the interference of Venus and the
Earth, and, to a smaller extent, the
other planets.
The precessional couples of the
planets also account for the equatorial
acceleration of the sun and the polari-
ties of leader and trailer spots. It ex-
plains the location of sun-spots on the
sun; why their activity follows a defi-
nite cycle; and, most important of all,
their cause. The verification of these
facts is based on accurate measure-
ments that have been recorded since
1825. These data, collected for over
one hundred years, are in complete
agreement with the theory that sun-
spots are caused by the precessional
action of planetary bodies.

gan's new electron microscope.
30,0011 X
By
ARTHUR W. DOBSON, '42E
T IK.E their colleagues everywhere
-•—'else, scientists at the University of
Michigan have, for a long time, been
anxious to explore the domains of par-
ticles too small to be seen by visible
light. And now they will be able to do
just that, for on April 3rd a new instru-
ment will make its appearance on our
campus. That instrument is the elec-
tron microscope.
The usefulness of any microscope is
limiterl by its resolving power. The
shortest distance by which two par-
ticles can be separated in the object
and still appear separated on the
image is a measure of this power; the
smaller the distance, the greater the
power. In general, this distance can
not be less than one-half of the length
of the wave emitted by the illuminating
source. Consequently, the shorter the
wave, the greater the possible resolv-
ing power.
The shortest wave length of visible
light is about 4000 A. Hence, the
greatest resolving power of a light
microscope corresponds to about 2000
A. By using photographic processes
with ultraviolet light, the. resolving
power has been increased to about
500 A.
The use of electron waves, rather
than light waves, gives much greater
resolution. The length of electron
waves is inversely proportional to the
velocity at which the electrons move.
The velocity attained by electrons in
the electron microscope is directly
proportional to the difference of po-
tential between the anode and the
cathode of the electron
source. With a potential dif-
ference of one volt, the
length of the electron wave
emitted is 12 A. By increas-
ing the voltage to one mil-
lion, the wave length is re-
duced to about 0.01 A. In
the machine acquired by the
University the best value
has been found to be be-
tween 30 and 100 kilovolts,
which produces a wave
length of 1/25 A.
Theoretically, then, it
should be possible to define Rr.f
atomic dimensions with the
possible resolving power of
this type of microscope. However, the
instrument which the University will
receive has a resolving power of 50 A.,
which is only 1/2500 as good as it
theoretically could be. This power en-
ables the manufacturers to guarantee a
magnification of 30,000 diameters,
which can be increased by usual pho-
tographic enlargement.
The electron microscope is in many-
respects analogous to the light micro-
scope. Nearly everyone is familiar
with the latter, which consists of a
light source, condenser lens which con-
centrates the light beam on the speci-
men, an adjustable stage, an objective
lens, and an eyepiece or projection
lens for making photographs. In like
manner, the electron microscope con-
sists of an electron source, and has
magnetic fields of suitable shapes which
do the work of the lenses. As can be

Electrons do what light waves can't
seen from the illustration, even the
shape is similar. The outstanding
difference is that the luminary travels
from top to bottom.
The electron source is composed of
a single potential, hot cathode type,
tungsten filament surrounded by a
smooth guard electrode. This is at
the top of the tube in a lead hood de-
signed to protect the operators from
X-rays that are produced. Below the
hood is the condenser coil, which fo-
cuses the electron beam on the speci-
men in the objective chamber. The
specimen is fixed on a collodion film,
since glass is opaque to the electron
beam. The mount is clamped in the
tip of a cartridge placed very close to
the objective coil field lens, bringing
the beam together into an intermediate
image. The projection coil then pro-

a by-word of practically the en-
tire nation in the last six months.
The draft bill and the repeated calls
on Congress for defense appropria-
tions have caused the whole of our
country to become aware of our po-
sition in international politics. Serv-
ing as the "arsenal of democracy," we
seem to be the key nation both for
turning the tide of battle that has
started and providing the actual im-
plements of war.
One of the most important factors
affecting the production of war ma-
terials is the availability of finished
gears. The National Defense Program
has created the need for a much greater
gear production capacity, while at the
same time demanding efficiency and
accuracy in the finished article.
Because its specifications call for
the combined properties of accuracy,
lightness, and strength, the aircraft in-
dustry, a large consumer of finished
gears, has caused an excessively press-

GEAR FINISHING

ing demand for gears finished by cer-
tain processes. It will be seen later
why this demand has created a special
problem for gear manufacturers. To
keep up with the demand, gear pro-
ducing machinery manufacturers have
been constantly on the alert for pos-
sible improvements in both speed and
efficiency. There are four available
methods now accepted for finishing
gears, i.e., for forming an accurate sur-
face after the rough or perhaps semi-
finish cuts have been made. These are
shaving, lapping, grinding, and bur-
nishing. Of these, shaving and burnish-
ing are done before any heat treatment
14
of the gear, while lapping and grinding
are follow-up processes.
Shaving is a finishing process which
has been known for only about ten
years. Its relative newness, coupled
with the fact that it is a pre-heat-
treat operation, is the reason
that it has not yet won the
confidence of gear users. Be-
fore shaving was known, gears
were finished by fine cuts made
by the original hob or generat-
ing cutter used to shape the
teeth in the gear blank. By
shaving, a more readily con-
trolled method than light cut-
ting, it is possible to take off
a much finer amount of metal
(0.001—0.003"). In shaving,
small amounts of metal are
scraped off the tooth surface
by the rubbing action of a cut-
ter having a contour comple-
mentary to that of the tooth.
Either a rack or a rotary cut-
ter may be used, both of which
have serrated teeth, so that
each serration on the cutter
tooth is in itself a cutting edge.
In the rack cutting machine, the
rack is made up of a series of serrated
toothed bars which have a contour
complementary to that of the teeth to
be finished. This rack moves length-
wise on a platen table at about 150
cycles per minute. The work is in
mesh with the rack (Fig. 1) and it re-
ciprocates across the width of the
track at a speed which is inversely
proportional to the magnitude of the
angle of the crossed axes of the work
and the rack. It has been found in
practice that the more nearly parallel
the axes of the work and the cutter,
the greater must be the speed of re-
ciprocation across the cutter to give
the proper shaving action.
With a rotary cutter (Fig. 2), the
action of the machine is very much the
same, except that the cutting ser-
rations are made on the teeth of the
rotary cutter. Rotary shavers can be
used to finish either helical or spur
gears. In finishing helical gears, the
axes of cutter and work are set askew,
so that when the teeth mesh, those of
the cutter slide across those of the
work and shave as they go. In finish-
ing spur gears, however, the axes are
parallel, and there must be a recipro-
cating motion of the cutter to get the
necessary shaving action.
The most important advantage of
shaving is the economy. Of the two
types of cutter, the rack is the more

Generated ground teeth
expensive and is best used for mass
production, since it will make nearly
1,000,000 gears with several sharpen-
ings. For job lots, the less expensive
rotary cutter is much more satisfac-
tory. One advantage of the rotary
cutter over the rack is the introduction
of a hunting tooth into the cutter.

on the cutter is not the same as the
number of teeth on the work. Thus the
same two teeth will not remesh with
each rotation of the rotary cutter and
the error on one shaving tooth is not
accentuated as it is on the
rack.
Because shaving is done be-
fore heat treatment, it is not
applicable to the production
of gears for use in aircraft. In
an airplane engine, gear light-
ness is of prime importance
because the goal is minimum
weight per engine horsepower.
In order to obtain this goal,
the hubs and spokes of the
gears are cut to the minimum
size that will give the required
strength. After heat treat-
ment, such small parts become
excessively distorted, and any
finishing process used before-
hand is rendered completely
worthless. Only grinding and
lapping may be used for finish-
ing, and at the present time
grinding is in vogue.
The reasons that aircraft
men demand form ground
gears are threefold. On hob
cut gears the characteristic cut
leaves an excess of metal which |
cannot be removed by lapping;
generated ground gears some-
times have the base fillet cut
into (Fig. 2), which may result in a
starting point for fracture; no other
method will produce a gear of sufficient
accuracy after heat treatment.
Form grinding employs a grinding
wheel which has been given a section
complementary to the gear tooth pro-
file. On the other hand, generating
grinding uses the basic principle in-
volved in generating an involute curve
using base rolls and tapes. In this case
the grinding wheel has a perfectly flat
surface and takes the part of an im-
aginary rack, since the rack is a
necessary part of the generating proc-
ess. In neither case, however, can a
high cutting speed be used, because
the work has to be indexed after each
cut. An average rate for all grinding
production has been estimated to be
43 seconds per tooth, which is com-
paratively slow. Other factors such as
gear design, grain, type and size of
grinding wheels, amount of stock to be
removed, final accuracy desired, and
the nature of the grinding compound
will measurably affect the time re-
quired for grinding.
One company is now producing a
flame-hardening machine which heats
only the outer tooth shell, without
touching the base of the gear. Quench-
ing after such localized heating pro-
duces no distortion. This provides a

possible application for the shaving
process in aircraft gear manufacture.
The only restriction is that the gear
must be made of carbon steel to re-
spond to the treatment, and thus far
it has been difficult to educate airplane
designers to using anything other than
alloy steel.
The other two major finishing proc-
esses, lapping and burnishing, are ac-
complished in much the same way on
machines of similar design. Lapping
is an abrasion process in which the
work is rotated in contact with a
master gear, usually of cast iron, while
a lapping compound is introduced be-
tween the meshing teeth. A cross re-
ciprocating motion is used to rub the
teeth against each other. In burnish-
ing, however, the work is rotated in
contact with one, two, or three gears,
without a grinding compound and
without the cross-reciprocating mo-
tion of lapping. By means of weighted
levers connected to the axle of one of
the master gears, pressure is exerted on
the work and cold working of the tooth
surfaces results. The last important
difference between the two methods is
that lapping follows, while burnishing
precedes heat treatment.
Burnishing is fast losing its useful-
ness because it is a cold-work process
which sets up internal stresses in the
gear. After heat is applied, these in-
ternal stresses subject the gear to fa-
tigue failure. Burnishing is chiefly
used for cleaning up tooth profile for
noise reduction.
Lapping, like burnishing, is not so
popular a process as some people
imagine. There seems to be a mis-
taken idea that it is a cure-all for gear
inaccuracies. But its true value lies in
its ability to smooth out grinding or
cutting scratches. If more than 0.001"
is to be removed, lapping is not
practical.
A so-called revolutionary gear ad-
vance of 1940 has been the first pro-
duction of gears with "Elliptoid" or
crowned teeth. Crowned teeth are
thicker in the center, preventing ex-
cessive stress concentration at the un-
supported edges. Crowning is done
in the lapping process by having one-
lap on center, and the other two laps
of a three lap machine (Fig. 3) off
center on each side of the work gear
producing a crown (Fig. 4). Crowning
may also be produced by shaving. It
permits the use of a gear working be-
tween inaccurate bearings without
causing a corner bearing on the teeth.
This process has been called revo-
lutionary because the government will
not accept crowned gears for any of
their war machines now on order. How-
ever, there is every reason to believe
that, since crowned teeth are superior
to straight ones because of their equal
stress distribution, they will prove their

advantage in service tests, and will be
universally accepted. Crowning has
been known for a number of years, but
its advantages are only now becoming
fully realized.

might. Most of us know how we
should study, but few of us follow
even the most rudimentary of the
principles we know, at the expense of
considerable time and effort.
I have found that I can study best
when absolutely cut off from contact
with my fellows. My roommates are
the best in the world; I love my fra-
ternity brothers; telephone calls and
appeals for aid from underclassmen
(with the mistaken idea that I re-

my ego; I even like swing music
played over midwestern radio sta-
tions—but all these and heaven too
keep me from studying effectively.
Purely for self-defense, therefore, I
either find a room where I can lock
out the distractions or go to the
library where telephones, roommates,
and radios are ruled as illegal inter-
ference with the pass receiver. In the
last two mentioned places I can study
quietly, without distraction, and most
important of all, in about one-third of
the time I would require elsewhere.
A recent all-campus survey shows
that the classroom is the favorite
sleeping place for 73.49% of the stu-
dent body. Although I do suspect the
absolute validity of these figures, I
believe they probably aren't far from
wrong if those who are mentally asleep
are also included. Those who waste
(Continued from page II)
time in the classroom by sleeping
(either physically or mentally) are
practically forced to educate them-
selves—and they wonder why the
assignments are so tough or why they
so often find themselves working on
the wrong material. My Scotch blood
and a natural curiosity have saved me
from this fate and compelled me to get
the most out of the class periods. And
it does pay dividends -not only in the
form of smaller apple bills at the end
of the month, but also in a better
understanding of the subject matter.
Two other study habits have es-
pecially helped me. The first is the
habit of taking complete notes on all
reading done. I do this not for use in
review, but to help me correlate the
various things I read and to force me
to pay attention to what I am reading.
The second is the attempt to spend
a little time each night in advance
studying. This procedure enables me
to find points which aren't quite clear
after this hurried survey of the subject.
Noting these points, il is possible to
get them cleared up the first time the
topic is introduced in class.
Each individual must find his own
best study procedure. The above,
combined with regular periods for
study and special times for reviewing,
have proven successful for me. The
most important habit to learn, how-
ever, is the good old-fashioned one of
rolling up one's sleeves and wading in.

Originally it was planned to present
a discussion on "How to Study" from
the viewpoint of the student. It is
readily appreciated that study is a
means to an end. Studying engineer-
ing is like practicing engineering; many
methods and combinations of methods
can be used to do the same job. For
example, it cannot be said arbitrarily
that studying should be carried on
"with or without a date;" that de-
pends on the date. The best time to
study, as well as the best place to
study, depends on the temperament of
the student. The schedule of courses,
the amount of outside work, and the
extent of participation in professional,
cultural, social, and athletic activities
are all variables that influence the
curve of "study vs. scholastic success."
The complexity of this problem makes
it too ambitious a topic for a student
to discuss; such advice might be more
harmful than helpful. If one is in-
terested in improving his technique in
studying technical subjects, individual
conferences with an experienced and
sympathetic educator are to be highly
recommended. However, there are
several general observations concern-
ing this business of going to school
that may be of interest to students
in engineering.
For a man to be a good engineer he
has to "know his stuff." Good charac-
ter and appearance, along with cour-
tesy and tactfulness, are very impor-
tant in professional life; yet these are
secondary. When an engineer is hired
there is a job to be done; his knowledge
and experience in the work are given
first consideration by the employer.
You can't be an expert if you don't
know the fundamentals. To be sure,
the courses offered in a standard en-
gineering curriculum are barely the
fundamentals of the game. There is
no subject included which will not
assist an engineer directly in his serv-
ice to industry. An ambitious boy
learns these fundamentals thoroughly
during his college days. Study seems
to be the only way to master these
details.
In this business of going to school,
the health of the student is a major
consideration. Serious thought should
be given to the development and main-
tenance of a strong physique. A clear,
alert mind usually accompanies good
health. Contact with successful men
in our field emphasizes the fact that
they refrain from such habits as might
affect their physical fitness. A car
that has been driven over cliffs several
times might not operate with the same
smoothness and efficiency. A body
that receives similar treatment might
be similarly affected. Regular habits
of study and rest are important also.
Two or three extra hours of extra work
the night before may render one useless
the entire next day.
Another observation concerns the
fact that a wise student never wastes
time. When an hour is spent in such a
way, it is not 1/24 of a day that is

lost but 1/8 or 1/10, depending on the
daily allocation for study. Half-
hearted study is also wasting time.
The success of a study period is not
measured by the number of hours con-
sumed; speed is as important in study
as it is in athletics. Good students
are not only accurate, they are fast.
Factories pay "time and a half" for
overtime. Similar returns come to
students who deny themselves regu-
larly several hours of entertainment in
favor of the books.
The next thought concerns the
bonuses that punctual students "cash
in on." When a course is studied regu-
larly, the class-room discussions and
lectures mean something. Conserva-
tively, it can be said that with the
proper preparation an hour in class is
worth several at the desk. A wise
student takes advantage of this fact.
To go on, a fellow who gels each course
"cold" as it comes along is not bothered
by that material later on. Half of a
graduate student's time is spent learn-
ing the things that were supposed to
have been mastered during his under-
graduate days. There are a few boys
in each class who learn this early in
life and capitalize on it.
A student is most wise if he so equips
duces a further magnified image, which
can be seen on a large fluorescent
screen through six observation win-
dows. For permanent records, the
screen may be removed and the
electron image allowed to strike a
photographic plate.
Since the electron beam would be de-
flected by air molecules, it must be in
a vacuum. Thus, the whole tube is
evacuated, including the specimen
chamber and the camera chamber.
In order to facilitate changing speci-
mens and photographic plates, their
respective chambers are fitted with
air locks so that the vacuum of the
main system may remain unbroken.
To further safeguard and simplify the
changing of specimens, the operation
of one handle lifts the specimen from
the objective lens, places it in a sepa-
rate section, and isolates that compart-
ment from the main body of the instru-
ment. The operation of a second
handle releases the outside door to the
section and breaks the vacuum in that
compartment simultaneously. The

specimen cartridge can then be re-
placed by a similar operation. Such
replacement is said to be so exact
that if a specimen is removed for ad-
ditional experiments and then re-
placed, only a slight adjustment of
the focus, if any, is necessary.
An additional refinement is pro-
vided to facilitate the initial adjust-
ment of the specimen. Three ports are
used for viewing the intermediate
image on a fluorescent screen close to
the plane of the projection lens coil.
The relatively low magnification of
this stage makes possible the easy se-
lection of the most interesting part of
the specimen, and the simple move-
ment of it into position to be magnified
further by the projection lens.
With the instrument, the University
intends to study such micro-organisms
as bacteriophage, filterable viruses, and
genes. Bacteriophage is especially im-
portant, since it is a destroyer of some
harmful bacteria. Genes are interest-
ing because they are the hereditary
factors in chromosomes. Biologists
Michigan men, who have watched Tom
Harmon during the last three years,
should appreciate thoroughly the value
of being "tops in the game." In en-
gineering, as in all professions, there
is a mythical rating of the men in each
particular branch. All of the manu-
facturers and contractors want the
men whose reputations have estab-
lished them as authorities. Jobs arc-
not handed out on a basis proportional
to training and experience. A choice
few get all of the interesting and
spectacular work, with big pay and
bigger bonuses; whereas the great
masses of less ambitious engineers do
routine operations, which seldom give
experience that leads to brighter days.
A final observation concerns the fact
that natural ability does not insure a
student of scholastic success and pro-
fessional prominence. It is a very
common sight to see an industrious
boy outclass his more capable brother.
In this" connection Dr. Katz often
makes the following remark: "In
thermodynamics, work energy is the
product of the 'intensive factor—
pressure' and the 'extensive factor—
volume'; in life, it is the combination
of the 'intensive factor—ability' and
the 'extensive factor—effort' that re-
sults in professional power."

of large molecules, such as various
proteins and chlorophyll.
Chemists are anxious to study the
shapes of colloidal particles, while
chemical engineers will be able to
study the minute structure of plastics,
rubber, paints, and metals. Of course,
specimens must not be opaque to the
electron beam; therefore they must be
cut into sheets less than .001 mm.
thick.
The University of Michigan is for-
tunate indeed to be able to obtain an
electron microscope. It is the fifth
one to make its appearance on the
North American continent. The equip-
ment was requested by the Depart-
ments of Physics, Bacteriology, Chem-
ical Engineering, Chemistry, and Elec-
trical Engineering. The microscope
stands seven feet high, weighs 700
pounds, and is rated at 60 kilovolts.
It will be housed in the first basement
of the Randall Laboratory, and will be
operated under the supervision of Pro-
fessor O. S. Duffendack.

A large fruit juice extractor looks so simple that there
would not appear to be any special problems in the
selection of materials for its parts. Yet, the screw must
stand high pressures, and tramp iron can cause seri-
ous trouble. Ripe fruit won't wait for machine repairs.
Because it meets all three demands of the service
so well one manufacturer of extractors now uses
nothing but cast Carbon-Molybdenum steel for the
screws. The steel (1) develops the requisite strength
and toughness when normalized; (2) is comparatively
inexpensive and (3) permits easy reconditioning when
it is finally required — the worn spots being built up by
welding and re-machined to original dimensions.
Here, then, is another case where the use of modern
materials has economically achieved a distinct prod-
uct benefit. Our book, "Molybdenum in Steel", is sent
free on request to technical students and all others
interested in modern materials for modern needs.

the dogs!
We hope this doesn't sound as if we
were apologizing; we*re not! We're just
fighting mad. We had one of the best
stories of the year set up in this space.
If you don't believe it, come look at a
page proof.
Now, we won't accuse the Daily of
going over to our printer and reading
our copy to get ideas; but it sure did
look suspicious when they told the story
about the boys that frenched the Presi-
dent's bed, just after we had sent the
copy to press.
But the Daily did us a good turn that
same day, when it announced the re-
sults of the campus poll on magazines
and newspapers. This eased our mind
considerably, because it told us a com-
petitor of ours was getting along all
right. And we'd been worried about the
Gargoyle, too. But it's doing pretty well;
with only five or six times as many
potential readers, it was proclaimed fav-
orite magazine just as often as the
Technic was.
blow-out
Auto ban or no auto ban, some stu-
dents will dash off to Chicago for a
big weekend every so often. Recently
a couple of engineers were bowling
along toward the Windy City in an
old Model A Ford. Suddenly, there

was a loud report. Instinctively, the
driver clutched the wheel more tightly
and brought the car to a stop. Jump-
ing out, they examined all four tires.
Every one was as sound as when it
came from the re-treader. Then some-
one noticed the spare tire in the fender
well. It was flat as a pancake, with a
gaping blow-out in the casing.
w m
frequency
All engineering students take phys-
ics. Some of them have trouble with
it. Some lit students take physics,
too, but it doesn't bother them. In
fact, it's right up their alley.
Recently on a class quiz one of them
was drawing an "audiograph" of
sounds heard by the human ear. It
was no trouble for him to remember
the graph from the textbook. Un-
hesitatingly he went ahead, plotting
intensity in decibels against frequency
in "osculations" per second.

it can't happen here
Lit school honorary societies get into
difficulties never encountered, of course,
by the societies made up of efficient en-
gineers. One of them, composed of Lit
BMOC's, quite reasonably thought it
would be fine to have a joint dinner
meeting with a BWOC group. Every-
body was having a fine time until it
came time to pay the check. The girls
had assumed the boys were throwing
the party, while the boys had counted
on a Dutch treat.
And something happened to another
society which just never could happen
to engineers. They laid rather elaborate
plans for a beer party, and on the ap-
pointed night only the president and
the faculty advisor showed up.
E C T S
higher
We were a little surprised when the
cop on the corner told us the street was
blocked because of a fire. What was
there on South University that could
burn? Besides, we couldn't see any
flames.
Soon the darkness disclosed the Ann
Arbor Fire Department, out in full

force. We gave a merry cheer when we
noticed they were parked by the Law
Quad. But we still didn't see any fire.
Well, there are false alarms, of course.
Pretty soon a friend emerged from
the Quad. We asked the obvious ques-
tion, and were told that some papers
had been on fire in the basement.
We knew there was a reason for hav-
ing the hook-and-ladder truck there!
goodbye now
And now we sit down and take our
typewriter in hand—gosh, it's heavy—
to say goodbye. Here it is March al-
ready. We don't know how that can
have happened so soon; we just now-
started editing the Tf.chnic. But the
year has gone by, for the calendar says
so.
In leaving, of course, we want to
thank the entire staff for the swell co-
operation that has made the year go so
fast. And we want to thank the college
for the appreciation it has expressed
from time to time.
And now we commend you to the
mercies of the new staff.

ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL REASONS FOR USING ANTI-FRICTION BEARINGS
T^kcause of the dependence placed upon them in the produc-
tion line, machines of modern design can afford to employ only
those parts whose reliability and service life can he accurately
determined before they are used. That is why more and more
machine builders are standardizing on ball bearings, the fun-
damental bearing type which gives assured performance.
The ball bearing has a thoroughly sound background of
scientific principle governing its design, and the life and capacity
of ball bearings—New Departure ball bearings—are subject
to as accurate mathematical determination as is the strength of
a steel bridge. New Departure ball bearings are the last word
in anti-friction bearings.

Millions and millions of New

made even one revolution in a

financier
If you have tried to spend some
money in the Engineering College in
the past two years you probably ran
into some trouble—in the form of one
Harold Britton. Here's why: he is
Business Manager of the Michigan

Hal Britton
Money, music, and motorcycles
Technic, treasurer of the Senior Class,
treasurer of the Engineering Council,
Finance Chairman of the 1941 Slide
Rule Ball, and has been Circulation
Manager of the Technic, Finance
Chairman of the Engineering Ball,
Ticket Chairman of the 1940 Slide
Rule Ball, and House Manager of his
fraternity, Theta Xi.
But Hal is not the "money grubber"
that these statistics might seem to in-
dicate. Ever since grade school, music
has been one of his major interests; he
played in the high school band and
orchestra in his home town, Midland,
Michigan, tooted his French horn in
the University marching and concert
bands for four years, and played in
pun
the University Symphony for three
semesters. Topping all this off is
membership in Kappa Kappa Psi,
honorary band fraternity.
In between all these activities and
studying Electrical Engineering, Hal
found himself elected to Eta Kappa
Nu, Tau Beta Pi, and Vulcans, served
on the Engineering Council for the
last three years as representative of
his class, and later of A. I. E. E., and
is this year Chairman of the Honor
Council.
Born right here in University Hos-
pital in 1918 while his father was teach-
ing and getting a Ph. U. in organic
chemistry, Hal deserted Ann Arbor at
the age of two when his dad went to
work for the Dow Chemical Company
in Midland. Boy Scouts, music,
sports, and camp counseloring occu-
pied his adolescent years, and on gradu-
ation from high school in 1935 he took
a trip out to the west coast. He re-
turned for a year of post graduate
work, then set out for Kansas City,
Missouri, for a course in radio and
television. Obtaining his first class
radio-telephone operator's license, he
worked for three months as an opera-
tor and engineer for station KXBY in
Kansas City.
But the lure of his home state was
too great, and in February of 1937 he
came back to Midland to work for
Dow. Then in the fall it was the Col-
lege of Engineering of the University
of Michigan for him, where he began
a dizzy whirl of activities which has
continued for four years.
Hal found himself a charter resident
of Allen-Rumsey, and recalls many
hectic happenings of those early dorm
days. Tossing bottles out of windows
onto lawns across the street and turn-
ing the tables on a "friend" who at-
tempted to empty a metal waste
basket full of water under his door were
among the events that brought down
the wrath of the housemother.
Our versatile hero also has athletic
inclinations, preferring hockey and
other winter sports, and motorcycling.
(He's on his second machine and no
accidents yet.) Social life? Four J-
Hops and three Senior Balls give one
an idea of that.
What the future holds he cannot
predict. If the draft holds off, he may
come back for graduate study or else
take a job doing research and test
work. But we think his future's all
predetermined. We can see him now
as the treasurer of a big electrical
company, sitting in a plush lined
office signing checks (and darn few
of 'em).

noted two interesting facts on this oc-
casion (1) that Hitler is a demonstra-
tive, shouting speaker and (2) that the
political campaign going on then was
for one man only. There was no op-
position whatsoever, and for this
reason, Prof. Dodge says that he can-
not understand the political psycholo-
gy of the German people. Because of
his position as second lieutenant in the
Coast Artillery Corps during the first
World War, this trip has put him
again in close contact with the an-
tagonistic nations of the world. His
real purpose in being in Europe at this
time however, was to view some of the
hydraulic laboratories in the schools of
Germany, Switzerland, and Austria.
Except for this extensive trip, most
of Prof. Dodge's life has been spent in
and around Ann Arbor. He was born
at Whitmore Lake on Nov. 7, 1893,
from whence he came to the Univer-
sity of Michigan to obtain both his
B.S. (C.E.) and M.S. (C.E.). Before
he had received his first college degree,
he helped a graduate student design
the highway arch which crosses the
Huron River near the Michigan Cen-
tral Depot. On other occasions he has
been employed by private concerns as
appraiser, consultant and designer.
An unusual job came to him through
his association with Dean M. E.
Cooley. Dean Cooley was one of three
partners in an appraisal firm in Ann
Arbor which gained a national repu-
tation from its work on the Pere Mar-
quette Railway. Out of this, Prof.
Dodge was assigned to a similar job
for the Peerless Cement Co. which
was going into receivership. He was
chief appraiser on this job, and now
has a one and one-half inch volume of
tissue pages as evidence of his work.
The purpose was to completely evalu-
ate the company's property.
Some of his other home work in-
cludes designing and supervising the
construction of the two large Ann
Arbor storm sewers and various other
smaller sewers. He has also had
authority in the design and construc-
tion of upstate storm and interceptor
sewers and drains, and he helped pro-
mote the new Ann Arbor water soften-
ing plant, which was so badly needed.
A hobby of Prof. Dodge's which has
probably grown out of the publication
of his book on Fluid Mechanics along
with M. J. Thomson, is constructing
various lecture table devices for demon-

Too many big, tough brutes
strating hydraulic principles. He is a
firm believer in the idea that a profes-
sor's first duty is to instruct his stu-
dents, while research and consultation
are secondary measures, although both
are necessary for complete success.
Typically modest in his attitude, Prof.
Dodge is not the type to accept credit
where he is not deserving of it. Also,
retaining a youthfulness that belies
his years of experience, it is not un-
common for him to invite his daughter
down for a coke with all the gallantry
of a "college student."
chairman
When June rolls around, and the
members of the class of '4IE receive
their diplomas, they can thank James
V. Winkler for planning and carrying
out the work of the Commencement
Committee, for on his shoulders falls
the job of making June twenty-first a
success in the eyes of the graduating
seniors.
"Wink" was born in Manitowac,
Wisconsin, but most of his life has been
spent in Manistee, Michigan, his pres-
ent home. In high school he spent
most of his extra time playing football
and participating in sports in general.
A co-captaincy of the football team
featured his senior year.
Upon graduation from high school,
Wink took a job on a Great Lakes
steamship, working in the engine room.
The experience gained during those
four years has been very helpful here
in school. While working, he took
a correspondence course in Civil En-
gineering, and would have received a
degree if he had kept it up a few
months longer. He says that this cor-
respondence stuff is the real thing, and
you really learn something—no pipes,
either!
Wink decided that Civil Engineering
was not for him, and in 1937 he entered
the University of Michigan as a candi-
date for a degree in Mechanical En-
gineering. During his freshman and
sophomore years he played football,
until he had so much trouble with his
shoulders he had to drop out—too
many big tough brutes, anyway.
In his junior year he became a mem-
ber of Tau Beta Pi, and was initiated
into Delta Tau Delta fraternity. This
year Wink is managing to keep himself
plenty busy. He was chairman of the
Tau Bete initiation and was tapped by
Vulcans. Elected as Vulcans' repre-
sentative to the Engineering Council,
he served as Patrons Co-chairman of
the Engineering Ball.
When Wink graduates, he would
like to do his bit in the design and pro-
duction of aircraft engines. He likes
hunting, fishing, swimming, and sports
in general. And as for love life—ask
him why he spent every week end last
semester in Detroit. He's got some-
thing there.

1,000,000 volt pictures
X-ray examination of steel castings
has played a vital part in the pro-
duction of high-quality steel castings
during the past few years. Through
the application of this method, flaws
which would otherwise pass unde-
tected have been discovered and recti-
fied before machinery went into actual
service. This use of X-rays has proved
to be especially useful in the inspection
of great steel castings used in mam-
moth turbines, and in countless other
ways to insure high quality in ma-
chinery.
Up until a short time ago, the largest
industrial unit in use anywhere in the
world was a 400,000 volt unit which
required one hour to make an X-ray
picture through four inches of steel
three feet away. Today a 1,000,000
volt unit is in operation, and will do
the same job in two minutes.
This new giant is housed in a special
building—a structure 100 feet long by
35 feet wide. The walls of the build-
ing are of solid concrete, 14 inches
thick, plus 12 inches of brick on the
interior. Through this precaution,
stray X-rays are prevented from es-
caping into surrounding buildings. A
30-ton crane handles castings for in-
spection. The X-ray equipment is
completely contained in a large cylin-
drical tank which is suspended from
another crane to facilitate operations.
dehydra tor
An automatically operated, self-
contained dehydrator, embodying the
principle of removing moisture from
air by adsorption without resorting
to low temperature cooling, employs
silica gel as the dehydration or ad-
sorption substance. The gel is capable
of adsorbing up to 40% of its weight
in moisture. The unit is entirely auto-
matic in operation and consists essen-
tially of a rotating cylindrical wire-
screen drum containing silica gel, two
fans and fan motor, and a drive
mechanism to rotate the drum. It is
necessary to heat the air to activate
the gel and this is accomplished either
by gas or steam heating. The dehy-
drator finds use in the manufacture of
explosives, films, plastics, candy, and
other products requiring a dry at-
mosphere.

In addition, the cables contain three
pairs of telephone wires.
The deep water sections of the
cables are 4.18 inches in diameter with
each of the three conductors having
an area of 500,000 circular mils. The
shore ends are 4.84 inches in diameter
with an area of 750,000 circular mils
in each of the conductors.
The unusual size of the cables pre-
vented the use of reels. The problem
was finally solved by coiling the cable
in water-tight gondola cars. The cable
was tested in these same cars by the
simple process of filling the cars with
water and running the high voltage
tests.
new bearing
A development of the technique of
powder metallurgy promises 200r&lt;
longer bearing life and increased engine
economies. The bearing is essentially a
thin layer of high-lead babbitt bonded
to a steel back by means of an inter-
mediate layer of sintered nickel and
copper powder in the approximate per-
centages of 40 and 60 respectively.
These powders are heated in a con-
trolled atmosphere to sinter the powders
and bond them to the steel backing.
The babbitt metal is then made to flow
into the rough surfaces of the copper-
nickel matrix forming a mechanical
bond. The thinner this layer of babbitt,
the greater the efficiency of the bear-
ing. Heavy babbitt shells tend to crack
and fail under continuous loads.
This type of bearing, manufactured
under the name of "Durex No. 100," if
being used at the present time exclus-
ively in a modern automobile which if
proving the bearing's efficiency through
tests and natural wear. On the basis of
these tests it is predicted that the life
of the bearings will be 2009c longer
than that of any others previously in
use. The new bearing is recognized as
an advanced stage of development:
however, further improvement is still
possible.
blitzbombs
An important factor in World War
II is the use of incendiary bombs.
Through their use whole cities have
been razed, and their "terror value" is
of considerable importance to the
modern tactician.
Two types of incendiary bombs are
known to exist and are popularly
called electron bombs and multiple-
effect bombs. The electron bomb con-
sists of a shell of electron metal (80
percent magnesium and 20 percent
hardening metal), inside which is a
charge of thermite. Unlike thermite
bombs used in the first World War, the
magnesium shell and not the thermite
is the principal incendiary material.
Ignited by mechanical means upon
impact, the bombs burn for ten or
fifteen minutes with a temperature of
26
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


ing in weight from one kilogram to
twenty-five kilograms, the lighter
bombs are dropped ia lots of ten or
twenty from containers within the
plane. Such a number released from
a height of a mile or more would strike
within an area of 10,000 square yards.
Heavier electron bombs are used for
specific objectives such as power plants
or factories.
The electron bomb is exceedingly
difficult to extinguish. Water acceler-
ates the burning of the magnesium and,
because of this fact, may be used to
shorten the life of the fire as well as
wet down the surrounding area.
Since the oxygen required for the re-
action of the thermite charge comes
from the iron oxide of the thermite,
the electron bomb cannot be smothered
while the thermite is burning. How-
ever, the British have developed a
''snuffer" made of wire mesh sprayed
and covered with asbestos. Ordinarily
a minute is required to extinguish the
bomb by this method.
The multiple-effect bomb contains
separate incendiary units which spread
over a wide area upon impact. It
weighs approximately twelve kilograms
and consists of either magnesium, phos-
phorous, or both.
synthetic phenol
Since 18.54, phenol has been made
from coal, the proportion of phenol to
byproducts being relatively small. The
plastics industry has grown so fast,
however, having increased by over a
hundred-fold, that it has become neces-
sary to synthesize basic materials, such
as phenol, used in their manufacture.
Recently a new $2,000,000 plant has
been constructed at North Tonawanda,
New York, for the production of syn-
thetic phenol from several common
chemicals. When phenol is made by
this new method, known as the Raschig
process, its ratio to by-products is ten
to one. The plant is the largest of its
kind in the world, and the only one in
the United States. It is one of the
most amazing chemical units in the
world and, in spite of its size and
intricacy, it can be operated at full
capacity by a force of six men and a
supervisor for each shift. Operations
are controlled automatically by these
men at master control panels. In case
of motor trouble anywhere, automatic
signal divisions warn the operators who
can then cut in duplicate equipment
from their control stations. This dupli-
cate equipment has been installed at
every stage for use in case of trouble.
The various units are joined with 40
miles of pipe, three miles of which are
made of glass, porcelain, or rubber to
withstand the action of acids at high
temperatures.
The process itself is so intricate that
many leading chemical engineers in
this country refused to consider it
when it was first proposed here a few
years ago. Briefly, it consists of first
passing a vapor mixture of benzene,
hydrochloric acid, and air through a
catalyst. This produces a mixture of
chlorinated benzenes from which mon-
ochlor-benzene is distilled in the pure
state for use in the second step. In
the second step, a vapor mixture of
monochlor-benzene and steam is passed
over a catalyst. The reaction produces
phenol, and the hydrochloric acid is
re-formed. These two stages actually
form a completely continuous process,
and during the process most of the
materials formed, and the catalysts,
are recovered for re-use.
The new plant assures an inde-
pendent and controlled source of the
purest phenol obtainable in this coun-
try—well above U.S.P. standards. Not
only does it make possible improved
plastics, but it also aids definitely in
national defense, since phenol is used
in some explosives.

MUCH 2 8 AO 29
FOR months now, students have
been discussing the Engineering
Open House. When it was indicated
last fall that there would be whole-
hearted support for the project, the
But this is not all that has been
planned for March 28 and 29. There
is also to be an alumni meeting Satur-
day. There are hundreds of graduates
in nearby cities who would like to meet

The Engineering College has a reputation for teamwork
Engineering Council formed an Open
House Committee, composed of Coun-
cil members and organization repre-
sentatives. It lost no time getting
started to work and drawing up plans.
The faculty and student societies have
cooperated in planning exhibits and
demonstrations, and to add still fur-
ther to the interest and value of the
program, industries have been asked
to lend educational exhibits.
A banquet, primarily for under-
graduates, has been arranged for the
night preceding the exhibition.
Uean Crawford, and have never had
a chance. Furthermore, the Univer-
sity has felt for a long time that it
would like to honor some of its out-
standing engineering alumni. It has
not been possible to award many pro-
fessional degrees, such as Mechanical
Engineer or Aeronautical Engineer, be-
cause theses are required for these de-
grees, and a successful engineer hasn't
time to stop and write a thesis. There-
fore, a reunion luncheon is to be held,
at which Governor Murray U. Van-
Wagoner, '2IE, who is probably the
College's most prominent alumnus, is
to speak. Afterward, several citations
will be made at a meeting in the
Rackham Building.
These meetings will serve to remind
both students and graduates what a
broad and complex field Engineering
is, and what a remarkable Engineering
College Michigan has. They will prob-
ably do more to awaken alumni inter-
est in the college and its future than
any event in years. Even though the
benefits of active alumni support may
be somewhat intangible, they are not
slight. Such support is one of the im-
portant reasons why the University of
Michigan has been able to rise to
leadership in so many fields, and why
it will continue to lead.
The foundation for a successful Open
House has been well laid by an efficient
and hard-working committee. Al-
though much work has been done,
more remains, for in the next two weeks
the details must be attended to. Ex-
hibits must be set up, and efficient
guide service provided.
If this work is left to pile up on a
few shoulders, the Open House is likely
to be a failure. If the load is properly
distributed, there should be little in-
convenience to anyone, and the project
will be a great success.
We all agreed last fall that we
wanted to hold this exhibition, and
that each of us was willing to do his
share. All we need to do now is to
stick to our promise, and cooperate
with the Open House Committee.
These last two weeks will be a critical
period, and team work will be vital.
The Engineering College has a repu-
tation for teamwork. We feel sure a
successful 1941 Open House will be
another victory for that spirit.

GOVERNOR
VAN WAGONER
"Success story" of Michi-
gan's most prominent Engi-
neering College Graduate.
T F ever you have met a man who has a
1- remarkable sense of humor, who has a
pleasing disposition, you will know what
kind of a man Governor Van Wagoner
is. With a vast understanding of men,
and an aptitude for repartee, he is now-
piloting the Michigan ship of state.
Although he was named Murray by
his mother because she ''liked the sound
of it", he has been called Pat since
birth. His early life was spent in Pontiac,
where he was educated in the Wisner
and Baldwin grade schools. Mrs. Mable
Roy, one of his teachers, challenged her
class one day with the statement, "It's
all very well to finish grade and high
schools, but the acid test is to graduate
from college." Pat took the challenge
seriously, and set his mind to studying
for a college career. He had a natural
aptitude for mathematics, but other
studies were conquered only after hard
work.
As a Michigan man in the class of
1921, Pat's college career was character-
ized by activity. Since his biggest aim
in life was to build bridges, he entered
the Civil Engineering department in
1917. Pat wasn't on the campus two
days before he was rebelling at the
sophomore hazing gang. One night hs
refused to tip his "pot" to several sopho-
mores so they demanded reparations en
masse. Pat was taking care of himself
all right until eight or ten more closed
in upon him with murder in their eyes.
He decided to evacuate. Turning, and
rushing through the corner drug store,
he shouted to his close friend Les Wikel,
"See them? When they give me a break,
just watch me." Taking off with a wide
open throttle, he sprinted out, and into

an alley. Before anyone knew what had
happened, Pat was safely tucked away
in a chicken coop for the rest of the
night.
Young Pat was not one of the rich
boys who frequented the campus in
those days, for he found it necessary
to work to pay for a part of his expenses.
He worked at Marquardt's garage on
the midnight shift; later, he was em-
ployed by a local undertaking firm. His
summer position was with the Pontiac
division of General Motors. He has often
expressed his deep regrets for not be-
coming an affiliated man, for he was
pleased with fraternity life at that time,
saying, "there was not a heel in the
crowd."
But his work was not enough to keep
him busy. Pat liked football, and after
a tough season, won his freshman award.
In his first game as starting center in
his sophomore year, he suffered a knee
injury that plagued him all the rest of
his football days, but Pat still won two
reserve awards. Coach Yost remarked
about his perseverance and his deter-
mination to do his bit for the team.
In addition to being a football man,
Pat became vice-president of his class,
President of the then existent Pontiac
Club, member of the American Society
of Civil Engineers, Web and Flange,
Triangles, Vulcans, and the Gridiron
Club.
The University awarded the man a
diploma in 1921.
Van Wagoner's construction career
was one of commendable achievement.
His friends agree that he has a remark-
able degree of engineering judgment,
for he can make a plan and then work
it out. His keen ability for making de-
cisions quickly and his good disposition
have won the respect and friendship of
all who know him. He carries the Mich-
igan tradition of being democratic in
the sense that his judgment of men is
based solely upon their qualities and

pearances. In organization work, he
uses a positive approach to men, but if
the situation demands it, he can show
that he's "tough."
After graduation he saw his dream
come true—he built some bridges. In the
employ of the Michigan State Highway
Department as a project engineer, Van
Wagoner's first bridge was a 90-foot
camel's back on M-46 at Elwell west
of Alma; his second, a swing bridge at
Marine City over the Bell River.

Michigan State Capitol
A far cry from a chicken coop
But public life soon gave way for a
Pontiac engineering firm, then a consult-
ing business of his own. It prospered for
the next seven years. As an organization
man during these years, Van Wagoner
was a member of the Pontiac Exchange
Club and aided in forming the city's
Junior Chamber of Commerce.
In 1928, politics took his eye again
and he ran for county surveyor, but
took a licking.
In 1930, his two organizations asked
him to represent them on the second an-
nual Michigan air tour. While he was
away from home, his friends thought
he should get into public service once
more, so they circulated petitions for
him to run for the position of count}'
drain commissioner on the Democratic
ticket. Murray was not anxious to run
since he still recalled the incident of
1928. The election, however, turned to
his favor with a 51S majority—the first
Democratic victory in Oakland County
in twenty years.
Van Wagoner policies caused county
tax savings. As a result, he was re-
elected two years later by a 7400 ma-
jority. Thus was the future governor's
political career launched in earnest.
The spring of 1933 saw the unanimous
nomination of Murray for the post of
State Highway Commissioner at the
Democratic State Convention. With a
vast majority, he moved into office for
a term of four years, and was re-elected
in 1937. He has the distinction of being
the first Democrat to hold the post.
Murray's ability as a leader became
fully recognized through his organiza-
tion work. His record as chairman of
the Anti-Diversion Committee of the
American Road Builders' Association,
led, in 1938, to his election as president
of the Association, the largest highway
organization in the world. [The Anti-
Diversion Committee was established for
the purpose of preventing the diversion
of gasoline taxes from highway construc-
tion.] Re-elected in 1939, he joined the
board of directors upon expiration of the
term of office.
President Roosevelt, in 1938, ap-
pointed the Commissioner as an official
American delegate to the International
Road Congress at the Hague. During
his trip abroad, he inspected many of
the great European highways. As an
amateur photographer, he kept perma-
nent records of them.
During his administration of the
Michigan highway system, roads have
been scientifically constructed. Na-
tional attention has been focused on
tourist highway development in the
state, particularly upon new shoreline
roads and roadside developments. High-
ways have been built for fast traffic.
Curves are banked for safe driving at
over 75 miles per hour and time con-
suming routings through large cities and
small communities have been success-
fully eliminated. "We are not building
roads for any community, we are build-
ing roads for the State of Michigan,"
he would say, when some troubled
Chamber of Commerce would question
his methods. Connecting links between
large cities were taken over and made
into uniform highways rather than a
disorganized group of county or com-
munity roads. The old fashioned pave-
ment-gravel-pavement trail was replaced
with a continuous concrete highway.
During his regime he had to his credit
a long list of accomplishments that made
him the country's "A number one" high-
way commissioner. After retiring a debt
of $12,000,000 in his first year of of-
fice, he proceeded to build over 1000
miles of scenic and shoreline highways
and 160 roadside parks with 3500 pic-
nic tables. With a highway planning
division to study traffic and construction
problems, he spent the sum of $94,000,-
000 for road construction without going
into debt or being charged with waste or
dishonesty. Michigan has pioneered in
the use of bituminous material for low-
cost roads, in highway markers for night
driving, and in many safety features.
With this list of achievements for a
background, and a well-rounded per-
sonality, he now attends the affairs of
the State as Governor. It seems to those
who come to see him, that he is the busi-
est man in the State, particularly when a
new social problem arrives for decisions.
On a normal day, the Executive Of-
fice is filled with persons awaiting con-
ferences, people of all sorts with some
special problem, or some ax to grind. A
large secretarial staff is required to make
and adjust appointments, to arrange
banquets, dinner dates, and social func-
tions.
One typical afternoon our appoint-
ment had been postponed; later, the
afternoon press conference had been
postponed, then cancelled. Reporters
were waiting around, some taking it
easy, others ardently discussing momen-
tous problems. From a conference room,
a rather young man stepped and asked,
"Some of you fellows want to see me?"
and the press conference was re-opened.
Smoking a cigar, the Governor leis-
urely directed the discussion of the prob-
lems of the day: the strike, the labor
policy, and the future campaign. The
press boys still remember the Governor's
engineering background. While discuss-
ing the campaign managers, one of them
threw in the remark "Are you going to
give each one a slide rule, Governor?"
To which he replied, "Well, it might be
a good idea, but some of the boys down
there might have to be educated in
using it."
We noticed a small oilcan on a leather
clad desk-set in the center of the Gov-
ernor's desk and later inquired as to
the use it had.
Smiling, he told us, "One of the Re-
publican Senators gave me that oilcan
to pour oil on the troubled waters of
state, to assure me a smooth adminis-
tration."
His concluding remark seemed to be
symbolic of a man whose career was suc-
cessfully started. To a query concerning
plans for the future, he replied, "My
first duty is to do a good job here."

Dean Crawford
A cordial welcome to Open
House festivities from our
genial host, Dean Crawford.
To Our Guests:
On this day the students of the Col-
lege of Engineering and the faculty wel-
come to our laboratories alumni, high
school visitors, students from other di-
visions of the University, and the pub-
lic generally. As hosts of the day,
members of the student body are pleased
to be of service in guiding you about the
buildings and explaining the equipment
of the various laboratories. Use their
services to the fullest extent.
Of course, the objective of this Open
House is to make as many people as
possible acquainted with the work of
the student engineer and the appliances
which the engineer uses in his capacity
as a servant to society. The Open House
also provides an opportunity for the
high school student to gain information
relative to the engineering professions;
and the term "professions" is here used
advisedly in the plural. To the public
generally many of the exhibits will be
of educational value, and the labora-
tories will demonstrate the methods em-
ployed by engineers in studying the
scientific principles underlying the dif-
ferent engineering fields.
The show which you will see today is
entirely the result of student effort. It
is not one conjured up and presented
on the spur of the moment. For months,
under the leadership of the Engineering
Council, the student governing organ-
ization, a large number of committees
have been working hard to intelligently
plan and successfully bring into being
the activities of the Open House. The
results of these labors you are witness-
ing now. In addition to experiencing
the satisfaction of seeing a job well
done, these energetic workers have had
an opportunity to learn something about
team work. Now they know a little
more about organization and its impor-
tance to engineers; to them the term
"cooperative effort" really has a mean-
ing.
And so we bid you welcome—we, the
students of the College of Engineering,
Engineering Council, and the Faculty.
May you have an interesting visit with
us, and may you carry away a clearer
picture of engineering and of the sci-
ences on which it is founded.
OPEN HOUSE, 1941

PRESENTS
committeemen
The Ninth Engineering Open House
has been directed by a committee of
Engineering Council members. Their
guidance and leadership are responsible
for its success. The co-chairmen, Rob-
ert L. Summerhays and Robert W.
Bishop, deserve special credit for the
efficient organization of sub-committees
and arrangement of the
program.
Soft-spoken, with a
bass voice, Bob Sum-
merhays comes f rom
Rochester, New York,
where he was born in
1920. He attended
West High School and
played on the soccer
team. He also tells us
proudly that he was a
member of the Tiddly-
winks Club.
Bob is a Mechanical
Engineer, especially in-
terested in power
plants. But he seems
even more interested in
activities. When he en-
tered Michigan in the
fall of 1938, he pledged
Chi Psi Fraternity.
That spring he tried
out for the Michigan
Technic and joined
its advertising depart-
ment. In his sopho-
more year, he was
elected to the Engineering Council, and
found himself too busy to continue with
the Technic. His experience was put to
good use, however, when he became
Editor of the Arch, freshman handbook,
last fall. Triangles tapped him in No-
vember. This year membership in the
Engineering Council and co-chairman-
ship of its Open House Committee have
kept Bob busy.
One of Bob's hobbies is skiing. He
spent a week-end in Cadillac, Michigan,
recently, indulging in that sport. He also
likes to sail and has spent some sum-
mers in Scout Camp.
Bob Bishop is another New Yorker,
from Niagara Falls. Born in 1919, he
went to Niagara Falls High School,
where he was Treasurer of his Senior
Class, Sports Editor of the yearbook,
the Xiagarian, and President of the Hi-
V Club.
Now in his senior year at Michigan,
"Bish" is Vice-President (and an ex-
Treasurer) of Triangle Fraternity. A
Metallurgical Engineer, one of Bob's
first connections here was with the

Bishop and Summerhays
On their shoulders, the Ninth Open House
American Institute of Metallurgical En-
gineers. As the Institute's Engineering
Council Representative, he helped Bob
Summerhays with the Arch, and is Co-
Chairman of the Open House Commit-
tee. During the summers, Bob works in
the research laboratories of the Carbide
and Carbon Chemicals Corporation. In
Ann Arbor, he works in the School of
Dentistry, preparing dental alloys.
To give a complete picture, it is only
fair to tell that a good share of his
time has been taken up by—shall we
say—a social activity?
One of Bob's fond memories is the
time he travelled about 100 miles in two
weeks by canoe, near Lake Timagami,
Ontario. "Rained every day, too," he
comments.
Of course, the responsibility of plan-
ning the Open House has been shared
by the other members of the Central
Committee, who have all done admira-
ble jobs. Bob Beals, Chemical, '42, of
Detroit; Bob Brown, Physics, '42. of
Valley Stream N. Y.; Larry Kelley,
Metallurgical, '44, of Painted Post, N.
Y.; Verne Kennedy, Metallurgical, '42,
of Evanston, 111.; and John Tietjen,
Mechanical, '41, of Lakewood, Mich.,
are the other members.
A larger committee composed of rep-
resentatives of societies, has done the
spade-work of arranging the details of
exhibits. The Aeronautical Engineering
Department was represented by Henry
T. Fielding, Jr., of I. Ae. S.; Chemical
and Metallurgical, by John Wardwell.
A. I. Ch. E., and William M. Wood.
A. I. M. E.; Civil Engineering and
Geodesy and Surveying by Robert P.
Kimball, A. S. C. E., and George Gro-
ver, Transportation Club; Electrical, by
Robert E. Miller, A. I. E. E., and Alex-
ander P. Jerencsik, Eta Kappa Nu; and
Engineering Mechanics, by Allen B.
Hamilton, Triangles.
John Tietjen, A. S. M. E., and Dud-
ley Scrogin, S. A. E., represented the
Mechanical Engineering Department;
Dave Ladd, Vulcans, the Department
of Metal Processing; and Ralph Turner
and Ray Belsley, Quarterdeck, Naval
Architecture and Marine Engineering.
Robert G. W. Brown took charge of
the Physics Department, while Fred
Elmiger, Pi Tau Pi Sigma, Ray Gau-
thier, and Verne Kennedy handled the
Reserve Officers Training Corps exhib-
its. In addition, some very important
work was done by Joe Hallisy, who ar-
ranged for industrial exhibits; William
Furniss, who prepared the motion pic-
tures program: Charles M. Brown, who
organized the guide service; and Harry
G. Drickamer, who provided publicity.
Another very important job was done
by the All-Engineering Banquet Com-
mittee of the Engineering Council,
which arranged Friday's banquet. Head-
ed by Bob Morrison, President of the
Council, it included Don Hartwell.
Michael Hindert, George Hogg, Verne
Kennedy, Ed King, and Jim Winkler.

When the first Engineering Open
House was held in 1913, it was called
an "Annual Exhibit." The second was
held in 1914, but thereafter it became
It is a great pleasure, too, to welcome
outsiders interested in the work of the
College—students from other branches
of the University, high school students,

Inside and out, the
Engineering College changes constantly
evident that it was going to be impos-
sible to have one each year. Since that
time, it has become traditional to open
the engineering buildings to visitors
every few years. This year, engineer-
ing students are proud to be able to
have the Ninth Engineering Open
House.
A great share of the visitors will be
engineering students. One of the chief
objectives of the Open House has been
to acquaint students with departments
they knew little about before, and help
underclassmen decide what branch of
Engineering they were most interested
in.
and others. It is a particular pleasure
to welcome back a large group of alumni.
Many graduates, interested in the Col-
lege and in the friends they had here,
do not have the opportunity of return-
ing often. They should find the Open
House, and the Alumni Luncheon in
connection with it, an excellent time to
come back to Ann Arbor.
The Open House Committee has
made every effort to make it possible for
visitors to get a complete, comprehen-
sive view of the College, and the work
done in training engineers. Almost all
of the laboratories have been thrown
open for inspection, and many special
exhibits and demonstrations have been
arranged. Industrial exhibits have l.-een
obtained to show some of the results of
engineers' work. Guide service has b-^en
provided to help show the displays to
the best advantage.
We hope you will enjoy seeing the
"engine school" in action, at close range,
with no locked doors. We hope you will
enjoy seeing the Open House as much
as we have enjoyed preparing it.
One of the highlights of the Open
House weekend is the second annual All
Engineering banquet on Friday night,
featuring as the principal speaker Clyde
Paton, Chief Engineer of the Packard
Motor Car Company.
When the first exhibition was held in
1913, there was not as much to show
as there is today. The West Engineering
Building had been built only eleven
years; one wing of it was only three
years old. Ten years later, in 1923, the
East Engineering Building was put into
use, greatly enlarging the facilities of
the College.
However, the size and importance of
the Engineering College has been in-
creasing constantly. More and better
equipment is now highly desirable, and
will be obtained within a few years.
Few students seem to be aware of the
Mortimer E. Cooley Foundation, estab-
lished in honor of beloved Dean Emeri-
tus Cooley, whose vision and untiring
efforts have directly been responsible
for Michigan's present high position in
engineering education. It is hoped that
two new buildings may be soon erected,
and the College permanently endowed,
through this fund. Everyone who has
ever been connected with the Engineer-
ing College will want to support this
movement.
We hope that, in a few years, you
will return to another Open House, to
see an even larger and better equipped
College of Engineering.

The instruction given at Camp Davis is similar to that offered at the camps of the leading colleges of
engineering of the United States. The camp is situated in the Jackson Hole area about 75 miles south of the
Yellowstone Park. A road connecting the Lincoln Highway at Rock Springs, Wyoming, with the Yellowstone
Park, traverses the valley of the Hoback River in which the camp is located. A splendid climate with clear days
and cool nights, a considerable area near the camp clear of trees and brush, and a topography varying from
gentle slopes to rugged mountains, combine to make this region an ideal one for giving instruction in surveying.
Students and faculty are housed comfortably in permanent buildings provided with running water, electric
lights, and a modern sanitary system. The mess furnishes excellent meals.
The work is arranged for a three-day trip to Yellowstone National Park, as well as for week-end trips to
nearer points of interest. The total cost for the eight weeks session is in the neighborhood of $150.

as incidental factors in machine design. This is a great mistake.
Many an otherwise well-designed piece of equipment has failed
to live up to expectations because of inefficient bearings.
With operating speeds constantly going higher, radial loads get-
ting heavier, thrust loads more severe, and precision tolerances
closer, bearings are more important than ever before. Don't make
the mistake of underestimating their value.
By getting a thorough knowledge of the principle, construction and
application of the TIMKEN Tapered Roller Bearing you will be
able to meet every bearing need, avoid trouble and assure correct per-
formance. This knowledge will be one of your most valuable assets
when you graduate. It will make you a better engineer. Take the first
step now—write for a free copy of the Timken Reference Manual.

UNIVERSITY ENGINEERS
STUDY
WIND GUSTS
A study of the forces which an electrical trans-
mission line must withstand during storms was
conducted at the University of Michigan. One part
of this investigation required the measurement of
the rapid fluctuations of velocity which are present
in the wind. No commercial instruments were
available which would record the wind variations
rapidly enough, so a special anemometer was de-
veloped, capable of recording accurately wind
changes occurring within intervals of time as small
as one-tenth of a second. The upper photograph
shows one of these instruments mounted on a 250-
foot tower on an exposed ridge near Ann Arbor.
The records of twelve anemometers were com-
bined to give a "cross-section" of passing wind gusts. The chart at the bottom of the page
shows one of these cross-sections which might also be referred to as a "contour map" of the
wind. It was produced by plotting the wind velocity for each interval of one-half second at
each anemometer. Contour lines were drawn so that any given line represents a particular ve-
locity. From such graphs it has been possible to identify various translatory and spinning
motions in the atmosphere, and to evaluate the dynamic effects they produce, not only on
transmission lines, but also in other fields of industry and engineering.

forts are directed towards stimulating
sales, opening new markets, dealing with
distributors, installing and servicing of
products sold, and management of for-
eign personnel. He is sometimes referred
to as a sales-engineer. In this article Mr.
Appold describes the nature of the work,
the living conditions, and opportunities
connected with the position of foreign
marketeer. Mr. Appold is well equipped
to write on this subject as he has served
as a foreign sales-engineer in Hawaii,
Japan, China, Philippine Islands, Neth-
erlands Indies, Malaya, Siam and Bur-
ma. At present he is employed as the
general manager of the Genelcctric
Rayos X, S. A. of Mexico.
rT^HE nature of the work in a foreign
country differs in many respects
quite markedly from similar work in the
United States. First of all the languages
are different in other countries (and I
feel inclined to state that that applies
even to English speaking British Col-
onies). So the aspirant for the position
of foreign marketeer should burn extra
midnight oil learning and becoming
fluent in a foreign tongue or .two. The
greater command you have of the lan-
guage of the country in which you ex-
pect to promote your company's inter-
ests, the sooner you will be prepared to
take up your post and the better you
will be able to convince the "natives"
of the benefits to be derived from your
company's products.
As world conditions have changed and
perhaps will change rapidly it is at pres-
ent difficult to predict which language
will most likely be more predominant.
It can, however, be said that the foreign
language of greater probable value is
Spanish. Spanish is the language spoken
nearly everywhere South of the Rio
Grande. These countries are still outside
of the sphere of active war and quite
probably they will remain as our foreign
markets even after the war.
Another obvious difference found in
foreign as against domestic posts is the
difference in currencies. Consequently,
the foreign marketeer has to have some
insight into the ramifications of foreign
exchange. While he will deal in the cur-
rency of the country in which he is sta-
tioned, his prices, costs and charges are
of necessity pegged to the dollar. Let
us see by example just how rate-of-ex-
change affects his problems.
Suppose we are in a country where
the currency is the peso. And let us sup-
pose the current rate of exchange is two
pesos to the dollar. You sell a $1,000
machine for 2,000 pesos. The order is
placed and the machine is shipped. But
as the foreign country is at a consider-
able distance and as the merchandise has
to pass the customs of the country,
there will be an elapsed time of several
months between the order and the final
delivery of the merchandise. The ma-
chine arrives, is installed and the money
collected. But, as has been a frequent
experience, let us suppose that between
the time of the receipt of the order and
the installation and collection, the re-
The inside dope on how to

gime of the foreign country has taken
its peso off the gold standard, or it may
have decided or been forced to devaluate
its currency, let us say to four pesos to
the dollar. Now you will still collect your
2,000 pesos, but upon going to the bank
to convert your pesos into dollars with
which to repay for the apparatus ship-
ped, you will obtain not one dollar for
every two pesos, but one dollar for every
four pesos, and for 2,000 pesos you will
receive only $500. As the merchandise
had a price of $1,000 your company
will be out a neat $500.
But there are ways and means of pro-
tecting yourself and the company. One
way is to obtain a loan from a local bank
at the time the order is taken, buying
dollars with this loan, and paying your
company in advance. As your loan for
the above-referred-to deal could have
been 2,000 pesos you would have re-
ceived 1,000 dollars at the time the or-
der was taken. Following installation
you would have received 2,000 pesos
and paid back your bank loan with the
required interest. So even if the rate-of-
exchange had slipped in the meantime
from 2 pesos to the dollar to 4-1, none
of you would have suffered except the
government bank. The company would
have received its $1,000, the customer
would have paid the stated price of
2,000 pesos and you would have liqui-
dated your loan of 2,000 pesos from the
local bank.
All that sounds like quite a simple
maneuver. However, a bank loan may
be difficult to obtain for lack of funds
or the government, anticipating its de-
valuation move, may seriously restrict
bank loans. It is then up to the foreign
marketeer to steer as best he can thru
this maze of financial entanglements.
Of course, the home office will assist him
with instructions and advice, but as they
are distant, that information may be too
late in arriving. Consequently, the for-
eign marketeer would do well to be
By
E. C. APPOLD, '27E

familiar with the intricacies of foreign
exchange so he can guide himself on a
safe course of action in the money end
of his business.
From the nature of his position in a
foreign country the foreign marketeer
finds another difference in his work as
contrasted with the work of a man in a
similar post in the U. S. Being at great
distance from his home office he cannot
always, without incurring serious de-
lays, depend on home office opinions and
advice. In the U. S. office, the sales-
engineer, the installation and service en-
gineer, and even the executives are sur-
rounded by experts with special training
who can give ready opinions. But the
foreign marketeer not being surrounded
with such competent associates finds
himself forced to rely much more heav-
ily on his own knowledge and ability.
He finds he requires a much more
rounded-out training, a more thorough
knowledge of his company's products
and a fuller understanding of his com-
pany's policies.
A great percentage, if not the major-
ity, of foreign markets are in latitudes
having different climatic conditions from
those in the U. S. High humidity is
found in many and others have high al-
titudes. High humidity and high alti-
tudes present greater engineering and

will often find that some of his units
which have functioned so faultlessly in
the IT. S. are susceptible to many acute
and chronic ailments in a foreign coun-
try. In the domestic field he may have
been trained and have gained experience
in the recognition and elimination of
defects and troubles commonly encount-
ered in the U. S. But in a foreign coun-
try he may run into difficulties the symp-
toms of which are new and strange
and the cure for which cannot be at-
tained by the standard prescription or
formula which he had been accustomed
to apply at home. Obviously the mar-
keteer cannot give up—he must take his
tools in hand and investigate the trouble
minutely, make his prescription, apply
the treatment and do a little praying on
the side.
Many companies with longer exper-
ience in export marketing have tackled
and conquered the problem of high hu-
midities and high altitudes. But at best
they have been and are handicapped, as
long-run tests under such adverse con-
ditions are almost impossible of execu-
tion in laboratories in the U. S., since
the actual tropical climatic condition
cannot be entirely duplicated in a lab-
oratory. Microbes, such as mold produc-
ing microbes, are plentiful in the Tropics
but scarce in a high humidity laboratory
room in the U. S. The next best course
is the maintainance of a close coopera-
tion between the foreign marketeer and
the department experts in the U. S.
Many companies now have an efficient
and close cooperation between their for-
eign representatives and domestic lab-
oratories and designing departments.
Should the marketeer, however, be as-
sociated with a company which as yet is
not organized towards efficiently meet-
ing and correcting weaknesses to ad-
verse climatic conditions, he would be
required to seek the correction by him-
self and to reconstruct his apparatus in
its weak spots, or to apply means for
counteracting the deteriorating effect of
adverse climatic conditions.
Strong foreign competition, a compe-
tition characterized by practices differ-
ing greatly from U. S. business prac-
tices, is another phase of foreign versus
domestic posts. Competition from for-
eign houses is most always characterized
by appreciably low prices. If he looks
carefully, the foreign marketeer will
most always find also lower quality. If
he is to compete successfully, he must
locate and bring to attention the differ-
ence in quality justifying fully the price
difference. Then again a foreign govern-
ment may have the foreign competitive
house subsidized, permitting the house
to sell at prices below standard prices.
Or the foreign marketeer may encounter
a real problem, that of a foreign country
bartering its manufactured products for
the other country's produce. The latter
can get him nicely entangled in political
machinery should he attempt the cor-
nering of at least part of the business.
In handling personnel there also exists
a difference. We Americans are reared
from childhood in an atmosphere of

. . . impregnable ring of defense
mechanical and social efficiency. When
grown we take such efficiency for grant-
ed and often fail to even recognize it.
It takes some time to learn why the
foreign personnel often fails in carrying
out well prepared and apparently easily
understood plans or orders. Details not
covered through instructions but ob-
viously necessary for attention he will
find neglected by someone who had con-
sidered them unimportant or had not
been aware of them. Then also many
practices and methods which Americans
accept and carry out as second nature
are found peculiarly strange or silly by
foreign personnel. Perhaps we are what
we appear to be to many, industrial- and
business-efficiency fanatics. But the for-
eign marketeer must remember that
while he has been reared in an atmos-
phere of efficiency others may have been
reared in other atmospheres, usually
leaning to greater and broader cultural
education. So a greater amount of un-
derstanding is required in handling per-
sonnel and greater patience while in-
stituting practices and methods designed
to improve efficiency.
So much for the nature of the work.
Let us now consider conditions as they
affect health. Almost without exception
conditions of public health are in the
U. S. very much in advance of those
in any foreign country. So you may
not find the same good sanitary condi-
tions in a foreign country as those
you have been accustomed to. This re-
quires then that you must be more on
guard for the protection of your health.
A sound and healthy physical condition
is the best protection against sickness
and diseases. So one of the requisites for
a foreign marketeer is sound health. In
the States we are accustomed to con-
sider sicknesses as transmitted through
germs in the air. In tropical countries
especially, sicknesses and diseases are
not so much transmitted through the air
as through food (mostly raw vege-
tables), water and the mosquito. Since
these are quite visible transmitting
mediums it is not a great difficulty
guarding effectively against their trans-
mitting "bugs" to you. Cooked foods,
boiled water, mosquito netting and Flit
just about build up an impregnable ring
of defense.
So while in the States you bothered
little about food and drink, except as to
the selection of the dishes most appeal-
ing at the moment, in the foreign coun-
try you would exercise greater caution
as to their selection, rejecting on occas-
ion the appealing dish for a less savory,
but safe dish. And as to mosquitoes, you
should go out of your way to avoid
playing host to them.
Should some of you consider a post
in the Tropics you might be worried
about the heat. Curiously enough I have
suffered more from heat in cities like
Chicago, Detroit and New York than in
Singapore which nestles virtually on top
of the equator. In the Tropics, you dress
for heat and houses are built for best
protection against heat. About the only
bother suffered from tropical heat is the
monotony of it. As a personal note I
might add that while in the Tropics
many of us Americans had many times
taken on Japanese baseball teams in the
early afternoon, forgetting the heat of
the day in the "heat" of the competi-
tion. Tennis courts are always crowded
on Sundays and Saturday afternoons
and a golfer seldom permits the heat to
deprive him of a Sunday's round.
Another question frequently asked by
those considering foreign posts is about
living costs. In some respects these run
higher, in other respects lower than in
the States. Plane for plane they are,
with the exception of but a very few
capital cities, quite a bit lower than in
the States. But certain circumstances
will require your living on a higher plane
10
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


the end result is a living cost about as
high as in the States.
As a foreign representative you are
one among many of "a big fish in a lit-
tle pond." Usually you are to the foreign
market a specialist or expert, as you
may be one of the few or perhaps the
only representative of your company.
So among the native inhabitants you
stand out and are through circumstances
placed into a certain higher social plane.
Then also in the States you are sur-
rounded by labor-saving devices and by
a general social efficiency with and in
which you can get a lot done with a
minimum of effort. But not so in a for-
eign country where labor saving devices
are more costly and where people and
buildings and the general social plan
are not fully adjusted for their adaption
and adoption. Also the lower cost of
servants plus the customs of the coun-
try enter into the picture with the result
that from two to four servants go to
make up a household staff where in the
States you probably had none. And class
distinction of which you tasted none in
the States enters quite decidedly into
the picture. As a representative of a
company of that wealthy (they always
forget our national debt) industrial
giant, the U. S. A., you are promptly
placed into one of the upper classes,
usually too near the top for comfort.
The matter of servants and customs
sometimes runs to extremes. For ex-
ample, in India, where every business-
man, even though he travels but occas-
ionally, maintains in his employ a valet
and where in clubs a virtual army of
servants stands about waiting to dry
you after a shower, assist you with get-
ting into your underwear and putting
on your shoes, while you recline sipping
a cooling "chotapec." But you are to be
warned that few Americans learn to go
through such a routine with grace and
dignity.
And in other aspects your social life
is of necessity different and more active
in a foreign country. As it is not your
native land you are never quite at home
in a foreign country, with the result
that you fill up the time with a greater
business and/or social activity. It most
always is both.
Let us now consider the opportunities
in the foreign markets. The nature of
the work in a foreign field requires a
number of additional attributes and a
more thorough training as against those
required for a similar post in the States.
The foreign representative has to rely
decidedly more on his own ability and
on his own initiative. He has to assume
quite a number of additional responsi-
bilities. It follows therefore that he will
have a relatively greater value to the
company which means a relatively
greater income.
The positions available in foreign
markets are in many respects like those
available in the States except that there
are fewer posts pertaining to produc-
tion. The latter is for the reason that
many U. S. companies market the man-
ufactured product. Some companies
have in certain key countries set up as-
sembly plants, as have several automo-
tive companies, while other companies
such as some rubber tire companies
carry out an entire manufacturing proc-
ess in the foreign country. Those com-
panies requiring skilled labor or an in-
tricate manufacturing process for the
production of their products, as a gen-
eral rule, export the finished product,
or export all or the major parts for
assembly in the foreign country.
country is a fuller life and provides
every opportunity for exercising a de-
cidedly greater percentage of your abil-
ities than is provided by a comparative
post in the U. S. But for all these ad-
vantages the aspirant for a position in
a foreign country must be prepared to
face a few extra inconveniences, face a
few extra dangers and be prepared to
leave relatives and friends behind and
to establish a new circle of friends.
There are of course periodic leaves
when the foreign marketeer can come
back home to renew old friendships and
to bask in the home atmosphere.
Before concluding it should be stated
that this article has as a basis condi-
tions as they have existed up to the
present. What changes the Second
World War will have on foreign mar-
kets is a conjecture anyone may indulge
in. It all depends. Of course, foreign
markets will not disappear, in fact they
should open appreciably with this ap-
parent world revolution. The U. S. is
still its own biggest consumer, and the
per capita peoples of foreign countries

Don't expect any plumbing
The larger number of posts are how-
ever those pertaining to the marketing
or sales end of the business and to the
financial side.
Then there are posts with mining
companies, oil companies, fruit com-
panies, rubber companies, etc., whose
activities are in the development of the
countries' resources and products for
importation into the U. S.
So from the above it can be visualized
that there are a goodly number of op-
portunities in the foreign field; that,
post against post, the foreign field re-
quires men of broader, more thorough
training; that life in a post in a foreign
consume but a fraction of that con-
sumed in the U. S. With that point of
view it is to be readily appreciated what
the consumption possibilities of foreign
countries are. The aftermath of the
war may quite likely be a more stabil-
ized world economy and a better bal-
anced world trade. But there may be
"a lot of fun" before the peoples of
this earth will again come to their senses
and realize that trade necessitated by
supply and demand is to their mutual
benefit—that cooperative agreements,
such as reciprocal trade treaties, are far
preferable to world shaking wars as the
solution of this never ending problem.

panies engaged in the manufacture
of electric motor control—let us say less
than ten leaders or principals and about
the same number who are interested as
a side line. Their product is advertised
almost exclusively in technical publica-
tions since the general public is not the
market for the product. Without some
previous experience or exposure to the
field, the engineering student may not
be aware of this interesting industry.
This article is therefore addressed to

CONTROL
the engineering student who may wish
to know more about the field of electric
motor control.
Further instruction and development
of the graduating engineer is provided
by the motor control industry. This
takes the form of lectures, field trips,
shop work and experience in various
departments throughout the plant. Shop
work and test room experience bring
familiarity with a myriad of details in
the construction and adjustment of the
apparatus. Lectures by department
heads review engineering principles, de-
sign features and motor characteristics
as well as discuss special applications
and drives. Practical acquaintance with
manufacturing processes and special ma-
chinery are gained by visits to steel
mills, rubber plants, machine tool build-
ers, etc. By means of this special train-
ing a great deal of valuable experience
is gained in a short time. On comple-
tion of such a test course, the newcomer
is prepared for entering either commer-
cial or engineering branches of the in-
dustry.
A majority of the control manufac-
tured easily falls into a class of stand-
ardized apparatus. Simple motor start-
ers, both AC and DC, together with
drum type controllers are catalogue
items and stocked by jobbers. Full volt-
age starters for small squirrel cage mo-
tors are manufactured as a production
item and sold in quantities at low prices.
In such cases it is economical to replace
worn out units without attempting to
repair them. Not so many years ago,
the starting of a synchronous motor was
a major operation entrusted to engineers
or those specially trained for the job.
Improvements in the design of syn-
chronous motors and their starting char-

acteristics now permit automatic start-
ing from push buttons. As the motor
design improves, certain types of con-
trol become standardized.
There will always remain a great deal
of special motor control where each con-
trol is especially designed for each ap-
plication. It is this special control which
requires most of the engineering atten-
tion and to which this article refers in
particular. Drives which have been me-
chanical, hydraulic or steam operated
are changed to electric motor drives re-
quiring control. This is particularly
true in heavy industries and heavy ma-
chine design. Steel mills, for example,
were steam operated—from the revers-
ing steam engine driving the bloomer
rolls to the cylinder operated flying
shear—while today a large part of the
steel mill is electrically operated and
controlled. New machines and new
processes are daily introduced. They
will be motor operated and someone
must design and coordinate the motor
control.
It soon becomes apparent that motor
design and motor characteristics dictate
or at least govern the motor control.
Improvements in motor design will
simplify the control, or conversely, de-
ficiencies in motor design must be com-
pensated by the control. For example,
we could compare rheostatic control of
a DC motor with variable voltage con-
trol. In both cases we are starting with
the same DC motor—let us say it is
compound wound. We wish to acceler-
ate, run, slow down and stop the motor.
In the case of variable voltage control
this sequence is accomplished by the
combined characteristics of the motor
and an accompanying generator and the
control panel becomes minor. In the
case of rheostatic control this sequence is
accomplished with magnetic contactors,
relays and resistors in which case the
control panel is the principal item. We
can safely agree that an understanding
of motor characteristics is a fundamen-
tal requirement of control engineering.
There are commercial as well as
engineering possibilities in motor control
for the graduating engineer, depending
on his personality, training and prefer-
ence. In considering the marketing of
the product, we must consider the pur-
chaser as well as the seller. More and
more companies are now purchasing
much equipment through specially
trained men with a practical knowledge
of the requirements and a knowledge
of the available equipment. Obviously,
then, the salesman must be well
equipped and trained with a technical
knowledge of his equipment. Of partic-
ular assistance in selling such apparatus
is an ability to "make your pencil talk."
Sketching is very convincing and breeds
confidence, but it also implies a tech-
nical acquaintance with details. It is
not necessary to be an authority on all
possible applications, but if the prob-
lem is beyond his personal experience,
the salesman should be able to analyze
the requirements and gather the neces-
sary data so that the problem can be
submitted for solution.
Advertising and sales promotion is
another commercial aspect requiring en-
gineering talent, when your product is
as technical as motor control. It has
been said that general advertising is de-
signed to appeal to a teen-age mind.
This statement must be adjusted when
your customer wants facts attractively
or cleverly presented.
The design and manufacture of spe-
cial motor control requires a great deal
of engineering. Let us consider first the
development laboratories maintained by
the industry. Unit apparatus such as
contactors, limit switches, etc. are con-
stantly being redesigned and improved.

pet valve from extinction.
AIRPLANE ENGINE
EXHAUST VALVES
THE book. Automobile Engineering,
published in 1921 by The American
Technical Society, states, "The disad-
vantages of the poppet valves—the
small openings they afford, the noisy
and hammering action they involve,
their tendency to leak and in other ways
give out, and the necessity of frequently
regrinding them—are objections so seri-
ous that it is no wonder the prospect
of their elimination is so widely wel-
comed." The book advocated further
development of the slide valve and
sleeve valve. Such was the status of the
poppet valve.
Since then, by a series of mechanical
and metallurgical conquests, engineers
have developed valves that can handle
125 HP and that can operate over 5000
hours without trouble. Moreover, these
valves operate red hot at exhaust tem-
peratures up to 1500°F in the presence
of oxidizing and corrosive gases and
under large impact tensile stresses.
The first mechanical improvement
was the use of hollow valve stems for
lightness. An important discovery dis-
closed that if the hollow stem were
about half filled with a salt that melted
below operating temperature, the vio-
lent agitation of the liquid caused by
the reciprocation cooled the valve by
dissipating the heat down through the
valve guide. Experiments proved that
pure sodium was the most ideal cooling
agent. Sodium melts at 175.5°F into a
liquid that has the consistency of kero-
sene and has good wetting qualities.
Further cooling is effected by wide
valve seats that help transmit heat to
the cylinder block and by a large ra-
dius of curvature of the stem at its junc-
tion with the head. This large radius
aids too in giving a more streamlined
flow to the exhaust gas with a resultant
decrease in the orifice coefficient and in-
crease in volumetric efficiency of the
cylinder and increase in power. The re-

CHARLES W. RANSON, "42E
duced valve temperature also reduces
detonation risks. Another very impor-
tant mechanical improvement was
forced lubrication. This assures posi-
tive and thorough lubrication at all
times, and stem wear is greatly dimin-
ished. The hollow valves are carefully
hand polished inside and honed outside
to remove all tool marks and scratches,
as these cause stress concentration with
possible fatigue breakage. Since the
stamped letters formerly used for mark-

Figure 1
Evolution of Wright Cyclone
ings caused many fatigue failures, the
markings are now made with an electric
pencil and curved lines.
The selection of the proper metal al-
loy required much painstaking research
for there were so many factors that
compromises had to be made. The metal
had to be resistant to oxidation, corro-
sion, wear, fatigue, warp, stretch, and
impact, and to have a low coefficient of
expansion, high hot strength properties,
no carbide precipitation, no tendency
to air-harden when cooled rapidly, and
to be machinable and grindable. These
requirements are best met by TPA, a
high chrome-nickel austenitic steel which
is forged into the desired shape. The
stem is nitrided to make it hard and
wear resistant. To obtain an extremely
hard and durable surface the valve seat
is coated with stellite, an alloy of 50-
60% cobalt, 30% chromium, and a
small amount of tungsten, by means of
high temperature brazing. These alloys
have almost completely stopped the cor-
rosion formerly caused by small quan-
tities of lead salts deposited by fuel
combustion, however, pitting of the
stem is still caused by the electrolytic
action of motor oil which has been
acidified by products of combustion.
These pits generally develop into fatigue
cracks. This chemical action takes place
only when the engine is idle and can
be prevented by using uncontaminated
oil and by eliminating bell cups at the
entrance of valve guides.
The sodium is introduced and pro-
tected from the air by a temporary cap.
The stem barrel is hermetically sealed
by either a tapered plug seal or by
swaging in the end. The tip of the stem
is covered with a hardened cap or a
tungsten steel button
weld or a stellite
puddle.
The first hollow
head valves were made
by forging copper in
the head and melting
it out to leave a cav-
ity. Some valves are
manufactured w i t h a
copper core that does
not melt but which is
a good heat conductor.
Experiment has shown
that a valve stem com-
posed of copper for
about 40% of its di-
ameter will transmit
three times as much
heat as a solid steel
one. Copper also deadens the ringing
noise of the valve.
Figure 1 shows the evolution of the
Wright Cyclone valves. The valves in
the upper row were made of cobalt
chrome. The one on the left was drilled
for lightness only; the other three were
cooled by a salt that melted below oper-
ating temperatures. The valves in the
lower row were made of TPA alloy and
were sodium cooled. The one on the
right is the present hollow head valve
with stellite seat, cobalt chrome welded
tip, with nitrided and honed stem. This
is the finest valve known.

one of our most wastefully ex-
ploited raw materials available today.
Prominent among the causes of this
waste is that incurred by the failure to
utilize wood to its fullest extent as a
source of valuable chemicals.
Wood and woody tissues are composed
of three general chemical parts: the car-
bohydrates, the wood extracts, and
lignin. The carbohydrates, of which cel-
lulose is the principal constituent, have
proven extremely useful in plastics,
paper, sugars and starches, and in count-
less other forms and applications. The
wood extracts vary considerably with
different woods, but certain members of
Scientists have now found
prospective uses for wood's
forgotten components.
the group, such as the tannin;, alkaloids,
oleoresins and wood dyes find uses in
widely different fields. Until recently,
however, the lignin of the wood has
had only nuisance value as a commer-
cial raw material.
Lignin is defined, for lack of positive
information, as the non-carbohydrate,
extractive-free portion of wood. Rough-
ly, it comprises about 25 per cent of the
total weight of woody materials. Recent
investigation has given some proof to
the hypothesis that lignin is a respira-
tion product in the process of plant
photosynthesis; and that it exists in the
plant as a cohesive material between
the cell walls. Other than this, however,
little is known about the substance,
which greatly hinders investigation for
possible uses.
The largest single source of unused
lignin comes from the wood wastes of
the lumbering and wood working indus-
tries. It is estimated that 15,000,000 tons
of waste lignin is available from this
source alone. Softwood lumbering meth-
ods are particularly wasteful. One-half
of the tree as it stands in the forest
never reaches the sawmill, and still
more of the wood is lost in subsequent
woodworking operations.
One of the recently developed uses
for this enormous amount of waste ma-
terial has been in the manufacture of
lignin plastics. In general, the original
woody material is treated in such a way
that the lignin content is proportionally
increased, is eliminated altogether, or
the lignin is physically or chemically
changed. This is accomplished through
thermal or acid hydrolysis or chemical
condensation. Some of the results in this
field have produced plastics which are
very good in certain limited fields, par-
By
KEITH SMITH, '43E
ticularly for use as panels or boards
which require" low material strength.
Germany has produced wood plastics of
this type as a byproduct in the extrac-
tion of glucose from wood. But produc-
tion of such ''Ersatz" materials, made
without binder material as in the case
of the German product, has resulted in
brittleness and low material strength,
so that use is restricted to low grade
wall panelling and flooring materials.
The American-made lignin plastics,
benefitting from the addition of a binder
material, have the following general pro-
perties:
Molding conditions
150°-250 C. 1500-14,000#/ sq. in.
Compressive strength 21,000-25,000 lbs.
Flexural strength 6,000-8.000 lbs.
Moisture absorption
Machineability generally good
Color dark to lustrous black
These plastics possess some undesir-
able properties such as high water ab-
sorption and lack of colorability: and at
present experience certain difficulties in
manufacture. These, however, are being
gradually overcome. Because lignin
plastics can be manufactured at a cost
of from Vi to 1/10 that of the usual
phenolic molding materials, the slight
disadvantages in quality can be partially
overlooked. It is only fair to conclude,
however, that the field is as yet a very
new one, promising many important de-
velopments in the future.
Lignin, as such, has found uses as a
de-polarizer on the negative terminal of
storage batteries, and as an iron-remover
in the process of water softening.
Lignin chemists have even found uses
for such common waste materials as
corncobs, grain hulls, and peanut hulls.
A hard, black, lustrous plastic can be
made by condensing aromatic amines
and furfural in an alkaline solution of
these hulls and molding the resulting
resin with other lignin.
Second among the chief sources of
lignin is that obtained from waste liquor
in the manufacture of wood pulp.
Since only about one-half of the total
composition of wood is cellulose, modern
pulp mills require two tons of wood for
every ton of cellulose pulp produced,
leaving the other half of the wood, most
of which is lignin, dissolved in the pulp-
ing liquor. This pulping liquor has pro-
duced no other result than that of caus-
ing a waste of 1,500,000 tons of lignin
annually, as well as presenting a serious
problem of stream pollution in cases
where it is improperly disposed of.
Naturally, the first concern of the
lignin chemist was to solve the problem
of stream pollution. With the liquor from
the soda process for making wood pulp,
this was a simple matter. Lignin was
found to precipitate upon simple acidi-
fication, whereupon it was dried and
burned. A more useful process involved
passing flue gas containing 16 to 17 per
cent carbon dioxide through the soda
pulping liquor and coagulating the lignin
by heating. The resulting powder could
be made to react with aldehydes in the
presence of phenols to produce a
thermo-setting resin suitable for molded
boards.
When it comes to the problem of dis-
posing of the liquor from the sulphite
process for manufacturing wood pulp,
considerable difficulty is experienced.
The material can be utilized directly as
a binder in secondary roads. This is due
to its adhesive and colloidal properties.
The material also has possibilities for
development as an adhesive or cement.

You may see him in overalls with
a very dirty face, when he has just fin-
ished a job in the Chemical Engineer-
ing lab; or at a concert indulging his
interest in good music. But most of the
time you'll find him in the Technic
office, doing his part in publishing the

Seymour Furbush
Editorial prodigy
magazine, for the Michigan Technic
has been Seymour Furbush's chief in-
terest since he came to Ann Arbor. As
Managing Editor, he is its hardest
working and most dependable staff
member. No matter where you meet
him, though, you'll find him doing his
job quietly and capably, and you'll find
him a warm friend, always willing to do
favors.
"Fuzz" was born in Syracuse, New
York, early in 1918, though the fam-
ily lived in State College, Pennsylvania,
where his father taught. While he was
very young, they moved to New Britain,
Connecticut, and then to Baldwinsville,
New York, when his father began to
teach mechanical drawing in a voca-
tional high school in Syracuse, not far
away. Seymour went to school in Bald-
winsville, and joined the Boy Scouts as
soon as he was old enough. He played
trombone in the high school orchestra,
and also in the Baldwinsville Band.
He was on the varsity hockey team,
and in his senior year was treasurer of
the class and Managing Editor of the
high school paper. He graduated third
in his class in 1936.
Seymour went for a year to Syracuse
Collegiate Center, a junior college oper-
ating under Syracuse University. Then,
in the fall of 1937, he came to Mich-
igan to study Chemical Engineering. In
his second semester, he tried out for the
Technic. At the beginning of his sopho-
more year, he was given the job of Co-
Editor of the Publication Department,
normally a junior's position. He held
that place until last spring, when he
became Managing Editor.
Along the way, "Fuzz'' was active in
the Westminster Guild for a couple of
years. He joined the American In-
stitute of Chemical Engineers in his
sophomore year, and has been active
ever since. In the spring of that year,
Triangles tapped him, and last fall he
became a member of Vulcans. He was
Publicity Co-Chairman of the Slide
Rule Ball Committee in 1940, and this
year is its Music Chairman. He is also
on the Finance Committee of the Senior
class, and on the coordinating council
of Group Z, a Student Religious As-
sociation discussion group.
With all these things to keep him
busy, Seymour has earned a large
share of his expenses. In his first
semester he worked in a meat market,
and for the last two years has held a
board job. In addition, he has held a
variety of summer jobs, working as
meat clerk, and carpenter's, painter's,
and electrician's helper. But he has
found time to spend at least a couple
of weeks in camp almost every summer
since 1930. Last summer he was shop
and handicraft counselor at Camp
Penn Loch, Interlochen, Michigan.
After graduation, Seymour is going
to work for Solvay Process Company,
in Syracuse, doing research work. What
the far distant future holds, he will wait
and see.

preferred, so when he went to Pennsyl-
vania State College he combined his in-
terests and studied electrochemical en-
gineering. When he graduated with high
honors in 1916, he had already put in
two summers with the U.S. Bureau of
Standards doing electrical measurements
work. The ink had scarcely dried on
his degree before he was working for
the Hooker Electrochemical Company
at Niagara Falls. He spent two years
there before coming to Michigan in the
fall of 1918 as an Instructor in chem-
ical engineering.

rebuke
The three boys were sitting around
one of the tables in the Union dining
room. A couple of pretty girls were
sitting at the next table. As boys will

do, they began to comment. But in-
stead of whispering, they talked in their
native language, Greek.
Pretty soon the girls got up to leave.
As they passed where the boys were
sitting, one of them dropped a note on
the table. Written in Greek, it said,
"Thanks for your compliments, boys,
but next time be sure you use a lan-
guage your subjects don't know."
aeneid
Yes, you probably guessed what it
was. You were probably right. But
we think it was a good publicity stunt,
anyway.
And you may have heard the whole
story, but we doubt it, so we're going
to tell it to you. First, we stood by
guarding the slide rule while the Daily
photographer took the picture of the
lawyers carrying it off. We admit we
were a bit skittish about it, but our
publicity agent insisted.
But it seemed nobody believed that.
So the lawyers wanted more evidence;
they wanted to hang the rule in their
dining hall during dinner. We vetoed
that flatly; but somebody cried on
somebody's shoulder, and they got the
rule. No, it wasn't any substitute, it
was the real thing. Well, to our amaze-
ment, it lived through dinner safely and
the lawyer who was responsible took it
to his room until some of us could re-
turn it to its proper place. We were
pretty much amazed; we almost began
to think we could trust lawyers.
Our nerves had to be put on edge
once more, though. The guy's room-
mate ran off with it. The next news
was that it was in a sorority house base-
ment, and a bunch of loyal engineers
got ready to storm the place.
The boys outside weren't the only
ones who were loyal, though. The girls
who went with engineers got in a fight
with the girls who went with lawyers
over it. Only one casualty was re-
ported: one girl was bitten. No matter
what Daily surveys show about the
popularity of engineers, our girls love
us. But that's slight consolation for a
lost slide rule.
But right will triumph over might.
Our pal on the Crease Ball Committee
had a conscience, and smuggled the
rule out the back door and returned it
to us.
serenade
Speaking of April 4, we heard an in-
teresting story. It seems that some en-
terprising engineers conceived a plan to
give the Crease Ball crowd a thrill. Be-

tween Everett Hoagland's numbers, the
public address system was to give out
with "Saint Patrick Was an Engineer."
But something went wrong at the last
minute and the thing never did come off.
tall tale
Perhaps the Aeronautical Depart-
ment will deny this. We don't much
blame them. We would, too. But we
hear an Open House visitor walked into
the wind tunnel with a hat on. Natu-
rally, it came off, and in a few seconds
the tunnel was filled with felt.
So the resourceful engineer in charge
took a tube of glue out of his pocket,
and began to wave it in the air. The
felt stuck, of course, and in a couple
of minutes, the hat was rebuilt. After
the glue dried, it was returned AL-
MOST as good as new.
wages of sin
Somebody yelled "Fire!" and the
boys ran out of the house to watch. It
was only a chimney burning out; so
they had to create their own excite-
ment. One of them lifted the hydrant
wrench off the fire truck, and handed
it to another, who tucked it under his
coat. But somebody tipped off the cop,
who came in hot pursuit.
The boys were a little younger,
though, so they got back to the fratern-
ity safely. Without a search warrant,
the cop couldn't prove much, so he left,
warning that the house would be
searched the next day.
Not meaning any real harm, the
guilty parties returned the wrench the
next morning, and all was forgiven. But
that couldn't be admitted to the broth-
ers; the culprits kept up the bluff that
the house would be searched. This went
pretty hard with one boy, who had an
unlicensed pistol around.
About noon, a car pulled up in front
and two heavy men in overcoats stepped
out. Without waiting for them to start
toward the house, Willie ran upstairs to
protect his gun. While the two men
were crossing the street, Willie buried

the pistol in the coal pile. When the
excitement had finally died down, he
went back to get it.
He hasn't found it yet.

The Bard of Avon was right about
the rose—its name is unimportant.
But if he'd had anything to do with

have learned a lot!
Names must be easy to pronounce

like other exchange names—must not
use the same dial finger spaces.
Take MUIR and OTIS, for ex-
ample. Fine!—except they dial alike!
For the first two letters of each ap-
pear in the same finger spaces on the

Often hundreds of names are listed,
studied, discarded before one is
found that meets all requirements.
Such care in every phase of Bell

Why not telephone home often? Long Distance rates to most

for the removal of lignin from sulphite
liquor has involved its precipitation from
solution with a controlled amount of
lime. The products of the reaction are
calcium sulphite, basic calcium lignosul-
fonate and a residue of lignin-containing
material. A plastic can be made directly
from the calcium lignosulfonate by a
patented process in which the chemical
is mixed with sixty parts of other lignin
material. However, by converting the
calcium lignosulfonate to the sodium
compound and heating with alkali, the
substance vanillin, essential constituent
of vanilla flavoring, is split off. This
process is in commercial production both
in the United States and Canada.
In an attempt to discover the basic
chemical building unit of the lignin
molecule, chemists developed a process
of hydrogenation, which presents bright
possibilities for industrial utilization of
waste pulping liquor. This process is
very desirable because it does not cause
drastic decomposition of the native
chemicals in wood, as do other processes.
As a result, a new series of potentially
valuable compounds have been pro-
duced.
The process involves the reaction of
lignin with hydrogen under high pres-
(Continued from page 14)
sure and at an elevated temperature. It
can be carried out either in a dioxane
solution using copper chromite as a
catalyst, or in a water solution with
nickel as a catalyst. Although lignin
from soda pulping liquor can be hydro-
genated directly, that obtained from sul-
phite liquor must first be reduced and
the reduction products, hydrogen sulfide
and mercaptans, boiled off. This step is
taken to avoid poisoning of the catalyst.
Products of this hydrogenation pro-
cess are methanol, 10-20^; N-propyl-
cyclohexane and derivatives, 20-35%;
and high-boiling resin, 40-609?. It was
later discovered that wood wastes could
be hydrogenated directly.
The high boiling resin from these
reactions has been shown to be very
similar in chemical composition to the
propylcyclohexane. The unidentified re-
sidue from this process has the general
formula (C;-,H,.0)x and its identification
should be only a matter of time.
Of particular interest in these reac-
tion products are the commercial possi-
bilities of the propylcyclohexane deriva-
tives. One of the few compounds of this
group that has been identified, 3 (4-hy-
droxycyclohexyl) propinal-1, can be
converted to parapropylphenol, a sub-
stance as yet commercially unavailable,
but which possesses the valuable prop-
erty of rendering "Bakelite" type plas-
tics, varnishes and lacquers immune to
discoloration from light. If and when
this process becomes commercially
adaptable, it is estimated that gross
profit on a $3,000,000 hydrogenation
plant similar to those now used in the
hydrogenation of vegetable oils might
reach $2,000,000 on the parapropyl-
phenol alone. Thirty such plants, using
100,000,000 pounds of waste lignin an-
nually, could be built without completely-
utilizing this vast amount of waste ma-
terial which at present has only nuisance
value.
Most of the scientific experimentation
in synthetic materials during the last
two decades has centered around coal
as a raw material. While this experimen-
tation is very commendable, it utilizes a
raw material which may someday be ex-
hausted, while wood and plant wastes in
the meantime have been left to rot away
in the fields and forests. We are just be-
ginning to realize the importance of
these wasted materials and to develop
uses for them. However, we have only
begun, and development along these
lines should continue for years to come.
ELECTRIC MOTOR CONTROL
Redesign in this case does not merely
involve new enclosures such as "stream-
lining" the product, although improved
appearance is always an aim in mind.
Redesign is necessary to take advantage
of new materials and new principles so
that greater utility and longer life are
incorporated in the product. New prin-
ciples also result in new control meth-
ods and apparatus. A frequency relay,
recently developed, operating on the
secondary of a slip ring motor, when
used on cranes and hoists, has greatly
increased the controlability and safety
of such drives. Electronics, as applied
to heavy duty machinery, still occupies
a small corner in the field and may in-
vade it with greater strength. Good
practical application of well known prin-
ciples is as valuable as scientific genius.
Since we have been talking about
(Continued from page 12)
special control for heavy machinery,
you may have the impression that few
engineers are required since large quan-
tities of such heavy machinery are not
purchased. The difficulty seems to be
that so many variations and com-
binations are possible that the problem
cannot be disposed of with a single
investigation. Each projected installa-
tion requires examination and a change
in design since the last installation ne-
cessitates a change in the detail of the
control. For example, we could take any
heavy machine tool, such as an ingot
scalper or billet chipper. The first one
will have 3 or 4 motor drives but before
the second has been sold, the design is
changed or improved and now requires
5 or 6 motor drives, some mechanical
movements having been replaced by
electric motor drives. You will also ap-
preciate that the control problem is
different if the power supply is AC
rather than DC. As a result, each such
installation receives individual attention
with considerable preliminary engineer-
ing required before the job is sold and
much detail engineering before the final
control can be manufactured. The num-
ber of trained engineers required to
keep a moderately large shop busy is
out of proportion compared to industry
in general.
The problems which are presented in
recommending control for heavy ma-
chinery are very interesting. Their so-
lution requires originality and ingenuity
as well as understanding of engineering
fundamentals and motor characteristics.
The field offers opportunity to the grad-
uating engineer both in commercial and
engineering aspects.

THREE JOBS...ONE IRON
Versatility in cast iron — especially when economi-
cally obtained... is a valuable asset for both the
foundry and the user.
Consider, for example, the experience of a manu-
facturer of Diesel engines — and the economies ef-
fected by using one base iron to meet three distinct
sets of requirements. One set calls for ability to resist
wear and hold pressure at operating temperatures,
the second for toughness and pressure resistance at
the same temperatures, and the third for the wear re-
sistance and toughness essential for timing gears and
similar parts. Good machinability is, of course, a
prime requisite in all three cases.
All these varied requirements are being met by
using the same Chromium-Molybdenum (0.60-0.70%
Mo.) base iron; only slight changes in the analysis are
necessary. The practical and economical advantages
to the foundry are obvious. And the user benefits by
getting reliable, machinable parts at reasonable cost.
Our booklet, "Molybdenum in the Foundry", is
both interesting and helpful. A copy will be sent to
all those interested free on request.

for the chapter at Michigan.
Back in 1917 when Prof. Baker was
a plant superintendent for the Hooker
Company, the labor shortage because
of the war speedup was often a head-
ache to him. At that time, vagrants
picked up by the police were put to
work in plants that were short of help.
Thus, the crews Prof. Baker had work-
ing under him consisted frequently of
an assortment of alcoholic ex-prize-
fighters, thugs, and the like. The turn-
over was terrific, for generally when a
vagrant was paid at the end of a few
weeks, he would "hit the open road"
again, since he was no longer considered
to be a vagrant in the eyes of the law
and therefore was not compelled to
work.
One cold wintry night about that
time, with the mercury hovering about
20° below zero, Prof. Baker was on
night shift at a picric acid pilot plant
when he heard the fire whistle signalling
its shrill alarm. Racing out into the
snow he encountered the watchman of
the plant who said that upon hearing
the alarm he had immediately sent in
an alarm to the Niagara fire depart-
ment. There was a large store of high
explosives and also some fulminate of
mercury on the grounds and so fire was
a deadly menace. Rapid inspection of
the various buildings of the plant re-
vealed no sign of a fire, however, and
it was discovered that the steam line
leading to the fire whistle had leaked
water on to the pull-chain, this water
freezing and eventually tripping the
alarm. Prof. Baker called up the fire
department only to be told that every
piece of equipment in the City of Ni-
agara and in the surrounding area had
left for the plant! That left him the
unpleasant task of telling the horde of
arriving firemen who had driven miles
over icy roads and frozen swamps that
it was only a false alarm—which he
did from the inside of the barbed wire
fence.
When asked for his opinion on the
proposal to graduate engineers of the
class of '42 next February, Prof. Baker
said that he was not too enthusiastic
over the idea. He believes that a good
share of the student's training would
be lost by such a move, and this would
be to the detriment of the 3&gt;4 year
graduate later on. He stressed the im-
portance of the student's work in his
fourth year in college and cited the de-
mand made by industry for chemical
engineers with additional training even
beyond that of the B.S. degree. He felt
that it was not as important to turn
out engineering graduates in y/i years

Liberal engineer
as it was to conserve engineering gradu-
ates for strictly engineering work, civil
or military. He referred to an editorial
in a recent issue of the Xews Edition of
the American Chemical Society as close-
ly expressing his ideas. This editorial
quotes Major Battley as stating that
the purpose of the selective service
should be "to select those best fitted to
maintain the armed forces by continu-
ing to perform their civilian tasks and
to select those who are best fitted for
military training. But at this moment,
in making that selection, production
must have priority over everything,
including the training of military man-
power."
swimmer
Wm. Beebe, born on April 24, 1918,
in Columbus, Ohio, is one of the many
who entered and are leaving their edu-
cational period amidst two great world
struggles. During that twenty-year pe-
riod, Bill has lived in Columbus and
Cleveland, Ohio, and Wilmette, Illinois,
attending various schools in these cities.
At the high school in Wilmette, Bill
headed the Student Aid Committee
(charity organization) and won letters
for swimming, football and track. After
completing the high school curriculum,
he thought a year of prep school would
add the finishing touches before he en-
tered college. Mercersburg Academy in
Mercersburg, Pa., was his choice.
Since he has been at Michigan, Bill
has not been idle either. His activities
at present include Michigamua, Vulcans.
Engineering Council, Chairman of the
Cap and Gown Committee, Swimming
team captain, and formerly a member
of Triangles. He is also an active mem-
ber of Alpha Delta Phi fraternity.
Most naturally, the interesting as-
pects of Bill Beebe's life are almost
entirely connected with swimming. He
credits a great deal of his excellence in
this sport to Matt Mann, Michigan's
coach. A member of the medley relay-
team which recently broke its own Big
10 record, and several interscholastic
records in back-stroke are some of the
things he has achieved under Matt
Mann.
For three winters Bill has been with
the team in Florida and on one occasion
nearly reached England with them. Matt
had chosen six men who could comprise
the competition for any swimming event
in a meet to go on a goodwill tour to
England, having been born in Leeds
himself. Just as they were ready to
leave, England declared war and their
intended passage ship, the Queen Mary,
was converted to a troop ship. Despite
the fact that he will not have the op-
portunity to go to England as an official
member of the Michigan swimming
team, the desire remains.
Bill's father is a chemical engineer
and by natural instincts he is also fol-
lowing that line. Intending, eventually,
to go into the sales end of engineering,
Bill has already signed with DuPont's
for their preliminary training course.
As captain of the swimming team, he
has learned a great deal about getting
along with men and he intends to apply
this to his later occupation rather than
the slide rule. His tendencies are to-
ward the human relation rather than the
actual application side of engineering.
Along this same line, he also would
promote a scheme for widening the
scope of engineering subjects, that is,
bringing in literature, music, and the
fine arts to give the engineer that hotly
contested attribute—culture. We might
classify Mr. Wm. Beebe as a liberal
engineer.

cloth
The inspection of cloth during proc-
essing has been facilitated by the use
of a synchronized stroboscope. At some
time during the processing a stroboscope
is synchronized with the cloth motion
so as to obtain a stationary cloth pat-
tern regardless of speed. The equipment
is useful in checking register in cloth
printing and in discovering
defects in either the cloth
or the printing process.
Printing speeds of 70 yards
per minute are common,
but the stroboscope pro-
vides visibility up to 475
yards per minute without
blurring. Two standard 48-
inch daylight 40-watt flu-
orescent lamps backed by
reflectors illuminate a
space 48 by 15 inches. A
flash timer geared to one
print roll is connected in
the grid circuit of an igni-
tion tube which furnishes current to the
tubes. The two tubes in series take 60
amps, at 5000 volts for 30 microsec-
onds or less per flash, at usually more
than 15 flashes per second.
paper mills
The making of newsprint from slash
or loblolly pine in the South reached
the commercial stage this year when a
$6,000,000 paper mill was put into
operation. The mill has a combination
of diverse apparatus requiring the finest
co-ordination to assure operation. Two
6000-kva double - extraction turbines
supply the power; and the connected
load includes 12,000 hp. in pulp-grinder
motors and a 1000-hp sectional-drive
paper machine. There is thus a com-
bination of turbines with sudden fluctu-
ations in demand. In addition, the
slightest speed change in the paper ma-
chine will break the paper. A slight
change in motor voltage would affect

tors are used on the exciter, generator,
and section-drive motors. Also, a buck-
and-boost generator, operating from a
bridge circuit with vacuum-tube ampli-
fier, gives extremely fast counteraction
on incipient voltage changes.
alloy
A new means of ensuring privacy to
electrons that "live in glass houses"
was recently patented. The patent cov-
ers a new way of using Kovar, an alloy
which is a perfect mate of glass, to seal
parts of vacuum tubes used in the radio
and electric power industries. Kovar is
a mixture of iron, nickel, cobalt and
manganese and has the unusual charac-
teristic of expanding at the same rate
as glass as the temperature rises. Thus
it forms a "strain free" seal to keep
unwanted air out of glass vacuum de-
vices in which electrons are at work gen-
erating x-rays or radio waves.
Kovar also resists the corrosive action
of metallic vapors, such as sodium and
mercury, which are used in some of
these vacuum devices. For this purpose,
it is used in conjunction with a hard,
low-expanding type of glass.
water wings
Aloft with one landing wheel jammed
in the retractable gear of his plane, the
pilot was forced to choose his safest
escape by "pancaking" his plane into
the water of a convenient bay. The hero
—an ingenious device which kept the
plane afloat.
In each wing of the plane is a com-
partment with a pop-out door, inside
of which lie two deflated rubberized
bags. These are connected by flexible
tubing to a cylinder of compressed car-
bon dioxide gas about the size of a gal-
lon bottle.
Early developments of this gear were
operated by hand valves in the cockpit.
The improved units now made use auto-
matic valves to inflate the bags, which
pop out of their compartments and keep
the plane afloat whether it goes into the
water on its belly or on its back.

Recording an epoch-making achievement in chemical engineering
January 21st, 1941, will remain an historic date
on the calendar of chemical engineering progress.
For on that day, at Freeport, Texas, a truly epoch-
making achievement was accomplished—the first
production of magnesium metal extracted in com-
mercial quantities from the waters of the sea.
Metal from sea water—magnesium—lightest of
all structural metals in common use.
This achievement is the fruition of Dow's 2 5 years
of experience in the continuous development of
magnesium metal production. For at Midland,
back in 1915, Dow began extracting magnesium
from Michigan brine by its own processes.
A quarter century of effort in developing uses and
applications for DOWMETAL* (Dow's name for
its Magnesium Alloys)—creating demand that has
permitted a progesssive lowering of price—has
made magnesium metal indispensable to American
industry. Now demand is suddenly increased enor-
mously. For magnesium is essential to airplane
construction; vital to national defense.
The successful production of this all-important
metal from sea water marks an epoch—the begin-
ning of a new era in the production of metals.

'42E: FEBRUARY?
IT WAS just a year ago that the issue
of a four-, five-, or six-year curricu-
lum held the attention of the engineer-
ing profession. The pros and cons of
this subject were debated by industrial-
ists as well as students and faculty. At
that time the longer course found much
favor due to the recognized lack of cul-
tural training on the part of the grad-
uating engineer. Under the present
system six hours of non-technical elec-
tives barely inoculate the student engi-
neer with the serum of culture.
And yet today the proposed lengthen-
ing of the engineering curriculum is rare-
ly mentioned. The world of today is one
in which ideas of education, as well as
politics, may be rendered obsolete by
changing situations.
On February 8, 1941 the Advisory
Committee on Engineering Defense
Training of the United States Office of
Education asked the Society for the Pro-
motion of Engineering Education to
consider the feasibility and advisabil-
ity of accelerating the regular engineer-
ing program. As a result, a committee
of seven men met in Pittsburgh on
March 1 and 2 to analyze questionnaires
prepared and sent to 135 engineering
colleges. Representing leading state,
municipal, and private schools through-
out the country the committee discussed
this question of rushing engineers
through the engineering schools in less
than the standard four years.
This move to accelerate engineering
education came as a result of an un-
usually large demand for new engineers.
Present conditions indicate that approxi-
mately 40,000 new engineers will be re-
quired to fill engineering positions in
the coming year. This year the engi-
neering schools of the country will grad-
uate about 12,000 student engineers. Due
to the uncertainty of foreign conditions
a crisis three months, six months, or a
year from now may require an immedi-
ate supply of engineers to fill the re-
maining 28,000 positions. Engineers
would be needed for mass production,
design, construction, supervision, main-
tenance, research, and for teaching op-
t rators.
Because of this possibility of an ur-
gent need for engineers, it has been sug-
gested that the class of ?42E be gradu-
ated in February, 1942. Estimations
indicate this early graduation would re-
lease 7,000 extra man-years to engineer-
ing fields.
Such a plan of early graduation might
be made possible through a compulsory
summer session. A fifteen-week summer
school could be substituted for the regu-
lar second semester. The change would
allow this year's junior engineer to fulfill
the graduation requirements by next
February.
A summer school session seems to be
the only feasible plan for without it the
student would be forced to eliminate
valuable research courses taken during
the second semester of the senior year.
Such an elimination might decrease his
value to industry and might possibly
defeat the purpose of accelerating study.
Admitting that a summer session
might satisfactorily solve the problem
of early graduation, what are some of
the obstacles to such a plan? From the
standpoint of the University the pro-
posal has its disadvantages. Of neces-
sity the plan would have to be made
compulsory for all members of the class
of '42. In addition there would be the
added cost of a fifteen-week summer
session and the loss due to a decreased
enrollment next spring. It has been
estimated that the engineering schools
of the country would stand to lose a
total of $5,000,000.
Probably the most important objec-
tion, however, would be the loss to in-
dustry of the research conducted by
faculty members. Competent engineers—
many faculty members conduct research
projects for industrial concerns during
the summer months. Naturally such re-
search would be eliminated if the pro-
posed summer session was made a real-
ity.
Objections on the part of the students
would be equally strong. Most students
will agree that the present engineering
curriculum is "dished out" in concen-
trated doses. The fifteen-week summer
session would result in eighteen consecu-
tive months of study. Such a period
might conceivably be injurious to the
general morale.
Again, a majority of the students are
either partially or entirely self-support-
ing. Many of them work during the
summer for a "nest egg" to help carry
them through the following year. The
elimination of this opportunity would
p.ove disastrous to the educational plans
of these students.
Summer work also serves a purpose
possibly as valuable as the money
earned. It is recognized that many en-
gineering students do not have definite
plans regarding their field of work after
graduation. By working for industrial
concerns during the summer the student
gains valuable experience which often
aids him in making his selection of his
senior courses. Without this experience
the student who flips a coin which comes
down with steam power plants up may
find after graduating that aircraft en-
gines is a far more interesting field.
In conclusion, we feel that the uni-
versities and colleges should cooperate
to the fullest extent with industry for
the national welfare. However, we be-
lieve that the graduation of the class of
'42E four months early would, for the
above reasons, be inadvisable and might
even defeat the purpose of the plan.

The instruction given at Camp Davis is similar to that offered at the camps of the leading colleges of
engineering of the United States. The camp is situated in the Jackson Hole area about 75 miles south of the
Yellowstone Park. A road connecting the Lincoln Highway at Rock Springs, Wyoming, with the Yellowstone
Park, traverses the valley of the Hoback River in which the camp is located. A splendid climate with clear days
and cool nights, a considerable area near the camp clear of trees and brush, and a topography varying from
gentle slopes to rugged mountains, combine to make this region an ideal one for giving instruction in surveying.
Students and faculty are housed comfortably in permanent buildings provided with running water, electric
lights, and a modern sanitary system. The mess furnishes excellent meals.
The work is arranged for a three-day trip to Yellowstone National Park, as well as for week-end trips to
nearer points of interest. The total cost for the eight weeks session is in the neighborhood of $150.

INTRODUCING . . .
NEW champion! The world's largest and
most powerful industrial \-ra&gt; unit, pack-
ing a wallop equivalent to $90,000,000 worth of
radium, is now at work in the General Electric
Mant at Schenectady.
Stronger by 600,000 volts than others in its
:lass, the 1,000,000-volt monster clips down to
two minutes the old record ot an hour to
rake a picture through four inches of steel.
The machine is housed in a special building,
nth 14-inch concrete walls plus \1 inches of
exterior brick to absorb stray radiations. Another
safeguard for X-ray technicians is the X-ray
safety "wrist watch" a leather case, worn on the
.rist, carrying a small piece of unexposed X-ray
ilm. This, when developed at the end of the da) .
will show up any scattered X-radiation to which
the wearer mav have been harrntulK exposed.

THE HUMAN EAR CAN DETECT SOUND,
BUT CANNOT MEASURE IT.
Most objectionable noises are made up of many compon-
ent sounds. For all practical purposes three equal sounds are
just as loud as four. It naturally follows,then, that the re-
moval of any one or two of the several sounds will result in no
appreciable reduction in the loudness of the noise.
This has been the stumbling block in much noise-reduc-
tion work. Various sounds would be removed, but the loudness
of the noise would be little affected.
Progress in quieting can be definitely measured,
and new moves indicated by instrumental measurements.
Successful noise reduction requires both

RIDING COMFORT
By
WALTER E. LAY, '15E
Professor of Mechanical Engineering
THE comfort of the automotive pas-
senger has been the subject of con-
siderable research during the past few
years. On the basis of research begun
at the University of Michigan in 1935
certain conclusions have been reached
regarding the relationship between the
mechanics of springs and cushions and
the physiology of the human body.
The prime function of the whole sys-
tem of springs and dampers is to relieve
the passenger of shock, to make him
comfortable, at ease, and to prevent
accumulation of fatigue due to con-
tinued riding in the vehicle. Comfort
and ease is the desired state, and fatigue
may be considered as the result of fail-
ure to accomplish such a state for the
passenger. The following definitions,
taken from the dictionary, are then in
order:
Comfort—"Freedom from anxiety or
pain." "Mental or bodily wants satis-
fied."
Ease—"An undisturbed state of mind
or body."
Fatigue—"To weary with mental or
physical exertion." "The sum total of
the results of mental or physical activity
which show themselves in a diminished
capacity for work."
We should note that the last defini-
tion indicates the economic value of
providing comfort and lessening fatigue.
The transportation of passengers is a
means to an end. We ride to work. We
cannot do a full day's work at the of-
fice if we are greatly fatigued by the
journey from home. The traveling sales-
man may not make an important sale
if he is too wearied by the drive from
the home office. We cannot appreciate
beautiful scenery when we are fatigued
by the travel itself. Builders of buses
assert that they provide the most com-
fortable seat for the driver because les-
sened fatigue prevents costly accidents.
It will be noted further that, in all the
definitions, both the mind and the body
are considered. The meaning of "men-
tal comfort," that is, "freedom from
anxiety," is vague and any measure-
ments at best only qualitative. "Bodily
comfort" presents a meaning only some-
what less vague. We have never been
able to measure the energy, if any, used
in thought or worry, but we can meas-
ure the work done by muscular exertion.
Muscular fatigue is always accompanied
by some mental fatigue. Certain phys-
iological and psychological items such
as the basal metabolism, blood and
urine analysis, reaction time, sense of
balance, accuracy of muscular coordina-
tion, and the accuracy and speed of
mental processes have been measured as
indications of either mental or bodily
fatigue, or both. Thus, in speaking of
comfort and fatigue, we find that we
can only vaguely define them; we have
no unit of measurement and the instru-
ments available will measure only very
approximate indications of fatigue or
comfort. Moreover, we have two kinds
of fatigue whose effects are interlaced
and we have no available means for sep-
arating them. In short, fatigue is the
sum total of a number of things about
which we know very little.

a spring, shock absorber, or cushion may
be accurately expressed in terms of mo-
tion, velocity, acceleration, rate of
change of acceleration, or in terms of
vibrations of various frequencies. All
the foregoing items may be expressed in
definite units and measured with reason-
able accuracy. Thus, the designer of
springs, shock absorbers, and cushions
just as did our squirming about on the
circus seats or the church pews. We
have come to believe that static com-
fort is very important.
Being engineers, we may consider the
passenger as a body having a given
mass, to which external forces of any
size or direction may be applied to pro-
duce corresponding accelerations. Let
us further consider the simplest type of

has a problem. He must design mechan-
ical equipment whose motion, velocity,
and acceleration may be measured or
calculated with fair accuracy. He must
use this equipment to produce physiolo-
gical or psychological effects which have
no units, and cannot be accurately indi-
cated or measured.
It has been stated that, aside from
the show-room ride, static comfort is of
relatively little importance. There
might even be some question as to
whether there ever is any discomfort
or fatigue when a person is sitting
quietly without motion. But, when we
think of sitting for hours on a rail fence,
on the narrow board seats of the circus
tent, or on hardwood pews in a church,
we must dismiss that idea as untenable.
It has been said that a certain amount
of motion lessens the fatigue. It might
be possible that such motion lessens the
fatigue due to an uncomfortable cushion
motion—when this body is at rest. Since
the velocity is uniformly zero, then, the
force should be zero. But actually the
acceleration of 32.2 ft. per sec. per sec.
due to gravity is producing an active
downward force. This force must be
counter-acted by an equal and opposite
force, supplied by the seat, in order to
maintain the state of rest. If the body is
seated in a car traveling over ordinary
roads, the force or acceleration of grav-
ity is still by far the largest component
of the total force acting on the passen-
ger. The acceleration of gravity with its
force is greater than the maximum brak-
ing force. It is some eight times as much
as that attained in accelerating the car
in high gear. The fact that it is usually
by far the largest force involved, led us
to believe that a study of static comfort
might yield valuable results. We have
all heard the expression of "floating on
a cloud" or "resting on a bed of eider
down" used to convey the ultimate in
ease or comfort. The same idea may be
expressed, in mechanical terms, by "a
body supported by low pressure, well
distributed over the supported area."
The unit pressure, the pressure dis-
tribution, and the size and contour of
the supported area each merit consider-
ation in detail. For a subject of a given
weight, the greater the support area, the
less the unit pressure. Also, the softer
the cushion and the deeper we sink into
it, the greater the support area and the
lower the unit pressure. Hence, a mat-
tress on which we lie is ordinarily made
softer than the chair on which we sit, and
this, in turn, is made softer than a car-
peted floor on which we stand. To rest,
we sit or lie down. We choose such posi-
tions because they provide the greatest
comfort and the greatest opportunity to
recover from fatigue. Such considera-
tions seem to indicate that low unit
pressure is conducive to more comfort
and less fatigue.
It is common experience that even
small unit pressures applied at a point
or on a limited area of the body surface
produce more discomfort than the same
unit pressure applied to a large area.
This result seems to indicate that varia-
tions of pressure over the support area
will be uncomfortable and that, in ad-
dition to low pressure, uniform distribu-
tion of low pressure is most desirable.
Such a conclusion is somewhat erron-
eous, however, because of the nature of
the human body. Much of the weight
of the human body is hung on the skele-
ton through muscles and ligaments. Due
to continued use, the flesh on portions of
the body lying between the bones of the
skeleton and the support areas becomes
padded or calloused (witness the soles
of the feet) so that it can endure higher
pressures with less discomfort than can
the flesh on other parts of the body.
Certain portions of the body, in the
neighborhood of a large artery where
blood circulation may be restricted, or
where pressure on a large nerve may
produce partial and temporary paral-
ysis, can endure less pressure with a
given discomfort than can other por-
tions. Therefore, low unit pressures, not
uniformly, but properly distributed over
the support area should give the opti-
mum comfort. But what is the proper
distribution of pressure?
This seemed to be the most vulnerable
point from which to attack the problem,
and accordingly a piece of apparatus
called the Universal Test Seat was con-
structed. Its dimensions were com-

vary the distribution of the supporting
pressure in any manner which seemed
most comfortable to the passenger. This
method of adjusting the seat dimen-
sions, sitting posture, support area con-
tours, and pressure distribution depends
upon the ideas of pain or discomfort from
the sensory nerves and muscular reac-
tions, and is similar to that of the oculist
fitting a person with spectacles. The
seat is composed of four major assem-
blies: frame, seat cushion, seat back,
and floor and toe-board unit. The three
latter assemblies can be moved up or
down, forward or back, or tilted at vari-
ous angles to suit the comfort require-
ments of any individual or to produce
any desired sitting posture. The seat
cushion and seat back each contain 49
calibrated cylindrical coil springs. These
springs are arranged in seven crosswise
rows of seven springs each. Each cross-
wise row is mounted on a separate plate
which can be raised or lowered inde-
pendently. Thus, with a subject sitting
on the cushion, the distribution of pres-
sure can be adjusted for maximum
comfort. The top ends of the springs
are covered in the conventional manner.
The angle which the surface of the
cushion makes with the horizontal is
measured by the use of a scale. An-
other scale shows the included angle be-
tween the surfaces of the seat cushion
and the back, while a third and fourth
set of scales measure the width of the
cushion and the height of the back. A
vertical chart is placed below the

amount of compression introduced in
each crosswise row of springs by the ad-

ference between these values is the ac-
tual compression of each of the springs.
Since the springs are calibrated, the load
supported by each spring is obtained
easily. Fig. 1 shows the construction

passes down the axis of the spring,
through a clearance hole in the movable
sub-plate on which the springs are
mounted, and enters a small copper tube
attached to the bottom plate of the
cushion by means of a standard com-
pression coupling. This copper tube
leads to the upper edge of the chart to
which it is firmly clamped. The cord
leaves the tube at the bottom edge of
the clamp, passes down the chart in
front of the scale, through a guide hole
at the bottom edge, and out below
where a 0.02-lb. weight serves to keep
it under constant tension. The cords
thus follow, with surprising accuracy,
the movement or deflection of the upper
ends of the springs. The position of the
movable sub-plates is indicated on the
chart in the same manner. The zero
positions of the upper ends of the
springs and the sub-plates are indicated
on the chart by white bands painted
around the black cords.
The data on these charts is recorded
by the use of cameras. Data, taken over
a range of 2 SO subjects, was averaged
and curves (see Fig. 2 and 3) plotted.
The average deflection of the upper
surface of the springs away from a base
line is also plotted against the distance
from the front edge of the cushion. This

springs without load and with the mov-
able sub-plates, which carry the springs,
in their lowest or zero position. Plus

CELLULOSE ACETATE
By
BLAINE B. KUIST, '41 E
IT IS A safe bet that, no matter where
you may be, you are at this instant
in bodily contact with cellulose acetate.
Perhaps the form is slightly disguised,
but it is there nevertheless. If you are
wearing a shirt with a "do-not-starch"
collar, you are literally surrounded with
cellulose acetate, for such collars are
made either by incorporating a layer of
the cellulose acetate fabric between
cloth layers or interweaving threads of
the plastic with the material to be
stiffened. If you have a sport shirt on,
rather than a dress type, you still can't
escape because chances are 30 to 70
that it contains acetate rayon. When
writing, you are probably grasping a
cellulose acetate barreled pen or pencil.
Step outside to the car and you have
over 230 possible contacts with the
molded plastic. A few possibilities are
steering wheel, horn button, dash knobs,
window knobs, light fixtures, and dielec-
trics in the ignition system and instru-
ment panel.
Those sunglasses you use for driving
probably have cellulose acetate frames.
To see the road you may be looking
through safety glass laminated with
cellulose acetate. This is especially true
if you have a 1934-38 model, during
which time almost all non-shattering
glass was made with a layer of the
plastic between two sheets of glass. In
1939 polyvinyl butyrl began to displace
cellulose acetate in safety glass to the
extent of 65% and since has left cellu-
lose acetate with just a small corner of
the market that it used to monopolize.
When you start to tinker with tools,
sooner or later you will pick up a cellu-
lose acetate cased flashlight or a screw-
driver with a transparent handle made
of the plastic. Enter a kitchen and han-
dles on the cabinets and utensils formu-
lated from the same cellulose ester are
all about. Glance at a wrist watch with
an unbreakable crystal; it is cellulose
acetate.
Be you of the feminine gender,
chances are even greater for contact
with the plastic. Trinkets, costume
jewelry, buttons, hat brims, zippers, and
no end of varieties of fabrics are of
cellulose acetate origin. So when it is
said that everyone is familiar with cel-
lulose acetate, it is literally true, even if
the individual does not realize it.
Cellulose acetate is also taking its
place in national defense along with
other plastics. Due to the loud public-
ity in the past two years there probably
exists in John Q. Public's mind the
mistaken idea that metals will very soon
be replaced by all sorts of synthetic
fibers for fuselage construction. It is
erroneous, because plastics cannot take
stresses of nearly the magnitude that
metals do. That is the main reason why
plastics in their present stage of devel-
opment and metals are essentially non-
competitive; plastics are replacing met-
als in non-stress-bearing parts. For
instance, this year the Willys-Overland
Company is saving S pounds of zinc per
car by using cellulose acetate for replac-
ing horn buttons, etc. For the most
part, plastics find application because
of their own unique properties such as
ease of forming, eye-appeal, light
weight, or insulation ability, plus, of
course, the big factor of cost. Naturally
they will be used wherever possible in
an emergency because there is an al-

had, a fact which cannot be said for
many war materials. A few military
uses of cellulose acetate are lenses and
valves on gas masks, tinted windows for
air raid shelters, and gun stocks. Mili-
tary planes deserve special mention; in
one British bomber there are twenty-two
applications of cellulose acetate. The
plastic is used in chutes for conveying
ammunition belts from boxes to ma-
chine guns, in oil gages, windows, nose-
housings, knobs, control wheels, light
fixtures and pulleys.
If cellulose nitrate is the "daddy"
of all the thermoplastics (differing from
thermosetting plastics in that they do
not adopt a permanent set), then cellu-
lose acetate is the oldest son. They were
discovered about a generation apart, the
nitrate in 1833 by Braconnot and the
acetate in 1865 by Shutzenberger. Cel-
luloid (cellulose nitrate plus camphor)
appeared in 1869, as the first useful
plastic, credited to Hyatt, the same man
who made Hyatt bearings famous. Cel-
lulose acetate matured to a useful stage
in 1903 when Miles found he could
partially hydrolyze the stubborn tri-
acetate to make a very workable mate-
rial. The period of the World War I
gave the plastic its real start when two
uses were found for it: safety film and
wing dope for airplanes. In both in-
stances its property of non-inflamma-
bility led to its replacing the explo-
sive cellulose nitrate. During the post
war period the rapid expansion of
the acetate rayon industry occurred
mostly through the efforts of the manu-
facturers to find a new outlet for their
excess product. 1927 saw cellulose ace-
tate offered to the market by the Cellu-
loid Corporation as a molding composi-
tion and also in the form of rods, tubes,
and sheets, the standard forms of the
nitrate. Since then, the nitrate has
steadily given way to the younger ace-
tate which did the same jobs better. Last
year 24,000,000 pounds of cellulose ace-
tate were produced for plastics as com-
pared to about 50% of that amount for
cellulose nitrate. Now the nitrate's main
stay is the lacquer industry, but even
there it does not go unchallenged.
Table 1 shows the estimated production
of plastics last year according to
Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering,
February, 1941. Cellose acetate is shown
to be by far the most important of the
thermoplastics.
The manufacturing of cellulose ace-
tate is essentially the same whether its
intended use is plastics or rayon. Simply
stated the chemical reactions involved
are (1) esterification of cellulose and
(2) hydrolysis. The long chain cellu-
lose molecule is composed of basic units
(C6H10O5) which contain two primary
alcohol groups (—OH) and one sec-
ondary alcohol group. During esterifi-
cation, the 3 alcohol groups are replaced
by acetate groups (CH.,COO—). Hy-
drolysis merely reverses this action and
restores the alcohol groups.

The source of the cellulose is always
purified cotton linters which are almost
100% alpha-cellulose. These are treated
with acetic anhydride in the presence
of a solvent and a catalyst (usually sul-
furic acid) yielding cellulose tri-acetate
and acetic acid in a few hours, depend-
ing on the temperature (50-80°C). The
traditional solvent for the tri-acetate
during the acetylation step has been ex-
pensive acetic acid, but the Hercules
Powder Company, the largest single
producer of cellulose acetate for plas-
tics, found that methylene dichloride
could be used with better success. Sev-
eral advantages are claimed for it:
1. It is one of the best solvents for
cellulose acetate.
2. It eliminates most of the acetic
acid used as a solvent which amounts
up to 50% of the acetic acid handled
in the recovery plant. Acetic acid is an
expensive solvent by reason of its high
recovery cost. This chlorinated hydro-
carbon on the other hand can be 98%
recovered by simple water decantation.
3. It reduces the amount of sulfuric
acid catalyst required from 9 to 12
parts per 100 parts cellulose to about
0.5 parts. Not only is this a substan-
tial saving in material but the smaller
amounts of sulfuric acid reduces the
danger of degrading the cellulose by a
strong acid solution.
4. It enables a fine temperature con-
trol over the acetylation because of its
high volatility (BP 40°C). By control-
ling evaporation, the heat of reaction is

5. The product is more uniform due
to the clear homogeneous solution pro-
duced in the acetylator.
6. Reaction time is less. This is prob-
ably because of the more homogenous
solution also.
7. There are no gelatinizing tenden-
cies apparent even at the highest con-
centrations of cellulose acetate solution.
. The product of the acetylation is a
clear solution of cellulose tri-acetate.
Unlike cellulose nitrate the reaction
cannot be halted at some predetermined
intermediate point, hence hydrolysis
becomes necessary to make a partially
acetylated product of uniform composi-
tion. When the cellulose tri-acetate is
hydrolyzed, the acetic groups per unit
are reduced from 3 to 2 plus. Cellulose
acetate flake put on the market has to
have the exact degree of acetylation
specified with it and this important
property is expressed in the industry as
percent acetic acid or sometimes acetyl
value. A tri-acetate for instance has

Hydrolysis is accomplished in a hy-
drochloric acid and/or sulfuric acid
catatytic bath after the excess acetic
anhydride has been "killed" with water.
It occurs in a matter of a few hours,
the rate depending on the temperature
and degree of hydrolysis desired. The
reaction is halted by dumping the whole
content of the hydrolyzer into a vat of
water which has the double result of
stopping the action by dilution and pre-
cipitating the cellulose acetate as a
fibrous white mass. In general, the
greater the hydrolysis the more sol-
uble and less viscose is the product ob-
tained.
Following this, the process involved
is mainly the separation of liquids
(water, acetic acid, acid catalysts, and
solvents such as methylene dichloride)
from the cellulose acetate. It is not
simple at best, for the resulting fibrous
slurrys are unwieldy to convey and
process.
Approximate proportions to produce
160 pounds of cellulose acetate:
Cotton linters 100 lbs.
Acetic anhydride (Ys excess)..300
Sulfuric acid catalyst 0.5-12
Solvent:
Acetic acid 300-400
or Methylene dichloride . .. .300
Theoretical yield of triacetate. .177
Theoretical yield of diacetate. .152
The by-product of the process is 800-
1200 pounds of 18-20% acetic acid per
100 pounds of linters used. Most plants
find it profitable to operate a recovery
plant in conjunction with their acetate
plant making glacial acetic acid. The
amount of such acid turned out of the
plant has been esti-
mated at over 150'.&lt;
of the output of cellu-
lose on a weight basis.
It is interesting to note
that the Hercules Pow-
der Company, which
has a capacity of
10,000,000 pounds of
the acetate per year—
(42% of the total U.S.
production of 1940),
has an acetic acid re-
covery layout which
can be operated by
one man at a control
board. Nevertheless
the separation is ex-
pensive. That is one
big factor that oper-
ates to keep the price
of cellulose acetate up 50% above the
low for cellulose nitrate.
After the cellulose has been thor-
oughly washed free of the liquids, dried
and ground to flake form, it is still in
a useless state and far from being a
moldable plastic. The missing essential
is the plasticizer. Without it the cellu-
lose acetate to be molded must be
heated to a temperature which causes
charring. Plasticizers increase the flow-
ability so that 290-350°F and 2,000-
7,000 psi pressure are sufficient to pro-
duce results. Also, the plasticizers pro-
foundly affect all the
properties of the final
product such as tensile
strength, surface hard-
ness, impact strength,
moisture resistance,
stability, warping re-
sistance and heat re-
sistance. Unlike cellu-
lose nitrate, which has
camphor as the best
plasticizer, cellulose
acetate has over 200
potential plasticizers
which have been inves-
tigated. And the list is
growing every day.
These may be present
in a finished plastic
in all sorts of combina-
tions; sometimes as
many as 4 different
ones being used
together. In most
cases the plasticizers The plastic comes in a multitude of forms
total to about Yi of the weight of the
final product.
The materials used for plasticizing are
in general aromatic esters containing
several benzene rings. To qualify they
obviously must be insoluble in water,
odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, of high
boiling point (the higher the better),
chemically stable, and cheap. In addi-
tion, it must be compatable with cellu-
lose acetate and produce the desired
properties in the molded plastic. This
is not a small order but many chemicals
can do the task; some of the most pop-
ular ones being tri-phenyl phosphate,
tri-cresyl phosphate, di-alkyl phthal-
ates, phthalyl glycolates, and sulfona-
mides.
To be complete, the plastic must be
of the right color and that is one re-
spect which makes cellulose acetate a
favorite. It is available in any shade
from glass-clear to jet-black, all easily
obtained by incorporating a few tenths
of a percent of pigment or dye.
Once the material is properly plasti-
cized, colored and powdered, it can be
molded by either of two methods. The
first is simple compression molding in
which the powder is poured into a
heated die, then squeezed into shape.
The second is injection molding in
which the material in a plastic state is
squirted through an orifice into a warm
die. The latter method is especially
adaptable to mass production and there-
fore is used whenever possible. The fact
that cellulose acetate is used in 80% of

THE Engineering Open House of
1941 is over. The brief flurry of ex-
citement that pervaded the Engineering
and Physics buildings a few weeks ago
has long since died away, and for stu-
dents, professors and visitors alike the
Enginering Open House has become an
important event to be remembered.
If we were asked to name the one
outstanding impression we obtained
from the Open House exhibits we
would give credit to the efficient and
whole-hearted spirit of cooperation that
made the Open House a reality and a
success.
This excellent cooperative spirit was
evident not only in the fine depart-
mental exhibits, which required long
hours of careful planning and construc-
tion, but in the efficient and closely
knit cooperation shown between depart-
ments. Special credit for this well or-
ganized effort should go to Bob Sum-
merhays and Bob Bishop, general co-
chairmen, for the long hours of planning
which was under way many months be-
fore the big event took place. No less
credit should go to the various engi-
neering societies which cooperated to
make the affair a success. An "A" rat-
ing should go to Pi Tau Pi Sigma for
their telephone service (Bob Radkey in
charge) and to Sigma Rho Tau and
Tau Beta Pi for their guide service un-
der the direction of Chuck Brown. How-
ever, we think the latter were more than
repaid for their efforts — Hamtramck
high school girls being what they are.
Those who counted on seeing the en-
tire show in a few hours were soon to
be disillusioned; after spending nearly
an entire afternoon going the routes of
but two of the five tours, we can readily
appreciate the irony in the remark of
one visitor who, when asked what he
preferred to see, replied, '"Why, I'd like
to see everything, of course."
The day had its eventful moments.
One industrious soul in the Auto Lab by
the name of Bill Church, having spent
an hour with Chrysler's chief engineer,
was confident he could explain the
Chrysler Symplimatic Drive to the satis-
faction of all comers. His illusions re-
ceived a temporary setback, however,
when a group of "interested" bystanders
started asking embarassing questions.
The situation was relieved, however, by
their confession that they were Chrysler
Engineers and were only trying to see if
he knew what he was talking about. In-
cidentally, he did!
Misfortune stalked the Aero Depart-
ment in the form of the U. S. Navy,
which took over the wind tunnel just
before exhibit time. This did not seri-
ously distract from interest in the ex-
hibit, as testified by an appeal on the
part of the Aero Department to the

ARTHUR W. C. DOBSON, '42E and CORDON C. OSTERSTROM, '43E
THE FIRST spring day of the year
found us on our way to Toledo on
the long awaited trip through the great
Rossville plant of the Libby-Owens-
Ford Glass Company. Mr. Ralph S.
Gram, our genial host for the day, met
us at the East Broadway office and took
us to the scene of operations.
We parked in a space littered with
enough broken glass to blow all the
tires on a big interstate trailer, and en-
tered the storage silos. Here, in bins 30
feet tall, is stored 1800 tons of pure
Lake Huron sand, 600 tons of lime, and
600 tons of soda ash. These propor-
tions are approximately those used in
the glass mix. These raw materials are
purchased according to definite specifi-
cations, and samples are analyzed reg-
ularly.
The raw materials travel to the pour-

ing bins on rubber belts over which are
suspended magnets to remove iron parti-
cles. The pouring bins empty into a
device which is both weighing scale and
elevator.
We ploughed through thick dust on
the floor, and breathed a sort of dense,
sandy mixture which had a little air in
it. Of course, all of the operators wear
aspirators. The mixer at the top of the
elevator poured the batch into a small
train of cars which ran around a bal-
cony and emptied into hoppers around
the oven room. The building housed
eighteen furnaces which are used in
making glass. One of the furnaces was
being charged at the moment so we
went downstairs to have a look. The
furnaces seemed to be about fifty by
twenty feet and about ten feet high.
There were five doors on each side and
each door had a circular hole in it.
Through one of these holes four burly
workers were poking a charger. This
was a counterbalanced beam about ten
feet long on the end of which was a
spoonlike recess. The hopper previously
filled by the train was moved to a po-
sition up over the furnace door, and the
charger was filled from this. It took
quite a while for the men to spoon one
of the melting crucibles or "pots" full.
The pots, made of fireclay, are cylindri-
cal in shape and have the capacity of a
good sized bath tub. The furnaces are
run at 2600°F. for 36 hours and are cut
to 2000 F. for the final six hours before
pouring.
Farther on down the line they were
taking the white hot pots out of the
furnaces. To do this the whole door
was taken off. The workers did not
seem to mind the heat, for one of them
rode up on his tremendous power tongs
suspended from the overhead crane and
began fishing around for a pot. The
tongs seized a pot and withdrew it from
the furnace. As the heat had been
drawn somewhat, the pot was even hot-
ter than the furnace. We shielded our
eyes as it passed about four feet in
front of us, and we speculated on what
we would do if the pot broke, for it was
badly cracked. (We were relieved when
one of the men told us that the glass is
so viscous that it is easy to get away in
time.)
The tong operator then sped his crane
down to the other end of the building.
By the time we got there they had
raised the pot in front of a pair of roll-
ers perhaps thirty inches in diameter.
The rolls began to turn and the glass
was dumped in front of them. Flat
surfaced tables slid by under the rolls
and caught the ten-foot wide strip of
plate as it emerged. Enough glass is
rolled out at one time to make about
400 square feet of one-quarter-inch fin-
ished glass. The rolling machines may
be adjusted to roll glass of predeter-
mined thickness up to lVi inch, which
is the largest commercial thickness. In
this case, of course, only a portion of
the table is covered.
The flat surfaced cars flank the mouth
of a "lehr" or annealing oven after they
pass beneath the rollers. The sheets are
slid off the cars into the lehr where
their temperature is gradually lowered
to relieve thermal stresses.

cause of the many handling operations
necessary to carry it out, it is somewhat
cumbersome and has been replaced to
some extent by large tanks of molten
glass continually being charged at one
end and discharged at the other through
the rollers. However, the pot process
must be used wherever a large number
of different types of glass must be man-
ufactured in such small quantities as to
make the construction of a continuous
tank assembly uneconomical.
The rolling of a rough surface of
glass is but the first step in the process
of making a piece of plate glass. It
must be ground and polished before it
is ready for use. Most of the capital
tied up in a plate glass plant is in the
form of the grinding and polishing ma-
chinery. We were very much impressed
as we got our first look at the "G &amp; P"
(grinding and polishing) equipment.
The machine consists of a succession of
flat tables about ten feet wide and
twenty feet long, arranged in two paral-
lel lines about five hundred feet long.
The glass plates are mounted in quick-
setting plaster on these platforms which
slide slowly along beneath the grinders
and then the polishers. The grinders
are nothing more than beams, weighing
several tons, equipped with a row of
elliptical cast iron discs which rotate on
the glass plate as a sand compound is
fed between them. The beam recipro-
cates and the discs mesh as they rotate,
thus covering the entire surface. The
abrasive must be handled by rubber
lined pumps.
The grain of the abrasive used
changes as the glass moves down the
line, so many grinding beam assemblies
are used as each is set to operate with
but one grade of abrasive. We counted
thirty of these beams on one line. It is
quite spectacular to see the grinders in
action as they slide their heavy masses
back and forth. Looking down the line,
one is reminded of great grey caterpil-
lars gnawing away at a leaf.
The glass is polished by a beam ar-
rangement similar to the grinding beams
except that the cast iron discs are re-
placed with felt pads and the sand with
rouge. The felt pads wear and must be
replaced. This is done by having the
polishing beams move down the line at
a rate much slower than the glass itself.
When a beam reaches the end of the
line it is lifted up and put back at the
beginning of the polishing line. While
it is on its way back, the pads can be
inspected and replacements made if
needed. When the glass emerges from
the finish end of the line it is freed from
the plaster, turned over, and sent down
the second row of grinding and polish-
ing machinery to be finished on the re-

verse side. The speed of the glass may
be varied between 75 and 100 inches
per minute according to its thickness
and composition. The whole grinding
and polishing line is more than a quar-
ter of a mile long.
Each grinding and polishing beam is
powered by a 25 hp motor and there
are about 210 beams in all. Power is
supplied by an electrical generating
station at the plant which is fitted with
three 2000 kw generators.
The sheets of glass which are made in
this plant usually measure 10 by 20 feet
and weigh several hundred pounds. Not
so long ago these enormous sheets were
handled by men who passed slings under
the lower edge to carry them. The
sheets frequently broke inflicting severe
and sometimes fatal cuts. Xow a cradle-
like structure fitted with vacuum cups
and handled by the overhead crane ac-
complishes this dangerous task.
After the trip along the polishing
line we saw the finished glass being
washed in dilute acid and dried, and
then placed on the inspection racks
where an examiner marks every defect
in the sheet. He also indicates where
the sheets are to be cut so that a mini-
mum of loss occurs in cutting out the
flaws.
We continued past great stacks of
finished glass of all colors, sizes and
shapes. Curved glass is made by taking
flat ground glass and heating it in
formed molds in a carefully regulated
oven.
An interesting place was where the
curved rear windows of automobiles
were being made. Each window was
cut by hand from a finished piece of
plate glass with a template guided dia-
mond cutter, and was then lowered into
a furnace machine which heated and
curved it. Then air was blown on it to
cool it quickly. This rapid cooling pro-
duces glass strained so that the outside
is in tension and the inside is in com-
pression. This is called Tuf-Flex glass
or completely tempered glass. When
broken, it disintegrates completely into
small pieces and does not splinter.
The company is putting up at present
a continuous flow tank, of the type de-
scribed earlier, on the plant site. This
addition, which will include some of the
most modern of automatic materials,
handling equipment and control, should
be finished by the end of this year.

can produce more than with his hands.
In the development of his science, the

this basic objective and has designed
equipment and tools that show little or
no regard for the man who must operate
them. The proof of this statement is
easily found by a short trip through any
of our modern industrial plants. Punch
presses, for example, were never de-
signed from the standpoint of conserv-
ing the movements of the operator, but
simply to produce a part.
In the past, the only original attempt
to point out the fundamental error in
some of our machine designs has been
made by the motion study engineer. The
tool engineer, however, has had a poor
opinion of motion study as a practical
tool to be used for everyday design
problems. His attitude has not been
without foundation. Micromotion study
with its therbligs, simo-charts, and other
specialized analysis procedures has re-
quired the interpretation of skilled ana-
lysts. Recent developments in the mo-
tion study field, however, have brought
into use a new technique of operation
analysis that can be profitably used by
the tool engineer in his daily work.
To better understand the nature of
this new technique, take an example
common to our daily experience. It is
necessary to check the physical dimen-
sions of a part against a print of the
part. The first tool required would be a
measuring device, such as a scale or
micrometers. The new technique of op-
eration analysis is a similar device, a
measuring stick, by which the effective-
ness of an operation in the shop may be
judged with reference to its use of labor.
When the motion study engineer ap-
proaches an operation in the shop for
the purpose of measuring the effective-
ness of the labor utilization, he uses the
new technique of operation analysis and
observes the muscular movements of
the operator. Through his observation
of the muscular movements required by
the worker to perform the cycle of the
operation he is able to judge the effec-
tiveness of the workplace, layout, the
tooling, and the training of the operator.
The basic principle underlying this new
technique of operation analysis is called
the movement concept and is stated as
follows: The cycle time of an operation
is proportional to the number of move-
ments required by the operator's
method, plus the machine time. The ef-
motion m
m its mmt)
II hi w: DE
fectiveness of any setup may be meas-
ured by comparing the number of
muscular movements required to per-
form the operation (the input) to the
pieces produced (the output).
To illustrate the point, take the sim-
plest of all operations, walking between
two points. From common experience it
is known that the distance separating
two points is an important factor in de-
termining the time required to cover the
distance on foot. Applying the move-
ment concept to this case it is evident
that the time required to perform this
operation is dependent on the number
of muscular movements, steps, required
to cover the distance between the two
points. The greater the distance the
more steps, and consequently the more
time required to perform the operation.
Suppose a barrier is placed in the path
between the two points, the additional
time required will be proportional to the
number of movements required to cir-
cumnavigate the barrier. Although the
above example may seem overly simple,
it does give the motion study engineer
a basically sound approach to operation
analysis and improvement.
After observing the muscular move-
ments required to perform an operation,
the motion study engineer applies two
basic principles to improve the opera-
tion. First, he eliminates the unneces-
sary movements, and second, he im-
proves the necessary movements. The

requires fewer muscular movements in
its performance, and for a given period
of time, the operator's output is greater,
not because the operator works harder,
but simply because more effective use
has been made of the worker's physical
input.
The motion study engineer has made
considerable progress in improving exist-
ing operations in the plant. Intensive
training programs have been instituted
to train plant supervisors in this tech-
nique of operation analysis. The results
have been most gratifying. The com-
bined efforts of the plant supervisor and
the motion study engineer have materi-
ally reduced waste effort in the plant.
Unfortunately, this approach to bet-
ter methods is basically wrong. It con-
tains too much of the element of "lock-
ing the barn after the horse is stolen."\
The solution to this problem lies within
the scope of the tool engineer. It is hs

department. If he supplies a well de-
signed tool, the labor utilization is ef-
fective. On the other hand, if the tool is
poorly designed, we have two obvious
losses. First, there is the redesign and
rebuilding cost, and second, there is the
added labor cost of operating poorly
designed tooling and equipment until
improved setups can be provided.
One method of overcoming poor de-
signs from a labor utilization standpoint
is to check the proposed tooling before
it leaves the design board. Below are
listed thirty-one points that have been
found useful in designing tools and
equipment .
1. Replace hand movements by auto-
matic movement.
2. Replace hand movement by foot
movement.
3. Eliminate the passing of work
from one hand to the other.
4. Provide hand levers, etc., with
multiple functions.
5. Provide means for finished work
to drop from fixture into discharge
chutes.
6. When drop discharge cannot be
used, arrange for disposing directly in
front of operator; over top of machine
is often a good solution.
7. Arrange for getting new work from
hopper or chute as close as possible to
discharge point so as to overlap move-
ments.
8. Eliminate the use of the hands as
a holding device.
9. When possible, keep hand move-
ments within radius of forearm. In all
events, keep within radius of full arm
without body bent or twisted and with-
out necessity for stepping to reach point
desired.
10. Eliminate barriers so that move-
ments can follow shortest path.
11. Keep both hands busy with use-
ful work and avoid wait of one hand.
12. Provide double station fixtures.
13. Eliminate hard to find controls
such as small buttons which require eye
directing.
14. Aid locating by means of slides,
guides, flanges, stops, bell mouth, holes
and bullet-nosed pins.
15. Separate scrap from good parts.
16. Keep eye movements within small
space, about six-inch circle.
17. Avoid necessity for operator as-
suming uncomfortable position. Most of
work should be at elbow level.
18. Build controls of proper size,
shape, and weight, and build to operate
without undue effort.

19. Build foot pedals so that they
may be operated by either foot.
20. Where feasible, arrange so that
machine can be operated equally well
from standing or sitting position. This
is best accomplished by arranging to
work at elbow height when standing,
then provide high posture chair so that
operator may sit and still work at elbow
height. When foot controls are used, it
is generally necessary to provide upper
and lower pedals.
21. Provide definite location for loose
tools. Mount if possible in position for
use to require as little handling as pos-
sible.
22. Make all controls "quick acting."
Use toggles or cams instead of screw
clamps.
23. Design machines for loading so
that those tools such as pliers, tongs,
etc., do not have to be used to place the
parts in fixtures.
24. Where possible, levers, such as
feed handles on single spindle drills,
should be made reversible so that they
can be operated by either hand.
25. Design machines as much as pos-
sible to shed oil dirt by eliminating flat
horizontal surfaces.
26. Provide sufficient place for chips
and turnings and make these places eas-
ily accessible for clean out.
27. Provide sufficient toe space to
allow operator to stand up to machine
as he should.
28. Provide compound lines large
enough to keep chips and turnings
washed off fixtures to relieve operator
from having to brush or blow off.
Point number 11
29. Provide for simple tool changes
and setup change.
30. Provide for fast feed of tools or
carriages up to work and fast return to
unloading point.
31. Make the job safe for the opera-
tor. Do not sacrifice safety for motion
economy but strive for both.
Technical journals have recognized
the need for more wide spread applica-
tion of motion study principles to ma-
chine design as illustrated in the follow-
ing case.' "Machine tools are generally
becoming much more convenient to op-
erate. Common sense rather than appli-
cation of any deep theory has been re-
sponsible for much of the improvement.
In the case of one signally convenient
line of machines, here is how this end
was accomplished. When one of the ma-
chines was on the drafting board, every
effort was made to group control levers
at a strategic operating point, and to
design them for easy and safe operation.
The machine was even laid out full
scale on a vertical board and the loca-
tion of the controls checked against op-
erators. 'Fitting the machine to the
man' did not end with that, however.
When the machine was built, it was
equipped with temporary control han-
dles which could be bent and otherwise
altered. Up to these controls stepped
not one but a number of practical op-
erators, and the bending and changing
was continued until a majority were
satisfied with the location and 'feel' of
the handles.
1 Hubbard, Guy "What About Machine
Tool Design?" Machine Design, Nov. 19.56,
p. 39.
Factory Management and Maintenance
"Then, and not until then, were the
final handles designed; these perma-
nent handles being laid out from the re-
vamped temporary ones. Acceptance of
these machines by users has amply justi-
fied the trouble and expense of this
'tailor-fit,' which was, after all, not a
very costly procedure. It also should be
mentioned that attention was paid at
the same time to convenience of tooling,
the inserting and removing of work, of
lubricating and of operating safety."
Cases similar to the one described
above are altogether too isolated. But
the time is rapidly approaching when
the tool engineer is going to be held ac-
countable for the design of his tooling
from a labor utilization standpoint. The
tooling must still produce the part to
print, but no longer can the tool de-
signer stop there. He must, in the fu-
ture, consider the movements required
of the worker to operate the equipment,
and reduce them to a minimum.
Management is beginning to recog-
nize the fallacy of the old approach,
of improving a job after it is running
in the shop. As the plant supervisor be-
comes better equipped through motion
study training to spot poorly designed
setups, greater pressure is going to be
brought to bear on the tool designer. In
the future movement economy must be
designed into new equipment.
Tools and equipment should extend
man's ability to produce. It is, there-
fore, only logical that we approach the
problem of designing equipment from
the standpoint of the conservation of
human energy.

emistr^ of the home!
Among life's "big" moments, few
compare with the joy of stepping
into a brand-new home! Feminine
hearts flutter with excitement—mas-
culine hearts swell with pride. And
well they may with all the better-
ments built into the home of today!
If you are one of the 2 50,000 people
who are buying or building a new
home this year, you will be interested
—and probably surprised—to learn
how much chemistry means to the
enjoyment and satisfaction you are
going to get out of your new dwelling.
From the very foundation to fitments
and furnishings, chemistry is respon-
sible for numerous advances in home
building, furnishing and maintenance.
Just to take a few instances out of
Dow's innumerable chemical prod-
ucts that may well be used in your
home: Dowflake* Calcium Chloride
makes concrete faster-setting and
stronger—lumber treated with Dowi-
cides* resists mold and rot—paints,
varnishes and enamels made from
certain raw chemicals produced by
Dow are tougher, more weather- or
wear-resistant, easier to apply —
Dow produces dyes for fabrics —
plastics for household equipment and
furnishings — protective materials for
treating paints, wallpapers and
awnings against mildew—calcium
chloride to allay dust on driveways,
control ice on steps and walks—and
for the garden there are also Dow
spray materials.
These are but a few of the key
instances where Dow chemicals con-
tribute to better homes—better living
—a better America.

key man
Step right up and meet George Wees-
ner, a gentleman and a scholar, a self-
styled loafer, whose special brand of
"loafing" has brought him the editor-

George Weesner
Lazybones
ship of the Technic for the past year,
more letters (Greek) than a Harmon,
and more keys (which he never wears)
than a night watchman.
For two cents (if you're broke he'll
extend credit), George will launch forth
into a lecture on the Southland—its
marvelous scenery, climate, girls, hos-
pitality—for it was in Nashville, Ten-
nessee, that he was born, went to school,
and acquired that inimitable drawl.
At the Peabody Demonstration
School in Nashville, George just rested
up for bigger things ahead. He was pho-
tographer for the yearbook, wrote for
the school paper, and played on the
tennis team.
Came September, 1937, and George
was installed in Allen-Rumsey House in
Ann Arbor, ready to study Civil Engi-
neering. Already completely at ease on
his feet, he scarcely needed further
training, but joined up with Sigma
Rho Tau and stuck with it for two
years. He also tried out for the Tech-
nic in the Spring of '38, and the next
fall was appointed Publication Co-
Editor. After two years of outstanding
work in that department, he was
chosen Editor-in-Chief. This year he
has uncomplainingly done the work of
two or three men, and turned out one
of the best series of Technics in the
history of the magazine. It was he who
conceived, and did most of the work
on, the special Open House issue of the
Technic.
And as for the keys and honors men-
tioned above: Scholastically—Member
of Phi Eta Sigma, Tau Beta Pi, Phi
Kappa Phi, and associate member of
Sigma Xi; Socially — Alpha Kappa
Lambda fraternity, Decorations Co-
Chairman of 1941 Engineering Ball,
Patrons' Chairman of last year's Slide
Rule Ball and General Chairman of
this year's. Along the way Triangles
and V'ulcans found him indeed worthy
of membership.
Every summer since he was fifteen,
with one exception, George has worked
for his father, who handles contractors'
equipment. The exception may or may
not be considered as a vacation. Like
all good Civils, he spent the summer
between his sophomore and junior years
at Camp Davis in Wyoming. We've
heard some wild tales of that place, but
George corroborates them all. Briefly,
his reactions are, quote: "Unquestion-
ably the swellest summer I ever had;
Jackson (Wyoming) is the swellest
town in America." But summer or not,
he was the coldest he ever was in his
life, riding back from Jackson at four
o'clock one morning on the running
board of a roadster carrying twelve
people. After the camp season was over,
George dutifully came directly home, by
way of Seattle, San Diego, and way
points.
After reading this hasty chronicle of
super-activity, you may well raise a
quizzical eyebrow at George's one am-
bition—to own a plantation, retire
thereon, and loaf. His hobbies—photog-
raphy, tennis, and good fiction—may
only confuse you on that point. His pet
peeves—lab work and memory courses—
may start bringing you around. But
we're still from Missouri.
It is superfluous to predict a bright
future for this lad. He was born just
three months too late to have a draft
number to worry about now, so will go
to work in his father's business after
Commencement, starting somewhere
near the bottom. We feel perfectly safe
in predicting that someday he'll be at
the top.
aerodynamicist
Often when we find ourselves in the
basement of the East Engineering
Building, we see a rather tall, well built
gentleman engrossed in the directing of
aerodynamic tests. The testing is of new
propeller designs in an attempt to cor-
rect air-turbulent defects and reduce the
number of airplane disasters caused by
tailspins.

Professor Stalker
Prophet
The other day we stopped to talk
with the director of these experiments,
Professor Edward A. Stalker. He ex-
plained to us that a real impetus has
been added to this work by the present
national defense emergency. In his quiet
manner he went on to say that the im-
provements desired in general are in the
speed, maneuverability, and armor of
fighting planes. Unauthoritative sources.

At Western Electric we're producing telephone equipment for
use now which normally would not be required for the Bell
System's nationwide service for two or more years.
More than a year ago we began to plan for the impending need—
to make ready our people, our plants, our machines, our materials.
So we're prepared when a rush order comes from Uncle Sam
to equip Camp Edwards or Camp Beauregard with adequate tele-
phone facilities. Thirty million feet of wire? Yes, in a single order.
"More telephones for these new plants," is the urgent demand
of aircraft manufacturers and other defense industries. Western

duction schedules.
So in this time of need, as in calmer days, Western Electric's

he stated, have recently branded the
American planes as inferior to the
foreign models, but he does not agree
with this criticism. Instead he points
out that the only defects in our planes,
at one time, were insufficient armor and
gas tanks which were not self-sealing.
And both of these defects have now
been remedied. We see that Professor
Stalker is thus not only a teacher but
also a very active research worker be-
ing especially interested in aerodynamics
and fuselage design.
Professor Stalker is also a real Mid-
westerner, being born just before the
turn of the century in Cheboygan when
all that upstate territory was lumber
country. He can still call to mind the
picture of lumberjacks swaggering
through those streets during the gas
light days. This picture soon vanishes,
however, before another one of a mod-
ern little commercial town with the
lumber now going to its paper mills in-
stead of downstream. The calls of
"timber' which were so raucous in Pro-
fessor Stalker's youth have now dropped
to a mere whisper.
After finishing high school in Che-
boygan, Edward Stalker came down to
Ann Arbor and enrolled as a freshman
in mechanical engineering. His interests,
however, soon turned to aeronautics
and so in 1919 he was one of two men
to receive a B.S. in Aeronautical Engi-
neering. His scholarship during his
undergraduate days won him the honor
of membership in Tau Beta Pi. After
engaging in aeronautical research for a
while, he returned to his Alma Mater
and received his M.S. in 1923. Since
that time he has remained on the Fac-
ulty of the College of Engineering, be-
coming in 1939 the Chairman of the De-
partment of Aeronautical Engineering.
In the course of his research work,
Professor Stalker has been the author
of several scientific papers concerning
aero-design problems. His list of "best
sellers" includes Principles of Flight and
The Extraction of Energy from the
Wind, which do not coalesce the Jules
Verne novel with the Leonardo Da Vinci
apparition. However, not all of Profes-
sor Stalker's twenty-four hours are
spent in the wind tunnel. He has a
daughter almost six years old with
whom he enjoys many pleasant mo-
ments.
If Professor Stalker is questioned
about the future of airplanes, particu-
larly after the present conflict ceases,
he will reply that the fighting planes
and bombers will be rehabilitated for
commercial use. Some day giant air-
planes may compete with the railroads
for heavy freight, and helicopters shall
transport the populace. All this enters
into Professor Stalker's vision of the
future of aeronautics.
inventor
Meet the man behind the pipe, Jerry
Mecklenburger. Seeing Jerry without a
pipe when he isn't in a class would be
seeing the eighth wonder of the world.

Jerry Mecklenburger
The better for his presence
He has collected quite a few pipes, but
you would probably be more interested
in his tobacco, which is pretty good.
Officially he is Jerome W. Mecklen-
burger, '41E; the "E" in particular be-
ing Engineering Mechanics. Jerry just
missed being a Christmas present and
beat 1920 in by only two days. Al-
though born in Chicago, he moved to
Winnetka, Illinois, where he has lived
since 1923.
As a hobby, woodwork and cabinet
making have occupied his leisure time.
His basement shop at home was en-
tirely equipped with the profits of his
hobby. He managed to find time to par-
ticipate in student activities, among
others, doing scenery work for ama-
teur players. That was the closest he
came to being an actor. Topping it all
off, he dabbled with photography—all
while in high school.
During a summer vacation before
entering college, Jerry claims to have
done the dumbest thing in his life.
While visiting the Grand Canyon, he
walked to the bottom and back again.
It was cool on the rim, but the heat
on the bottom would have compared
with Hades. It took only three hours to
go down, but ten to climb back up.
As a less strenuous recreation, Jerry's
favorite pastime besides pipe smoking
is fishing. He likes it better because he
can smoke and fish at the same time.
While a counselor at Camp Nebaga-
mon, in Wisconsin, Jerry found time to
get in a lot of fishing while taking ca-
noe trips. In his travels he got as far
north as The Lake of the Woods in
Canada, not, however, by paddling.
Jerry began at the University of
Michigan by attending Rendezvous
Camp. After being initiated into Zeta
Beta Tau Fraternity as a freshman, he
pounded the books until his junior
year. Coming to the conclusion that
activities other than studying, if that
can be called an activity, were an im-
portant part of college life, he started
doing more than school work. As a re-
sult, Vulcans tapped him in his senior
year, he is a member of the A.S.M.E.,
Chairman of the Engineering College
Committee on Professional Practice,
and President of the Student Council
of B'nai B'rith Hillel Foundation. In
addition, the Michigan Chapter of Zeta
Beta Tau awarded him the National
Chapter Service Key this year. A part
of his junior year was taken up assist-
ing Professor F. L. Everett on a re-
search problem involving Photoelas-
ticity.
Jerry isn't a bookworm, but still is
not a social hound. He admits going
out once in a while, but denies making
a habit of it. That is conventional for
an Engineer; however, Jerry is uncon-
ventional in liking English. Yes, believe
it or not, there is an Engineer who
takes more English than is required!
Trying his hand at invention, Jerry
was issued patent 2070018 in 1937 for
a "Mounting for time pieces," a shock-
proof mounting for automobile clocks.
The patent now makes beautiful wall
paper.
Ever since he can remember, Jerry
has wanted to be a patent lawyer. Rea-
soning that Engineering was the proper
background for this, he entered the En-
gineering college. When June rolls
around, Jerry "hopes" to be among
those graduating. After graduation, the
Law School will be the better for his
presence.
Being under the draft age at the time
of the first registration, Jerry isn't un-
der the draft now. He'll register at the
appropriate time, though—the govern-
ment will see to that.

There are no "unimportant" parts in an airplane en-

Nickel-Chromium-Molybdenum and Nickel-

Engineering rode again (and what a
ride it took) during the pre-Open House
publicity.
It seems that Engineering Council
President Bob Morrison got a brain-
storm about Saint Patrick. He wanted
shamrocks—thousands of them. So he
called a history-making conference at-
tended by several of the mightier brains
in the engineering school. The pros and
cons of Saint Patrick were duly discussed
and brilliant ideas flowed in a volume
comparable only to the mighty Missis-
sippi. The preliminary bouts over, the
main event began to take form. Like
true engineers the group went into
action. Drickamer calculated stresses
with his trusty slide rule. Heinen mis-
calculated with another rule. Vollmer
drew pictures of vectors, while King
applied the well know rules of aero-
dynamics. The plan of plans was ever
so carefully designed on paper.
There were to be two gigantic sham-
rocks in conspicuous places over the
Arch. Mightily the engineers labored.
At last the shamrocks were assembled.
R E F L
To King and Vollmer fell the honor of
putting up these masterful creations.
But even the best of engineers make
mistakes (remember the Tacoma
Bridge). E.M. 3 had been relegated to
a place of minor importance in the cal-
culations. Came Saint Patrick's Day
and a high wind (not from the engine-
ers). Results: one startled coed, seven
pieces of shamrock, five engineers back
to read their textbooks again.
equation
Ever since we were freshmen we have
been lectured about the horrible fate
which awaits those engineers who just
substitute figures in equations and turn
the crank to get the answer. It seems
the theory behind this is that you might
be caught without an equation some day

and then you wouldn't know what to do.
Anyway, one of our fellow equation-
substituting mechanical engineers was
running a test on the Ridgeway engine
in the M.E. lab the other day and was
considerably chagrined to find that the
unit was operating at 400$ efficiency.
It seems he had substituted the length
of the Prony brake arm and the area
of the indicator card in the equation
hp=plan/33,O0O.
lost and found
It sounds like something from an un-
expurgated edition of "Grimm's Fairy
Tales," but the source of this tale is an
ECTS
unquestionably honorable person so we'll
shelve our doubts behind last year's
cuts.
According to our informant the sad-
dest sight at any time during Open
House was one of the co-chairmen. The
afternoon before the Open House he
was seen dashing around the two en-
gineering buildings tearing his hair out
in big chunks. It seems that he had
"misplaced'' one of the exhibits—a small
matter of an 81 and Ya foot panel from

the Detroit Edison exhibit. We are glad
to report that the lost was found and
the exhibit placed in its proper place.
Rumors that the lawyers had swiped it
were unfounded.
senior class night
Seriously now, this Senior Class Night
sounds like a good way to spend an
evening. If you're not a senior don't let
that scare you out of a good time, for
you can probably beg, borrow or steal
your roommate's identification card to
use when you buy your ticket.

hen fault exists in any type of bearing, high speed will
inevitably bring it to light ... in excess heat and wear. Thus,
high speed machine operation is at once a test of the accuracy
with which a bearing is made and of the efficiency of the basic

TECHNIC banquet
OPEN
"powers-that-be" to direct the tours
elsewhere while they sought to blast out
the log jam of visitors.
The Electrical Engineering depart-
ment underwent an attempt at mass
electrocution (well, maybe not quite
that bad) when some "fifth columnist"
stepped on a switch, causing a burnout
in the transformer of the electric eye
counting device. As a result, sparks and
responsible students were flying about
in general confusion.
Probably the most spectacular part
of the electrical exhibit was the Tesla
coil, with many spectators still wonder-
ing why operator Steve Gawura was not
killed by the calculated 750,000-volt
lightning bolts.
Believed to be the youngest visitor to
Open House was Dee Anne Miller, 7
months old daughter of Robert Miller,
general chairman of the Electrical En-
gineering department committees. Miss
Miller showed greatest enthusiasm for
IT IS with considerable regret that we
are obliged to announce Colonel Mil-
ler's resignation from the Faculty Ad-
visory Board of the Technic. Colonel
Miller feels he must resign since a con-
siderable amount of his time is being
taken up by the National Defense pro-
gram as he is the world's foremost
authority on heavy artillery. The Colonel
has served on the Faculty Advisory
Board of the Technic for eighteen
years and has been its chairman for
fourteen years.
Colonel Miller was born in Hagers-
town, Maryland, and attended Washing-
ton and Lee University where he re-
ceived degrees in both Civil and
Mechanical Engineering. He then
taught at the University of Illinois and
was Assistant Dean there from 1912 to
1917. Entering the army, he served for
a brief spell on the Mexican border and
upon our entrance into the war he went
to Europe to learn what he could about
mobile artillery from the French and
the beautiful colored sodium streamer
lamp which was part of the General
Electric exhibit. Badges of honor should
go to Al Jerencsik, Nelson Spencer,
John Strand, Louis Cuccia and Han
Chuan Hu for their splendid work on
the electrical exhibit.
Feature exhibit of the Engineering
Mechanics department was the half
round block of wood which vibrated up
and down when an electric fan blew
against it. The fluid mechanics and pho-
to-elasticity laboratories contributed
their share of interesting exhibits. Credit
for this exhibit should go to Chuck
Gibson, Avard Fairbanks and Carl Ox-
ford.
Michell Zolik should receive a leather
medal for his willingness to give his
fingers to the cause of the Civil Engi-
neering exhibit. Mick almost cut his
finger off while setting up the sewage
disposal model. The entire ASCE under
Jack Steketee and Bob Kimball should
British. The Colonel learned so much
that, after the war, he wrote a two vol-
ume treatise on Railway Artillery which
is the most comprehensive work of its
kind. He has also written a book en-
titled "The Paris Gun" which is a
biography of the Big Berthas that
shelled Paris during World War I. At
present he is writing a book on the ef-
fects of education on students. His list
of honoraries and societies includes Phi
Gamma Delta, Pi Tau Sigma, Scabbard
and Blade, Sigma Rho Tau, Theta Tau,
Phi Beta Kappa, A. S. M. E., and
chevalier of the Legion of Honor.
His long period of service to the
Technic is typical of the interest
which he takes in all his work—an in-
terest which has made him an expert
and valued man in everything he has
tackled.
Colonel Miller will be succeeded by
Professor Ferdinand N. Menefee as
Chairman of the Faculty Advisory
Board of the Technic.
receive a great deal of credit for the
completeness of their exhibit.
Novel among the exhibits were the
ROTC and NROTC displays. The
army's Garand rifle and 37 mm antitank
gun and the Navy's 14-inch shell at-
tracted considerable attention.
Outstanding among the Physics de-
partment's exhibits were the ruling ma-
chine, cyclotron and artificial mirage.
Mike Hindert and Woody Frailing de-
serve particular credit for their realistic
creation of the artificial mirage.
In this brief review of the Engineer-
ing Open House of 1941 we have proba-
bly neglected to give credit to numerous
individuals who have worked long hours
that the Open House might be the out-
standing success that it was. The im-
portant thing, however, is that every
individual who contributed materially
to this achievement has the satisfaction
of having cooperated in true engineering
fashion to attain a worthwhile goal.

per surface of the loaded spring has
been compressed to a point below the
base line, and conversely, minus values
indicate that the surface is above. The
minus value occurs where the sub-plates
have been raised far enough to push the
upper surface of the springs above their
original positions on the base line in
order to provide the desired support
pressure. Obviously this base line bears
no relation to the free unloaded surface
of a commercial cushion. It can be used
only to locate the contour of the loaded
cushion.
To design a seat on the basis of in-
formation gained from Fig. 2 and 3 and
the scales is relatively easy. The unit
pressure for any spring in a seat cushion
may be read from the pressure curve on
Fig. 2. Knowing the unit pressure and
the area which must be supported, the
load on each spring is computed. The
position of the upper end of the loaded
spring is determined by the deflection
curve and the dimensions from the
scales. The other spring characteristics
may be chosen according to the space
available and the softness desired. The
seat back may be designed in a similar
manner. A seat designed in this way
meets the requirements for static com-
fort in the loaded condition regardless
of the location of unloaded surface.
Within limits its location and contour
may be varied as desired. A seat de-
signed in the foregoing manner will pro-
vide static comfort to more of the 250
subjects than any other.
Thus far we have considered only
static comfort. We believe that the same
method of analysis may be applied to
the problem of dynamic comfort. Sup-
pose that we have a seat with the largest
supporting area, that is, the lowest unit
pressure, and the best pressure distribu-
tion. We know that a person may sit on
the seat for a long period, perhaps all
day, with a certain small fatigue de-
veloped. Yet he has the full force of
gravity (an acceleration of 32.2 ft. per
sec.2) acting on him throughout that
period. On the other hand, if the seat
begins to move about in any type of
motion involving changes of accelera-
tion, that is, changes of force, the fa-
tigue developed will be considerably
greater. The body seems to be, there-
fore, very sensitive to changes in pres-
sure (changes of acceleration) with re-
spect to time. The greater the rate of
change, the greater the discomfort and
fatigue. It was known in ancient times
that the continued fall of drops of water
(a small force suddenly and periodically
applied) on the skin may amount to
actual torture. Such discomfort, re-
sulting from driving off a straight line
onto a tangent circular arc is well
known to highway engineers, and on
modern highways all circular arc curves
are preceded and followed by transition
curves. Thus the steering wheel, even
at high speeds, is gradually turned back
to the straight-ahead position. By this
means the rate of change in the value
and direction of the forces acting on the
passenger is much reduced.
This discussion may be summarized
very briefly. To give the passenger the
maximum comfort and least fatigue the
following mechanical objectives should
be attained by the cushion. We believe
that we have shown that, for static
comfort, they are:
1. To support the passenger over a
large area to get the smallest unit pres-
sure on the flesh.
2. To avoid variations in pressure
from point to point over the supported
area except those variations dictated by
actual variations in the body of the pas-
senger. (To obtain the surface contour
and pressure distribution on the loaded
cushion that is considered by the aver-
age passenger to be most comfortable.)
By extending our analysis of the con-
ditions required for static comfort, we
believe that the objectives to be at-
tained for dynamic comfort are:
3. To avoid large changes in pres-
sure or forces acting on the body of the
passenger with respect to time.
4. Especially to avoid high rates of
change, with respect to time, of either
the values or direction of pressures or
forces acting on the human body.
We believe that the trend in cushion
design will and should follow the trend
of chassis design. Whereas the old chas-
sis springs had excessive friction which
varied with use, the present trend is to-
ward springs with accurately controlled
friction or without friction (coil
springs) with the proper amount of
damping for control.

ACETATE
(Continued from page 14)
all injection molded articles proves that
it works well in the process.
Comparing properties of plastics in
general is about as impossible and point-
less as comparing metals, i.e., the com-
parisons are without meaning unless
they are applied to two specific cases
for which the exact compositions and
the treatment during fabrication are
known. Also as with metals, certain
compositions are known to give definite
properties. Each plastic must be fitted
to its job. Often one property is ob-
tained at the expense of another in or-
der to meet requirements. For example,
hardness and impact strength are usu-
ally reciprocal.
Cellulose acetate holds its position in
the plastics world only because it can
do the job better and more cheaply than
the other plastics. It is usually one or
several of the following characteristics
which place it ahead of its competitors:
Low cost
High tensile strength (5,000 psi plus
or minus)
Flexibility
Moisture resistance
High impact strength
Ease of coloring
Moldability
Good dielectric
Low burning rate
Stability to light and heat
The price at present stands at about
30c per pound for the flake form, which
is 3c down from last year and 50% of
the price four or five years ago. It is
doubtful if it will ever reach the 20c
level set by cellulose nitrate. As a
ready-to-use molding powder (includes
plasticizer and coloring) it is on the
market at 44-50c per pound.
The achievement of 1940 for cellu-
lose acetate was the introduction to the
market of a more moisture- and heat-
resistant plastic of 58% acetic acid con-
tent heretofore unattainable, because of
its high viscosity and refusal to mold
well. The ever growing mixed esters,
mainly cellulose acetate-butyrate, show
great promise of extending the uses of
the cellulose plastics, especially in con-
tinuous extrusion processes.

industrial lighting
Just as industry must keep pace with
a government's demand for war mate-
rials, so must the materials and facili-
ties of the factory keep pace with the
changing conditions within its doors.
If you were to attempt to produce, for
example, automotive parts at a rate
greater on the former. This is an im-
posing fact but it does not contain the
whole truth. Installation, rewiring (if
necessary), and the amount of light
needed are factors of the initial cost.
Herein lies the greatest drawback.
Illuminating production lines, indi-
vidual work units such as assembly ta-
bles, or drafting rooms, presents indi-

Scientific American
Drafting room illuminated by fluorescent tubes
even near that maintained in present-
day factories by the use of individual-
drive-motor machinery, the outmoded
shaft driven lathes and drill presses of
twenty years ago would make the task
insurmountable. Again making the an-
alogy hold, commercial lighting effi-
ciency must keep pace with demands
made upon it.
Fluorescent lighting is our most re-
cent and nearest approach to satisfac-
tory universal illumination. High light-
ing efficiency coupled with low glare
and heating are the principal attributes
of the new system. Comparing a 40-
watt, 48-inch fluorescent bulb with an
ordinary 60-watt filament bulb, the ef-
fective lighting power is three times
vidual lighting problems of intensity,
source and color such that no general
statement covering all conditions can be
made. Installations have already been
carried out in various factories, for ex-
ample, an Ohio paint company is using
this light for color comparison. The
foot-candles used are graded as to the
nature of the subject—from high can-
dlepower for reflecting colors down to
low candlepower for white or high re-
flective colors. A California airplane
factory now being completed will be
equipped with fluorescent lights fur-
nishing candlepower equivalent to four
times that found on the average office
desk.
The relation between light and tem-
perature offers further points of com-
parison. Obviously, in an electric cir-
cuit, great heat indicates poor use of
supplied energy and subsequently, low
efficiency. Since the fluorescent bulb
never exceeds much more than 100 F.
and since 18.5% of the original energy
input returns as light, we conclude that
the new system is of relatively high ef-
ficiency. Workers are much more effi-
cient also because of the reduced tem-
perature and the improved lighting
caused by diffusion and elongated light
source.
It must be admitted that fluorescent
lighting has not completely solved all
problems in illumination, nor that it is
applicable to every situation. However,
eye trouble should vary inversely as the
extent of fluorescent lighting installa-
tion.
wood preserver
From the time man first began to use
wood as a construction material, one of
its most serious drawbacks has been its
susceptibility to the destructive action
of termites and fungi. Wherever wood
construction has had contact with soil
and water, myriads of microscopic or-
ganisms have attacked even the most
costly of wood structures. This has been
particularly true in damp, tropical cli-
mates and in many of the Southern
states of this country.
Industrial chemists, naturally, sought
to develop a means of combating ter-
mites and fungi, and today a most ef-
fective preservative has been found to
be Pentachlorphenal. This product
combines all the advantages of other
materials and in addition provides
100% protection, thereby eliminating
straining and weakening of the wood
to termites and fungi.
To determine the effectiveness of
Pentachlorphenal, a large number of
test experiments were prepared. Sec-
tions of wood, 2"x4"x2', were im-
pregnated with various compounds.
Then these treated sections were buried
in the ground in two test fields, one in
Bogalusa, Louisiana, and the other in
Jacksonville, Florida.

Yearly checks were made to deter-
mine the effectiveness of the compounds
in resisting termites and decay under
conditions favorable to both. The re-
sults obtained showed that Pentachlor-
phenal exhibited high efficiency as a
wood preservative since at the end of
four years untreated sections of sam-
ples showed only ten percent of sound
wood while all those treated with Pen-
tachlorphenal at the rate of 1.58 pounds
per cubic foot of wood showed 100%
sound wood.
It has been pointed out that Penta-
chlorphenal does not spoil the appear-
ance of the lumber, and does not affect
the handling properties. Furthermore,
it is economical to use and does not
oxidize nor affect the strength of the
wood.

AWARD FOR SERVICE
ONE OF the most progressive moves
of the collegiate year is the new
award fund which has been made possi-
ble through the efforts of Harry Drick-
amer, president of the class of '4IE.
Based on the students' service to
Michigan, the purpose of this fund is to
And yet it cannot be said that such a
student is not worthy of financial as-
sistance in the form of scholarship or,
more specifically, an award. The differ-
ence in scholastic achievement is often
adequately balanced by accomplish-
ments in campus activities.

A means to this end
help needy students who have been ac-
tive on campus and whose grades are
not high enough to be eligible for a
scholarship. There are many students on
campus who find it necessary to earn
part or all of their college expenses.
Some of these students find, or make,
time to participate in constructive extra-
curricular activities. Under the load of
jobs and activities such a student can
rarely acquire outstanding scholastic
grades.
As the award fund now stands the
awards shall be based on: (1) service to
Michigan, (2) scholastic eligibility, (3)
financial need, (4) good moral character
and good citizenship, and (S) prefer-
ence to be given to juniors and seniors.
The awards are to be of one hundred
dollars or less, as decided by the com-
mittee.
The faculty section of the award com-
mittee will consist of Dean "Uncle Joe"
Bursley, Dean Walter Rea, T. Hawley
Tapping, and a member of the Board of
Control of Athletics to be appointed by
the committee. These four plus five
leading students on campus will act as a
committee to select the recipients of the
awards.
Naturally, one of the greatest prob-
lems in establishing such an award is
that of finance. However, this idea has
found some ready backers on campus.
As a result, the J-Hop committee do-
nated $500 to the fund and a majority
of the Senior Ball profits will be turned
over to the award committee. In addi-
tion, all profits from Senior Class Night
will be used of the advancement of this
fund. It is expected that funds in the
future will be obtained from the profits
of class dances, from other dances and
special activities, and from special ath-
letic events.
This new award will be viewed with
interest by the campus for it is actually
a scholarship—a scholarship which is
awarded on the basis of education de-
rived from and contributions made to
campus activities. The value of such
education has been demonstrated time
and again by the success such graduates
have found in the engineering world as
well as in other fields.
This should by no means be defined
as a reason or excuse for not attaining
the goal of high grades. However, we
do feel that a proper balance can be
maintained. Unfortunately such a bal-
ance does not always insure the grades
necessary for the securing of a Univer-
sity scholarship. This is especially true
in the case of the student who is work-
ing his way through college.
In taking the step of founding this
award we feel that due recognition has
been shown for the "other half" of a
college education. Because of this we
"go on record" as being one hundred
percent behind the new award fund.

Demonstration of flow about an airfoil. The pattern
resembles that of a perfect fluid.

The teaching of courses dealing with fluid flow has been greatly influenced by its
growing importance in every branch of engineering. Quantitative work is as necessary
as ever, but more time must be devoted to the study of behavior of fluids. Whether
the engineer is interested in design of hydraulic structures or transfer of heat, design
of aircraft or control of industrial processes, resistance to motion of ships or
ballistics, wind loading and vibration of structures or cavitation in machinery, he is
as much concerned with mode of flow as with volume of flow.
The Engineering College has kept pace with this trend by introducing a broad
fundamental course which deals with all fluids, both liquids and gases, under the title
of Fluid Mechanics. To explain principles of hydrodynamics, to help the student
visualize flow phenomena, and to give him the feeling that it is all physically real,
numerous demonstrations of flow are used. In the classroom he sees for himself such
things as flow over weirs, flow through orifices and venturi tubes, the Magnus effect,
resistance of objects and the benefits of streamlining, and the vortex trail which is
so important in many vibration problems. Even the flow of the unattainable "perfect"
fluid is imitated.
