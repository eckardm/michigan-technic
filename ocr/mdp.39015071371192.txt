DEAN M. E. COOLEY
WHEN the great European war
started in 1914, among the very
first to volunteer their services were
the college trained men of England
and France. This was but natural as,
because of their training, they could
the quicker grasp the war's signifi-
cance. As England's great and im-
mediate need was an army, and as col-
lege men could more speedily absorb
the necessary training, they were ac-
cepted, and large numbers of them,
among the First Hundred Thousand
went forth to their first duty, the pro-
tection of their homes, and found their
Hall of Fame on the battlefields of
France and Belgium.
As England roused herself to the
war and realized that her only course
was to see it through, she called back
home those of her technically trained
men who were left after those early
days and began the construction of
her present great military and naval
plants without which she could not
hope to conduct a successful war.
What failure meant to the civilized
world, our part of it in particular, is
only beginning to realize.
That it was to be a war of science
and machinery was made clear to the
world by the fact that for 40 years
Germany had, besides making soldiers
out of her citizens, been calling on her
men of science for new ways to in-
crease the horrors of warfare, and on
her great manufacturing plants to
make ready the structure and ma-
chinery. And as the ideas of scientists
are made applicable to the problems
of peaceful life by the engineer, so
must he also make them applicable to
the problems of war. Thus the engi-
neer finds himself in vital positions en-
gaged in creating and developing the
resources of war, in transporting them
to the front and there building the
works necessary for their utilization
most effectively.
The world scarcely realizes the ex-
tent to which it is dependent on the
scientist and engineer for the con-
veniences and comforts of life,—nay
more, even the pleasures of life,—in
this wonderful mechanical age. The
tales of the Arabian Nights pale in
comparison. The segregation of the
engineer, slow in the beginning, gained
but slight headway before his advent
as a college trained man. Even then
it required years to establish his pro-
fessional entity so much is he a part
of the things which make up our daily
lives—our own entity. But a curious
thing happened. The 19th century
went to sleep with the engineer still a
child—an orphan as it were—seeking
an opportunity to be of some use in
the world; in other words, seeking a
job. When the 20th century awoke
the tale was reversed; the job went
seeking the engineer. In the years
just prior to the war the demand for
graduates was far in excess of the
supply; but now with war increasing
many fold the output of our factories
and straining to the breaking point our
transportation systems, the number
falls far short even of barest neces-
sities. All those who were able have
gone into the fighting machine itself
still further depleting the ranks of


WASHINGTON
18 January, 1918
My dear Dean Cooley:
I understand that there is to be a
meeting of the department superintendents of
the American Educational Association in Atlantic
City on the twenty-fifth of next month. I would
like very much to be present in person at that
meeting, but since I cannot be, may I not ask you
to express to the gentlemen assembled there my
very great concern that none of the educational
processes of the country should be interrupted
any more than is absolutely unavoidable during
the war.
My attention has lately been called in
particular to the falling off in the number of en-
gineering students and this has given me a good
deal of concern, because it is not only immediately
necessary that as many students as possible should
prepare themselves for engineering duties 211 the
Army and Navy, but it is also of the first consc-


quence to the country that there should be an
adequate supply of engineers for the period of
reconstruction which must follow the war.
Not only has technical training become
of enormous importance in military operations,
but the role of the engineer has become more and
more important in every process of our industrial
life, and I hope that influences may go out from
the meeting in Atlantic City which will call the
attention of 'parents throughout the country to
the importance of making any sacrifice that it is
possible to make to keep_ their sons in the schools
even during these trying times.
Cordially and sincerely yours,
Dean N. E. Cooley,
College of Engineering,
University of Michigan.

engineers; and the ranks of scientists,
too, have in the same way been de-
pleted.
The conditions in this country with
respect to its supply of engineers has
been set forth by the U. S. Bureau of
Education in its Circular No. 4, Au-
gust 30, 1917, from which I quote:
"The Engineer Corps estimates that
it will have from five to six thousand
engineer officers in service by early
spring. Approximately 6 per*cent of
the total force of a modern army is
made up of engineer regiments. The
privates in these regiments need not
be men with higher technical training,
however. The industries which fur-
nish war supplies are to be immensely
stimulated, and these are the industries
which chiefly demand the services of
engineers. Below is a tabular pre-
sentation of the output of all engi-
neering schools of the United States

"The situation with reference to en-
gineering is nearly paralleled in sev-
eral other technical callings. It is
this fact which has induced statesmen,
educators, scientific associations, and
industrial leaders to urge repeatedly
and emphatically that the higher in-
stitutions of the country, and particu-
larly those which give technical or sci-
entific training be kept in full opera-
tion, and that young men everywhere
be encouraged to attend them. Such
attendance is represented as a high
patriotic service."
College presidents, deans and pro-
fessors of engineering were called by
the Chief Signal Officer to meet at the
Bureau of Standards in Washington,
December 29th, last, to consider ways
and means to increase the supply of


technically trained men for signal
service. Two things developed at the
outset: one, the diminished attendance
at college; two, the loss of teachers.
If men were to be trained, they must
be induced to attend college, and the
necessary teachers must be had to
train them. Out of the discussion
came the appointment of a committee
to draft resolutions to the President
and to the Secretary of War; the
President to be asked to send a mes-
sage to the youth of the country to at-
tend school, the Secretary to prevent
the depletion of teaching staffs.
The President was immediately re-
sponsive, desiring only a suitable oc-
casion on which to make his utter-
ance. This was found in the forth-
coming meeting of the Department of
Superintendence in Atlantic City, Feb-
ruary 25th, to be attended by some
6,000 superintendents of schools. Un-
fortunately the President was unable
to be present and so sent a letter to
be read at the meeting. The letter is
reproduced in facsimile herewith.
In order to make the distribution of
the President's message still more
complete, Commissioner Claxton of
the Bureau of Education very kindly
undertook for the committee the task
of printing the message and mailing it
throughout the land.
Mr. James P. Munroe, Vice-Chair-
man of the Federal Board for Voca-
tional Education, presided over the
meeting when the committee was.

Howe, of the Case School of Applied

PRODUCTION OF ENGI-
NEERS MUST CONTINUE
"Anyone receiving as many letters
as I from various government war
departments, as well as from civil or-
ganizations, asking for young engi-
neers who cannot possibly be supplied,
would certainly appreciate their val-
ue and understand what the stoppage
of production would mean in coming
years."—P. C. Ricketts, Pres. Rensse-

THE COUNTRY NEEDS
ENGINEERS
American youths who are not quali-
fied for military service at this time
are urged by our leading engineers
and economists to take a course of
study in an approved technical school.
In doing this they will serve their
country and themselves, both now and
in the immediate future. Those who
are born engineers, those who achieve
engineering, and those who have en-
gineering thrust upon them will find
no lack of demand for their services.
Even now there is an ever increasing
demand for engineers, owing to the
continuous absorption by all the
branches of the service of the product
of the technical schools. It is a tru-
ism that this is a war of engineers.
Even the students have gone out. The
technical schools of France and Brit-
ain are virtually empty. Due to the
ravages of war—the destruction of

'&lt;&lt;TF WE could be sure they were
A safe!" How many sympathetic
people have listened kindly to the
aerial propagandist, as he expounds
the advantages and joys of the third
mode of transportation as represented
by the aeroplane, only to quench
the fire of his enthusiasm with
this disheartening half-question. On
this point the aforesaid exponent of
travel via the starry blue may quote
mortality statistics by the mile or hurl
aeronautical theory by the gross ton,
but he can neither bind nor smother
that still small voice.
Maybe the conversion of these kind-
ly people is of no importance to the
aeronautical world. Certainly it has
devotees enough; in fact it is some-
what hampered at times by their num-
bers and enthusiasm. On general mis-
sionary principles, however, it does
desire to do so. We present, there-
fore, incontestable proof of the con-
tention that aircraft can be made one
hundred per cent safe.
At the outset we cannot refrain
from a chagrined admission that the
solution of the problem has come from
men apparently unacquainted with the
aeronautical field, in fact, even out-
side the engineering profession. The
only probable explanation seems to
be that an altruistic desire to end the
war has stimulated their genius in
perfecting aircraft to the point of
great accomplishment.
Proceeding to the matter in hand
we would like to call attention first to
a very novel type of aerial creation
called the Fly-plane (Fig. X.—We use
the latter end of the alphabet as it is
yet unknown whether or not they will
fly). Here we have, according to a
description in one of the popular mag-
azines, a very compact or condensed
form of airplane, for it measures but
twelve feet span and ten feet length.
The condensed fuselage takes the form
of a straight-jacket which, with its at-
tached wings, fits the pilot very com-
fortably. The walls are hollow to
contain the fuel and oil necessary to
the operation of the condensed motor.
This motor, a gnome, vest-pocket edi-
tion, operates a condensed propeller,
the apparent function of which is to
cool the pilot when the fight is hottest.
At least, if it were intended to produce
a useful thrust it would be located so
that entire blast would not be deflected
by the jacket.
Launching and landing this graceful
craft is of course a simple matter.
Bulky landing gear is replaced by
fleet and graceful human pedal ex-
tremeties. To dart into space the pilot
has only to start the powerful motor,
run at lifting speed, and hard up the
helm. Now it is claimed that these
craft can fly at a maximum speed of
ioo miles per hour. From the very
nature of an aeroplane, not excluding
condensed goods, the landing speed
must then be 35 to 50. This will make
this type of aircraft very popular with
track men. We were going to predict
that as vehicles for social calls, the
Fly-plane would be ideal for society
ladies, but second thought suggests
that prior to that time must come a
modification either of the speed in the


Fig X. Since the Landing Speed is About Fifty Miles Per Hour, This Type op
Machine Will Doubtless be Very Popular with Track Men


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
former or of running gear in the lat-
ter.
There is no mention made as to the
material from which the Fly-plane is
made. Some one has suggested that
from the character of the name it must
be fly-paper. It is further recommend-
ed that when the craft is produced in
quantity, as its originator claims it
will be, its trade name be "1/Avion a
l'Ange."
Turning from this type of fighting
plane, we may, for the sake of con-
vents, according to the inventor, a
siege gun expert.
A few queries about the apparatus
as here represented, demand attention.
Why should the blast from the lifting
propellers be deflected horizontally by
the decks, thereby giving zero use-
ful lift? Or why again put the light-
ning tanks perpendicular to the direc-
tion of motion, when by placing ihem
longitudinally the resistance offered to
forward motion could be reduced
three or four times? If, however, we
Fig. Z. It Will Do "300 Per" On a Straightaway
trast, well direct our attention to the
giant offensive weapon of Fig. Y.
What could be more desirable than a
huge boat-shape helicopter which
could rise from the water without a
rapid forward speed, dart to the
enemy's fleet, hover over them and
with some uncanny means, as the
canned lightning here shown, utterly
destroy the whole of it? Why not in-
deed provide large roomy decks, where
the crew may move about with ease
and comfort, operating the heavy
siege guns, and discharging the five
tons of bombs carried? Nothing pre-
forget foolish questions of this char-
acter, we are prepared to admit that
here we have the potentialities for
putting an early end to the war.
Speaking of a speedy termination of
the horrible European (now European
and American) struggle, we are im-
pelled to glance at Fig. Z where in-
perspective sketch is shown the idea
which emanated from the brain of a
college Professor of Greek and Anci-
ent History. No, we do not have here
twin progeny of the old mill wheel of
sacred memory, nor yet lunch counter
order of Ferris Wheel "make it two":


merely the craft which will end the
war in thirty days.

which this cut was taken the author

ogist as to a new species of insect).

it is "a bit sudden," to be his partner
in this humanitarian scheme to "end

Summing up the rather hazy de-
scription of the apparatus, we can say
that it is not subject to the limitations
of propeller driven machines. It
But we must not pause too long be-
fore considering yet more premising
forms of aircraft, which we must de-
scribe in more detail. It is the
leviathan of Fig. U that we speak.
The inventor has complete drawings,
plans, specifications,—the work of
himself and a staff of engineers for
two years—everything in readiness
for quantity production.

will do 300 per on the straightaway,
and probably twice as much on the

professor, its favorite (and to some
humble mind only) maneuver. The
plans have been presented to the Gov-
ernment, but for some unknown rea-
son have not been approved. Surely
a .prophet is not without honor, etc.
We are sure Germany would be de-
lighted to have thousands of these
formidable machines built (by us).
This mammoth of the air measures
365 span and 225 length, and weighs
250 tons gross. Its power plant con-
sists of seven units totaling 28,500
11.P., which drive seven sixty-foot
propellers at 2,500 R.P.M. Two of
the screws are horizontal, and when
necessary support the entire weight,
thus enabling the machine to hover,
while the others drive the craft for-
yard with a modest velocity of 500
miles per hour. (Nothing is said in


ii
the inventor's description about re-
verse gear.) Enough fuel can be car-
ried to last 65,000 miles, from which
we see that it is possible to encircle
the globe two and one-half times in
11 days. Complete equipment is car-
ried, of course, such as sleeping ac-
commodations, baths, showers, reading
rooms, promenade deck and so on.
There seems to be no good reasons
why a swimming pool, tennis courts
erties the screws might otherwise
have? Indeed would there be any pro-
peller there to cavitate, after the cen-
trifugal forces had finished tugging at
the hub? Again, why make the gap
chord ratio of the wings one-third
when it is this condition that the blank-
eting effect of one plane on the other
is extremely large?
Civil engineering practice seems to
have hypnotized the inventor, when it

and golf links were not included in the
list. The crew necessary to man the
vessel is quite large, and—owing to
Union regulations—works in three
shifts of eight hours each.
The grandeur of the scheme is sub-
lime. But again the foolish questions.
What about the propellers, whose tips
will be revolving, if our arithmetic
erreth not, at the snail-like velocity of
5,500 miles per hour? Would not the
"cavitation" which occurs in the flight
of shells going at half that speed, de-
stroy any useful aerodynamical prop-
came to the design of some parts. The
artist unknowingly has improved
things. The interplane struts are not
steam-line as shown in the sketch, but
are built up of four angle irons tied
with lattice work; the idea is, no
doubt, to prevent the craft from run-
ning away, for these resistance pro-
ducing elements will act as excellent
brakes. The resilient landing gear is
also to be noted. It consists, as can
be seen, of six conventionally designed
tennis court rollers, the large bearing
areas of which are no doubt intended

is a mining engineer.
Finally we must observe what pure
art has to offer us in the way of solu-
tions to our aeronautical problems.
Witness Fig. V, where an aerial navy
sweeps ethereal space, according to
the vision of the artist.
Surely we might here have raised
our hopes high in expectation of the
radical and the dreamy. Not so!
Bound by tradition to the earth's sur-
face, he still adheres to Marine prac-
tice,—yes, to shapes and outlines that
would have delighted Norse seamen.
We take note in particular of the
graceful stern that is just disappear-
ing at the right of the sketch. No, it
must after all be a prow, according to
the direction of the streaming flag, and
the guess that the gas pipe there vis-
ible is the motor exhaust must be re-
vised to read fog-horn.
Even the size of the propellers and
control surfaces indicate a naval pre-
judice. Perhaps the creator expects
to make them effective by spraying
water or molasses in advance of the
craft. Although water wings never
needed struts to support them, those
of the aeroplane do, unfortunately,—
but then imagination is an essential
factor in the interpretation of art.
It may have occurred to you to
wonder just what relation the forego-
ing descriptions bear to the title of
this article, "Absolute Safety in Air-
craft." Simply this: Our point is
proven now that we have shown one
or more types of aircraft which are
absolutely sa-fe. Let us add that these
are safe; ioo per cent so. They can
be subject to no accident while in the
air for the reason that they will never
get there. If they get off the ground
at all, they will go only so far as they
can be lifted by some suitable hoisting
mechanism.
At this point the aeronautical engi-
neer gives up the question, as the prob-
lem now becomes one of crane design,
and must therefore be handed over to
the department on hoisting and con-
veying machinery. We have no con-
cern as to how they will treat the
problem.
We might add, however, that if the
patent officials had any voice in the
matter, there is little doubt but that
they would recommend that such
aerial atrocities be hoisted up to a
considerable height, conveyed to the
middle of the Atlantic, and deposited
there with an acceleration of thirty-
two and two-tenths feet per second
per second.
"Easy to pick flaws," someone says;
"our commonest conveniences were
once ridiculous." Quite true, and it
may be so again. It is quite within
the realm of possibility that the most
valuable contributions to aeronautics
may come from men of other fields.
But then, remember, we have merely
pointed out for the benefit of kindly
doubters that there are absolutely safe
aircraft.


GAS PRODUCER
W. L. BADGER, ASST PROFESSOR OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
SO FAR as can Be established by
direct experimentation, when
heated carbon is acted on by oxygen
the first action is represented by the
equation
C+Oi=CQ2+96,96o (i)
where the heat evolved is expressed
as gram-calories per gram-molecule.
Throughout this article wherever a
heat balance of a reaction is given
without other units being specified,
calories per gram-molecule will always
be understood. No matter what the
relative proportions of carbon and air,
the first result is always the same,
that CO. is formed. If the fuel bed
is so thin or so cool that no further
action takes place, the gas formed will
always contain only CO.; and limit-
ing the amount of oxygen or air will
only result in the combustion of less
carbon. But if, under the proper con-
ditions, this CO. then comes in con-
tact with more carbon, a second reac-
tion takes place, namely
CO,+C=2CO—38,640. (2)
In the formation of producer gas it
is this second reaction which we de-
sire to promote, and hence the condi-
tions under which it will take place
are of fundamental importance.
The most thorough and modern in-
vestigation of this reaction has been
carried out by Clement and Adams of
the U. S. Bureau of Mines, and their
results are published in Bureau of
Mines Bulletin No. 7. Before consid-
ering their quantitative results it will
be of interest to see how far the re-
sults may be predicted qualitatively.
For this purpose a principle known
as Le Chatelier's Theorem is of con-
siderable use. It is a principle which
apparently holds qualitatively in many
fields. It is, that when any isolated
system is in equilibrium, and any of
the conditions existing in that system
are changed, the equilibrium will be
shifted in such a direction as to tend
to counteract the change in conditions.
For instance, suppose a salt dissolves
in water with the absorption of heat.
Suppose a vessel to contain solid salt
in equilibrium with saturated solution.
If the temperature is raised, more salt
will dissolve; for in so doing heat will
be absorbed and this will tend to re-
store the original conditions. In the
same way it can be shown that a salt
which liberates heat on dissolving in
water should become less soluble with
a rise in temperature. Solids which
expand on melting will have their
melting points raised by pressure, etc.
This principle applies to gas reac-
tions as well. Reaction (2) absorbs
heat when it proceeds from left to
right. Suppose a vessel contains car-
bon, carbon monoxide, and carbon
dioxide in equilibrium. If the tem-
perature of the vessel be raised, the
reaction will shift in such a direction
as to tend to lower the temperature, or
in other words, more carbon dioxide
will be reduced to carbon monoxide.
In the same way, we may prophesy the
result of pressure. One gram-mole-
cule of any gas, at 0° C and 760 mm.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
pressure, occupies a volume of 22.4
litres. If'we assume graphitic carbon,
with a specific gravity of 2.2, we find
that a gram-molecule (12 grams) has
a volume of only 5.4 cc, as against
22400 for either of the gases. There-
fore the solid carbon can be consid-
ered as having a negligible volume.
But since the reaction results in two
gram-molecules of carbon monoxide
to every one of carbon dioxide used
up, there is an increase in the total
volume as the reaction proceeds from
left to right. Hence an increase in
pressure would cause the equilibrium
suits quantitatively. A quantitative
knowledge of the position of equili-
brium is best gotten by actual experi-
ment. And this has the added ad-
vantage that the effect of the velocity
of the reaction can be considered also.
For though many gas reactions are
practically instantaneous, the reactions
under consideration take a very ap-
preciable time to come to equilibrium.
The final results of Clement and
Adams are shown in Fig. 1, which
gives the results for air and coke. In
these curves t is the time of contact
between the air and coke.

to shift to the left, as this would tend
to offset the increase. Hence, qualita-
tively, a gas producer should be run at
as high a temperature and at as low a
pressure as possible, to have as high
a content of carbon monoxide in the
resulting gas as possible. The fact
that air and not oxygen is used, so that
the resulting gas is diluted with nitro-
gen, does not affect the above line of
reasoning at all, as the nitrogen does
not react with the other substances in-
volved to an appreciable extent under
practical conditions.
LeChatelier's theorem, however,
does not permit us to calculate the re-
If we add equations (1) and (2)
and divide the result by 2, we have
0+1/2 02=00+29,160. (3)
As stated in the first paragraph, it is
most probable that this action cannot
take place, but it represents the final
result obtained when equation (1) is
followed by equation (2). Since air
is 20.9% oxygen, and since equation
(3) shows that for every molecule of
oxygen used up, two molecules of car-
bon monoxide are formed, it follows
that from 100 cc. of air, 79.1 cc. of
nitrogen and 41.8 cc. of carbon mon-


15
oxide should result. This would give
a resulting gas composed of 33.8%
carbon monoxide and 76.2% nitrogen
if the reaction went to completion.
By examining the figure it will be
seen that when i/t=0 (t=infinity)
complete conversion to carbon mon-
oxide is reached at a temperature be-
tween 11000 and 12000 C. But where
i/t=o.5 (so far as can be ascertained
the actual time of contact of air with
the fuel in a commercial gas producer
is from 1 to 5 seconds for every foot
of depth of fuel bed) complete con-
version is not reached till 14000.
Thus the temperature in the fuel bed
of a commercial gas producer to give
a gas of even 30% CO would have to
be so high that there would be certain
danger of slagging the ash or fusing
the lining of the walls. So, though
LeChatelier's theorem tells us to rui»
the producer as hot as possible it is
not practical to attempt complete con-
version, due to these mechanical con-
siderations. The fact that low pres-
sures are desirable is opposed by the
fact that structures built to run at high
temperatures are very difficult to build
mechanically tight; and in practice we
are limited to pressure variations of a
few inches of water either side of
atmospheric. Practical considerations
are then of more importance in decid-
ing what pressure shall be held than
the slight gain in equilibrium position
from lowered pressure.
The operation of a gas producer at
a high temperature is a disadvantage
from more points of view than the life
of the apparatus or the slagging of the
ash. Consider a theoretical fuel con-
sisting of pure carbon. If this were
burned on a grate we should get a
heating value of 96,960 gram-calories
per gram-molecule ; or 14,540 B. T. U.
per lb. If we put this fuel into the
gas producer and convert it into car-
bon monoxide according to equation
(3). we have liberated in the producer
29,160 gram-calories per gram-mole-
cule, or 4,374 B. T. U. per lb. This
is 30% of the total available heat in
the carbon. This heat can only serve
to raise the temperature in the pro-
ducer: and hence it can only leave the
producer by radiation or as sensible
heat in the gas. If the gas is to be used
for fuel purposes and the furnace is
built immediately adjacent to the pro-
ducer, much of the sensible heat can
be transferred to the furnace and thus
saved. This is done in gas-fired ro-
tary kilns, glass furnaces, and other
high temperature furnaces. But if
the mains have to be of any appreci-
able length, there is incurred not only
the loss by radiation, but the cost and
upkeep of large mains subjected to a
high temperature. On the other hand,
if the gas is to be used in a gas en-
gine, it will have to be freed from
dust and tar, which is practically al-
ways done by washing. This cools
the gas and wastes the sensible heat;
so that under these conditions the
maximum efficiency of the producer
could never be over 70%; and that,
under the ideal conditions of com-
plete reaction and no losses by radia-
tion or fuel in the slag. Obviously the
actual operating efficiency would be
much less, to say nothing of the in-
creased upkeep of the producer due to
the high internal temperature.
A way of escape from these unde-
sirable conditions is found in the re-
action
C+H.C^CO+IT—29,800 (4)
Here again it is probable that the first
reaction which takes place when the
water vapor comes in contact with hot
carbon is
C+2H,0=CO,+2H2


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
and that the C02 is then further re-
duced by further contact with more
carbon. This assumption is not es-
sential to the following discussion, for
the results of the two can be handled
as if the equation (4) really occurred.
Clement and Adams have investigated
the results of this reaction also, and
their final results are shown in Fig. 2.
This indicates that the conditions nec-
essary for equation (4) are almost the
same as for equation (2). Since
equation (4) absorbs heat, and since,
gas which, when used for fuel pur-
poses, may be carried farther and in
smaller mains, since more of its heat
is in the form of combustible gases and
less as sensible heat. When used for
power purposes the advantages are
still greater; for not only is there less
loss in cooling the gas, but the heat
so extracted may be returned to the
producer as steam. There have been
published accounts of producers in
which a 95% thermal efficiency for the
return of this heat has been claimed.

if the reaction proceeds from left to
right, there is an increase in volume,
we might have predicted the same
qualitative results. The quantitative
similarity, however, could not have
been so easily foreseen.
The results of the use of steam in
the gas producer should be very de-
sirable. Since the decomposition of
steam according to reaction (4) uses
up heat but gives a pure fuel gas, it
will not only help to keep the temper-
ature of the producer bed under con-
trol, but it decidedly enriches the re-
sulting gas. Consequently we have a
It is not difficult to calculate the rel-
ative composition of the two gases
under conditions of complete reaction.
To be sure, complete reaction is never
obtained; but since the effect of con-
ditions in the fire bed on the equa-
tions (2) and (4) is so similar, the
relative value of the two gases is of
interest. The theoretical composition
of gas made from air alone has been
determined above. To determine the
composition of the gas made from a
mixture of air and steam, assume that
just enough steam is added to take up,
in reaction (4), the heat liberated in

reaction (3). There will then be used,
for every gram-molecule of carbon
29800
consumed in reaction (3), or
29160
1.02 gram-molecules of carbon in re-
action (4). Then, from the combus-
tion of these 2.02 gram-molecules of
carbon, we get (since the ratio of ox-
ygen to nitrogen in the air is
1.00:3.76 and since each volume of
oxygen yields 2 volumes of carbon
monoxide).
From reaction (3)—
1 gram-molecule of carbon monox-
ide.
1.88 gram-molecules of nitrogen.
From reaction (4) —
1.02 gram-molecules of carbon mon-
oxide.
1.02 gram-molecules of hydrogen.
If we reduce these figures to percent-
ages, we get the following composi-
tion (the figures for air gas being re-
peated for convenience)

Evidently the use of steam is de-
cidedly advantageous, for it gives a
smaller quantity of a richer gas, be-
sides the greater possible efficiency dis-
cussed above. Consequently we find
commercial producers always using
steam; though this is also due to the
fact that the simplest means of inject-
ing the necessary supply of air is by
means of a steam jet.
The use of steam is not an unquali-
fied gain. If too much steam be used,
the result is a lowering of the tem-
perature in the fuel bed. Now, be-
cause the producer is run at as low a
temperature as is consistent writh a
good quality of gas, so that as cool a
gas as possible may be made, any
excess of steam over that needed to
use up the heat liberated by reaction
(3) (and not lost by radiation) will
serve to cool the fuel bed still farther.
This will not only result in a much
poorer grade of gas, but will alknv
considerable undecomposed steam to
pass through into the gas, where it car-
ries off heat from the producer and
lowers its efficiency if the gas is cooled
before using as in power gas. But
when the gas is to be used for fuel
and is not cooled before using the
undecomposed steam passes on into
the furnace, lowers the furnace tem-
perature, and increases the stack
losses. Consequently the use of steam
has to be carefully watched if effi-
ciency is the most desired feature.
But owing to mechanical considera-
tions its use on gas producers for both
power and fuel purposes is practically
universal.


IN MAGNETIC TESTING
A. W. SMITH, PH.D., ASSOC. PROFESSOR OF PHYSICS
WHEN a magnetic test is to be
made on a piece of iron or steel
it is first necessary to make sure that
the test piece is free from the effects
of previous magnetization. The test
piece is usually in the form of a ring
(shaped like a wagon tire) or a
straight rod which can be clamped at
each end in a heavy iron yoke. The
magnetizing field is furnished by an
electric current flowing through many
turns of wire, wound uniformly over
the full length of the test piece. The
amount of magnetization produced ii:
the iron is measured by a ballistic gal-
vanometer, or a fluxmeter, connected
to a test coil of a few turns of wire
wound around the middle of the iron
rod.
Magnetic History.
Starting with the smallest value of
the magnetizing current and grad-
ually increasing it, the magnetization
of the iron also increases, but not pro-
portionately. The relation is shown
by the curve OA, Fig. i. When the
magnetizing current is gradually re-
duced to zero the magnetization of the
iron decreases, but the curve AO is
not retraced. The new curve is AD,
and the iron is left at D instead of be-
ing at O.
If now the current is again in-
creased from zero to the same value
as before, the magnetization will in-
crease along the dotted curve DA.
This is very different from the true
magnetization curve, OA, and if the
iron had been at D initially (when we
thought it was at O) the first curve
would have been plotted as OE in-
stead of OA, and this would give an
erroneous idea regarding the mag-
netic properties of the iron. The
method of reversals would have given
a still different curve. This illus-
trates the meaning of the phrase "pre-
vious magnetic history" of the iron,
and shows how essential it is that the
effect of such previous magnetization
be removed, and the iron brought to a
neutral condition before the magnetic
test is made.
Demagnetization.
The object of the present investiga-
tion is to determine the effect of Vari-
ous methods of demagnetization.
Usually a large magnetizing current is
applied and gradually reduced to zero
while at the same time it is reversed
many times. In this way the iron is
magnetized first in one direction and
then in the other, but to a slightly less
degree each time, until at last the iron
is left with very little magnetization.
This treatment should be complete
enough to wipe out every trace of per-
manent or residual magnetization, and
leave the iron equally ready to receive
the new magnetization in either direc-
tion. The principal variation in this
process is the rapidity with which the
current is reversed. Sometimes an
alternating current is used. This is
very convenient and the current is re-
versed ioo or 200 times each second.
When the iron is in very thin sheets.


19
or fine wires, this method is satisfac-
tory; but it is not suitable for solid
bars, because large eddy currents are
induced within the iron. These eddy
currents flow around the iron in such
a direction as to keep it magnetized in
spite of the efforts of the applied cur-
rent to change the magnetization. In
such cases it has been recommended
that the current be reversed as slowly
as once a second.

Curve is Shown by OA
There are, then, two questions to
be answered: first, in what state will
a given process of demagnetization
leave the iron; and second, in what
way will the results of the magnetic
test be affected by the method used to
demagnetize the iron?
Hysteresis Cycle.
The hysteresis curve1 for a ring of
Swedish iron is shown in Fig. 2. The
ordinates of this curve give the mag-
netic flux density, B, in maxwells2 per
sq. cm. while the abscissae give the
magnetic field intensity, H, in gausses.2
For this particular curve the iron was
carried through a cycle from a mag-
netic field intensity of £1=13.3 gausses
in one direction to an equal value of
H in the opposite direction, and back
again. When the field was reduced to
zero the iron was left at E with a
residual magnetization of B=7500
maxwells per sq. cm. as shown by OE.
Use of Alternating Current.
To show the effect, or rather the
lack of effect, of alternating current
the iron ring was subjected to a 60-
cycle current. The initial current was
1.5 amperes, giving a maximum value
of H=2i gausses, and this was slowly
reduced to .02 amperes. If the iron
followed this decreasing magnetic
field it should have very little mag-
netism left after this "demagnetiza-
tion," but this treatment reduced the
magnetization only from OE to OR,
Fig. 2. This means that three-fourtl.s
of the residual magnetization was not
removed by the alternating current.
At .this stage it was thought best
not to subject the iron to larger mag-
netic forces, but after the completion
of the-tests described below, larger
alternating currents were used. After
magnetizing the iron to D, Fig. 2, with
a direct field of 13.3 gausses, an alter-
nating field of 200 gausses, gradually
reduced to zero, brought the iron to
Z, Fig. 2, and left it with a residual
magnetization of 4000 maxwells per
sq. cm. This shows how fully the in-
duced eddy currents shield the interior
of the iron against the magnetic field

the International Electrical Congress, Paris, 1900,

of the external current. It would have
required an applied field of over 2000
gausses to demagnetize the center of
the iron. There is nothing new in the
observation that an alternating cur-
rent will not completely demagnetize
thick pieces of iron; but the extent of
this inability is not always appreciated.


21
Method for Determining Residual
Magnetization.
It may be well to explain how it is
possible to determine the magnetic
condition of the iron when the mag-
netizing current has been reduced to
zero. Since the iron ring forms a
closed magnetic curcuit, there is noth-
ing to indicate whether the iron is
magnetized or not, and the residual
magnetization cannot be measured. It
is therefore impossible to tell whether
the iron is in the state represented by
O, Fig. 2, or E, or Z. And as long
as the iron remains in this state we
can only surmise its condition. How-
ever, when the direct current is again
applied, and the iron is strongly mag-
netized, it will be at F, Fig. 2 (very
nearly) and the change in the mag-
netic induction from its former value
to F can be measured by the deflection
of a ballistic galvanometer. It is there-
fore possible to measure back from
F and find where the iron was before
the change occurred. All of the points
in Fig. 2 were located in this way.
One Cycle Per Second.
An elaborate study of the best
method for demagnetizing iron has
been made at the Bureau of Stand-
ards, with the conclusion that a direct
current, reversed by hand not faster
than once a second while it is grad-
ually reduced, is the most effective.
Therefore, this method was used to
demagnetize the iron ring. The cur-
rent was slowly reduced from 1.5
amperes (H=I3.5) to .05 ampere
while being reversed at about one cycle
per second. The reversals of this last
small current carried the iron around
p. small hysteresis loop, which should
have been at O, Fig. 2, if the demag-
netization were complete. To deter-
mine whether this were the case or
not, the full +1.5 amperes were ap-
plied, and the resulting deflection of
the galvanometer showed that the iron
had been at L, instead of at O. This
means that the process of demagnet-
ization had left the iron at L with a
residual magnetization of 5000 max-
wells per sq. cm. Thus this demagnet-
ization has left two-thirds of the resi-
dual magnetization undisturbed.
In this process of demagnetization
the maximum current was applied at
first, and incidentally it remained at
—f-1-5 amperes for a short time before
the reversals began. The iron was
thus magnetized strongly in one direc-
tion and the reversals were not able to
remove this magnetization. This pro-
cess was repeated, but at the beginning
the current was reversed once and al-
lowed to remain at —1.5 amperes for
half a minute, before the reversals
were continued and the current ic-
duced to .05 ampere. This application
of —1.5 amperes magnetized the iron
in the reverse direction as strongly
as it was magnetized before. The pro-
cess of demagnetization with reversals
at the rate of once a second did not re-
move this reverse magnetization but
left the iron at M. Probably the iron
near the surface was more completely
demagnetized than this point would
indicate, while interior portions of the
iron were barely affected. The pjint
M is thus an average value for all of
the iron.
Reversals Once in Ten Seconds.
It thus appears to be very easy to
reverse the direction of the magnetiza-
tion, but it is equally evident that this
cannot be done as quickly as once a
second. The demagnetizing process
was then worked more slowly, allow-
ing the current to remain in one di-
rection for ten seconds after each re-
versal. Starting with the current at


THE MICHIGAN TECHN1C
i.5 amperes this was reduced by
twelve steps so spaced as to reduce the
magnetization by nearly equal
amounts. At each step the current
was reversed ten times with a ten sec-
ond wait after each reversal. At the
end of this process the iron was found
to be very nearly demagnetized but
there remained a slight residual effect
in the direction of the initial current,
which was also the direction of the
current just before it was reducAd
from one value to the next smaller.
The number of reversals was then
changed to eleven at each step. This
meant that when the current was re-
duced to the next step the magnetiza-
tion was at one time in one direction
and the next time it was in the reverse
direction. This is a more symmetrical
reduction and gives the iron no bias in
favor of either direction. Even three
reversals at each step gave very satis-
factory results and a single reversal
with the ten second wait at each of
the twelve steps produced a more com-
plete demagnetization than in any case
where the current was reversed as rap-
idly as once a second. This particu-
lar piece of iron had a cross section
of a little less than 5 sq. cm. With a
thicker piece of the same kind of iron
these effects would be proportionately
greater and it would require a cor-
respondingly longer wait at each re-
versal to demagnetize it.
Effect of Imperfect Demagnetiza-
tion.
It has been shown why it is neces-
sary to demagnetize the iron before its
true magnetic properties can be de-
termined. In view of the fact that
the process of demangetization by re-
versing the current as often as once
a second does not actually leave the
iron in a demagnetized condition, the
question arises, what sort of a mag-
netization curve would be obtained
by the usual method of reversals; and
how would this curve differ from the
magnetization curve obtained after the
ring has been completely demagnet-
ized?
In the first place it may be noted
that the reversal of the smallest cur-
rent carried the iron around the small
hysteresis loop L, Fig. 2, instead of
the corresponding hysteresis loop at
the origin. While the abscisae of these
two loops are the same, the loop at h
is less inclined to the H-axis, and
therefore the galvanometer deflections
will not be the same in the two cases.
Had the magnetic field simply been
reduced to zero from its maximum
previous value, and then carried
through the same cycle of values, the
hysteresis loop for the iron would
have been at T, and the galvanometer
deflection would be still different.
If the iron, after being carried
around the loop T, is subjected to a
slightly larger value of H, and again
carried around the hysteresis cycle,
the new loop S will be somewhat be-
low T, but it will be as high as pos-
sible and still lie within the large loop
FD, and no amount of reversing the
current will bring it to O. Larger
loops will extend below O as shown by
PQ. These loops were experimentally
determined for this ring. The final
loop will be FD, and this is the only
one which is symmetrical about O.
When the iron has been completely
demagnetized and then carried through
a similar set of magnetizing cycles,
starting with the iron at O instead of
at T, all of the loops are symmetrical
with respect to O, and the last loop
is FD.
Results of Magnetic Tests.
To find the effect that the method
of demagnetization has upon the nor-


23
mal magnetization curve obtained by
the usual method of reversals, the iron
was prepared for such tests by differ-
ent methods of demagnetization.
In the first case a magnetic field of
II=6o gausses was slowly and grad-
ually reduced to zero while at the same
3000
induction change measured by the
fluxmeter. Then the next largest field
was reversed, and so on until the max-
imum field was reached. The rela-
tion between the field, H, and the in-
duction, B, is given by a curve similar
to OA, Fig. 1. This curve is not re-

time it'was reversed at one cycle per
second. This left the iron in a state
corresponding to L, Fig. 2. But a
magnetization test was then carried
through in every way the same as
though the iron were completely de-
magnetized. The smallest field was
first reversed and the corresponding
produced here, but the permeability
curve is shown by Curve I, Fig. 3.
The permeability, ju, of the iron is
measured by the ratio B/H, and this
is plotted, as ordinates, against the cor-
responding values of B to give
Curve I.
Again, the iron was magnetized to


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
H=6o, and the circuit broken. This
leaves the iron at a point correspond-
ing to E, Fig. 2. For the sake of
comparison the same set of measure-
ments was repeated without any
further demagnetization of the iron.
The results, expressed in the same
way as before, are shown by Curve
II, Fig. 3, which, as would be ex-
pected, lies below Curve I.
Finally, the iron was completely
demagnetized by reversing the cur-
rent once in ten seconds while
the current was reduced a little
after each third reversal. Of course
this process was long and slow. The
induction measurements were made in
the same manner as for the two pre-
vious cases, and the results are shown
by Curve III, Fig. 3. This indicates
a higher permeability than Curve I.
In fact there is more difference be-
tween the values of the permeability
measured after this complete demag-
netization by the slow reversal of the
magnetic field and the corresponding
values shown by Curve I for one cycle
per second, than there is between the
curves for one cycle per second and
no demagnetization.
Conclusions.
The proper magnetization curve for
a given sample of iron is not obtained
unless the iron has been completely
demagnetized. Reversals of the mag-
netizing current at the rate of once a
second may be too rapid for effective
demagnetization.
In every case the reversals should
be slow enough to allow the magnetic
flux to reach its full value before the
next reversal. This rule allows faster
reversals at the higher magnetizations.
An odd number of reversals at each
step is more effective than an even
number, because the current is then
reduced in a more symmetrical man-
ner.
WHEN THE STARS AND STRIPES COME BACK
ACROSS THE SEAS
You have heard the bugle calling,
heard the measured drumbeats
falling.
In the morning, in the evening, all
the day.
You have seen where they're encamp-
ing, and have heard the steady
tramping
As our gallant boys in khaki march
away.
Out of life from every station, out
from every life vocation
They are going out to fight for you
and me.
On their banner is the token: Tyrant
rule must first be broken
E'er the Stars and Stripes come
back across the sea.
O! the cry that never ceases f rom
those countries rent in pieces.
Where the children have forgotten
how to smile;
This is no time for debating, no time
now for useless waiting,
Men and money must keep moving
all the while;
Moving, moving to the border, solemn,
silent, and in order
With the banner flung to heaven
fair and free.
Bearing always the same token: Ty-
rant rule for ever broken
When the Stars and Stripes come
back across the sea.

J. T. DICKINSON, "20
LEADING out of Ann Arbor on
the north side of the city, there
is a road, which, at a point about one-
half mile from town, crosses the Mich-
igan Central Railroad tracks, and, but
three hundred feet farther on, passes
over the Huron river. Just before
reaching the tracks, this road form-
erly made quite an abrupt descent,
and after crossing them made another
slight drop to the river. The rail-
road near this point curves sharply
and, because of this and the peculiar
lay of the land nearby, it was exceed-
ingly difficult for the occupants of an
approaching vehicle to determine
whether or not a train was nearing the
crossing. Many accidents resulted and
the place finally came to be known as
"Death Crossing." Some time ago
the State Railway Commission decided
that the danger should be done away
with by bridging the wagon road over
the tracks.
It happened that the road was one
of the State Highway Department's
"trunk line" roads and one upon which
improvements were about to be made.
These improvements were to include a
new bridge over the river at the cross-
ing near the railroad, and since the
Highway Department has control of
the building of all highway bridges
over thirty feet in length, the con-
struction of this bridge was in the
hands of this department.
Thus, two bridges, with but a short
space separating them, were required,
and as the one was to go over the
railroad, the other must, of course,
also be raised somewhat above its old
level. Separated in this manner by
only about one hundred feet, the two
bridges were accordingly constructed
and connected by a fill. Fills were
also necessary at the two approaches
and these, with the one between,
brought the total fill required up to
47,000 cubic yards. The material for
this was obtained from a near-by river
meadow and consisted almost entirely
of hard-packing clay. This clay makes
a firm foundation for the road con-
necting the bridges and also aids, to
some extent, in strengthening the end
columns of the bridge.
Both bridges are of reinforced con-
crete throughout with steel eye beams
in the larger spans. The width j is
such as to allow for a seventeen-foot
road with curb and for a three and
one-half-foot sidewalk on each side.
The center lines of the two bridges
coincide and this line makes an angle
of forty-five degrees with the rail-
road. Although work was started on
both at the same time, that on the
railroad bridge was pushed somewhat
harder and as a result the former is
practically completed now, while the
river bridge will not be entirely fin-
ished until some time this summer.
In order to prevent the descriptions
of the two from becoming confused,
each will be described separately, tak-
ing the railroad bridge first. This
bridge presents a rather peculiar ap-
pearance because of the forty-five de-
gree skew with the railroad; for, the
piers of the spans parallel the tracks,
thus making them also at an angle of
forty-five degrees with the center line


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
of the bridge. There are three such
spans, the largest being fifty-one feet
long and rising twenty-two feet above
the rails. The other two spans are
each thirty-one feet in length and are
placed one on either side of the larger.
These two smaller spans were built
with the piers paralleling the railroad
in order to provide for two additional
tracks which the Michigan Central
upon which the sidewalks rest. Be-
sides these three there are ten columns
and one other pier perpendicular to
the center line. The columns at the
south end are thirty-one feet high
and those at the north end forty-one.
A good gravel and boulder foundation
was found for all piers and columns
so no piles were necessary. At each
end of the bridge there are curtain
"The Two Bridges Were Connected by a Fill"—Showing the River Bridge in
Foreground, and the Railroad Bridge to the Extreme Right
company may wish to lay at some
time in the futue.
The bridge floor is not level
throughout, there being a rise of two
feet from each end to the center.
Thus the floor slopes away in both
directions from the center of the larg-
est span with a grade of four per cent,
and this grade is held throughout the
distance across the fill and the river
bridge. This makes the center of
the railroad bridge the highest point
in either of the two structures. The
three piers of the railroad spans, par-
alleling the tracks, are each twenty-
four feet high and two feet thick
and are constructed with shoulders
walls, partly covered by the fill, which
give the structure a massive appear-
ance.
The bridge is surmounted by a
railing which adds a great deal to its
general appearance and, of course, to
its safety. This railing is composed
of concrete spindles and pilasters
with a coping, also of concrete, six
inches high and one foot wide. The
spindles are all pre-cast. Despite its
massive appearance and undoubted
strength of construction, the railroad
bridge contains in all but eight hun-
dred and ten cubic yards of concrete.
Because of its peculiar design this
bridge offered many difficult prob-


27
lems of construction. These have,
however, all been successfully over-
come and the bridge stands today
practically completed..
As was mentioned above, the river
bridge is built on a four per cent
grade throughout. The floor is
twenty-four feet above the floor of
the old river bridge and thirty feet
above the surface of the river. The
were put in with very little difficulty.
Curtain walls similar to those in the
railroad bridge were used and the
whole upper structure is very much
like that of the latter bridge. Exactly
the same sort of railing is to be used
but will not be put up till spring. The
river bridge will contain, when fin-
ished, about six hundred cubic yards
of concrete.
'This Bridge Presents a Rather Peculiar Appearance Because of its 450

supporting piers of this bridge are
of a different type than those used in
the railroad bridge, in as much as
the latter are of the simple support-
ing type while the former exert a
cantilever action. The river bridge
has three arches, which, however,
have no arch action because each
pier is slightly separated by a small
space from the one adjoining. If one
pier should ever settle a trifle, the rest
of the structure would not be ma-
terially affected, because of this sep-
aration. In all probability there will
be no settling in any of the piers for
a good hard clay foundation was
found for all. But two piers were
necessary in the river bed and these
Both bridges were designed by the
State Highway Department and while
of course both are sufficiently strong
to withstand any test to which they
will ever be put, special attention was
paid to saving of material and econ-
omical construction throughout. After
the scars of construction have grown
over the bridges will undoubtedly also
have a very good appearance.
The work was started in May, 1917,
and it is expected that everything will
be completed sometime during the
summer of 1918. The entire cost
will be about sixty-five thousand dol-
lars, with the railroad bridge requir-
ing a little over half of this amount.


F.J. KORTICK,'18
Chairman of Honor Committee.
THE second anniversary of the
Honor System in the College of
Engineering has been celebrated. It
has proved to be the success that any
organization of such high ideals
should prove among men whose prin-
ciples of honor are as those of the stu-
dents of the Engineering College.
That the Honor System should orig-
inate and receive its notable develop-
ment entirely from the student body
is most conclusive evidence of its suc-
cess. The result of a ballot cast in
the various classes in engineering dur-
ing the latter part of January, 1916,
showed that eighty percent of the stu-
dents were in favor of trying out the
Honor System during the final exam-
inations which began January 31.
This trial was granted by the En-
gineering faculty, who were unani-
mously in favor of such an organiza-
tion among the students. The stand-
ard of honor set forth in the Honor
System was so well upheld during
these final examinations, and the stu-
dents were so pleased with its sim-
plicity and effectiveness, that in
March, 1916, ninety-eight percent vot-
ed for a permanent Honor System in
the College of Engineering. Today
we can look back with pride upon the
way we have grasped one of the great-
est and most fundamental principles.
We feel all the more elated over the
success of our organization of honor,
as we recall the jests and perverse
phophecies given by our friends on
the various corners of the campus,
when the Honor System was in its
state of infancy in the College of En-
gineering.
We all know that the success of our
Honor System is due to the very im-
portant part which each of us has
played to uphold its principles. Our
aim now is to make this organization
more and more ideal. The ideal Hon-
or System is one in which each does
his share perfectly. If there is a back-
slider in our group, the little share of
some person or group of persons is
increased. We are willing to increase
our little part when so worthy a prin-
ciple is at stake. Then there is the
added incentive that we are support-
ed by the whole College of Engineer-
ing. Let it be made clear that the
Honor System is not forced on any-
one; the individual may at any time
feel perfectly free to take his exam-
ination under a proctor. This has, to
some extent, furnished an excellent
record of the success of our Honor
System, as up to this time we have no
record of any student making such a
request.
As we all strive, shoulder to shoul-
der, for a more ideal Honor System,
we are in return receiving the Stand-
ard of Honor so essential to a success-
ful engineer and to good citizenship.

THE COUNTRY NEEDS ENGI-
NEERS.
(Continued from Page 5)
roadways, canals, railways, bridges,
water works, public service plants, not
to mention whole towns razed and
hundreds of ships sunk—there will be
no end of work for the engineer once
the war is over. What money there
is left after interest charges on the big
national debts are paid will go to-
ward rebuilding destroyed towns and
public works and worn out transpor-
tation systems. The debts to be paid
are so huge that money will be scarce.
This will give the engineer a chance
to live up to his reputation as a man
who can do for one dollar what any
fool can do for two. For a time, prob-
ably for a long time, the whole world
will have to work hard and save hard
to make up for the wanton waste
caused by this frightfully expensive
conflict. The bread and butter arts
will prevail as they haven't prevailed
for years, our recent complex modern
systems giving way, under stress of
economic necessity, to more simple
and primitive ways. The cultural
studies—the classics and humanities—-
will, from force of circumstances,
make room for the studies that prom-
ise maximum output at minimum ex-
pense. The scientific method will pre-
vail until the world finds the time and
the leisure to cultivate again the
amenities of life. Applied science and
engineering are synonymous. To con-
duct the war, then, so that victory will
rest with our allies, and to rehabilitate
war's ravages once the nations are at
peace, means work for as many engi-
neers as our technical schools can
turn out. Here indeed is an alluring
prospect. All the youth of the land
with an aptitude for engineering
should lose no time in getting enrolled
in some accredited technical school,
for what America and her allies have
urgent need of now is not idealists and
pacifists but hard-headed practical
men with a first class technical train-
ing. An earnest student in a techni-
cal school at this juncture is just as
useful to his country as a soldier in
the trenches or a sailor on a ship of
war.—Electrical Engineer.
ENGINEERS AND CHEM-
ISTS ARE NEEDED
Director Van H. Manning of the
Bureau of Mines, says, in Iron Age:
"The War today is one in which engi-
neers and chemists play a far greater
role than ever before. The products
of the mines, furnaces, factories, and
chemical plants are being so rapidly
consumed that the highest possible
skill is required to keep pace with the
destruction everywhere apparent. In
the organization of a great army,
many classes of specialists are needed,
and the problem is to get the best qual-
ified man for each place."
COMMENT ON PHOTO-
SURVEYING ARTICLE
(December, 1917, Technic.)
Two very interesting letters have
been received from Dr. Otto Klotz.
'72, Chief Astronomer and Director
of the Dominion Observatory, rela-
tive to Canadian work in Photo-Sur-
veying. It appears that the American
and Canadian Alaskan Boundary Sur-
veys were distinct duplicate surveys
and not a joint survey as was implied
in the article on Photo-surveying ap-
pearing in the last Technic. The
parties covered the same area and in


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
some cases worked close together. The
Canadian party made use of the cam-
era while the Americans did not.
Quoting from Dr. Klotz, "Photo-
graphic Surveying was begun with us
under Dr. Deville in 1885 and has
been carried on ever since. ....
Our application of the method in con-
nection with the Alaska Boundary
Survey in 1893 and onward firmly es-
tablished its superiority over other
methods in a highly mountainous
country. . . . Many a time when as-
cents were made jointly by a U. S.
officer and a Canadian to a mountain
peak, the latter would set up his cam-
era, cover the horizon with seven
shots and be through before the other
had fairly started and then to find
likely that a bank of cloud or fog
rolled up and enveloped all in relative
darkness. The result was that Mr.
J. A. Flemer of the U. S. Coast and
Geodetic Survey spent a winter with
us to familiarize himself with the
modus operandi in evaluating the
photograph in terms of horizontal and
vertical measure. Mr. Flemer wrote
two splendid reports on the method
in the U. S. C. &amp; G. publications.
(Later published in book form by
John Wiley arid Sons.)
PHYSICAL TRAINING AT CAMP CUSTER
It has been found that physical
training in the armies of our allies
'over there' has been one of the most
important factors in putting real 'pep'
into the men, and it is this fact that
has brought physical training into our
camps and cantonments, to the great
benefit of our men.
The training at Camp Custer (Bat-
tle Creek, Mich.) has become one of
the most thorough athletic and physi-
cal recreation systems to be found
among the many camps of the coun-
try, as is shown by the excellent con-
dition of the men there. Custer has,
as do most other camps, a Civilian
Director of Athletics, who, under an
army officer, directs all the athletic
work. F. A. Rowe, '08, former Di-
rector of Intramural Athletics at this
University, and famous track man,
occupies the important position of civ-
ilian director. He filled a similar po-
sition at the Officers' Training Camp
this summer at Ft. Niagara, just pre-
vious to his assuming charge at Cus-
ter.
A most interesting feature of the
program at Camp Custer is the com-
piling of a regular boxing schedule
whereby it is made possible to have
the various companies compete. A
competent instructor to supervise and
stimulate boxing has been provided.
It has been the aim of the athletic
organization under the direction of
Mr. Rowe to make the work of inter-
est to all types of men by varying the
games as much as possible, and by
forming platoon teams for the various
games instead of having one man rep-
resent an entire company. Each bri-
gade commander in the division ap-
points a brigade athletic officer. Each
regimental or separate organization
commander appoints the athletic offi-
cer for his organization. Each com-
pany commander then appoints a com-
pany athletic officer who in turn is
held responsible for the athletics of
his own company.
Great care is used in picking these
officers, and they are all men of abil-
ity who have the energy to see that


31
the programs are properly carried out.
The men are all given setting-up ex-
ercises and are also taken out on
cross-country runs and hikes. They
are also given the opportunity to play
hockey, soccer, and the like, as well
as indoor baseball. Practically all re-
ceive considerable training in boxing.
Boxing has' been taken over by Mr.
Charles White, who has been an-
nounced as Division Boxing Instruc-
tor.
The men are enjoying the athletic
sports and are greatly developing un-
der the system which has proven to
be invaluable to camp life.

Knowing always what the end can

the $5 stamp. The 25 cent stamp is
known as the Thrift stamp and the
$5 stamp as the War-Savings stamp.
Thrift stamps bear no interest, but
when one has saved $4 worth of them,
they can be exchanged for a $5 War-
Savings stamp by paying a, certain
amount in cash. In March, 1918, this
amount is $.14, in April, $.15, in May,
$.16 up to December, 1922, when
the amount is $.71, the maximum val-
ue. The government will then pay
$5 for the stamp at the time it becomes
due which is January I, 1923. This is
equivalent to an interest rate of 4%
impounded quarterly.
Those who prefer may buy a $5
stamp outright. These automatically
increase in value a cent a month. Thus,
in March, 1918, one can buy a $5
stamp for $4.14.
Both Thrift stamps and War-Sav-
ings stamps are for sale at post offices
and banks or may be obtained at room
225, Engineering building.
FINAL EXAMINATIONS
For some time the faculty and oth-
ers, who have really given much
thought to the matter, have seriously
questioned the value of final examin-
ations as given heretofore. About
one-seventh of the total time presum-
ably available for instruction has, till
this past semester, been devoted to
final examinations.
To quote from the March, 1917,
Technic,—"We spend one month out
of each nine trying to show the fac-
ulty that they have taught us some-
thing in the other eight. They ought
to have a fair idea of that themselves.
In those four weeks we do nothing
constructive or permanent."
The peculiar conditions due to the
war seem to have brought the whole
matter to a head, with the result that
classes in the Engineering College
were continued right through the time
that is ordinarily set aside for finals.
The various departments provided
such "written or oral tests of scholar-
ship" as they saw fit, these tests being
given during the regularly scheduled
periods for each course.
The system was successful where
the members of the faculty really got
the idea and entered into the spirit of
the scheme, which was to save the
time usually devoted to finals and use
it for some really constructive work.
Many students have become much op-
posed to the plan. Doubtless this op-
position is made up largely of those
who were under the dominion of
some misguided faculty member who-
felt that it was his duty to provide
quite a respectable final examination
for every meeting of the class during
the entire two weeks. Such a system
is vastly worse than the old method of
giving finals, and we can only say that
we are entirely in accord with the op-
position.
Let us sincerely hope that all facul-
ty members will cooperate to the full-
est extent in carrying out the true
idea of this new plan to gain time, if
this system is used again this coming
June.
WELCOME, T-SQUARES
The Technic wishes to take this
opportunity to officially welcome our
new neighbors of across-the-hall, the
T-Square Society. The T-Squares—
the women's engineering society—date
back to 1913, but not till this year
have they had a regular room of their
own. The new quarters are in Room
268, Engineering Building.
Welcome, T-Squares!

THE NEW COVER DESIGN
We wish to take this opportunity to
officially express our appreciation to
J. J. Kucera and R. Kruger, both
Senior Architects, for the new cover
design which is their handiwork. We
are especially pleased with the live
drawing of the Engineering towers.
PLEASE
Do Not Roll Photographs which
you send in to the Technic for re-
production. We have mentioned this
matter before, but still, every issue,
we receive prints that have been
spoiled due to being sent rolled. This
issue three exceptionally good photos
were spoiled in this manner. One was
cracked so badly that it could not even
be patched up or retouched; the oth-
er two have been used, though their
appearances are somewhat marred.
Rolling photos, especially if they
have glazed surfaces (as they should),
injuries the emulsion so that when
they are unrolled the surface hair-
cracks or even breaks. These cracks,
even though fine, show up as black
lines upon reproduction.
Photos should be mailed flat, and
should be well protected by cardboard
or some other suitable reinforcement.
BOOK REVIEW
Finding and Stopping Waste in Mod-
ern Boiler Rooms. Cloth, limp bind-
ing, 424 x 7 in. A publication of
the Harrison Safety Boiler Works,
Philadelphia, Penn., 1918. 274 pp.
Price, $1.00.
This book is a reference manual
"to aid the owner, manager and boiler
room operator in securing and main-
taining plant economy." The various
problems in securing plant economy
are taken up in a concise and orderly
manner under the five heads: Fuels,
Combustion, Heat Absorption, Boiler
Efficiency and Boiler Testing, Boiler
Plant Proportioning and Manage-
ment.
Careful discussions of theory are
followed by the practical sides of the
various subjects. Many cuts of boil-
ers, boiler settings, and sundry appa-
ratus, together with many graphs and
curves greatly add to the value of this
handbook. Tables and data, hereto-
fore more or less scattered, are to be
found in it for ready reference.
Mr. Henry Kreisinger, of the Uni-
ted States Bureau of Mines, who con-
ducted for the Government many of
the steam boiler investigations men-
tioned in the manual, read and cor-
rected the proof of this book.
"WHEN THE WAR WILL END."
Absolute knowledge I have none,
But my aunt's washer woman's son
Heard a policeman on his beat
Say to a laborer on the street
That he had a letter just last week
(Written in Latin, or was it Greek)
From a Chinese coolie in Timbuctoo,
Who said the negroes in Cuba knew
Of a colored man in a Texas town
Who got it straight from a circus clown,
That a man in the Klondike heard the news
From a gang of South American Jews
About somebody in Borneo
Who heard of a man who claimed to know
Of a swell society female rake
Whose mother-in-law will undertake
To prove that her seventh husband's niece
Has stated in a printed piece
That she has a son that has a friend
That knows when the war is going to end


The Signal Corps authorizes the follow-
ing statement:
Ten thousand machinists, mechanics,
chauffeurs, and other skilled workers are
needed at once by the Aviation Section,
Signal Corps. The present call for 10,000
men is to fill an immediate need and may
•be regarded as the precursor of others as
the service is being built up. Even at that
the actual strength of the service today is
over one hundred times what it was on
April first last year.
The dependence of the Air Service on
the mostly highly skilled men is being
brought out more emphaticaly with every
week of development. Where in the first
rush there was little experience to indicate
this fact, it has since developed that prac-
ticaly 98 men out of every 100 in the service
must be skilled in some branch of work.
Airplane work has been wholly new and
unfamiliar to American mechanics, who
have been taken from other trades and con-
verted hastily into workers on the most
delicate kinds of jobs. It has been neces-
sary for both officers and men to learn very
largely by experience. At the same time a
degree of care and attention not usually
associated with American quantity produc-
tion and methods has been required, as
•great watchfulness is essential to prevent
any plane leaving the ground in imperfect
•condition.
Secretary Baker recently expressed this
situation as follows:
"The great problem now remaining is to
secure the thousands of skilled mechanics,
engine men, motor repair men, wood and
metal workers needed to keep the planes
always in perfect condition. This great
engineering and mechanical force at the
airdromes , flying fields and repair depots,
bnth here and behind the lines in France,
is a vital industrial link in the chain of air
supremacy. Without them the planes
turned out would be useless and the flyers
helpless."
Men registered in the draft may be in-
ducted into this service by applying to their
Local Draft Board. Men not registered
may enlist at any Recruiting Office. Fur-
ther information may be had by applying
to the Air Division, Personal Department,
Washington, D. C. In either case they will
be sent to San Antonio, Texas, for segre-
gation by trades, followed by a brief course
of instruction at the flying fields or at vari-
ous factories and organized into squadrons
mostly for service oversoas.
The present call is especially for:
Machinists.
Auto Mechanics.
Engine Repairmen.
Gunsmiths.
Chauffeurs.
Carpenters.
Blacksmiths.
Tinsmiths.
Cabinetmakers.
Electricians.
Coppersmiths.
Sheetmetal Workers.
Propeller Makers.
Wireless Operators and Constructors.
Tailors.
Tent Makers.
Sail Makers.
Truckmasters.
Vulcanizers.
Welders, and
Makers, repairers and installers of:
Magnetos.
Ignition Systems.
Cameras.
Watches and Clocks.
Instruments and Typewriters.


J. T. DICKINSON, 70, Editor
rpHE first part of the school year of 1917-
.1 18 is now over, and as this magazine
goes to press the second semester is rapidly
getting under way. Very soon all the con-
fusion attending enrollment and getting
started in the new classes will cease and
the old, steady grind will once more com-
mence. Considering all that is happening
in other parts of the world, it seems at
times as though things could not go on here
as smoothly as they do. Of course, some
things are different; new courses are being
offered and the teaching faculty has
changed; also one is constantly reminded
of the fact that a war is going on by the
men everywhere in khaki, but a person must
still study if he wishes to get by a course,
and there are still always some who wish,
when the end of the semester draws near,
that they had studied just a little harder at
the right time.
Many are starting in now firmly resolved
to do better work this semester and not let
this or that subject slide until, along near
the end, they will be unable to make it up.
Along with such feelings and thoughts of
the war one is bound to stop once in a
while and try to determine, in his own
mind, whether or not he is doing his share
towards helping Uncle Sam win this war.
Then also he is apt to consider the part
which this University of Michigan as a.
whole is taking in the war, and if he knows
all she has done and is now doing he cannot
help but have some feeling of pride and go-
about his work with a determination to-
work harder while he is allowed to stay
here and make himself more fit to do his bit
when the time comes.
ENGINEERS' RESERVE CORPS
On December 15, 1917, there was issued
at the office of the Chief of Engineers at
Washington, a set of regulations termed,
"Regulations Governing Enlistment in the
Engineer Branch of the Enlisted Reserve
Corps." These are in the form of an
amendment to the Selective Draft Regula-
tions and are to apply directly to students
of draft age now enrolled in some engineer-
ing school.
It states first, that a proportion of the
students as named by the school faculty,
pursuing an engineering course in one of
the approved technical engineering schools
listed in the war department, may enlist in
the Enlisted Reserve Corps of the En-
gineering department and thereafter, upon
presentation by the registrant to his local
Board of a certificate of enlistment, such
certificate shall be filed with the Question-
Copy intended for publication in this department should be in the hands of the Editor
on or before the following dates:—
For March issue February 12 For October issue October 1
For May issue April 12 For December issue... .November 12
Copy may be mailed, or taken in person, to the offices of The Michigan Technic,
269-271 Engineering Building, Ann Arbor, Mich.
Manuscript, photographs, or other copy will not be returned unless specifically re-
quested.
Ms. should be on 8'A x 11 paper, typewritten, with double space between lines.
Phtographs should be on glossy paper, and mailed flat.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
naire and the registrant shall be placed in
Class V on the ground that he is in the
military service of the United States.
From here it goes on to give the eligi-
bility requirements for enlistment in the
corps, and these may be summed up essen-
lialy as follows:
1. He must be a citizen of the United
States.
2. He must be a student in one of the
selected schools.
3. He must be regularly enrolled and
must be pursuing a course required for
some degree in engineering.
4. He must have made since his entry
upon this course at the school a record of
standing which will indicate clearly that he
may be regarded fairly as deserving a place
among the first third, based primarily upon
the scholastic records of the young men
who have graduated from that institution
during the past ten years.
Besides the above requirements he must
of course also pass the necessary physical
examination.
As may readily be seen, this fourth re-
quirement stated above is going to set a
limit on the number of men who will be ad-
mitted to the corps, and considerable dis-
cussion has arisen as to the practicability
of adding such a requirement. Of course
there must be a line drawn somewhere, for
not all engineering students will ever make
a success as engineers in later life, but it is
a question whether this restriction should
be based primarily upon the scholastic rec-
ords of the students. It has been proved
many times over that the successful prac-
ticing engineers are not always the ones
that made the higher grades while in col-
lege. On the other hand, the statement has
been made, and by competent authorities,
that there are practically as many good en-
gineers, or rather just as many men who
will make good engineers, on the low half
of the scholastic record as there are on the
upper half. The question would then un-
doubtedly be asked, How is one to tell
whether a student will make a good en-
gineer after he graduates? It seems as
though this question could best lie answered
by the instructors who have been in daily
contact with that student for several years
and who know, after such contact, just
about what can be expected from him,
rather than by merely consulting his card
of grades and relying solely upon that.
However, as the regulations now stand
they will undoubtedly help a great deal in
keeping up the supply of engineers which
is needed to carry on this war and will be
needed in the reconstruction work after
the war. What the war department is try-
ing to do in order to carry on this war
successfully is to make use of every man
and to use that man where he is going to
do the most good, so if we need engineers
it should, of course, be seen to that we get
engineers. It has been stated that this war
is an engineers' war, and this statement
seems to be borne out by each new develop-
ment. The Engineers' Reserve Corps will
be similar to any other branch of the army,
for instance, the infantry, except that an
engineer cannot be made as quickly as an
infantryman and because there are no other
places, the enginer must be made in some
one of the present day engineering schools.

CORRESPONDENCE COMMITTEE FOR
MICHIGAN ENGINEERS IN
SERVICE
Every day we hear reports of graduates
of the engineering college going into one
branch or another of service in this great
war. Nearly every day, too, there are men
going directly from the college to enter the
ranks of the service. There are Michigan
engineers in all of the training camps of
this country and a good many are already
at the scene of the battle on the Western
Front. AH of these men have interesting
experiences to tell those who are still in
school trying to prepare in the best way
possible to serve their country. Many
could give us good advice as to the best
courses to pursue here, and what to try for
when we get out. Then, too, many of the
men in service want to know where their
old class-mates are,—in what line of service
and where they can be found.
To supply all these wants is the task
which the Engineering Society, in connec-
tion with The Tech nic, is now bending all
its efforts. A committee known as the Cor-
respondence Committe for Michigan engi-
neers in service has been established, head-
ed by J. H. Sharpe, '18E, as general chair-
man, composed of two men from each of
the four classes of the engineering college
and eight men chosen from the membership
of the Engineering Society at large. Let-
ters have been sent to all alumnae and for-
mer students of classes of the last few
years in an effort to get an accurate list of
all these men who are now in service and
in what capacity they are serving. A card
index is being kept by this committee of all
the reports as they come in and is available
in the society rooms for anyone desiring to
use it. A new bulletin board has been
placed in the society rooms on which are
posted letters and news from the men in
service as they are received by the Com-
mittee or men in the college. All letters
received by the Committee asking for the
address of other Michigan engineers are
answered immediately by some member of
the Committee to the best of his ability.
In this way we are trying to act as the
connecting link between the men in service
and the engineering college, as well as be-
tween the men themselves. To make this
work effective and of the greatest value to
all concerned, the active co-operation of all
Michigan engineers is a necessity. If you
are now in the Service and have not already
sent in information about yourself to this
Committee, do so at once whether you have
received your circular letter yet or not.
Any time we can be of any service to you,,
or when you have some good "dope" for
the boys back at school, we will be more
than glad to hear from you. If you would
like to have The Tech nic sent to you, let
us know about it and we will see to it that
a copy gets to you.
BASKETBALL
Varsity basketball has made its first ap-
pearance at Michigan, and promises to be
popular. Although not as many games
have been won as perhaps we were hoping
would be won, all have nevertheless been
well attended and much enthusiasm has
been shown by both spectators and players.
As regards the games with Conference
teams, we have still to win one, but the
men have shown the Westerners that they
have the same old fighting spirit which has
always characterized Michigan's footbalf
teams and which has always been such »
factor in this University's success in ath-
letics. The scores show that the game?
have not been altogether one-sided and any
person who has attended a game will assure
you that such was not the case.
What the men lack more than anything
else is experience, and although they have
tried to make up for this in "fight," and
in some cases have succeeded, nevertheless
that smooth team work which characterize?


4i
an experienced team is present now only in
streaks. We hope and believe, however,
that the team will soon gain this and are
looking forward to the remaining games on
the schedule with great interest.
N. A. R. U.
A University of Michigan Naval Aux-
iliary Reserve Unit is now being formed
on the campus by L. H. Beach, '18E, as a
result of a request made by Lieut. J. H.
Clark, Assistant Supervisor, U. S. N. R. F.
of Cleveland, Ohio. To date the unit is
composed of ninety members and is fast
approaching the hundred mark. It is not
known as yet whether the number will be
increased beyond the latter, mark.
In order to be eligible for the unit the
men must have been enrolled in some de-
partment on the campus within the last two
years. They must be "energetic and active
and must have completed their education in
mathematics through logarithims and trig-
onometry." Their scholarship is also a
factor which will receive consideration.
The age limit is between twenty and
twenty-six and the physical examination is
the same as that required to get into the
navy. Some departures have been made
from these limits when the applicant
showed unusual qualifications. Those ac-
cepted are immediately given the rating of
Quartermaster, third class.
The Unit will remain here until some
time after the first of April. In the mean-
time their course will not differ materially
from that of the average student. They
are. however, requested to take, if possible,
the new course being offered in navigation.
Upon being called, they will be assigned in
small groups to merchant ships on the
Great Lakes, where they will serve about
eight weeks in various capacities so as to
become thoroughly familiar with general
seamanship. Having successfully com-
pleted this part of the course, they will be
ordered to report to the officer in charge
of the intensive training service at Pelham
Bay Park Naval Training Station, New
York. Here they will pursue a course in
Navigation. Seamanship, Ordnance and Na-
val Regulations, covering a period of eight
weeks. Having completed this, they will be
required to pass a rigid examination on all
subjects. Their weekly marks, together
with the marks made upon the final exam-
ination and their final fitness report cover-
ing this period, will be the governing fac-
tors in their qualifications for duty at sea.
Those having the better grades as deter-
mined above will be given the rank of en-
sign.
K. 0. T. C.
By order of Lieutenant Mullen, there is
now being formed in connection with the
Lieut. L. J. Williams, Retired, P. O. S,,
Adjutant, R. O. T. C, University
of Michigan
Student Cadet Corps a brigade headquar-
ters company. This company is to consist
of the following officers: One first ser-
geant, two color sergeants, battalion ser-
geant majors, two regimental sergeant ma-
jors, eight sergeants, thirty-two privates,
and a band consisting of fifty-six men, in-
cluding drum major sergeant and corporals.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
The fifty-six members of the band will be
divided so as to form two regimental bands
of twenty-six men each.
Positions in the company were open to
all students, including those not taking
military drill as well as the cadets. The
members of the company will be required
to put in considerable time in order to fill
their positions efficiently. Besides infantry
drill and military etiquette, a thorough
course is to be given the officers in ad-
vanced signaling, guard duty, and field
THE BAG BUSH
With the mercury hovering around the
zero mark, and a real nor'wester of a
blizzard howling across the field, the Fresh-
men and the Sophomores fought out the
Bag Rush on Ferry Field Saturday, De-
cember 8. Snow had already fallen to a
depth of about six inches, and it was still
coming, sailing along on the wind at about
forty miles per hour. Regardless of this,
the Freshmen were out four hundred
strong and the Sophomores were repre-
sented with about half this number. A
good-sized crowd of spectators had also
turned out to view the affair.
The Bag Rush was held this year as a
substitute for the Flag Rush, and was,
acording to all reports, entirely successful
as such. It was reported that several feet
were frozen and undoubtedly there were
many coughs and colds contracted, but
these were entirely due to the unusual
weather, which was, in turn, due to the late
scheduling of the affair. If held another
year, as undoubtedly it will be, the game
will take place at the time the Flag Rush
used to be held, that is, about three weeks
after school starts in the fall. This will
provide better weather and make the game
more enjoyable to spectators as well as con-
testants.
The contest itself consists as follows:
Along a field about the size of a football
field, eleven bags are distributed at equal
intervals on a line midway between the
two longer sides. These bags are of cylin-
drical shape, about five feet long and two
feet in diameter. They have heavy canvas
coverings and are filled compactly with
some material which gives each a weight
of about one hundred and thiry pounds.
The contestants line up along opposite sides
of the field, and at the signal each side
rushes out and endeavors to carry, shove,
or pull the bags back over their own goal.
The game is divided into halves, and at the
end of the final half each bag is located
and its position noted with respect to the
goal lines and the center line. Each bag
back of the goal line counts, for the side
carrying it there, two points, and each bag
displaced from center but not over the line,
one point. The Freshmen won the event
this year with a score of nine points, as
compared with the four made by the Sopho-
mores. It can not be said that this result
was due to superior numbers of the Fresh-
men, for they were divided up and but half
used each half of the contest. There was,
however, some advantage in this division,
in that the Freshmen started out with
fresh men at the beginning of each half,
while the same Sophomores worked
through both parts. This slight advantage
can not, however, be considered as having
any real effect on the final score, which was
certainly quite decisive.
NO J-HOP THIS 1EAR
It has finally been decided that there
would be no J-Hop held at Michigan this
year. The final vote which abolished the
event was taken by the committee in charge
on the afternoon of January 14, and was
unanimous. This decision came, however,
only after several changes of opinion on
the part of members of the committee, and
an unlimited amount of discussion.
The Hop committee first met on Thurs-
day, the tenth of January, but took no vote
concerning the holding of the event pend-
ing the action of the Junior Engineers, who
were to meet next day. The following day
the J-Engineers passed a resolution asking
for the complete abandonment of the social
event. This was the first real action to be
taken by any body of the Junior class, and
although it seemed drastic to some, it was


43
welcomed as an idea, at least, of what was
desired by the students themselves.
The committe held another meeting soon
after this assembly of Engineers, and after
a lengthy discussion, voted to hold a formal
J-Hop. Several war measures were to be
adopted, such as cutting down on the dec-
orations and music, but the affair was still
to be formal. When the announcement of
this decision came out in The Daily, and
known to the Campus in general, consider-
able agitation was aroused, and it finally
turned out that even this decision was not
final. The Senate Council had still to
give its consent.
The Student Council held a business
meeting Sunday, the fourteenth, and among
other things done was the passing of two
resolutions pertaining to the Hop. The
first of these was addressed to the Senate
Council, asking this body to refuse any pe-
tition of the Juniors to hold a formal party,
or any party with the name J-HOP. The
other was a set of resolutions to the third-
year men asking them to withdraw any
petition they may have made for a Hop
and to give up any plan already started.
This soon had an effect, for next day the
Hop committee met to reconsider the ques-
tion. Interviews had been held with sev-
eral prominent faculty members, and the
committeemen came together this time with
a clearer idea of the question to be con-
sidered. After but a short discussion, a
vote was taken which turned out to be
unanimous for the abandonment of the
Hop for this year.
This result expresses without doubt the
general mind of the Campus, and is per-
haps the only result which would turn out
satisfactorily to all concerned. Consider-
able interest has been taken in the question
by the whole state, and the general senti-
ment seemed to be that the old, expensive
Hop should be done away with.
ARMY STORES COURSE CHANGED
The preparatory course for men desiring
to enter the Enlisted Personnel of the Ord-
nance Department has undergone some
changes since the last class was graduated.
The course is now termed the "Ordnance
Training School," instead of the "Army
Stores Course," and is limited to the teach-
ing of the ordnance course alone. The
Quartermaster and Ordnance courses were
very similar. Since a graduate of the Ord-
nance course is practically qualified to fill
either a Quartermaster or Ordnance posi-
tion, it was decided that but the one would
be taught.
A change has also been made relative to
the position of the men while they are here
studying. Formerly when a man applied
for entrance to the course, he was admitted
if he had had sufficient business training.
If upon completion of the training he still
desired to enter that department of the
army, he had to enlist. At that time he was
given a physical examination, and perhaps
refused admittance because of some physi-
cal defect. In such a case the only thing
left for him to do if he still desired to get
into the army was to go into some branch
where the physical requirements were not
so high. It might be stated here that minor
defects such as flat feet, underweight, and
missing finger will not keep a man out if
he be up to requirements otherwise.
The new arrangement eliminates the
chance of any such thing happening as
above, inasmuch as now each man must
actually be sworn into the service before he
starts the course. If the applicant be of
draft age, he must pass the physical exam-
ination of his own draft board, and upon
passing this he will be furloughed to Ann
Arbor for six weeks to take the course. If
below twenty-one or above thirty-one years
of age, he must enlist before starting.
Thus, all of the men are actually in the
army before they begin their work here at
Ann Arbor, this place being merely the
point of mobilization.
The fact that the men are subject to army
orders while taking the course has lead to
some further changes in their actions while
here. They all have their meals together
now at the Union, and each man must re-
port there three times a day. No man may
leave town without a permit, and a careful
record is kept of each man's tardiness and


THE MICHIGAN TBCHNIC
absences. This record is to be sent in to
Washington and kept there as that man's
official record.
NEW COURSES OFFERED
Ballistics
The Department of Mathematics offered
for the semester beginning February II a
new course to be termed Ballistics, or
Mathematics 74. This course deals with
the characteristics of modern guns and pro-
jectiles, the problems involved in the the-
oretical and experimental study of the flight
of projectiles, and the calculation and use
of range tables. The object of the course
is to give students intending to enter mili-
tary or naval service an acquaintance with
the methods used and the problems arising
in the handling of guns of all sizes.
Navigation
Also, beginning with the second semester,
a new course in navigation was offered by
the Department of Astronomy. This
course is known as Astronomy 22 and was
planned primarily to enable students who
are interested in nautical service to prepare
themselves in navigation as a part of their
college work.
The course includes the principles of
Piloting, Dead Reckoning, and Nautical
Astronomy, with appropriate observatory
practice; also the rules of the road at sea,
principles of general seamanship, and sig-
nalling according to the International code.
For the benefit of those enrolled in the
Naval Reserves especial stress is being laid
on the subjects under navigation covered
in the Reserve Officers' Training Camps in
preparation for Ensigns' examinations.
Consideration is also being given to the
additional topics included in the curricula
of the Free Navigation Schools of the
United States Shipping Board.
1918 OPERA
For the first time in the history of the
event, women are to be allowed to take
part in the Union Opera. The 1918 opera.
"Let's Go," contains six or eight feminine
parts, besides twelve women in the chorus,
and these parts are to be filled by Univer-
sity women.
The call was made this year as usual for
men tryouts for all parts of the opera,
and after the men who turned out had
been tested, it was found that they would
offer insufficient material with which to
put on the play successfully. Accordingly,
after due consideration, the Union present-
ed a petition to the Senate committee on
student affairs asking that women be al-
lowed to take the feminine roles in the
1918 opera. The Senate committe granted
the petition, with two provisions, which re-
quired merely that parental permission be
obtained by each woman, and that each
be a regularly enrolled student in the Uni-
versity.
It is said that the scarcity of men capable
of taking the parts in this year's opera is
due to the large "number of prospective
actors who have recently entered the serv-
ice. The practice of allowing women to
take part in the opera will, then, probably
extend only for the duration of the war,
after which men will again assume all roles.
CHANGE IN TIME
When school was started last fall all
classes were called one-half hour earlier
than formerly in order to make use of the
afternoon sunlight for military drill. This
system was continued until the Christmas
holidays, when it was decided that a still
more advanced time schedule was necessary
in order to provide the required daylight.
Accordingly, the change was made from
Central to Eastern time, and beginning
January first, classes were started at the
usual time of eight in the morning and
one in the afternoon. Thus the University
is now running on the same schedule as
last year, except that, compared to sun
time, wc are one hour ahead of last year.
This provides the necessary light for drill
and ought also to make a considerable sav-
ing in electricity, which leads directly to a
saving of coal.
The city officials of Ann Arbor also
considered the question of adopting East-
ern time, but finally came to the conclusion


45
not to do that. .There are, then, at present
"two times" in Ann Arbor, which fact may
be considered advantageous or the opposite,
as you please. One bright Lit. has decided
that the advantage is all with the two times,
for he says that you can now call on a girl
by one time and leave by the other time,
which certainly is practical if you use them
in the right order.
In closing he advised every student:
"Stick to your education first and finish
your course in the University. Your coun-
try will need you a great deal more later on
than it does at the present time."
LECTURE ON CANTONMENTS
Before a large audience in the audi-
torium of the Natural Science building,
Major Starrett, '99E, on Thursday, January
10, gave a lecture concerning the building
of the sixteen National Army cantonments.
Major Starrett described the workings of
the different war divisions of the govern-
ment and explained the problems confront-
ing each division. "The cantonment di-
vision is now considering some of the
largest problems of the government," he
stated. "The storage and terminal problem
deals with the erection of six vast termi-
nals covering four hundred acres of land.
Three of these terminals will be accumula-
tion depots which will be situated through-
out the country. All of the buildings will
be of a permanent nature."
"The whole trouble lies at the terminals,
and it is my personal opinion concerning
the taking over of the railroads that the
government will put the terminals in
shape."
Major Starrett described the conditions
at some of the larger shipbuilding centers
and outlined the work being done at each.
At Hog Island a city is being built in a
swamp, which is to be populated by one
hundred and twenty-five thousand people.
All camps under construction are modern in
every respect, possessing streets, a complete
water system, a fire fighting force, electric
lights, a cold storage plant, sanitary sys-
tems, and amusement centers where the
men can congregate. The construction of
the cantonments, in each of which there
are about twelve thousand buildings, con-
sumed a little less than one-tenth of the
entire annual wood supply of the United
States.
FINAL EXAMS
The final examinations in the Engineer-
ing Department for the semester just ended
were conducted somewhat differently than
they have been formerly. Instead of de-
voting the usual two weeks to finals, it was
decided by a special committee of the fac-
ulty that there would be no such period of
time allotted for the purpose of holding
exams, and that the question of holding
any finals at all would be entirely up to
each department. Regular classes were
held during the final two weeks right up to
last Thursday, and any examinations given
took place in the regular class periods. In
many cases this merely resulted in the hold-
ing of a large number of short exams in
place of the one longer one, and although
there may be some advantage in this, it
seems difficult to make it out.
A. S. H. AND Y. E.
The American Association of Heating
and Ventilating Engineers held its twenty-
fourth annual meeting on January 22, 23,
24, in the Engineering Society Building,
New York City. The meeting consisted of
six sessions, in each one of which some
question relating to the heating art was
discussed.
As a part of the first session a paper was
read on the topic, "What We Do and Don't
Know About Heating." This paper was
prepared by J. R. Allen, formerly Professor
of Mechanical Engineering in this Univer-
sity and now Dean of Engineering at the
University of Minnesota.
J. E. Emswiler, Associate Professor of
Mechanical Engineering in this University,
contributed a paper which was read as a
part of the sixth and last session. The
topic of this paper was "Measurements of
Low-Pressure Steam Used for Heating the
Buildings of the University of Michigan."


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
ENGINEERING SOCIETY.
The General Society.
The rooms of the Engineering Society up
over the Arch are getting more popular all
the time. Between classes and during va-
cant hours the members find it a fine place
to come for a smoke and a little recreation.
The latest newspapers and magazines that
are always on the table ,and the fine view
which the big windows give along the diag-
onal walk afford the members plenty of
diversion.
Just after Christmas vacation a dance
was given by the society at the Union.
Very attractive programs were arranged
for the occasion and Ike Fischer furnished
some of his famous "Jazz" music. Punch
was served during the evening. D. M.
Springer, '19E, was chairman of the party
and Prof, and Mrs. L. M. Gram were the
chaperones. Another party is planned to
take place just before spring vacation.
During the course of the second semester
a series of lectures on different phases of
engineering will be given under the aus-
pices of the general society. The object
of these lectures is to bring the men of
the different departments of the college in
closer touch with each other and make each
man better acquainted with lines of engi-
neering other than his own. The first lec-
ture of this series was to be one by Mr. W.
C. Wright of the National Founders' Asso-
ciation, who was to show us a few reels of
films on the subject of "Methods of Mod-
ern Foundry Practice." Due to the Uni-
versity ruling that all Campus buildings
be closed at six o'clock every night for
about a month to aid in national plan for
coal conservation, it was necessary to can-
cel this engagement for the present, but it
is hoped that arrangements can be made to
have the films shown here at some later
date. The next number of the series will
be an Exchange Lecture by Dean C. H.
Benjamin, of Purdue University, on the
subject of "The Evolution of Machine and
Engine Frames or Bodies," on March 6th.
Among the other numbers of the series
will be an illustrated talk on "Concrete
Ships and Barges," and seyeral other in-
teresting talks on live engineering subjects.
One of the largest projects which the
General Society has undertaken is the in-
auguration of the Correspondence Commit-
tee for Michigan Engineers in Service.
Several notes on this committee are to be
found elsewhere in this issue.
Branch Societies,
civil.
Before the Christmas holidays the Civils
met for a short business meeting and a
smoker. The evening was featured by a
very interesting talk by City Engineer
Manly Osgood and music by the Camp
Davis orchestra, assisted by three-fourths
of the "Riggsville Quartet." The Camp
Davis boys also put on a scene of camp life
at the Michigan Union Spot Light Vaude-
ville and subjected the audience to a sample
of the good, old-fashioned camp song-fest.
At present the Civil Branch is chiefly
composed of Seniors, but would like to take
this opportunity to urge men of all classes
having intentions of taking work in the
Civil department to sign up at the desk in
the Society rooms and take an active inter-
est in this branch as well as in the general
society.
CHEMICAL.
The Chemical Branch has had several
good smokers during the past few months,
at which there have been some very inter-
esting talks by members of the faculty and
student body as well as a few outside lec-
turers. At the last meeting an especially
interesting talk was given by "Fritz"
Thieme, '18E, on some of his experiences
while with one of the American Ambulance
Units in France. Fritz just returned from
France a couple of months ago and has
some wonderfully interesting tales to tell
about the life over there.
a. 1. E. E.
The year opened with about 25 of the
old members back in school, and since then
18 new members have been taken in. The
following meetings have been held this year
under the auspices of the organization. On
October 17th Professors Parker and Can-


47
non addressed the meeting. Prof. Parker
spoke about the opportunities offered in the
engineering field, and Prof. Cannon talked
on the relation of the student to the A. I.
E. E. At the next meeting Prof. B. F.
Bailey talked on the "Manufacture of Elec-
tric Machines," laying particular stress on
the economics involved. On December 7th
Mr. E. E. Kearns, of the General Electric
Company, gave an illustrated lecture on
"The Induction Motor." Following the
lecture a moving picture entitled "The King
of the Rails" was shown, illustrating the
development of transportation from the
beginning through the electrification of rail-
roads. A joint meeting of the Detroit-Ann
Arbor and University Branch was held on
January 18th. Dr. Luckiesh, physicist of
the Wela Research Laboratory, Cleveland,
presented a very instructive and entertain-
ing lecture on "The Lighting Art: Its Prac-
tice and Possibilities." Dr. Luckiesh is an
authority on this subject and has distin-
guished himself nationally as the author of
several unique books on shade and shadow
and color effects in lighting, besides numer-
ous articles on the subject of school light-
ing and allied topics.
The fourth meeting of the season was
held in the Detroit Board of Commerce
building, Friday, December 14. The
speaker for the occasion was Mr. Alex.
Dow, president and general manager of the
Detroit Edison company, and his subject
was "Capital for Public Utilities, It's Na-
ture and Cost." The topic was timely and
the talk as given by Mr. Dow proved to be
very interesting and instructive.
On February 8 the fifth meeting was
held, also at the Detroit Board of Com-
merce building. Mr. F. R. Temple, of the
Michigan State Telephone company, gave
a talk on telephone engineering.
A. S. M. E.
At the last meeting of the Society a very
instructive talk was given by Prof. R. S.
Hawley on "The Problems of the Mechan-
ical Engineer in the Mine." The chairman
of the A. S. M. E., William McKinley, '18E,
left school to go into the officers' training
camp at Custer a couple of months ago,
and a new election of officers is just about
to take place as we go to press.
RESEARCH
There is a great deal of research work
being carried on in the different depart-
ments at the present time which cannot,
because of its unusual character, be put
before the public. Many government prob-
lems, pertaining to the war, are being
worked out and although much of this is as
yet uncompleted, all departments report the
work as progressing satisfactorily.
CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
The research work in the Chemical En-
gineering department has suffered because
of the many changes in the staff during the
year and the various war problems that
have been attempted have consequently not
succeeded as well as might have been ex-
pected. So far as the time of the staff and
the students was not occupied with these
war problems, the usual type of research
has been carried on.
Dr. Holley has been directing the work
of Mr. Y. S. Chen on a problem relating
to the effect of different types of pigments
on the properties of the resulting paint.
Under Prof. Badger's direction a study
of aluminum alloys was begun, with the
idea of trying to improve the metals used
for aeroplane construction. A. E. Barton,
H. Rye, E. C. Fries, and A. F. Wendler
have been engaged on this work, with the
assistance of the whole of the Metallurgi-
cal department. The work has given prom-
ise of results, but so far has not yielded
anything definite enough to warrant de-
scribing it in detail. Mr. Fries also car-
ried out some tests with a new pipe cover-
ing material as compared to standard
makes, and did some work on water-proof-
ing it.
The Metallurgical work of the depart-
ment has been strictly along lines of in-
terest to various branches of the War de-
partment. Besides the work on Aluminum


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
mentioned above, Prof. Wood, Mr. Archer,
and Mr. Smart have been working on the
annealing of steel castings, and preparing
for a piece of work which the ordnance
department has in prospect. The work on
steel castings was done at the suggestion
of the Detroit Steel Castings Co., who
were casting shell blanks. The work was
quite successful and a report is in prep-
aration. Later the Ordnance Department
asked if this department could undertake
a study to determine the relative value of
different methods for forging shell blanks.
The work will involve a very extensive
series of metallographic examinations as
well as physical tests. The forgings arc
now being made and are expected soon
for the examination. Mr. Nethaway, the
holder of the Detroit Copper and Brass
Rolling Mills Fellowship, has been work-
ing on the composition for metal for shell
bands.
Under Prof. Brier, some very interesting
dye problems were started. Mr. McGee
and Mr. Wilson were both engaged on
work of this kind, and both were having
very good success, developing dyes of ex-
cellent quality by processes that promised
high yields at little costs. It became nec-
essary to shift both of these men to an-
other problem, that of optical glass.
The preparation of optical glass is a war
problem of great importance. It is needed
both for camera lenses for aeroplanes, for
field glasses for officers and for submarine
periscopes. For all these uses, but particu-
larly the last, it is essential that the glass
have a very low absorptive power. Glass
as good as German optical glass has not
yet been made in this country, and it
seems to be a question of getting a glass
free from even the most minute traces of
iron. The Geographical Laboratory and the
Bureau of Standards arc working on this
problem, and have succeeded in getting
materials for the glass that arc free from
iron. However the only clays available in
this country for making the pots in which
the glass is melted, are quite high in iron.
A method was suggested by a member of
the staff of the Geophysical Laboratory
which removed the iron, but destroyed the
plasticity of the clay; and glass pot clay
must be plastic. Dr. Laird had done some
work indicating that he might be able to
restore plasticity to a clay which had be-
come non-plastic. This work was brought
to the attention of a member of the Geo-
physical Laboratory's staff, who arranged
to have the whole problem referred to this
department. Prof. Brier has charge of the
removal of the iron, and Dr. Laird of re-
developing the plasticity. Prof. Brier has
been assisted by Mr. McGee, Mr. Schoon,
and Mr. Snow. Dr. Laird has been assist-
ed by Mr. Geller, who leaves February 1st
for the Bureau of Standards in Pitts-
burgh to continue this work in the Bu-
reau's ceramics laboratory. Dr. Laird, as-
sisted by Mr. White and A. W. Laird, has
also been working on a problem referred
to him by Prof, (now Lieut.-Col.) A. H.
White. This has to do with the fixation
of Nitrogen from the air, the work for
which Lieut.-Col. White was called to
Washington at the beginning of the war.
In addition to assisting in all the metal-
lurgical research, Mr. Smart has been di-
recting the work of Mr. Kronbach, who
has been working on the reduction of a
technical filtering medium composed of car-
bon.
Mr. Parker has been carrying out a re-
search on the production of technical am-
monium bromide and the utilization of
waste ferric oxide from the manufacture
of sodium bromide. He has also been di-
recting the work of Mr. Y. C. Chen on the
use of lime or strontium oxide for re-
moving sugar from molasses.
RESEARCH IN PHYSICS
The Absorption- and Reflection of Radia-
tion by Pyrex Glass.
IV. W. Sleator and Helen L. Nicholson.
Pyrex glass, of which both laboratory
and domestic glass-ware are now being
made, has remarkable thermal properties
which, together with its mechanical
strength, account for its value. The mak-
ers of Pyrex are interested in knowing its
transparency for light of different colors.
Since the radiation involved in ordinary


49
heating lies in the infra-red part of the
spectrum it is desired to measure the ab-
sorption coefficient of the glass for wave-
lengths between 0.0007 m.m.— the visible
red—and 0.012 m.m. Within this region
most glass ceases to be transparent, as it
is in the visible spectrum, and becomes
nearly opaque.
Work on this problem requires a spec-
trometer in which the usual lenses are re-
placed by metallic mirrors, and the glass
prism by one of rock salt or quartz. The
usual eye-piece is replaced by a thermopile
which, with a galvanometer, constitutes the
detector. By interchanging thick and thin
pieces of glass in the path of the light it
will be possible to measure the absorption,
independently of the reflecting power, for
the different wave-lengths of the radiation
spectrum. By inclosing the samples of
glass in an oven it will be possible to
measure the effect on the transparency of
the temperature of the glass itself. Appro-
priate modification of the arrangements
will permit a similar study of the spectral
reflecting power. Apparatus for the prob-
lem is now being assembled, and the work
will probably be continued throughout the
semester. The makers of Pyrex glass are
The Corning Glass Works ,of Corning,
Xew York.
MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
In the December Tf.chxic. attention was
directed in these notes, to a little experi-
ment which was then about to be under-
taken, to ascertain whether or not it is
necessary to lubricate the steam spaces
of a steam engine. It may be recalled that
this investigation was to be carried out on
the Lansing engine by first operating the
engine continuously under a constant brake
load and steam pressure for 24 hours, with
cylinder oil fed at a regular and normal
rate. The cylinder oil was then to be cut
off entirely, and, without stopping, the en-
gine was to be operated for another 24
hours under exactly the same load and
pressure, unless the absence of oil should
appear to be harmful to the engine. Indi-
cator diagrams were to be taken at regu-
lar intervals.
The program as outlined was carried out
satisfactorily. The indicator diagrams
were planimetered as soon as they were
removed from the indicator, and the areas
plotted against time of duration of the
test. Since brake horse power was held
constant, any rise or fall of the curve
drawn through the points indicated a vari-
ation in friction horse power.
As the test progressed, after the oil was
cut oft the growth of this curve was watch-
ed with great interest. But, outside of lo-
cal fluctuations, the section of the curve
for the second 24 hours lay on almost ex-
actly the same level as that of the section
for the first 24 hours. In fact, the aver-
ages of the two were within less than 1%
of being the same.
That no observable increase of friction
followed the discontinuance of the cylinder
oil feed, is an interesting- and important
fact. In order that it may be considered
properly, attention is directed to the con-
ditions of the test.
The engine is 8 x 10 in size, horizontal
style.
The valve is of the four-ported flat type,
with pressure plate.
The steam pressure was 100 lbs.
The quality of the steam entering the
engine was 98.5"/'.
The engine ran at 220 R.P.M.
The exhaust pressure was atmospheric.
The engine is an old one, and has al-
ways had lubrication.
On the completion of the test described
above, it was planned to conduct a similar
investigation on a Corliss engine. This in-
vestigation had to be given up for the
present owing to the fact that Mr. McKin-
ley, who was conducting the experiments,
was called into service. In fact, so many
of our men have left school to go into
the military or naval service, that it is
probable that little if any research work
can be carried on in the mechanical labor-
atory during the second semester.

MICHIGAN'S COLLEGE OF ARCHITEC-
TURE
T NDICATIVE of its progress during the
last eleven consecutive years of its es-
tablishment, and of the present status in
the teaching of Architecture, the College of
Architecture of the University of Michi-
gan presents an illustrated bulletin of class
work for the information of those who are
inclined to adopt the architectural profes-
sion as a life work. That this announce-
ment is direct, dignified, and definite, and
of typographical excellence, is in itself,
symbolical of Michigan's architectural
school.
Before the coming of Prof. Lorch, Wil-
liam Le Baron Jenny was teaching archi-
tecture and engineering at Ann Arbor, a
work which was probably terminated by
the demand for his services in practice, oc-
casioned by the Chicago fire. That was
twelve years ago.
It was with the advent of Emil Lorch,
as its head in Architecture, that this Col-
lege began to advance, and upon definite,
practical, and in many ways, different lines
from its contemporaries. The influence of
Prof. Lorch in this department is illustrat-
ed in this Bulletin.— (From The Western
Architect for October.)
tecture of Journalism, at Alumni Memorial
Hall. This talk was exceedingly interest-
ing to students of Architecture as well as
students of Journalism. Mr. Booth is an
excellent speaker, and dealt with his sub-
ject in a very convincing style.
At a meeting held January fifteenth, the
Architectural class of 1920 elected the fol-
lowing officers: President, J. Page; vice-
president, Harry Halgren; secretary, J. R.
Field; treasurer, E. G. Jehle; sergeant-at-
arms, S. Hopkins.
The Architectural Society has had all of
the best work done by students in design,
photographed. The prints of these pro-
jects are obtainable from R. G. Larke, irr
the Junior drafting room.
On January 11, 1918, George G. Booth,

Preparations are being made for another
exhibition of lithographs, oil-paintings, and

NOTICE ALUMNI
"D ECENTLY Dean Cooley received a let-
ter from the Chief of Ordnance, Ord-
nance Department of the War Department,
urgently asking for men with mechanical
and technical training to fill capably im-
portant positions in the various ordnance
establishments. This need is so vital and
pressing that we have been requested to
put it before our Alumni. As the Ord-
nance Department is charged with the
great responsibility of supplying all muni-
tions for our soldiers, anything that you
can do to assist in obtaining the required
quota of employes will be in the nature of
a distinct contribution toward bringing
about a speedy and successful conclusion
of the war. For information, write to the

AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
CLUB OF CLEVELAND
The recent exhibit of the University of
Michigan Club of Cleveland at the city
club there in competition with twenty-seven
other colleges and universities throughout
the country brought together perhaps the
most interesting ^collection of old Ann Ar-

Cleveland. Old class reunion pictures,
football pictures, pictures of the library,
photographs of all decades and many other
interesting things were there to bring back
as nothing else the memory of old Antt
Arbor.
Outside of the exhibit the club is very ac-
tive otherwise. Regular luncheons for all
Michigan men are held every Monday noon,
at the City Club, Hollenden Hotel, and ev-
ery Michigan man who goes to Cleveland
should go up and get acquainted and inci-
dentally get a good meal. Take note of
this and remember the next time you are
in the city.
The activities of the Club now include
the publishing of a bulletin, as the occa-
sion demands, at the office of the Secretary,
764 Hippodrome Annex. It is a mighty
interesting paper containing campus, alum-
ni and other notes, also the club's own
doings. Among the officers of the club-
are three engineers, Jess T. Caldwell, '13.
who is vice-president; J. H. Herron, '09,
and J. H. Dietz, '96, on the board of di-
rectors.

ceri "Ha
WOULD NOT LET GO.
Mike was working on the clocks, carry-
ing large boxes onto the boats. Finally
he was instructed to bring on a large an-
chor. The gang plank broke as he was
crossing and Mike went under. He came
to the surface and called, "Help, help."
Then he went under the second time. On
coming to the surface he yelled, "Help,
.help." Again he went under, and when he
came up the third time he screamed, "Help,
help, or I'll drop the anchor."
JUST MISTAKENED.
Coed (watching a Senior Engineer across
the table from her eat with his knife):
Are you taking a course in sword-swallow-
ing?
Senior Eng.: No, Madame. I am only
trying to peel my Adam's apple.


ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
Dear Editor: Could you tell me the cor-
rect way to pronounce evening-dress?
Answer: With emphasis on the
eve.
Dear Editor: Why can't the navy report
how many submarines have been sunk?
Answer: They can't spare enough divers
to walk about the bottom of the sea and
count them.
"How is your sick husband?"
"Oh! He isn't very good and I discov-
ered last night that he is color-blind."
"Tell me about it."
"He got delirious and talked about his
little girl with blond hair."
"What makes you think he is color-
blind?"
"Why, my hair is black." Prosh.
The student who thought a procrasti-
nator was a thing to make coffee in would
probably have to be told that a radiator was
not the driver of an airship.
A MILITARY BLUNDER.
"What is this waiter?"
"War bread, sir."
"Hang it! It's too old entirely for ac-
tive service."

ESSAYONS.
(Air: "Dixie")
I.
They are calling loudly for the Engineers:
"Get out in front and take the brunt,
Pioneers, pioneers, pioneers, Engineers!"
There's a job out yonder where the front
line veers—
A mining stunt,, a searchlight shunt,
Pioneers, pioneers, pioneers, Engineers!
CHORUS.
Then let's go out and DO IT,
For we—know how;
'Mid shot and shell we'll work like hell—
We'll do that job, and do it well;
Ho, es-say-ons! Ho, es-say-ons!
We arc the Engineers!
II.
There's a hell-swept corner out in No.-
Man's Land—
A hell on earth, where life is worth
'Bout a dime, just a dime, yes a dime,
Engineers;
And they want one company with lots o'
sand
To face that fire and string barbed wire
In time, quick time, double time, Engi-
neers.
CHORUS: (Fortissimo)
.—Wisconsin Engineer.
Editor's Note: The motto of the Corps
of Engineers is the French word "Essay-
ons" (Let us try). It forms part of the
design on the buttons on the uniforms of
the engineers.
HE KNEW.
Tommy (dictating letter to be sent to his
wife): The nurses here are a very plain
lot.
Nurse: Oh, come, I say. That's not
very polite to us.
Tommy: Never mind, nurse, put it
down. It'll please her.
0—50.
Clerk—This book will do half your
work."

Electricity has leveled out the
Continental Divide
HIGH among the bald peaks of the Montana
Rockies, 6,000 feet above the sea, the high-
speed, smokeless passenger trains and record-
tonnage freight trains of the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp;
St. Paul wind their way up and over the Conti-
nental Divide, under electric power. These trains
cross four hundred miles of the same mountain
ranges that years before meant weeks of perilous
travel to hor:eman or prririe schooner; over the
same tracks where a few months before giant steam
locomotives had faltered on the up-grades and
heated their brakes to redness while descending.
Half a hundred G-E electric locomotives are daily climb-
ing the Continental Divide, making faster time than their
steam predecessors, hauling heavier loads, and by means
of regenerative electric braking on the down-grades are re-
turning power to the wires, effecting vast economics. Con-
servation of approximately half a million tons of coal a
year is one of the epoch-making results.
Immune to the biting cold that freezes motion from steam
locomotives, freed from carrying tons of fuel and water, the
trans-continental electric locomotive is now a 3.000 horse
power reality—another General Electric Company achieve-
ment.

plants. If plants were equipped to burn whatever fuel is least desirable for
other purposes it would prove a great saving. This—the ability to burn any
fuel—is the big feature of
The MURPHY STOKER was the first scientifically right stoker. Burns all
of the gases—it eliminates all smoke waste.
No forced draft is required. On natural draft it will force the boilers up to
200% of their rating.
The MURPHY STOKER feeds the coal and removes the ashes automatically.
It can be adjusted while in operation.
Twenty-five years of unqualified
success proved that the Murphy
principle is correct.

Doorway to the Chapel of the Chateau, Amboise, France


JOHN C. PARKER, PROFESSOR OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
WHEN this present agony is pass-
ed we shall all find ourselves
in a different world, a world objec-
tively much the same as before but a
world converted to a new spirit and
to a different philosophy of social val-
ues. Not a small part in the new life
may be taken by the engineer if only
he will.
We are in a struggle for democ-
racy and naturally the minds of men
are turned as never before toward all
those problems of political, social and
economic democracy which lie ljeneath
the rights of peoples to govern them-
selves. When wc have determined in
the contest in arms that government
shall not be imposed upon one people
by another we are bound to give more
attention to the internal personal and
individual relations of men in the so-
cial groups.
These things will happen whether
we like them or not and it will not suf-
fice that I stand aloof and damn the
British labor program on the one hand
or capitalism on the other. It were far
better that I do my best to assure as
best I can a sane leadership and wise
direction of those things which nolens
volens are coming.
Already wc hear premonitory rum-
blings which show that the social ma-
chine is not in mesh. Perhaps the most
outstanding evidence of maladjust-
ment has been the irresponsibility
shown by labor in a time of social
stress. The nation has needed ships
and munitions and the call has been
answered by strikes and threats of
strikes; transportation has called for
extra devotion and some leaders have
seized the emergency as an opportu-
nity for securing their demands for a
greater share in the profits; the coun-
try has needed restraint in the con-
sumption of foods and the workmen
have eaten more because they had, for
once, wage fixed by themselves.
The writer must confess that ini-
tially all this was most disheartening
to him. He lamented that from our
Israel had departed our chiefest glory
—the glory of a plain manhood of
consecrated working men whose sense
of national devotion was greater than
class interest or selfish desire. He ex-
pressed some such idea in a conversa-
tion and was told that the condition
was not new—that sacrifice had al-
ways been made by the educated, the
cultured and the well to do. Of course,
such an idea was repugnant and was
at once repudiated but more thought-
ful consideration shows that it was es-
sentially right, that in all the great
sacrificial acts of history voluntary
dedication has been by the somewhat
privileged classes, not by those in the
lower stages of economic wellbeing.
Always, back of sacrifice has been a
sense of "nobless oblige."
Not always has the aristocracy of
abnegation been parallel to great
wealth or to exalted station, but, gen-
erally speaking, there has been a meas-


THE MICHIGAN TECHN1C
ure of financial comfort and at least a
stable social status as the background
of self-giving.
When the writer had satisfied him-
self of the facts he confronted another
consideration. In his acquaintance he
numbers men of many kinds, some of
very great wealth, some near the point
of abject poverty; some of distin-
guished position and of as distinguish-
ed ancestory, others in humble places
and of no antecedents whatsoever,
There has never been evident any in-
trinsic superiority in one group over
the other but, rather, men of humble
origin, inconspicuous in the social or-
der and perhaps ill supplied with this
world's goods, have quite as often as
not, demonstrated an innate bigness of
soul sometimes lacking in those who
have had greater opportunity.
Why then have service and sacrifice
seemed to be a class privilege? Is there
something which warps or hampers
the group devotion in spite of the indi-
vidual idealism and which may in time
react unfavorably on the individual?
Granted an initial fineness we can ac-
count for effective failure only by a
theory of adverse environment.
What is the environment of the
average wage earner; is it such as to
help or such as to stifle national, civic
or social devotion?
To one who- has ever been a unit in
a great industrial organization there
can be but one answer and that not of
the most pleasant.
Modern efficiency in production has
resulted in an intense specialization of
function. This specialization has, it is
true, been accompanied by higher
wage, by equally specialized and equal-
ly efficient sanitation, rest rooms,
safety devices, service annuities, rec-
reation facilities and "welfare work!"
All of these things have evidently
made for the advantage of the work-
men obviously and of course. Why
then is the fellow ungrateful, why has
he no sense of duty, why has he so
little magnanimity, so little patriot-
ism?
One wonders if it is because the
thing is a bit too efficient, a bit too sys-
tematic, just a shade Teutonic in its
cold perfection, quite a bit impersonal.
"No man cometh unto the Father
but through me," "If ye had known
me, ye had known the Father" — if
you know men, you can understand
God. This is good psychology and
sound sociology. No man can keep,
much less create, devotion to the big
and to the remote if he has not op-
portunity to feel an attachment to the
small and to the immediate. A man
can not become a patriot in a boarding
house. Devotion to country starts with
devotion to home. A man cannot feel
love of country if he is cold to the
job at which he spends the major por-
tion of his working hours. The capac-
ity for devotion grows with the proc-
ess. Here then are the starting points
for patriotic zeal—the home and the
job.
The home is the woman's job —
with it we have not direct concern.
With the job we are intimately con-
cerned.
I am sure that my own loyalty to
my employers in the past, as to Mich-
igan today, comes from but one thing
— the fact that I have always been
privileged to be a part of any organi-
zation in which I have worked. Al-
ways it has been possible for me, as
for all professional men, to influence
in some measure the philosophy and
the ideals of my institution and to see
some personal rewards for my indi-
vidual efforts. This personal relation


73
to one's work and to the institution is
hot given to the manual worker or to
the routine clerk.
However wrong may be the eco-
nomic unrest, the future must reckon
with it and cure it if we will have a
country. It is not enough to say that
some men are foolish and some bad.
Grant all that and yet we must ask
why some are bad and some fools.
Here is the big citizen-making op-
portunity for the engineer. His place
is in industry, he works for efficiency,
he understands the value of system.
He has intrusted to him on the one
hand the property interests of his em-
ployer, on the other the direction of
labor. If he has vision, he will see that
his efficiency does not destroy the spir-
it of the worker, that system does not
stifle loyalty, that earnings are not
glorified to their own defeat through
killing the esprit de corps. Because he
has faith in the identity of the finan-
cial interests of his employer with the
happiness of the employee he will in-
dividualize the labor of each man un-
der him and will select such subordin-
ates that no sterile mechanical "wel-
fare system" will attempt to take the
place of the natural relations of an
older economic order.
These things he will accomplish be-
cause he is peculiarly placed to know-
that all men are decent at base, be-
cause he knows and respects the man
who owns the works, because he
knows, respects and has a man-to-man
affection for the employees.
Doing these things he will promote
the interest of capital, will insure hap-
piness, self-consciousness of the right
sort and financial well-being for the
workers, and above all he will have
built a foundation for national loyalty
so that when any future crisis shall
confront the nation any man can say,
"This country has given me a place in
which to grow and breathe, if I have
not had all from society that I might
wish it is because the means were lack-
ing — I have felt the kindly desire;
now I welcome my chance to show an
equal service without thought of self."
The engineering of the future must
consist chiefly in the building of citi-
zens through the sincere direction of
environment.


PETER NEFF, CONSULTING ENGINEER, SPECIALIST IN
REFRIGERATION
THE field of the Refrigerating En-
gineer has been aptly described in
the words of the first president of the
American Society of Refrigerating
Engineers, when he says, "we claim as
our own, all that relates to the produc-
tion of temperatures, below the ordi-
nary, for useful purposes."
Such a conception is perhaps a rev-
elation to those who have thought of
refrigeration as having solely to do
with the household refrigerator and
the manufacture of ice. True, a few
may have extended their ideas to in-
clude cold storage in its various ap-
plications to food products and bev-
erages. Beyond this point the Art ex-
tends, however, in an ever widening
view, although little suspected by the
public at large.
The Refrigerating Engineer must
have a knowledge of the physical,
chemical and mechanical laws and be
able to apply them to the problems
that will confront him. Therefore his
education must have a wide founda-
tion if he would build substantially.
Experience and education must go
hand in hand, for, unless this is the
case, he cannot properly co-ordinate
the varied factors which appear in
every problem.
The manufacture of ice attracts at-
tention by its universality. It has,
however, undergone many changes.
Starting with the freezing of natural
waters, which produced an inferior
quality, it passed to the use of distilled
water and reached a perfection which
was considered final. But this finality
did not last long, for while the prod-
uct was good, the method of its at-
tainment was not economical. Then,
for a time, quality was sacrificed for
economy, but now, by the proper
treatment of natural waters, both be-
fore applying refrigeration and dur-
ing the freezing process, quality and
economy are rising together. For a
moment consider the factors that the
engineer had to co-ordinate to bring
this about; the various types of pow-
er,—electric motors, internal combus-
tion engines, turbines, uniflow and
other forms of steam power; waters
with varying soluble content; removal
of air from the water as it is crystaliz-
ed; whether to use high or low press-
ure air for agitation; dehumidifying
the air; and so on through a long list,
with each of these factors involving a
number of variables in itself. As
to compressors, while there has not
been the marked change as elsewhere,
yet the development of the high speed
type presages a marked improvement.
What has been said of ice making is
applicable to other uses of mechanical
refrigeration, a continued movement
toward more econmical and efficient
operation. In this connection it is well
to remember that with the compres-
sion type the absorption machine has
developed also, this is especially true
of the exhaust steam machine.
Insulation so vital to the conserva-
tion of the refrigeration when produc-
ed has not been lost sight of, and has
now come to be almost an industry in
itself.


75
The problems, the solution of which
would be a boon to the Art, are almost
innumerable. The Bureau of Stand-
ards of the U. S. made the determina-
tion of the latent heat of fusion of ice,
and was well along in the work of de-
termining the physical properties of
the various gases used, when the war
came on which has temporarily stop-
ped the work. To-day our engineers
are busy with the applications of re-
frigeration to meet existing needs.
In the wider field of refrigeration
many of the applications had their
start prior to the war, but these have
grown rapidly of late.
Among these we have what is term-
ed air conditioning, that is where both
the temperature and the humidity are
controlled. It enters into such indus-
tries as candy making, care and work-
ing of tobacco, textiles, leather, man-
ufacture and care of explosives, evap-
oration of liquids, and in many cases
where drying is required.
More than ever we must conserve
our food supply, transport it over-seas
and care for it there. Refrigeration
is required in every stage of this proc-
ess. We did little of ship refrigeration
before the war, now we must build
ships and more ships, and practically
every one must have at least a small
refrigerating unit. Contracts are al-
ready placed for hundreds of these in-
stallations. With our characteristic
American hustle we are getting re-
sults, accomplishing: what is needed:
later we will do it more efficiently.
Recently we heard much of the
Liberty Motor tests, all were interest-
ed, but how many realized the assist-
ance given by the Refrigerating Engi-
neer, and knew that a building was
erected in which all ranges of temp-
erature and altitude to be encountered
could be produced at will?
Small portable ice making plants
have been mounted on trucks for hos-
pital and field work; while Canton-
ments and Base Hospitals are gen-
erally equipped with refrigerating
plants. A permanent committee of the
American Society of Refrigerating
Engineers is co-operating with the
Government, and many unusual in-
stallations are being worked out. The
demand for ammonia for munitions,
—one pound will make 20 hand gren-
ades—, is likely to cause a shortage
for commercial plants and many
schemes for conservation as well as
substitutes are being considered. As
to the magnitude of the industry it
may be mentioned that three cold stor-
age plants, one in Chicago, one in Bos-
ton and one in New York, have an ag-
gregate capacity of 14,200,000 cu. ft.
The largest single machine is in the
Quincy Market and Cold Storage
plant in Boston, whcih has a capacity
of 1,000 tons refrigeration per day.
The largest installation, about 4,000
tons refrigeration per day, is in the
plant of the Eastman Kodak Co. at
Rochester.
During the year 1917 there were
1656 installations made, aggregating
43,589 tons refrigeration daily capac-
ity. The list embraces 24 standard
industries and a miscellaneous item of
226 installations with a tonnage of
6,838. Under this are such plants as
—munitions, cooling drinking water,
ice skating rinks, bottling works, oil
refineries, glue works, cheese, soap,
watch factories, waxed paper, govern-
ment buildings, commissaries, match
factories, textiles.
Refrigeration is an essential part of
our complex civilization and as such
is raised to one of the most important
Arts.


C. T. JOHNSTON. '95, PROFESSOR OF GEODESY
AND SURVEYING
PROBABLY more men are study-
ing the elements of government,
industrial and educational problems,
and other subjects of general concern,
than at any other time in the history
of the country. The controversy be-
tween the champions of the human-
istic studies and the devotees of sci-
ence has been intensified by activity
induced in the broader field. For two
or three generations the engineer has
rested quietly on the side lines, real-
izing his inability to appreciate some
of the arguments put forth by those
who do not see beyond the realm of
the humanities, and enjoying an oc-
cupation which demands the applica-
tion rather than the defense of the sci-
ences. He has been content, in a large
measure, to be an instrument which
applies science to industry.
The engineer, however, is misunder-
stood by the leaders of both hostile
camps. He has no prejudices and he
may ultimately become a medium
through which they may co-operate.
While watching the contest between
the champions of these schools, the
engineer has had a little time to study
another movement which threatens to
compel him to become a participator
rather than an observer. A few novices
in educational thought now recom-
mend that more attention be given to
specialization and that the preparation
of the engineer be intensified and nar-
rowed. This would mean that engi-
neering schools would train young men
as experts in highly specialized fields,
ignoring altogether their preparation
for citizenship. If such a plan were
to be carried into effect generally, the
engineer would continue to be .the
docile hired man that he has been in
the past. The popular conception of
the engineer of today has been estab-
lished to a large extent by the records
of trade school products.
Engineers and teachers in our en-
gineering schools have a broader vis-
ion of the future possibilities of the
profession they represent than would
be commonly assumed by the casual
observer. As the demand for special-
ized training has increased they have
been obliged to give heed thereto by
modifiying the earlier scheme of en-
gineering education in order that they
may be of greater temporary service;
realizing that in doing this they are
probably weakening the profession
and, in the end, denying graduates
many opportunities for higher posi-
tions and greater rewards. Engineers
are not satisfied with some of the pol-
icies that technical schools have been
obliged to accept during a critical
period of their history.
The engineer is a comparatively new
element in society. It is natural that
he should not be appreciated at once.
Because he has won some applause
during the period which recorded his
early development, he should not as-
sume that he can measure future re-
sponsibilities by the standards of past
performance. He has been obliged to
fit himself into the social scheme with-


77
out much regard to his own or the
public welfare. From now on he must
make a place for himself and let others
assume some of the responsibility for
the readjustments which must be suf-
fered as experiment teachers its les-
sons and as the final application of
new ideas takes the place of theory
and speculation.
The engineer agrees with those who
contend that the purpose of education
is to prepare men for citizenship. To
abbreviate argument, let us assume
that this is the great object to be at-
tained. The engineer admits that the
humanities are helpful,—in fact that
they are essential. He would be the
last to condemn the sciences, because
he understands some of them and he
uses them as tools. He is inclined to
believe that extreme specialization in
any line is dangerous. To be effective
in society some balance is essential.
However, it is apparent that men must
specialize within reasonable limits, at
some time in their preparation for a
life work. It is impossible to enter
into a discussion of the policies of edu-
cators as to when a certain subject
should be pursued; or, how far a stu-
dent would be warranted in extending
his study therein; when time, financial
ability, and the demand for trained
men are all considered.
While we can assume an agreement
relative to education as a preparation
for citizenship, we may not come to
terms when we try to define citizen-
ship or its responsibilities. Let us con-
fine ourselves then to one great re-
sponsibility which every educated man
should appreciate and in which, under
our form of government, every man
is presumed to have a part. What
special training does the average uni-
versity man receive that would fit him
to go to the state legislature and frame
some simple act which would add to
the convenience, prosperity or happi-
ness of the people of the common-
wealth? This should be one of the
great fields of individual usefulness,
yet universities have been inclined to
ignore the necessity for some specific
training therefor. It is unnecessary
to say now where or how this training
should begin or end. We might well
have specialists in government. Other
countries have been farsighted enough
to provide experts of this kind. It
would seem that some general funda-
mentals in the elements and history of
government and in political science
should be required. It is plain that
many of the advanced courses must
be given in the departments of special-
ization. In other words; after a
foundation is laid it is necessary,—
if we are to have laws which are bal-
anced,—to support them rather on a
foundation prepared in an appropriate
branch of education than on idle
theories that relate to none.
As an example, a student who is
preparing to be a teacher would ob-
tain his fundamental training in mat-
ters of government under the direction
of the department which specializes
therein. He would continue this study,
as it applies to education in the de-
partment directly concerned with that
study. Educators should be familiar
with legislative methods and .under-
stand fully what legislation is needed
in their own field. Their success may
depend largely upon such state legis-
lation as their combined influence may
bring about. They alone know what
the law should embrace and what dif-
ficulties are likely to be met and over-
come in its administration. If every
branch of education, which prepares
men for some specific field of useful-
ness, were to accept this responsibility,


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
our laws might develop a sane phrase-
ology and each class of legislation
might enjoy a style appropriate to the
subject treated. We might then read
the law as a matter of general interest
and not be obliged to plead guilty of
ignorance of the same at a critical
time.
The engineer has viewed legisla-
tion from the large end of the tele-
scope in years past. He has uncon-
sciously accepted the common and er-
roneous conception of law making,—
that it is public business of a mediocre
type and that the responsibility for
good or bad legislation lies largely
with the lawyer. At the same time
he knows that men of all types are
sent to the legislature and he is fully
aware that the legal profession would
refuse to accept the responsibility for
general legislation.
Regardless of the natural timidity
of the engineer, he enjoys some de-
cided advantages in the opinion of
those who understand him. When he
encounters a questionable theory, he
either goes to the laboratory where it
is tested in a way that satisfies him as
to its reliability, or he applies it in
practice, possibly to his own detriment.
In the latter case he shifts his labora-
tory into the open and makes an ex-
periment on a large scale. His reputa-
tion crumbles if his structures fail,
thus proving the fallacy of the theory
applied. Tn either case the engineer
discovers his errors without delay and
immediately profits by experience,
whether it be mild or harsh in char-
acter.
Many men who seek the truth are
unable to apply a critical test to
theories which might show defects if
it were possible to analyze them un-
der laboratory conditions. The train-
ing and experience of the engineer
develops some ability in analysis. This
faculty enables him to select premises
that are safe and sound. He learns
to express his ideas in concise English
and he develops a love of order and
the proper sequence of subjects. It
would seem that he should be an au-
thority in the framing of legislation
which has been prepared for many
years by his brethren of foreign coun-
tries.
Statutes relating to the location,
construction, administration and main-
tenance of public utilities and public
property of many kinds must ulti-
mately be based largely on principles
best understood by the engineer and
he should be the recognized authority
in these fields. It is impossible to re-
fer to but a few branches of legisla-
tion which the engineer must ultimate-
ly support.
Many national laws which relate to
technical subjects do not recognize
fully the necessity for engineering
judgment in their execution. Study
the histories of the Coast and Geode-
tic Survey, the United States Geolog-
ical Survey, the Patent Office, the Re-
clamation Service and the Indian Serv-
ice. Read the history of the Panama
Canal.
Engineers should be leaders in solv-
ing the transportation problems of the
country. Why js it that navigation
canals and navigable rivers are of so
little service to the people? Engineers
are not a positive force in the admin-
istration of such public resources as
rivers and lakes. These are governed
largely by the courts under the com-
mon law. Engineers probably realize
that the English colonies have prac-
tically abrogated the common law in
so far as it applies to water resources.
Drain laws are related to legislation
which has to do with water resources.
The drain laws of the several states


79
are not framed to encourage drainage
development. They cater to the ob-
structionist to drainage. Only the en-
gineer can find and apply the remedy
here.
Cities and towns grow without plan
or purpose. Finally, the public pays
the bills that are now charged to this
unnecessary expense of development.
The speculator in real estate lays out
our subdivisions without much regard
to public interests. Tn many foreign
countries the engineer, in co-operation
with experts in city planning, control
this development.
In legislation relating to water sup-
ply, the pollution of streams, water
power, irrigation development, public
safety and many other branches of
public and private endeavor, the engi-
neer has failed to manifest an attitude
of leadership. Policies that afford
protection to public and private inter-
ests in these fields are yet to be discov-
ered and applied.
Lands have been surveyed by the
general government for the benefit of
speculators rather than for the pro-
tection of settlers. The General Land
Office is organized on a legal and po-
litical rather than a scientific basis. But
few public land surveys are a credit
to the government and certainly not to
the engineer. The engineer has gone
on to other fields which have not been
invaded as yet by ruinous doctrines of
the past, and land surveying will not
be placed on a stable foundation of
science until he returns and accepts a
responsibility that should have been
assumed many years ago.
Statistics show that almost one-half
of the area that might be farmed at
this time lies idle. Profits that the
land might otherwise provide were
partially consumed by speculators long
before the farmer appeared. The en-
gineers of foreign countries have ana-
lyzed conditions of this kind and found
the remedy.
The engineer knows that his prog-
ress is marked by stakes set along the
straight line of honest endeavor. His
trail is plainly blazed and subject to
the scrutiny of all who are competent
to judge his record. While some pro-
fessional men can bury their errors
under the sod and others can shift re-
sponsibility for error to those who
furnish convenient precedents, the en-
gineer must start his investigations on
a foundation that is scientifically stable
and then erect his structures as truth
and honesty dictate. The engi-
neer who brings about the enactment
of legislation containing a single prin-
ciple that is essential to the prosperity
and happiness of many people, erects
a monument which will survive to per-
petuate his name long after the record
of many other achievements, which
seem of first importance to him at the
time, have been blotted from the his-
tory of his generation.


ED BY LESSONS FROM PARADOX-
ICAL WINDWHEELS
THOMAS O. PERRY, '69A, 72
THE four windwheels shown in
Fig. i were described in The
Michigan Technic for May, 1917.
Since then the two wheels shown in
Fig. 2 have been tested on the same
apparatus with the addition of a
speedometer. The wheel shown
mounted on the axle is designated
PPO°, which means that it is a
straight flat strip of sheet brass whose
front and rear surfaces are parallel
planes and whose weather angle is
zero with the plane of revolution. Ly-
ing on the table beneath the axle is a
wheel designated PCO°, which means
that the front surface is a perfectly
straight plane from end to end and
that the back is convex in transverse
section. When mounted for testing
on the axle the front plane surface is
parallel with the plane of revolution,
that is, its weather angle is zero. The
axes of revolution in both cases
pierces the centers of the faces of the
wheels and are perpendicular to the
plane surfaces.
Since adding the speedometer to my
apparatus, the four wheels shown in
Fig. 1 have been retested. In the de-
signations of these wheels R means
right-hand, L means left-hand, N
means neuter and the figures 8°, 30
and 0° indicate the weather angles in
the respective cases. It may be noticed
that three of the six wheels are of the
neutral variety and are reasonably
supposed to be indifferent to the direc-
tion of their revolutions. L30 is a
wheel naturally inclined to revolve
only in a left hand direction and could
not reasonably be expected to turn the
other way. R8° and Iy8° can be de-
pended upon to run true to their in-
clinations but have other paradoxical
peculiarities.
The wind to drive these windwheels
was furnished by a 12" electric fan as
indicated in Fig. 2. All of the wheels
measured io^4" from tip to tip and
the breadth was i%" except in the
case of PPO° which was iy2" wide.
The axle of the testing apparatus was
mounted to swing longitudinally with
perfect freedom except as the move-
ment was restrained by weights placed
in the pan hanging from the hori-
zontal arm of a bell lever, as shown.
It will be obvious without further de-
scription that the wind thrust against
the wheels could thus be weighed.
In our first experiments without the
speedometer it was suspected that the
wind blast partook somewhat of the
rotary motion of the fan which cor-
responded with right-hand motion o-f
the windwheels and that our neutral
wheels ran faster in a right-hand di-
rection than left-handed. The speed-
ometer showed that such was the case,
notwithstanding the fact that NO°
showed a disposition to start itself in
a left-hand direction without assist-


8r
ance and would not start in the direc-
tion in which the blast rotated without
help. To eliminate blast rotation a
tunnel 13" in diameter by 15" long
was constructed and divided longitud-
inally by eight thin radial partitions
of sheet metal. The fan was placed
close to one end of the tunnel and the
windwheels about 5" from the other
end. This tunnel is not shown in Fig.
2 but was used in the experiments
hereafter mentioned and effectively
stopped rotation of the blast.
to. This, by the way, was the only
one of the neutral wheels that would
run either side to. Those with curved
surfaces were retarded and quickly
stopped when mounted with their con-
vex sides to the wind. This too was
the only neutral wheel that could not
be readily started without winding a
string around the hub. The others
could be easily started by simply giv-
ing them a moderate whirl with the
fingers. In order to succeed well with
PPO° it should be nicely balanced,

As estimated by pressure against a
solid disc of the same diameter as the
windwheels, using data derived from
Eiffel's experiments, the wind velocity
was about 15 ft. per second.
PPO° was the last of these wheels
to be tried, and I must confess that
the trial was made more for the pur-
pose of confirming my opinion that at
least one face of a neutral wheel must
have curvature than in expectation
that this wheel would maintain motion
through action of the wind against its
weatherless flat face. The result was
that it maintained indefinitely and con-
stantly a speed of 1032 rev. per min-
ute after being given a good start by
means of a string wound around the
hub. It ran equally well in either di-
rection it was started and either side
and it helps considerably if the edges
are well rounded. The speed at which
this wheel had to be started approxi-
mated the speed which the wind could
maintain.
Wheel PCO° was the immediate
predecessor of PPO° and maintained
an average of 1656 r.p.m. in the direc-
tion in which it was given a start.
This wheel was made of white pine
3/16" thick and the back side was
curved in transverse section to a ra-
dius of 3" as shown to full size in
Fig. 3. A very moderate start with
the fingers in either direction was suf-
ficient to make the wind take hold and
quickly accelerate the speed to the
maximum which could be constantly
maintained. PCO° can be very easily
made of wood by simply rounding

over the back of a straight flat piece
3/16" thick, I-J4" wide and ioj^"
long. These dimensions are arbitrary
and can probably be considerably
varied. The thickened center, or hub,
also is probably unnecessary. There
can be little excuse for questioning
the results of this experiment since
it can be so easily repeated by any
one.
can generate and maintain motion at
right angles to its own course when
the actuated wing surface is normal
to the actual direction of the wind,
that is, entirely devoid of weather
angle or inclination with its plane of
motion. Evidently this cannot be ac-
counted for by previously accepted
analyses, as given by Rankine, which
first deduce the pressure normal to the
Fig. 2. Details of Apparatus—Wind-tunnel Not Shown
Fig. 4 shows a full size section of
wheel PPO° taken at any location
throughout its length and the di-
agramatic lines, excepting A B, rep-
resent wind velocities in direction and
magnitude relatively to the moving
surface which in this graphical an-
alysis supposes the direction of wing
motion to be from left to right as rep-
resented by B C indicating feet per
second at a radial distance of about
2/3 of the half diameter of the wind-
wheel as actually ascertained. A B
represents the estimated actual ve-
locity and direction of the wind. We
wrish to know how it is that the wind
flat surface and resolve this pressure
into two components, one acting use-
fully in the direction of wing motion
and the other acting impotently at
right angles thereto. Rrankine as-
sumes that there can be no effort
parallel with a plane surface along
which the wind is supposed to flow
without friction. Whatever surface
friction there may be is a retarding
force and must be added to the head
resistance of the leading 'edge and
the suctional resistance of the trailing
edge of the wing. The fact that PPO°
is driven by the wind at more than
1000 r.p.m. notwithstanding consid-


83
erable resistance to motion indicates
that it is an error to assume that the
wind cannot produce useful effort in
a direction parallel with a smooth flat
surface. Rankine's error arose as a
consequence of his adopting in his
Case V for flat surfaces what he calls
"an easier method" instead of em-
ploying his previous method used gen-
erally in the other cases. The appli-
cation of his general method is just as
simple as his "easier method" for solv-
ing our present problem and has the
advantage of being correct. We pur-
pose, however, to reduce Rankine's
general method to a simpler form,
though the form is necessarily greatly
simplified when we take relative di-
rections of wind and wing in their
real relationship.
The moving surface may be consid-
ered as affected only by the relative
direction and intensity of the wind.
The actual direction and velocity of
the wind io nur case is represented
by the line A B. Since the wing
moves from C to B while the wind
travels from A to B the relative di-
rection of impinging wind is repre-
sented by A C. On meeting the wing
the wind is deflected and flows along
the surface to the trailing edge where
it escapes without material diminu-
tion of velocity or further change in
direction. In other words, the ve-
locity A C is simply changed in di-
rection and its escape is parallel and
opposite to the wing's motion. The
impinging component of A C which
is opposite to wing motion is repre-
sented by B C. Reactions which af-
fect useful effort depend entirely upon
changes of relative wind velocity par-
allel with the line of wing motion. In
this line, along which alone the wing
can move, the wind is received with
the velocitv B C and cast off in the
same direction with a greater velocity
A C. The difference between A C
and B C represents acceleration of
wind velocity by the wing in a direc-
tion opposite to wing motion. If we

represent this acceleration in feet per
second by the symbol a, the useful
effort which actuates the wing will be
a/g. For instance, if a equals g or
32-2/10 ft. per second, every pound
of wind deflected by the wing will


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
produce a useful reaction equal to one
pound, and in any other case the re-
action will be greater or less in pro-
portion that o is greater or less than g.
This method of analyzing wind re-
actions against windwheels is applic-
able to all other forms of wings. In
the case of curved surfaces the air
immediately in contact with the wing
may not escape from the trailing edge
exactly in a direction opposite to wing
motion and for total reactions we
must consider all air which is de-
flected whether directly in contact
with the wing surface or not. Dif-
ferent parts of the whole volume of
deflected air will take different direc-
tions of escape from the wing, but,
as a whole, the escaping air should
take a direction more nearly in line
with wing motion than the relative
direction of impingement. This con-
dition, neglecting surface friction,
makes the velocity of escape parallel
with wing motion greater than the ve-
locity of impingement taken in the
same direction. It is only those com-
ponents of relative velocity, whether
of impingement or escape, whose di-
rection is parallel to wing motion that
we need to consider in determining
useful effort. Acceleration rearward
accounts for the useful reaction nec-
essary to actuate the windwheel.
Whatever direction or velocity a mov-
ing body may previously have, it can-
not be accelerated in any direction
without reaction in the opposite di-
rection proportional to the accelera-
tion. In our case the wing produces
the acceleration of the wind rearward
and experiences an equivalent reac-
tion.
If the actuation of wheels PPO°
and PCO° cannot be accounted for
by Rankine's "easiest method" of an-
alysis, it is still more difficult to ap-
ply this method to L3° when the wind
drives it in in a direction contrary
to its inclination.' This naturally left-
hand wheel was wind driven in a
right-hand direction at the rate of 960
r.p.m. after receiving a good start
with the fingers. Running left-hand,
according to inclination, it made 1560
r.p.m. and of course needed no as-
sistance to start. When mounted so
as to receive the wind against its con-
vex side this wheel could not be wind
driven in either direction, but the
blast quickly dampened motion im-
parted by the fingers.
Wheel NO° was wind driven at
the rate of 1344 r.p.m. in a right-hand
direction and 1440 left-hand. It was
no apparent reason for its greater
speed one way than the other. Whe-
tried without the tunnel it ran 1260
right-hand and 1170 left-hand. This
difference was attributed to rotation
of the blast with the direction of fan
revolution.
At first it seemed puzzling that this
wheel, as before mentioned, should
show a tendency to start of its own
accord in a direction opposite to blast
rotation and sometimes actually did
start without assistance in a left-hand
direction although its right-hand mo-
tion at full speed was the more rapid.
This, however, does not seem so
strange if we reflect that the starting
effect of revolving the blast is equiv-
alent to revolving the wheel with the
fingers. If the blast revolved a little
more rapidly the wheel would readily
start itself unfailingly in a left-hand
or contrary direction.
The fact that NO0 revolves less
rapidly than PCO° is probably due
to too great curvature of the wings in
NO0 for great speed. That is, the
leading edge would probably receive
the wind with less resistance if the


85
curvature was less. The back of PCO°
has the same curvature as NO°, and
making the front side a plane may
amount to about the same thing as
reduction of the average curvature of
the two sides. Undoubtedly the best
disposition of the leading edge is that
it be parallel with the relative direc-
tion of impinging wind. The trailing
edge should be so disposed as to di-
rect escape of air on the whole as
nearly opposite to wing motion as
possible.
Wheels R8° and L8° are supposed
to be entirely similar to each other
except that one is inclined for right-
hand and the other for left-hand mo-
tion. Yet for some obscure reason,
when tried with the tunnel, R8° ran
faster than L8°, the respective speeds
being 1896 and 1824 r.p.m. Before
the tunnel was used B8° made i960
and L8° made 1720 r.p.m.
The performances of these two
wheels are not paradoxical except in
the matter of wind thrust against
their surfaces while in full motion as
compared with the thrust received
when clamped to the axle and held
stationary. Rankine's method of an-
alyzing reaction against inclined wings
traveling at right angles to the course
of the wind presumes that the wing
surface recedes from the normal ap-
proach of the wind when the wing is
in motion and that the normal thrust
is reduced in proportion to wing speed.
This idea also accords with common
sense. It also seems to accord with
the teachings of all previous experi-
ments. I have invariably found in the
many hundreds of dynamometric tests
which I have made with a great va-
riety of windwheels that increase of
speed always accorded with diminu-
tion of load and that the torsional ef-
fort of the wheel was greatest when
there was no wing motion. Up to
the time of my experiments with these
wheels, R8° and L8°, I never doubted
that a windwheel with weather angle
should receive less avial thrust while
in motion than while held stationary.
I never before measured axial thrust.
The purposes for which windmill tests
were made did not require the meas-
urement of thrust.
It was in connection with the study
of aeronautical propellers that the ap-
paratus shown in Fig. 2. was con-
structed as well as the various wheels
herewith shown. This time I was
especially interested in the thrust of
air propellers when their functions
were reversed. I wanted to know
whether the wings of an aircraft of
the helicopter type, in case of motor
failure, had better be fixed or allowed
to revolve for retarding the rate of
descent. It had occurred to me that
if the wings were allowed to revolve
with a proper adjustable pitch they
would act the same as the wings of
an ordinary aeroplane while volplan-
ing spirally.
The result of my experiment was
that in a wind estimated at 15 ft. per
second the thrust against the wings
of my 8 degree wheels when held
stationary was 0.053 lbs. and that the
thrust was increased to 0.19 lbs. when
the wings were allowed to revolve
freely. That is, the thrust was in-
creased nearly four fold when the
wings revolved without applied re-
straint. When a solid disc of the
same diameter as the wheels was
mounted on the axle the thrust was
0.18 lbs. The revolving wings re-
ceived a wind thrust somewhat great-
er than the solid disc. To know this
would be comforting to a stalled avia-
tor and might save his life.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Again I wished to know whether
it would help to ease forced descent
if the wings were adjusted to a weath-
er angle of zero degrees. I found
that the thrust against the wings of
NO° was 0.054 ^s. when fixed. The
original idea was to hold them in fixed
position or, as this zero inclination
would reduce head resistance, that
they might be revolved by hand power
to increase resistance against too rapid
descent. It was a pleasant surprise
to find that the wind of descent would
be abundantly adequate to keep them
in rapid motion. The thrust against
these wings in free motion was 0.21
lbs.
This neutral wheel was probably the
first of its kind ever constructed and
driven with equal facility in either di-
rection by the wind, and its action
manifested so much energy as to sug-
gest that even a wheel with some
weather angle might be made to run
in a negative direction. Otherwise it
would have appeared foolish to make
L30 with the expectation of inducing
it to be wind driven contrary to its
inclination. The axial thrusts experi-
enced by L30 were 0.21 lbs. running
naturally, left-handed, and 0.19 lbs.
running unnaturally in a right-hand
direction. When fixed the thrust was
0.056 lbs.
The thrust against PCO° were
0.053 lbs. when fixed and 0.195 lbs.
when running, and against PPO° the
thrust was 0.045 lbs. when fixed and
0.165 lbs. running.
It is evident enough now that the
nearly four-fold increase in thrusts
against the wings in rapid motion
were due to the greatly increased
quantities of wind intercepted and we
can perceive too, how wrong it is to
consider in analysis an area of wind
only equal to the area of the wings.
For the sake of simplifying the prob-
lem, we considered in our analysis the
reaction of only one pound of air. To
get at the total reaction it is of course
necessary to consider the weight of
all the air which is deflected by the
wings. This is best found by experi-
ment.
From the performances of these
wheels and especially from NO° and
L30 we can gain some insight into the
mysteries involved in the flight of
soaring birds. Mr. Chanute and other
authorities have assumed that birds
in soaring flight find and remain
within the confines of ascending col-
umns of air and that propulsion in
soaring flight is due to a forward pitch
or so-called negative inclination of the
wings. Granting that the assumed
ascending air column is always avail-
able and that initial horizontal velocity
has somehow been gained, we can
now see that it is not necessary to as-
sume a negative inclination of the
bird's wings to account for propulsive
effort. Wheel L30 teaches that the
ascending current may produce pro-
pulsion even if the wings are tipped
to a positive angle of as much as three
degrees and that there is effective pro-
pulsion if they are slightly inclined
either way or not at all.
In regard to available ascending
currents of air, it is difficult to dis-
cover by observation that soaring
birds concern themselves with trying
to find or follow them. Some birds
habitually soar and go in any direc-
tion as they please, even ascending at
will, without much regard to direction
of wind. The fact that they frequently
soar in circles is due to the necessity
of keeping over the territory which
they wish to explore for food and


87
does not imply that they are trying to
keep within a "chimney" of wind as
Mr. Chanute suggests. They also fre-
quently soar in approximately straight
lines, but these lines of travel are de-
termined by their appetite rather than
from any desire to follow lines of
ascensional air as Hiram Maxim con-
tends. That there are such "chim-
neys" and lines of ascending air is in-
disputable, and it is just as true that
descending air is equivalent in volume
to all that ascends. These ascending
and descending air columns are small
or large in area according to the vary-
ing temperature of the earth's sur-
faces where they receive heat. As-
cending columns more generally pre-
vail over land, especially in hot cli-
mates, while water surfaces more gen-
erally experience descending currents.
The southern seas about the Antarctic
continent are especially favorable re-
gions for descending masses of cold
air, yet it is here that we find the
home of perhaps the most famous of
soaring birds, the albatros, a bird that
is almost never under the necessity
of flapping its wings and can even rise
from the waves without a flap.
Langley has shown how a plane sur-
face may be sustained by horizontal
wind impulses which his experiments
demonstrate are nearly always pre-
valent in unsuspected abundance. But
to make Langley's horizontal impulses
available for soaring flight it is neces-
sary to assume that the bird instinc-
tively adjusts its wings so as to regu-
larly receive the impulses underneath.
More recently, Eiffel's experiments
have shown that arched wings, sim-
ilar to the curved wings of my wind-
wheel NO°, experience a decided up-
ward pressure from horizontal wind
when'the chords of the wings are also
truly horizontal. From this it appears
certain that the arched wings of birds
need no angular adjustment to make
the horizontal impulses of wind al-
ways produce a sustaining effect.
Years before the Wright brothers
first demonstrated the practicability
of mechanical flight I had learned in
my experience with arched wings of
windmills that wind blowing parallel
with the chords still propelled the
wings with very considerable force in
the unreasonable direction, at right
angles to the chords. The experience
was very annoying at the time as it
interfered seriously with the purposes
I then had in view.
Eiffel was not contented simply
with the knowledge that horizontal
wind did lift his horizontally disposed
aeroplanes. He has shown by ac-
curate experiment that the lift against
the horizontal wings was more than
a third of the lift at what he consid-
ered the best angles of inclination for
aeroplane flight. That is, the lift
with zero inclination was more than
one-third of the lift at an inclination
of 6°. He also found that the lift
of the wind did not vanish short of
a negative weather angle of —40.
But why should Langley have con-
fined himself to plane surfaces and
horizontal impulses. It has long been
a matter of common knowledge that
wind pressure against concave sur-
faces of the same area. It is clear
that the resultant of other than hori-
zontal impulses must help to sustain
arched wings. All wind impulses
with which in every direction the at-
mosphere is ordinarily filled, help to
sustain wings which are concave un-
derneath and convex above. The ex-
cess of upward actuation constitutes
an equivalent for the assumed con-
stant rising current.
Only one other factor needs con-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
consideration to enable us to under-
stand why birds can soar. We have
seen how the wind pressures against
our windwheels are increased nearly
fourfold when the wings have rapid
motion. Chanute and others have ob-
served that before a bird can soar an
initial minimum velocity of about 17
miles per hour must be attained. This
the bird attains by flapping its wings,
or by diving from elevated perches or,
which amounts to the same thing, by
rising against the direction of the
wind. The initial speed is necessary
in order to multiply the number of
impulses received from air waves in
a unit of time, and the sustaining
force is multiplied accordingly. In the
case of our windwheels the amount of
wind intercepted was limited by the
area of the circle in which the wheels
were confined. Birds in soaring flight
are not subject to such limitation.
Langley was right in supposing that
birds soar by virtue of utilizing what
he called "internal work of the wind,"
though he failed to show completely
how the "internal work" could be
made available.
A complete exposition of the sub-
ject is more than any one should lay
claim to. We believe our experiments
with windwheels have added some-
thing to the enlightenment of our un-
derstanding and we must be content
if we have made our explanations ap-
pear reasonable.
What can be made to appear rea-
sonable to another depends upon his
own experiences either directly de-
rived or accepted by communication
from someone else. Most men, hav-
ing observed that the direction of mo-
tion of a windwheel is determined by
the angular inclination of the wings,
are apt to assume that the direction
of motion is determinable by reason-
ing processes alone. It is not difficult,
however, to find intelligent persons
who have never observed the action
of windwheels and they generally dis-
claim being able to express an opinion
as to the direction in which any wheel
ought to revolve. Some of these in-
telligent persons without observa-
tional knowledge on whom I have
tried the experiment think they can
reason the thing out, but I have found
that they are as apt to guess one way
as the other. For these personal ex-
periments I have been careful to se-
lect only people of more than ordinary
intellect.
I have reached the conclusion from
these experiments and many others,
that our reasoning faculties are little
better than pure imagination except
as they are constantly corrected by ex-
periment, or by experience, which
amounts to the same thing.
NOTE ON WINDWHEEL ARTICLE
*"P HE experiments above described
-■. are of considerable interest from
the point of view of their paradoxical
results. They are new in their partic-
ular form, but not in general princi-
ple. The Chinese according to "Aero-
phile," Jan. 1, 1914, were acquainted
with this phenomena long since. Their
elementary fan was a half round split
rod, pierced at the center with small
wooden shaft. By blowing directly
against the flat face, and giving the
whole an initial twist they obtained
the mysterious rotation. The 'above
experiments, though merely elabora-
tions on this, bring out new points.

We wish to attempt an explanation
from simple aerodynamical phenom-
ena.
For convenience in visualizing the
results obtained in this last and his
previous study the table of Fig. 1 is
shown. The "tandem" experiments
are omitted as these are merely com-
binations of single wheel action. Sev-
eral general results are at once evi-
dent: (1) The neutral wheels revolve
in either direction equally fast; (2)


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
R-3 revolves in either direction but
fastest to the right; (3) R-8 and L-8
revolve only to the right and left re-
spectively. Let us examine the cases
and see first of all why the neutral
wheels revolve at all.
Suppose we consider one of the
neutral wheels, say PP, represented in
Fig. 2. We may according to the
theory of propellers consider the ac-
tion of the wheel as the sum total of
the action of all the infinitely small
radial blade elements, which act just
as do the wings of the aeroplane it-
self. Then the average action occurs,
let us assume, at the element (A)
about f£ R-. or about 4^2" from the
hub and we may—consider the forces
as concentrated there. Let this sec-
tion be roughly as in Fig. 3. Now
imagine the wind current of 15 ft. per
sec. striking the blade at right angles
to the face. If the wheel is given an
initial twist to the left (upper blade)
such that the blade element has a
peripheral velocity V, then the re-
sultant velocity of the air with respect
to the blade is the vector sum F,, and
this current mets the blade element at
an angle, alpha, with the chord.
Let us turn now to Eiffel's experi-
ments on the behavior of aerofoils.
We find that he studied surfaces of
various sections and among them one
of section almost identical to that of
the wheel blade under consideration.
In general he found that when such
a surface was held in a current of air
at an angle of incidence, alpha, (Fig.
4) that it was subjected to vertical and
horizontal forces, Ry and i?x the re-
sultant of which, R sub-alpha made
an angle theta with the vertical, and
that theta was less than for certain
values of alpha, or made an angle
phi with the perpendicular to the
chord of the section. It is evident
that
phi = alpha minus theta.
Below is recorded the data for the
above section. That for the sections
of the other wheels would be similar
in nature, but would show slightly
differing values.
alpha 90 25 20 15 10 6 4 2 o
theta 90 25 18 11 7 6 5 5 5
phi 002430—1—3—5
For values of alpha between 220 and
6°, theta is less than alpha or phi is
positive. This is a well known and
understood phenomena occurring in
most aerofoils.
Returning to the blade element in
position on the wheel (Fig. 3) we see
that if the initial spin is such that
alpha is made as small as 220, then
R sub-alpha falls to the left of the
axis of the wheel and hence has a
component P in that direction. This
accelerates the rotation already start-
ed, and will continue to do so until
P becomes zero or so small as to just
overcome the friction in the bearing.
Suppose we say that to produce this
small value of P, phi must be 30.
Then from the data it is evident that
the corresponding value of alpha is
12. It is now easy to compute the
value of V and the R.P.M. necessary
to give alpha this value. We get 1,800,
approximately, a value fairly close to
the experimental.
The same analysis holds for the
other direction of rotation of this
wheel. And as for the other neutral
wheels, the principle is again the
different sections, the values of alpha
at which phi is positive will be differ-
ent.
In the . case of R3 it is clear,
in the light of the above results.


91
why it should behave as it does. In
considering it we must remember that
the angle formed by the two vectors—
V and Fj—is not alpha but some oth-
er angle alpha sub-one, such that in
rotation to the left (Fig. 5) alpha =
alpha sub-one plus 30 and in rotation
to the right (Fig. 6) alpha = alpha
sub-one minus 30. In the former case
it is quite evident that phi must be-
come greater than 30 in order that
the original spin may be supported.
The wheel will speed up until phi be-
comes nearly as low as 30. According
to Eiffel's data on the section similar
to that on this wheel, this occurs at
alpha, 20°. Alpha sab-one is then 17,
and the R.P.M. 1,200 as computed,
which is not so close as the previous
case. In rotation to the right (Fig.
6) the phi has only to become greater
than —30 to accelerate initial move-
ment. It will speed up until o again
drops to within say 30 of —3 which,
according to the data occurs at alpha,
8°. Alpha sub-one is then u° and
the R.P.M. 2,000. These results bear
out the fact that the rotation is slower
in one direction than in the other.
As to the wheels R- and L-8, we
have only to consider that phi never
reaches the value 8° to see why they
will not revolve to the left and right
respectively. When no component P
in the direction of the initial spin can
be produced, that motion cease, nat-
urally. They will, however, rotate
without help in their natural direc-
tions until phi comes within the 30 of
—8 or becomes —5, to which condi-
tion there again exists a definite value
of the R.P.M.
That the axial thrust—represented
by the component T (Fig. 3)—should
have a higher value than that of the
resistance of the blades when motion-
less, is somewhat more difficult of ex-
planation. Rather roughly we might
say that the rotating wheel "catches''
the air in the swept out area, and thus
a normal resistance equal to that of a
disc of the same area is produced.

Instructor of Aeronautics.
COMMENT ON MR. GERHARDT'S NOTE.
BY THE AUTHOR
HPriE explanation by Mr. Gerhardt
.*- showing by data taken from Eif-
fel's experiments that neutral wind-
wheels might be expected to continue
in motion after sufficient initial speed
has been imparted is interesting and
indicates that the inspiration to try the
experiment might possibly have been
derived from a study of such data al-
though Eiffel himself probably never
contemplated such use.
It should be noted, however, that
for values of alpha between 220 and
6s, between which limits in the speci-
fied case only can motion be assisted
by the component P, that the maxi-
mum value for phi is given as only 40
and that consequently the force P is
a very feeble one.
The impression one gets from wit-
nessing the experiments is that the
propulsive force is by no means insig-
nificant and that it might even be prac-
ticable to make good use of neutral
windwheels for power purposes, if
some means could be devised for
starting motion from a state of rest.
Assuming that phi must be as great
as 30 in order that axle friction may
be barely overcome, it is shown that


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
alpha would be about 12° and the
corresponding motion is 1800 R.P.M.
This is called "a value fairly close to
the experimental" although the wheel
under consideration makes only 1656
R.P.M. when running with no applied
resistance except axle friction.
I have applied friction with the fin-
gers to the broad hubs of these wheels
'and find that the motion is sustained
against many times as much resistance
as axle friction can account for, al-
though the motion is considerably re-
duced, making alpha probably greater
than 220.
I have no means of knowing the ex-
act amount of initial motion needed,
but feel sure that the wheels PCO°
and NO0 need not be started at more
than one-quarter the speed shown in
the table in order to make the wind
take hold and quickly accelerate mo-
tion to the maximum. The rapidity of
acceleration also indicates that the
actuating force must be much greater
than the maximum that can be assign-
ed to P.
Even if the initial motion is as great
as half the maximum attained in the
wind, that would make alplta about
25 ° and phi would be zero according
to given data.
It is not sufficient to show that phi
may be positive for the higher speeds
only. Eiffel's data do not account for
the slower speeds at which wheels
PCO° and NO° are driven by the
wind under additional applied loads
nor for acceleration from the very
moderate speeds required to give them
a start.

ALBERT J. ROUSSEAU, PROFESSOR OF ARCHITECTURE
ii^i E R T A I N wrong beginnings
v show their effects throughout
a whole career."
These words of the great Professor
Guadet, uttered when, after an active
professional life, he was appointed to
preside over the studies of the French
students of Architecture, represent a
conclusion drawn from his long ex-
perience. They have impressed me so
deeply by their indisputable truth,
that now, intrusted with a responsi-
bility somewhat like his, they come
back to me with such force that I have
not found anything more appropriate
than to present the explanation of
their meaning for the benefit of our
own students of Architecture.
The young man has reached the
age when he must choose a profession.
He decides on Architecture. If this
choice has been made from his own
inclination, it is a happy choice, for
Architecture is a magnificent art. It
is unquestionably a practical, a crea-
tive art, demanding long study, com-
plex knowledge, and speculative
thought.
Among all the qualities required for
the future architect the one essential
to his success is enthusiasm. This,
however, has its danger. It gives the
student a passionate love for his work
which will tempt him to impatience,
the cause for so many failures. His
imagination, fired by the masterpieces
of the ages, which he has admired,
gives him the impelling desire to at-
tempt at once architectural composi-
tion. This is a dream natural to the
ambitious young artist, but how de-
void of all logic! Tomorrow, he pro-
poses to surpass what years alone
have accomplished. By a gigantic ef-
fort of his will, or by an unexpected
spark of genius, he believes himself
able to guess at what the masters have
found only after laborious researches
and most profound meditations. He
wants to fly and lacks even wings.
What disappointment, too, awaits his
first attempt! For one cannot ascend
toward the high regions of art until
his wings are grown, until serious and
intensive studies have given vigor,
ability, the "coup d'aile!" The great
artists have always been great work-
ers, men formed by a rigorous disci-
pline of their faculties, having absorb-
ed one by one the elements, the means,
the secrets of their art and having
passed progressively from the stage of
imitating to that of creating. It is
useless to disguise the truth. The
study of Architecture will always de-
mand years of time, but from the be-
ginning it will also grow more and
more attractive. The aridity of the
start is due chiefly to the lack of con-
viction of the student who scarcely
ever realizes the importance of a right
beginning. Determination, taste, the
desire for perfection, artistic honesty,
all these the student must put into the
least of his studies and must never al-
low himself to neglect a detail. He
will soon discover that if these stud-
ies are arduous, they are also always


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
inspiring, and later, if he comes to
master his art, he will then appreci-
ate how interesting after all these dif-
ficulties are, provided the foundation
be solid and the progress well directed.
Our art resides in the high regions
of the mind. An ability to discover
its innumerable secrets which are
caught only through great efforts, a
technical ability to acquire, a taste to
form, an imagination to enrich and
means of realization to master, such
are its requirements. When once the
student realizes their magnitude and
the amount of courage and work they
mean, he still has to reckon with his
own strength. If he is frightened, it
is time to quit, but if on the contrary
these noble obstacles have awakened
his enthusiasm, his decision will then
be conscious and he will have merited
the delights art reserves for her faith-
ful lovers.
The architect must possess certain
fundamental knowledge which, is not
peculiar to Architecture but necessary
to almost all professions.
Literary knowledge will be of direct
use, for later, he will have to write as
much as to draw. It will also open
his mind and teach him to think. It
will awaken his intelligence to the no-
ble beauties of his art, and make him
read with profit. If he lacks that
foundation, he will absolutely have to
secure that culture by himself. He
must realize that the nobility of his
art is such that the reading of a trag-
edy of Shapespeare or the hearing of
a symphony of Beethoven is of profit
to the architect.
Scientific knowledge is even more
closely related to Architecture. It
will develop in the student sound
judgment, the faculty of analysis, and
method. More directly still, it will
ground his creations by giving means
of realization. Scientific knowledge
has nothing to do with imagination
or taste, but without it these would
be useless. Moreover, by an imperi-
ous law of evolution, Architecture be-
comes every day more and more sci-
entific. The future architect would be
behind his time if he were not more
scientifically trained than the archi-
tect of today who in his turn already
knows more than his predecessors.
The student must see these truths and
then make up his mind about them at
the very beginning of his studies. He
needs the sciences: they are a neces-
sary part of his program.
And now we come to the great
question of drawing, of which only
one thing can be said: one can never
draw enough! Drawing must be stud-
ied in a serious way, not as a diver-
sion as is generally understood, but
with the desire of analyzing forms
which have proportions, a scale, which
exist. Only an assiduous and thor-
ough training will make one sensitive
to these proportions, this scale, and
all the subtle nuances which give to a
piece of art its distinct character. The
study of drawing will also become by
a judicious selection of models a pow-
erful exercise in enriching the imag-
ination. It is so efficient as such, that
generally the most skillful draftsmen
become the most versatile composi-
tors, the most highly endowed with
ingenious and original power both to
conceive plans and to project facades.
This is necessarily so, for in art, ev-
erything is bound up together and
drawing is the foundation of all arts.
Generally the aspirant to the archi-
tectural career is gifted, ardent, and
industrious, but he approaches his
studies badly prepared, frequently
without even the least notion of the
serious character of the studies he


95
undertakes. He fails to be interested
in the beginning which in Architec-
ture, though elementary is neverthe-
less noble, for there are no studies in
art which are not lofty studies.
Construction also plays an impor-
tant part and must come at the very
start. Its means, its problems, the con-
trol of its combinations must be stud-
growing progressively more complex,
more difficult, but even at that stage
it will be essential to come back to the
study of the elements. This is the
work of a whole lifetime. In a well-
balanced program, the artistic studies
will be so proportioned as to make the
scientific work accepted with interest
if not with pleasure.

ied contemporaneously with the artis-
tic researches, with drawing, as soon
as the student begins to acquire no-
tions of architectural forms. Here,
as in design, the program of "self-
studies" which each student ought to
understand by himself will greatly
help him to master these subjects. This
outside work is absolutely necessary.
Such a program may be planned ac-
cording to one's taste and tempera-
ment, but it must be carried through
with the utmost energy, covering all
the matter of which the principles are
taught in the college. In this pro-
gram, the elements of each branch
must be reviewed frequently and will
constitute the chief part. Composition
will also be tried, small problems first,
From a well-established beginning
he will finally attain to composition,
the supreme aim. Composition is all
personal and may be acquired only
through arduous work and persistent
efforts. The first step in Architecture
is then to prepare oneself for composi-
tion. This preparation cannot be over-
done, for it almost always measures
the future success of a student. In
fact, once the technic of an art is mas-
tered, nothing more is needed than a
bit of feeling to produce work of a
high order. The student is too im-
patient to begin with composition. In
the simplest problem, such for exam-
ple as the design of a small pavilion,
tig. I, there will always be walls,
doors, windows, a cornice, a roof, etc.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Fig. 2. Hotp.i. de Ville, Rochei.ee, France
What can the student do with a sub-
ject like this when he does not know
what a door, a cornice, a roof is?
These are his first studies which he
must never consider as completed. He
can be taught how to draw a door or
a window without making childish
mistakes, but all his life if he is really
an artist he will have the ambition to
learn to design a door or a window.
He will see that antiquity, the great
artists of the Middle-Ages and the
Renaissance, and the masters of our
own days have well shown how diffi-


97
cult and noble is such a study.
He has to rebuild what centuries
have done before him. He must
know the first needs, the first means,
the first testimony of art, then later
the complex and refined solutions an-
swering more complex requirements.
He will see that between these sim-
ple and compound elements is a bond,
a gradual progress, an achievement in
which all civilizations have co-operat-
ed, and which continues to obey the
eternal law of evolution. Nothing ar-
tistic must escape his investigations.
He may have preferences and aver-
sions but never should connect himself
to one style or one epoch. He must
especially not fear to become ac-
quainted with our modern problems
on the ground that they defy artistic
treatment: that would then mean sur-
rendering before the battle. If right-
ly prepared, he will be equally inter-
ested in the scientific and the artistic
solution of a problem, he will have
started right, and to continue without
danger through the field of creation
it will be only necessary to walk
straight before him. Let him use his
eyes, get into the world about him, ex-
plore in the artistic domain, absorb
everything possible. All these acquir-
ed impressions will classify them-
selves and some day he will produce
the artistic creation as a result of
these efforts and of all the inspiration
he has received through the medium
of his studies.
One must look straight at the' real-
ities. Today the architect is asked to
be a broadly educated man, combin-
ing taste, artistic feeling, imagination,
knowledge, critical ability, fecundity
of resources, and will. What his pre-
decessors had to solve as difficulties
are nothing compared to the problems
laid before him. He must know and
learn more and more. The modern
architect must be a man of science in
all which concerns construction and its
application, a man of science also in
his thorough knowledge of all the in-
heritance of Architecture, and an ar-
tist in an art which concentrates, dom-
inates, and associates all the other
arts. There is no nobler career, but
there is none more arduous. Nothing
less is required than the combination
of the most varied faculties working
harmoniously in the triple domain of
thought, science, and art.
The crucial period for the student
is the time when his ideals are form-
ing. Being then constantly guided
by his instructors in an intimate and
friendly collaboration, he must put the
utmost of himself into his work so
that even the least problem may be
perfectly mastered. In his art, the
smallest detail may in certain circum-
stances become of capital importance.
He must endeavor to grasp the prin-
ciples before leaving the college, for
once his studies are finished, there
will remain but one judge, one coun-
sellor, one critic,—himself.

THE TWELVE-WEEK SUMMER
SCHOOL
At the present there is a great
shortage of technically trained men.
The engineering schools of the coun-
try are not turning out graduates fast
enough to fill the ever increasing num-
ber of vacancies. In order to shorten
the length of time required for com-
pleting the courses of study, the facul-
ty of the Department of Engineering
of the University of Michigan have
suggested the proposition of a twelve-
week Summer School, to take the place
of the regular eight-week session.
This would enable the students to ob-
tain about fourteen semester-hours of
credit instead of the regular eight or
nine. Under this system, a man at-
tending Summer School regularly
during his course would be able to
graduate in three years. This scheme,
if adopted, would not be permanent,
necessarily, as the purpose of it mere-
ly to more quickly supply the demands
created by the present crisis.
The feeling of the students towards
such an action has been sounded, and
on the whole it seems to be entirely
favorable. It seems that it would be
no more than the patriotic duty of
every student who is at liberty to do
so, to take advantage of this extended
summer session if it is put into effect.
EXGI&gt;EERS' NATIONAL WAB
CONVENTION
The Fourth Annual Convention of
the American Association of Engi-
neers, meeting jointly with the Com-
mittee on Engineering Co-Operation,
will be held at the City Club of Chi-
cago on Tuesday, May 14. 1918. Del-
egates from all National, State, and
Local Engineering societies in the
United States have been invited to the
meeting, and will take part in the
program, the slogan of which is:
"W H A T M ORE C A N E N-
GINEERS DO TO WIN THE
WAR."
The meeting will review return re-
ports of questionaires sent to all
societies; and will consider: how far
societies can avoid duplication and can
co-ordinate activities during the period
of war; the advisability of uniform
legislation for licensing engineers;
the present and near future demand
and supply of technical men for war
work; and the advisability of a cen-
tral co-operative employment agency
to prevent the tax of commissions on
engineers employed for government
work. It is also desired that this ses-
sion determine to what extent engi-
neers can help speed ship-building and
report what departments of the Army
or Navy need technical men at pres-
ent.
The annual election of officers and
directors of the American Associa-
tion of Engineers will also take place.
Major Gardner S. Williams, '99, is
to give the principle address. He will
speak on "National Organization
Work."
BOOK REVIEW
Essentials of Physics for College Stu-
dents. Cloth; 5^x9 in. A text-
book for undergraduates and a
lecture course and reference work
for teachers and other students of
physics. By Daniel W. Hering. C.
E.,' Ph.D., LL.D. of New York
University. X pp. 367. Price $1.75.
This book, now appearing in a sec-
ond and enlarged edition revised by
the author, has several changes which


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
no doubt will enhance its value. "The
original purpose has been to present
the principles of physics in a reason-
ably complete form, so selected as to
round out the information of a well-
educated man who is not aiming to
qualify as an engineer or technical ex-
pert, but who nevertheless desires to
be well informed in this branch of
science." The author has aimed there-
fore to produce a general work of sta-
bility, one which, assumably, he be-
lieves will present all the essentials in
the study of physics for some time to
come. From the point of view of an
engineering student at Michigan, it is
truly a helpful volume to have at hand
or in the library.
Well illustrated with diagrams and
line drawings the book is thoroughly
complete and clear. The binding is
plain but good, the type large and
clear, and the arrangement of material
well planned.

ence Committee of the Engineering College) a complete note of yourself?

J. T. DICKINSON. "20, Editor
THE United States is at war and is fight-
ing for a just cause. Moreover this
country is fighting for its existence just
as much as are its European allies.
We all realize the above, to some extent
at least, but we have not all really come
right down to cases and figured out just
what this war means to our individual
selves. If we think as much of this country
as did those who founded it we will show
that there are still true Americans in this
United States. If we are Americans, we
will do this now and act accordingly. It
is time that we should.
SWING OUT
The annual Senior Swing Out was held
this year on Saturday afternoon, April 27.
President Hutchins addressed the Seniors
assembled in University Hall on a topic con-
cerning the effect of the war on their lives
and their duty towards their country, in
the present crisis. He showed them how
they were confronted with an extraordinary
task, that of deciding how they could best
serve their country and then after they had
made the decision of executing it to the
best of their ability. After President Hutch-
ins. Prof. Charles Cestre, French exchange
lecturer of Harvard, told of the part which
America is taking in the war and of the
part which this country must play in the
future in order that the war may be brought
to a successful close. Following this the
Invocation and Benediction were offered
by Rev. A. W. Stalker. The exercises
were concluded by the playing of America
by the Varsity band. The Seniors then
marched from U-Hall about the Campus
and formed the traditional Block "M."
NATIONAL SERVICE
A student in the Colleges of Engineering
and architecture, of the University of Mich-
igan has many opportunities to fit himself
for national service. There arc many
special courses which will prepare stu-
dents for good positions in the Army or
Navy and ensure rapid promotion for cap-
able and earnest workers. Some of these
will be described below.
Officers' Reserve Corps
Under General Orders 49, of the War
department, an Officers' Reserve Corps is
maintained at the University of Michigan.
Students are not required to enter this
corps, but after they have once started, they
Copy intended for publication in this department should be in the hands of the Editor
on or before the following dates:—
For March issue February 12 For October issue October 1
For May issue April 12 For December issue... .November 12
Copy may be mailed, or taken in person, to the offices of The Michigan Technic,
269-271 Engineering Building, Ann Arbor, Mich.
Manuscript, photographs, or other copy will not be returned unless specifically re-
quested.
Ms. should be on 8yi x 11 paper, typewritten, with double space between lines.
Phtographs should be on glossy paper, and mailed.flat.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
must continue the work until graduation,
or at least finish the two year course. On
completion of the full course the student
will be eligible for a commission in the
Officers' Reserve Corps.
Enlisted Engineer Reserve Corps
This corps has already been described
quite fully in a previous issue of this maga-
zine but a few of the details will be re-
peated here.
Students who are candidates for a degree
in Engineering or Architecture may apply
for admission into the Enlisted Engineer
Reserve Corps and finish their course be-
fore they are called for active service in
the Engineer Corps of the Army. Scholar-
ship, personality, physique, experience and
efficiency determine the fitness of the can-
didates.
Naval Reserve Force
Students over 18 years of age who are
physically qualified may enroll in the Naval
Reserve, Class 4, for general service as
seamen, second class. They "will not be
called to active duty until they are graduat-
ed, except in case of great emergency,
which emergency the Bureau of Navigation
does not forsee."
On graduation these students will be
"examined and re-rated according to their
ability and requirements of the service."
Sanitary Engineering
At the request of the Medical depart-
ment of the army an intensive course cov-
ering about one year has been established
covering the subjects of Water Supply and
Purification, Sewage and Garbage Disposal,
Camp Sanitation, Bacteriology and Water
Analysis. This course is open to Seniors
in Civil and Chemical Engineering, and to
students of other institutions who have had
the necessary foundation in mathematics,
mechanics, and chemistry. All of the men
taking the course who have enlisted during
the year 1917-1918 have been appointed
sergeants in the Sanitary Engineering
Corps.
Ten men who finished the course but re-
cently have been ordered to report for ac-
tive duty at Washington. For a short time
they will do duty at the Walter Reed gen-
eral hospital at Takome Park, Washington,
but later will be sent into foreign service.
Ballistics
This course deals with the characteris-
tics of modern guns and projectiles, the
problems involved in the theoretical and
experimental study of the flight of pro-
jectiles, and the calculation and use of
range tables. Its object is to give the stu-
dents the methods used and the problems
arising in the handling of guns of all sizes.
Radio Communication
A course is given in Radio Communica-
tion, under instructions from the Chief
Signal Officer, U. S. A., which prepares
men for doing engineering work, for re-
search, or for giving instruction in the
practical operation of radio apparatus,
either in the army or in civil service. In-
struction is given in sending and receiving
messages by means of the dots and dashes
of the general service code.
Special Short Course in Naval
Architecture
From April 1 to the end of the semester
a course in Naval Architecture will be
taught, covering the principles of buoyancy,
flotation, stability, resistance and propul-
sion, and structural arrangements. The
course will consist of drawing and calcula-
tions, and will require at least fifty hours
in the class room and one hundred hours of
drafting. The course is offered at the re-
quest of the government and will probably
be repeated in 1918-19. It is open to
Senior students of the Colleges of Engi-
neering and Architecture only.
The Civil Service Commission and the
Assistant Secretary of the Navy report
that there is an urgent need for ship drafts-
men. The Assistant Secretary says furth-
er: "It would undoubtedly be possible to
appoint these students as draftsmen under
the Navy Department upon completion of
their course, and I may further say that in
case of draftsmen in the Navy Department
who are Registrants, requests may be made
upon their local boards for their transfer


117
to the Emergency Fleet Classification List,
which is the same thing as total exemption
from the draft so long as you are em-
ployed."
Navigation
This course, scheduled as Astronomy 22,
consists of lectures and laboratory work,
giving the principles of piloting, dead
reckoning, and nautical astronomy.
Gas Engine Practice
Besides the above, there are several
special courses in gas engine practice. These
courses consist of advanced work in the
study and design of many kinds of en-
gines and are open only to students or
others who are far advanced in this line of
work.
The Naval Auxiliary Reserve Unit
The second group of the Naval Auxiliary
Reserve Unit, made up of ninety men left
here on March 18th for Cleveland, ac-
companied by Lieut. Clark. Since arriving
there they have been taking the regulation
land training work consisting mainly of the
study of navigation. After finishing the
course in Cleveland they will go to the
Great Lakes Naval Training Station, and
from there to ships on the Atlantic where
they will receive their final training. On
completing the course they will be allowed
to take the examinations for an ensign's
commission. The second group of Mich-
igan men have a reputation to live up to,
as the first group from here have succeeded
in passing the examinations to a man.
The Naval Auxiliary Reserve Unit was
organized to supply officers to man the
government-owned merchantment, colliers,
tankers, supply ships, and other fleet aux-
iliaries.
DRAFTED AERO MECHANICS TAKE
COURSES IN ENGINEERING
SHOPS
On Monday. April 15, 1918, one hundred
and ninety-nine drafted men arrived in
Ann Arbor to take a special shop course to
be given by the University. They were
sent by the government to be instructed in
rudimentary carpentry and machine work
so that they may be able to do quick re-
pairing back of the firing line in France.
The course of instruction is definitely
prescribed by the government through a
special committee on war training com-
posed of members of the Federal Board on
Vocational Education. As a result the
various instructors are able to teach the
men with a higher degree of efficiency.
Although the University officials have no
authoritative word as to the number of
these courses to be offered, it is probable
that they will be continued for the dura-
tion of the war.
The men represented in this contingent
are nearly all from Michigan, one hundred
and fifty of them hailing from Detroit.
The men have been chosen by the draft
boards on the basis of the Questionnaires
sent in by themselves. Although the work
has been going on for only a short time
all of the men seem to be interested and
are showing considerable talent. The in-
structors report that they are pleased with
the grade of work being turned out. The
men receive drill daily and are under very
severe military discipline.
The west wing of the shop building has
been equipped for instruction in mounting
and repairing guns. Some other equip-
ment was also necessary such as shop
benches, tools, and several kinds of motors.
Among the motors is included one Liberty
motor. Fifty of the men are receiving
training in gunsmithy and bench work,
fifty in gas engine mechanics, thirty-four
in machine operation, twenty-five in black-
smithy, and forty in carpentry. The men
occupy the shops eight hours per day for
five and one-half days each week. The
entire course covers eight weeks.
The drafted men, during their stay in
Ann Arbor are housed in five vacant resi-
dences owned by the University and receive
their meals at the Union. The University,
through a committee of which Prof. Hig-
bie is chairman, supplies the heat, light,
and water, while the government furnishes
the bedding and other equipment. The
agreement which the University has made
with the government is at such a rate as


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
will insure the University against loss and
yet give it little or no profit.
Captain Durkee is in command of the
detachment and is assisted by Lieutenants
Millberry, Hall, and Godfrey. They have
their headquarters at 1145 Washtenaw Ave.
ORDNANCE COURSE
The class which completed its course on
April 20 did not start on the date sched-
uled for it to begin owing to a delay in
the arrival of the men from the supply
depots. The new system of inducting the
men into the course requires that each man
be examined and outfitcd before he arrives
here at Ann Arbor, and it was due to some
confusion at the depots that the men were
late in arriving.
Major Bursley, formerly head of the
ordnance course at this University, has
been called by the government to Washing-
ton where he has assumed control of all
the ordnance teaching work being done in
the country. He has the superintendence
of the schools in the various Universities
and in private industrial plants, besides
direct control of a school in Washington
for training clerks, typists, and stenog-
raphers for use in the ordnance depart-
ment.
The next course was due to start here
on April 27 but orders were received on
April 20 which caused the discontinuance
of the school here. The orders did not
state just what would be the policy of the
government as regards such work in the
future but it is expected that this informa-
tion will soon be received.
MORE MECHANICS TO BE
TRAINED HERE
In addition to the two hundred drafted
men at present being trained in the engi-
neering shops it is expected now that sev-
eral hundred more will soon arrive here
to take the course being offered by the
University. The University authorities re-
cently sent a signed contract to Washing-
ton which provides for the training of five
hundred men and it is expected that the
authorities at Washington will take im-
mediate steps towards fulfilling their end
of it.
The five hundred men are expected to
arrive here about June 15 and will be quar-
tered in Waterman gymnasium. The Union
will feed the men, giving them the regular
ration as prescribed by the government for
garrisons. The course starting June 15
will last till August 15 and will consist for
the main part in the teaching of auto re-
pair work. The location of Ann Arbor
makes it especially advantageous for the
teaching of this kind of work since the men
can be taken frequently to Detroit where
the construction work can be viewed in
the greatest automobile factories of the
world.
If the government decides to send more
men here, the University is prepared to
build a temporary building of the canton-
ment type in which to house the men and,
if necessary, to provide quarters for them
in the new Union building. It is estimated
that at least 1.500 men could be provided
for in this way.
Prof. Philip B. Woodworth has charge
of the vocational training for drafted men
in this district and was here recently, in-
specting the University's facilities for the
training of mechanics. He is reported as
stating that Michigan should be the train-
ing center for all army automobile mech-
anics in the central division of the country.
If the plans at present being formed in this
line are carried out, and undoubtedly they
will, Michigan will have added a little more
to the list of things she is doing to help
Uncle Sam win the war.
AMERICAN UNIVERSITY UNION
IN EUROPE
Over the entrance to an attractive build-
ing at 8 rue de Richelieu, Paris. France, is
the sign "American University Union."
The building was formerly known as the
Royal Palace Hotel till an influential
American University man started a move-
ment which resulted in the occupation of


119
the building by what is known today as the
American University Union of Europe.
The American University now establish-
ed in Paris is really the result of two move-
ments, one in Europe and the other here
in the United States. The two movements
have united and are now acting towards
the same end, namely: to meet the needs
of American University and College men
who are at present in Europe helping the
Allies to win the war. The following are
some of the specific purposes of the Union:
To provide at moderate cost a home with
the privileges of a simple club for University
men passing through Paris or in Paris on
a furlough; To co-operate with and pro-
vide a hearquarters for the various bureaus
already established; To aid friends and
relatives to get in touch with the men.
Among the privileges are an information
bureau, a writing and reading room, liv-
ing accommodations, social features, op-
portunities for physical recreation, enter-
tainments, medical advice and many other
such things which go far towards making
the life over there more enjoyable.
One of the movements which led to the
establishment of the Union was started by
American College men who met in Paris
and formed what they called The American
University Alumni Association in France.
Among those present were representatives
of the following Universities: Columbia,
Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Michigan,
Pennsylvania, Princeton, Massachusetts In-
stitute of Technology, Williams, and Yale.
The main object of this association was
to co-operate with the American Univer-
sities for the general well being of Amer-
ican College men in France.
After numerous conferences with the
Red Cross, the International Committee
of the Young Men's Christian Association,
and the War Department, a meeting was
called at the University Club, New York
City, July 15, 1917, in order to establish
the American University Union in Europe.
At this meeting a constitution was drawn
up, officers were elected, and it was decid-
ed to have a Representative Board of Trus-
tees in America, a small executive com-
mittee in Paris, and an Advisory Council
made up of American University men liv-
ing in France and representative College
men. Among those elected to the Board of
Trustees was President Hutchins, of the
University of Michigan, who received the
position of vice-chairman.
The Union as established in Paris has
met with such success that a branch has
been started in London. Although this
Union was established for the benefit of
the men during the war, it is hoped and
believed that it will be kept up after the
war. If this were done it might be a fac-
tor in influencing American men to go to
Europe to put the finishing touches upon
their education.
WAR CORRESPONDENCE COMMITTEE
The War Correspondence Committee
originated by the Engineering Society has
already produced results in the form of
about six hundred postals concerning the
whereabouts of Michigan engineers in the
service. These postals have all been filed
and the information obtained from them is
given in another department of this maga-
zine. It is hoped and expected that this in-
formation will go far towards letting the
men know where they can find their old
classmates and friends. Even though the
men cannot in the majority of cases get to
see one another it is at least of interest to
know what the other fellows are doing.
ATHLETICS
Basketball
The basketball season ended without the
winning of a Conference game but even
with this result the season cannot be con-
sidered as entirely unsuccessful. The team
fought for a place in the fastest basketball
circuit of the country and even though it
failed to come off victors in any one of
these games, it put up a game fight in every
one. No game was won without a struggle
and Michigan students are looking for-
ward to the games of the next season with
hopes of revenge and confidence in a better
record.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Track
The track team turned out by Coach
Farrell this season has proved to be 'one
of the best in years. Although material
was somewhat scarce "Steve" has given us
a. team which has still to go down to defeat.
The team is well balanced but neverthe-
less boasts of individual stars. This is the
sort of a bunch which the coach has long
been looking forward to and the way the
men have performed shows the results of
"Steve's" careful work.
Up to the present time the team has par-
ticipated in three meets with the results
shown below:
March 12—Notre Dame. Michigan 57;
Notre Dame 38.
March 16—Chicago here. Michigan 57;
Chicago 20.
March 23—Conference Meet at North-
western. Michigan first with forty-two
points.
There still remains one meet to be held.
This is the outdoor meet which is to take
place with Notre Dame on May 18.
The first meet of the season was held at
South Bend with Notre Dame on March
12. This meet consisted of eleven events,
and the Michigan tracksters came home with
nine first places, losing only the shot put
and the forty-yard dash. Johnson, Mich-
igan's brightest star this season, showed
up well in this meet, getting three firsts.
After the Notre Dame meet the captain
for the 1918 squad was elected. "Red"
Donnelly, distance runner, and the only
"M" man on the team was chosen for this
position by a unanimous vote.
The second meet was held in Waterman
gymnasium and was attended by a large
crowd of students who turned out to see
Michigan make her re-entrance into Con-
ference track circles. As the score of 57-20
shows, the meet was considerably one-sided,
Chicago getting only two firsts, the mile
and the quarter mile. Chicago's star relay
team went down to defeat at the hands of
"Steve" Farrell's tracksters as the final
•event after an exciting race.
An all-Conference meet was held at
Northwestern on March 23 in which the
Michigan track men again demonstrated
their superiority over anything which the
other Conference teams had to offer. In
this meet Johnson, Michigan star, tied the
Conference records for both the fifty-yard
dash and the sixty-yard high hurdles. He
also won the high jump. As a return to
Big Ten competition this meet makes up
in track for what we did not do in basket-
ball.
Baseball
Coach Lundgren has produced a base-
ball squad this year which has proved it-
self to be one of the best of many seasons.
The team is well balanced and has been
showing a fight and pep which if kept up
will carry it through the season with a
record to be envied. Thus far but one de-
feat has been endured and there seems to
be no good reason why that one should
have turned out the way it did.
The opening game on April 20 with
Western Reserve proved to be but a prac-
tice bout for the Wolverines, the final score
being seventeen to one. The following
game with Case turned out very similar
but gave the Varsity a little more practice.
Chicago was here for two games on May
3-4 and offered the Michigan ball tossers
the first real competition of the season. In
the first of these games, Ruzicka piloted the
Varsity to a one to nothing victory after the
struggle which consisted mainly of a pitch-
er's duel. The next day in the second
game with Chicago the team went down
to their first and only defeat thus far after
playing a loose game which was not at all
to be compared with the high class work
exhibited in the preceding game. The re-
sult of this game was, Chicago seven, Mich-
igan three.
The following Wednesday, May 8, the
team journeyed to Indiana where it handed
the Hoosiers a six to nothing beating. On
Saturday of the same week Iowa came here
and underwent a defeat at the hands of the
Varsity to the tune of two to nothing.
Mixed in with the above games M. A. C.
was met twice with results which did noth-
ing but fatten the batting averages of the
Wolverines and gave the Michigan rooters
a chance to crow a little.


121
On May 20, 11linois came here with a
good team and the leadership of the Con-
ference. They left that night still with the
same good team but left behind them the
honor of heading the list of Conference
teams. Michigan assumed this lead by dint
of hard slugging of what Klein, 11linois'
star hurler, had to offer and Ruzicka's good
work in the box. The score was eight and
four.
soldiers went out for them with much en-
thusiasm. The competition was inter-
company and there existed at all times a
keen rivalry for the honors.

R. O. T. C. Athletics
There have been no interclass athletics
this year, these events having been replaced
by competitive games conducted by Doctor
May for the members of the R. O. T. C.
Doctor May announces that these games
have been entirely successful and that the
ior work of the Union is also now practical-
ly finished and the interior work has been
started. The concrete work of the Library
was held up for some time this winter be-
cause of the extremely severe weather, but
has been completed now and the building
has begun to assume a definite form. It is
not known just when the two buildings will
be finished but work will be continued on
both during the summer.
THE OPERA
The first Michigan opera to be partici-
pated in by women has now gone down in
history and all things seem to indicate that
it will be the last of such a nature. The
portrayal of the characters as written by


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Mr. Weeks appears to have been as suc-
cessfully carried out by the women as by
the men but the general opinion prevailing
on the campus after the staging of the
show seems to be strong for the taking of
all roles by men.
A senior engineer is quoted as follows:
"I have attended the last four operas and
without doubt this year's opera is the poor-
est of the four. This is partly due to the
war with the resulting loss of talent, but
this is not the cause of all the shortcomings.
The staging was not up to par and many
troit, Kalamazoo, and Battle Creek. The
show was rehearsed many times after it
was put on here and changed to some ex-
tent and it was reported that the trip was
in general entirely successful.
Faculty Men Work on Aeroplane
Motors
Prof. Clyde E. Wilson has recently com-
pleted a report for the government on the
stresses which are set up in the crank-
shaft of the new Liberty motor. Mr. Hi. A.
Side View of Construction on Library
obvious chances to improve the plot were
missed. Most of the jokes "fell flat." The
principals carried their parts as well as
could be expected. The chorus men per-
formed as well as in past operas but the
chorus girls were far below the usual
standard when men were taking the girls'
parts. There was not a single appearance
of the chorus that will be remembered
as in past operas. For example, who will
ever forget the formation of the chorus in
the presentation of "Men of the Maize and
Blue" of "Tres Rouge." In the future war
operas let us have men in both the men
and women choruses but if necessary have
the women take the principal female parts."
The trip this year included stops at De-
Hicks, instructor in mechanical engineer-
ing, was for some time at the Packard
motor car factory in Detroit where the
motor is being tried out. Mr. Hicks assist-
ed Prof. Wilson, and is now working under
the direction of Major Hall, signal corps,
U. S. A., who with Lieut. Col. Vincent of
the same service, designed the motor.
Many other engineering faculty members,
are also engaged from time to time on work
concerning the new motor.
Lieut. Mullen reports that five hundred
and twenty-five members of the local R. O.
T. C. have left the corps since school start-
ed last fall for some branch of the army
or navy. The c ,rps originally consisted of"


123
a few over seventeen hundred but this num-
ber has gradually dwindled down until
there remain at present only twelve hun-
dred.
The R. O. T. C. was informally inspected
a short time ago by Major Max G. Garber,
of the United States army. It was re-
ported that the cadets are progressing sat-
isfactorily and that although there are still
some imperfections the drilling is as a
whole very good.
can be saved in one year, on the reduction
in cost of materials, to pay for the cost of
a new plate.
A. I. E. E.
A joint meeting of the Detroit Engi-
neering Society and the American Institute
of Electrical Engineers was held Friday,
March IS, at the Detroit Board of Com-
merce Building at Detroit.
The subject of the meeting was "Electric
Equipment and Electric Drive for Battle-
ships," and the speaker was Mr. Eskill
Berg, of the turbine engineering depart-
ment of the General Electric Company.
Mr. C. O. Wisler, instructor in Civil En-
gineering, accepted a position with Robert
E. Horton, consulting engineer, of Albany,
N. Y., and left the University May 21. His
work in the new position will be mainly in
connection with cases concerning the New
York State Barge Canal which has recently
been taken over by the government. He
was granted a leave of absence by the
University.
EVENTS
A ruling was made about the middle of
the winter causing the closing of all Uni-
versity buildings at six o'clock each day
and all day each Sunday. E. C. Pardon,
acting superintendent of buildings and
grounds, reported recently that during the
first seven weeks under the new rule a
saving of over three thousand dollars was
made. Since Easter vacation, however, the
buildings have been open as usual.
Along with the above note of a saving
being made it might be said that the grad-
uate school's diplomas are to be smaller in
the future. It is said that sufficient money
Prof. Wood, of the chemical engineering
department recently left for the signal
corps of the army. His resignation was
accepted a short time before he left by the
board of regents.
LECTURE
Dean C. H. Benjamin, of Purdue Uni-
versity, gave a very interesting lecture here
on March 6, concerning the evolution of
machine and engine frames. The talk was
illustrated with lantern slides and as many
here knew Dean Benjamin's record as a
lecturer, the amphitheatre of the Physics
building was packed full for the occasion.
This lecture was one of a series of ex-
change lectures which have been carried
on between Michigan and Purdue for the
last three years.
Prof. J. C. Parker, of this University,
gave the return lecture at Purdue a short
time before Dean Benjamin came here.
Prof. Parker's subject was "Public Utility
Rates."
FIRE IN CHEMICAL LABORATORY
A fire broke out in one of the laboratories
of the chemistry building on March 15,
which caused a loss to the building esti-
mated to be two hundred dollars, and a
further loss of chemicals of about the same
amount. A large scale distillation of ben-
zoic acid was being carried on and the fire
is thought to have started from the electric
heater used in the work. The smoke and
fumes of the burning chemicals gave an
impression of a much larger fire than was
actually in progress and also made the con-
flagration a difficult one to put out.
SUMMER SESSION
A summer session with the attendance
fully up to normal is expected for the com-
ing summer. Many special courses are
being offered and it is thought that there
will be many students here to take ad-
vantage of them.

RESEARCH
MARINE ENGINEERING
Commencing April first a special short
course in Naval Architecture was started
at the request of the Navy Department.
The course is open to Seniors in the Engi-
neering College only, and the object is to
give the men sufficient training to enable
them to take positions with the Navy De-
partment as draftsmen in the Bureau of
Construction and Repairs.
Prof. Sadler has been called to Wash-
ington to take the position of Assistant
Manager of Steel Ship Construction for
the Emergency Fleet Corporation. He has
been granted leave of absence for the dura-
tion of the war. Prof. Bragg will have
charge of the department during this
period.
Investigation relating to simplified forms
of Ships are still being conducted in the
Naval Tank, as well as some other special
problems which have arisen owing to the
present conditions existing in the shipping
situation.
CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
Several problems relating to the devel-
opment of the soya bean oil industry are
under way, under the direction of Dr.
Holley. Mr. Wong is studying the prob-
lem of so bleaching the oil that it will
be available as a food oil. Mr. Chen and
Mr. Lim are also working on other phases
of the utilization of this oil or its by-
products.
Under Prof. Badger's directions, the first
of the evaporators for the new Chemical
Enginering laboratory is being installed in
the old Boiler House and will soon be in
operation. This cannot yet be considered
a piece of research, but it represents the
apparatus for some very extensive large-
scale research that will be commenced as
soon as all arrangements are completed.
Mr. A. W. Laird, K. T. Wong, and S. T.
Page are assisting in the work in the labor-
atory. It is hoped that within a month
actual experimental work will be begun.
Prof. Laird is continuing his work on
clay free from iron for pots for the manu-
facture of optical glass; and on the oxida-
tion of nitrogen, both mentioned in the
last issue of The Technic. The work on
iron-free clays has been very promising,
and definite results are hoped for very
soon. This is being assisted by Mr. Simp-
son, Mr. Fettig, and Mr. Benkelman.
Prof. Brier has taken up a new war prob-
lem, the question of obtaining toluene from
spruce turpentine. This turpentine is a
by-product in the manufacture of paper
pulp from spruce wood, and has little value
as such. It is very closely related, chem-
ically, to toluene, the substance from which
the well known "TNT" is made, and of
which there is at present a considerable
shortage. Mr. Snow is working on this,
but the problem has just been started and
little has been done as yet.
Prof. Smart and Mr. Zimmerli are con-
tinuing the work on aluminium alloys which
has been going on all this year in the metal-
lurgical department. They are assisted by
Mr. Cherry, Mr. Pratt, and Mr. Norton.
They also have been investigating the
copper-nickel bands used on shells to grip
the rifling grooves in the gun. There has
been some trouble in shell plants due to
irregularities in this material. They have
also done some work on a problem relating
to the tempering of steel for shells, referred
to them by Maj. A. E. White.
The situation in this country with regard
to the need for chemists and chemical en-
gineers is one which has never been paral-
leled. The department has now on file
applications for men for such positions
which total between 325 and 350 men.
Most of these are for munitions plants,
principally for explosives plants, tho some
are for metal-working plants making shells,
etc. To meet this demand there will be
graduated in June only 15 men, most of
whom are already signed up. The uncer-
tainty of the relation of most of the posi-
tions offered, to the draft laws is the prin-
cipal drawback. Men in the Engineers Re-
serve can be transferred to the Government
nitrate plants under Lt.-Col. A. H. White.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
It is not only the prospect of plenty of
positions at most unusual salaries that
prompts the Department to make this an-
nouncement and to urge all who have any
interest in Chemistry or Chemical Engi-
neering to consider taking up this work.
There is also the fact that many important
war industries are going to be seriously
hampered by being absolutely unable to get
trained men at any price; so that men who
go into- this work and train themselves for
Chemical Engineering positions are doing
the country a real service. There are not
nearly enough men in the country trained
along these lines to fill the openings that
are being created by the building of new
and badly-needed plants. The pros-
pects are reasonable that after the war
there will be such an increased apprecia-
tion of the value of such men, that the shut-
ting down of the strictly war plants will
not result in the market being flooded with
men out of employment.
Another result is an increasing demand
for women chemists. Tho the work a wo-
man can do in strictly chemical engineer-
ing lines is rather limited, the chemical
field holds many openings which a woman
is well fitted to fill.
PHYSICS DEPARTMENT
The Magnetization of Iron in the
Absence of Hysteresis
Dr. Winthrop R. Wright
The magnetic characteristics of five
steels, arranged in decreasing order of car-
bon content, were obtained at temperatures
ranging from 20° C to the magnetic trans-
formation point. In order to obtain a
single magnetization curve at a given tem-
perature rather than the usual hysteresis
loop, hysteresis was suppressed by super-
posing upon the magnetizing field an alter-
nating field which was gradually reduced to
zero. The magnetization obtained in this
way depended only upon the applied mag-
netizing field and in no way upon the pre-
vious magnetic history of the specimen.
The specimens were made in the form of
elongated ellipsoids and were magnetized
within a long solenoid. A magnetometer
was employed to measure the magnetiza-
tion obtained. The specimen was heated
electrically and its temperature observed
with a platinum resistance thermometer.
The anhysteretic magnetization curve at
a given temperature has three characteris-
tics distinguishing it from the ordinary
magnetization curves. The curve has no
point of inflection, its slope at the origin is
aparently infinite, and it does not intersect
any other curve taken for a second tempera-
ture. Test was made of empirical equa-
tions which have been proposed for anhys-
teretic magnetization and it was found that
these represented the curves only very ap-
proximately.
HIGHWAY ENGINEERING
Research Work in the Highway
Laboratory
By John J. Cox
The Highway Laboratory during the pres-
ent school year has in addition to its regu-
lar work undertaken three important prob-
lems in research. These three problems
undertaken came to us by way of sugges-
tion and from three different sources.
Study and investigation for one of these
problems was made possible by a gift, in
the way of a fellowship in Highway Engi-
neering, made by Mr. Chapin, President
of the Hudson Motor Car Co., of Detroit.
On providing a fellowship at the Univer-
sity, Mr. Chapin suggested that a thorough
investigation and study be made in the
field of paved surfaces, such as are used
on country roads. To determine if possible
the relative economy of such surfaces and
information as to their behavior under
traffic.
Mr. E. E. Blomgren was granted this
fellowship and the work started in the fall
of 1916. The work was carried on dur-
ing the school year of 1916-1917 and all of
the present school year of 1017-1018. Con-
siderable information as to cost of con-
struction, cost of maintainance and life of
paved surfaces has been collected from all
available sources. This data has been


127
analyzed, classified and reduced t) a com-
mon basis so that comparison can be made .
with some degree of satisfaction. Studies
have been made of traffic, effect of traf-
fic, etc.
About the middle of the school year of
1916-1917, we were able to obtain a loan
from the City of Detroit, of the Paving
Determinator (a machine used for wear-
ing out pavement) designed and built by
that city in 1912. After this machine had
been erected and placed in operating condi-
tion, we undertook the study of wear on
different kinds of paved surfaces and on
different kinds of construction using the
same kind of surfacing material. On ac-
count of the time necessary to construct,
cure or season, and to wear out the pave-
ment, we have only been able to study
two different types to date, namely con-
crete and brick. The information collect-
ed under this study will be available about
July 1, 1918.
Another problem in research was under-
taken at the suggestion of the Koehring
Machine Co. of Milwaukee, Wis. This
Company presented to the University, for
the use of the Highway Laboratory, a con-
crete mixer of the batch type and capacity
of 10 cubic feet, with the suggestion that
work be undertaken to determine the prop-
er length of time to mix concrete in such
a machine to obtain maximum strength
within a permissable cost of mixing.
This work was undertaken by Mr. R. C.
Gore, instructor in Civil Engineering, dur-
ing the last part of the school year of 1916-
1917. The results obtained were not satis-
factory and it was decided to undertake
this investigation on a large scale during
the school year of 1917-1918. Accordingly
about 1,200 six-inch cubes were made un-
der as near standard conditions as possible
except time of mixing. The time of mix-
ing was varied from 10 seconds up to and
including one hour. After curing for 24
hours in moist air and 28 to 90 days
buried in wet sand, they were broken by
compression. Data on this work will also
be available about July 1.
The third problem in research was un-
dertaken for the Michigan State Highway
Department. This problem consists in de-
termining the distribution of loads on a
highway bridge with a 16 feet roadway
and a 16 feet span. The bridge was con-
structed in the laboratory under our 200-
ton capacity bridge-testing machine and
according to plans and specifications of the
State Highway Department for their stand-
ard bridge of this size. This bridge was
built by placing a 6-inch reinforced con-
crete floor slab on top of five 12-inch I
beams.
The bridge at this time is not quite old
enough to submit to test. It is the inten-
tion to load this bridge in various ways and
determine the effect of the loads by use of
a strain gauge.
The Highway Laboratory has also un-
dertaken the compilation of data collected
on all road work done by the Michigan
State Highway Department, particularly on
paved roads. This data will be available
for study at some future date.
It is not known to what extent the war
will affect our research work in another
year. Indications are that less will have
to be done on account of the lack of money
and men available. It is to be regretted
that this work can not be continued since
we are just nicely getting started and
there are so many phases of highway con-
struction and maintenance we know so
little about, the solution of which would
be a money saver to the public.

Some important changes have been made
in the programs in architecture. These
have been considered during the past year
and are based on a desire for fewer and
more intensive courses of study; the rend-
ering more uniform of the requirements
in programs I and II, and the obtaining of
more hours for electives in programs I,
II and III.
Eight or ten hours of electives will now
i&gt;e available in programs I, II and III, mak-
ing it possible for architectural students to
«lect more cultural work in normal times,
while under present conditions, they can
arrange a group of special courses to fit
themselves for some particular branch of
government service.
In line with the above, and in view of the
great shortage of ship draftsmen, eleven
seniors of the Architectural Department are
taking the special course in Naval Archi-
tecture under Professors Sadler and Bragg.
This course, which began on April first, is
intensive and will continue through to
June, after which the men will be assigned
to some government shipyard or office.
This course has been instituted by the
Navy Department, and the amount of work
has been prescribed by them. The work is
•entirely on steel shipbuilding.
The Freshman class had a hard time get-
ting together this year, but it was finally
accomplished. The following officers were
•elected:
President—W. Pcattie
Vice-President—A. Roemer
Treasurer—J. C. Goddyne
Secretary—J. Evarts
Sergeant-at-Arms—R. Ward.
R. S. Gerganoff, '17, B.S. in Architecture,
has been appointed to the faculty of North-
western University, to teach one hundred
men sent to that institution by the U. S.
Government. The instruction is the same
as that given to the two hundred men sent
to this institution by the government in
connection with the Aero service. Mr.
Gerganoff was an instructor in manual
training before coming to this University.
J. D. Kenyon, ex-'i8, has been commis-
sioned a First Lieutenant in the Aviation
Corps, and sailed for France on April
seventeenth.
Professor Sidney F. Kimball, of the Ar-
chitectural Department, has written a new
History of Architecture. MacMillan and
Company, of New York City, are the pub-
lishers.
Owing to the large number of men in
service, The American Institute of Archi-
tects, has withdrawn its medal, which it
presents every year, to the best all around
student in Architecture during his four
years. The medal is awarded only to stu-
dents attending an institution on the ap-
proved list of the association.
The College of Architecture is conduct-
ing special problems in housing, to pre-
pare students to go into this form of work
for the government. An entire industrial
town is being planned with all business,
public, domestic, and industrial buildings
required. The United States government
has appropriated one hundred millions of
dollars for the housing of employees of
special industries connected with war pre-
paration.


THE MICHIGAN THCHNIC
Mr. C. H. Whittaker, editor of the Amer-
ican Institute of Architects' Journal, who
has been making a special study for the
U. S. Government of housing conditions
will speak before the University on a date
to be announced later. The subject will be
"Industrial Housing and Planning."
Tau Sigma Delta," Architectural Honor-
ary Fraternity, elected the following: Leo
Hosman, Stanley Mills, Hiram Hamer,
and Miss Clara Stimson. This Fraternity
elects its members from the departments of
of Architecture and Landscape Design, and
is based upon high scholarship, personality,
and general all-round ability.
The Alpha chapter is at the University
of Michigan, it having been organized in
1914. During the last few years it has
expanded to several other universities.
Chapters have been installed at the Uni-
versity of Minnesota, University of 11linois,
and at Syracuse University. Chapters are
only being considered in colleges and uni-
versities, whose departments of architec-
ture and landscape design are of recognized
standing.
When the Michigan unit of the Naval
Auxiliary left last month, three men from
the Architectural Department were num-
bered among them. The men who left are
Samuel Wiener, Herbert Schmitz, and
James H. Foskett. Word has been received
from these men that they are enjoying their
work, although it is- quite hard, and that
they soon expect to be on the training ships
on the Lakes.
Glen E. Routier ex-'19, and Anton Doh-
men, ex-'18, are in government service on
ship work. Routier is with the Emergency
Fleet Corporation, while Dohmen is locat-
ed at the Philadelphia Ship Yards.
Mr. Wells I. Bennett, instructor in Ster-
otomy, Mechanism and Drawing in the
Architectural Department, has left the Uni-
versity, for government service on con-
struction work. He has been assigned to
a southern city, where an exceedingly large
terminal is to be constructed.
Some exceedingly fine work is being
done under Leon A. Makielski, instructor
in Free Hand Drawing. Mr. Makielski has
charge of a group on poster design. Dur-
ing the past month several War posters
have been turned in, which show marked
ability of the designers.
Mr. Barnes of the same department, is to
have charge of a class in landscape water
color. The class expects to do most of
its work on the Boulevard, when the weath-
weather permits.
Prof. McConkey's class in advanced
building construction, have taken some in-
teresting trips to large buildings, now in-
construction, where the practical details
were explained to them. In this manner
they receive a physical conception of the
work that they arc deing.


HE WAS WISE
'20—Somebody has been using a pony in
this course.
Prof.—How's that?
'20—I was up at the Library yesterday
and it was gone.
SURE PROOF
Soldier on guard hearing noise—"Halt,
who goes there?"
Voice in distant—"An American, sir."
Soldier—"Advance and sing the Star
Spangled Banner."
Voice—"I can't."
Soldier—"Pass, American."
AIN'T IT RIGHT?
A story is told at Camp Johnson of a
colonel and a day old rookie, who being
desperate for a match, walks up to the
colonel, slapped him on the back, and ad-
dressed him in the following manner, "Say
Pal, can you give a fellow a match?"
The good-natured colonel smiled, hand-
ed him a match, and after saluting the
rookie, walked on.
A trembling bystander using some of his
reserve breath told the rookie the enormity
of his offense. The rookie feeling that he
had courted death and won her made one
jump and was back in front of the colonel.
Saluting, he hastened to exclaim, in a
breathless voice, "Sir-r-I-I-I-I didn't know,
sir, you were the colonel. You see sir, I
just got here today and am not familiar
with all the faces or I wouldn't have asked
you for the match, sir."
The sympathetic colonel, appreciating the
circumstance, said, "That's all right, my
boy, but see that you never do such a thing
to a second-lieutenant."
A first lieutenant, noticing a private pas-
sing by without saluting called him back
and said, "Don't you know that you are
supposed to salute an officer?"
"Yes, sir," replied the guilty private.
"Very well," returned the lieutenant,
"Stand there and salute me fifty times."
A major, happening by, watched the per-
formance with an inside laugh from ear
to ear. As the lieutenant was about to
dismiss the private after the fiftieth salute,
the major stepped up and inquired, "Do
you know, Lieutenant, that an officer must
return every salute?"
"Yes, sir," replied the lieutenant.
"Very well," returned the major, "let's
go.
BATHING SUITS HOOVERIZED
—New York Sun...
Does this mean a "bathing-suitless" day?
ONE PEAL THAT DIDN'T APPEAL
An American traveler, who was slightly
deaf, was riding on top of an omnibus
alongside of an English cockney who was
loudly praising the sights of London. As
the omnibus passed St. Paul's Cathedral
the chimes located there began to peal
forth.
This brought more praise to the lips of
the Englishman. "Did you ever hear such
mellow tones?" he asked of the traveler.
Not hearing, the American leaned over,
put his hand to his ear and exclaimed.
"What's that?"
Again the cockney replied, "Those
chimes over there, don't they fairly carry
your soul to heaven on their ethereal
strains and remind you of the cymbals of
St. Peter when he summons the good
people to the pearly gates?"
Still unable to hear, the traveler, slightly
annoyed, said, "If that eternal noise of
those damn bells over there would stop for
a second I might be able to hear what you
have to say."

ROOFING AND SIDING
is moderate in first cost and involves no main-
tenance or depreciation costs. It is rust-
proof, corrosion-proof, fire-resisting and does
not require painting. It withstands sulphur-
ous gases, acid fumes, alkalies, salt water,
dampness, etc.
These results are obtained by immersing
steel sheets in an asphaltic compound. While
the asphalt is hot, there is imbedded on both
sides and all edges layers of pure asbestos
felt, all completely enveloped within a tough
waterproof coating.
Asbestos Protected Metal combines the
strength of corrugated steel with the long-
evity of asphalt and asbestos. It is the ideal
roofing and siding for all sorts of waterside
and industrial buildings.

Savings Certificates
The men who drive the rivets in our shipyards are told by the
Shipping Board:
Every Rivet You Drive is a Rivet for
America;
Every Rivet You Could Drive but
Don't is a Rivet for Germany.
And the Government says to you:
Every Quarter You Save to Buy a
Thrift Stamp is a Quarter for
America;
Every Quarter You Waste is a
Quarter for Germany.
When you buy a thrift stamp to help your country you are sav-
ing to help yourself.
Sixteen thrift stamps or four dollars and a few cents more will
give you a war savings certificate, which will pay 4% in-
terest compounded four times a year for five years.
The government will pay you back your money with interest at
any time you need it, if you return your war savings certifi-.
cates.
War savings stamps are savings bank accounts in the biggest and
strongest bank in the world—The United States Treasury.
Get the war savings stamp habit. It
will help you to save your money
and it will help America to win the
war.
If you loan your money to the United
States now you won't have to give it
to Germany as tribute when the war
is over.

Come Back a Better Man!
Uncle Sam is giving hint an ewer and better equipment,
in mind and body—fitting him for a bigger, finer life
WHEN that boy of yours comes marching home a Victorious
Crusader, he will be a very different person from the lad you
bravely sent away with a kiss, a tear and a smile.
He will bo strong in body, quick and sure in action, alert
and keen in mind, firm and resolute in character, calm and even-
tempered.
Self-control and self-reliance — ability to think and act in
emergencies — coolness and courage in time of stress and danger—
such will be the product of his training and experience.
Neatness, precision in detail without fuss and worry, prompt-
ness, reliability, scrupulous integrity, thoughtfulness and courtesy
—these things come from army comradeship and discipline.
A broad-shouldered,deep-chested,square-jawed YOUNG MAN
with flashing eyes and a happy smile—that's who will throw him-
celf into your arms when "Johnny Comes Marching Home Again."
That's who is coming back to live his life in happiness with you.
And in his hands—and yours—lies the future of America.
Help him, keep him happy NOW— by cheerful, newsy letters
—for your cake—and for Uncle Sam.

Thero aro other ways to save fuel besides closing down manufacturing
plants. If plants were equipped to burn whatever fuel is least desirable for
other purposes it would prove a great saving. This—the ability to burn any
fuel—is the big feature of
The MURPHY STOKER was the first scientifically right stoker. Burns all
of the gases—it eliminates all smoke waste.
No forced draft is required. On natural draft it will force the boilers up to
200% of their rating.
The MURPHY STOKER feeds the coal and removes the ashes automatically.
It can be adjusted while in operation.
Twenty-five years of unqualified
success proved that the Murphy
principle is correct.
Complete explanation of details

RESTS ON
INDUSTRY
FROM the dictionary of
every red-blooded man
and woman in these
United States the word,
"can't," has been eliminated.
That America CAN—
is proven by the onrush of
our mighty army—an aveng-
ing giant Nemesis of an out-
raged world.
That America CAN—
is demonstrated by the stu-
pendous output of her massed
industries under the spur of
our country's gigantic war re-
quirements.
Yet, like her army, America's
industries are still in leash.
They have not fully extended
themselves. Daily, our huge
production creative powers
reflect the quickening impulse
of a grim national determina-
tion.
And, in practically every
speeding shop and factory
throughout the land, Hoover
Steel Balls—those silent ene-
mies of mechanical friction—
are contributing much to the
potential efficiency of indus-
try, without which, the fighting
arm of this great Democracy
would indeed be paralyzed.
Obviously trade demand governs production
Measured by the unit of H in. balls the output of the Hoover

PHASES OF THE EVOLUTION AND THE
HISTORY OF THE INTERNAL COMBUS-
TION ENGINE
PART B. GAS TURBINES
A. F. GREINER, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF
MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
THE alternating internal combus-
tion engine working on gaseous
fuels, or the reciprocating piston gas
engine has been reviewed previously,
Mich. Tech. Vol. XXVII No. 3. The
continuous internal combustion motor
or the gas turbine will be the subject
of this article.
Of the two types, the latter, al-
though the oldest, is certainly the least
known, and yet appears to have the
richest prospects for the future.
Today, the main purpose of a prop-
erly designed gas turbine is: to com-
bine the important features of the
piston gas engine, especially the elim-
ination of the steam boiler and a high
thermal efficiency, with the desirable
features of the steam turbine, namely,
continuous rotary motion and high
economy in materials of construction
which assures lightness per unit pow-
er, large output, flexibility, and adapt-
ability in operation and regulation.
The first traces of an internal com-
bustion turbine have been found in
the engineering sketch book of
Leonardo da Vinci 1452-1519.
A later form of this mechanical de-
vice, "the smoke jack," shown in Fig.
1 has been illustrated in Wilkin's
"Mathematical Magick," edition of
1680. Wilkins praises the advantage
of the "Smoke Jack Gas Turbine" as
follows: It is noiseless, moves con-
stantly if there is fire in the chimney
without springs or weights. It is ser-
viceable for the roasting of meat, the
rocking of a cradle, the reeling of
yarn, the chiming of bells and other
musical devices thus producing cheap
and continual work.
The next improvement of the me-
diaeval gas turbine appears to be that
of
Barber 1791
contained in the British Patent No.
1833. It includes the production of
the working fluid by distilling the gas
from coal, wood or oil, mixing it with
the proper amount of air, charging
the combustion chamber, and directing
the products of combustion upon the
buckets of a turbine wheel. To reduce
the temperature he provided water in-
jection. Barber's invention although
correct and complete was doomed to
failure as it involved machine design
problems entirely too difficult for his
time.
Burdin in 1847
proposed his multiple reaction turbine
for the production of power from the
elastic fluids air, gas, and steam. Air,
which is compressed by a multiple


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
wheel rotary compressor, and heated
in a furnace, is directed upon the buck-
ets of a number of successive turbine
wheels in order to utilize the tension
of the fluid a number of times.
Fig. 1. The Smoke Jack. The First
Gas Turbine. From Bishop Wilkins's
"Mathematical Magick/' 1680.
Fernihaugh in 1850
planned in his British patent No. 1328
a combination gas-steam turbine. Air
is forced through the grate of a closed
tank lined with refractory material, in
order to burn the fuel which is fed in
sideways while a water spray enters
through the top of the tank to keep
the temperature at low limits. The
products of combustion, a gas-steam
mixture, are then directed upon the
blades of a turbine wheel.
Bulton in 1864
foresaw that the high velocity of the
gas jet leaving the nozzle offered great
difficulties and accordingly he intended
to remedy this by the use of successive
induced jets of increasing volume
which would consequently be of low-
er velocity. This method has consid-
erable merit. Another ingenious in-
vention of Bulton is his apparatus for
the production of a gas-steam-air mix-
ture under combustion at constant
pressure, consisting of two inverted,
and one upright, concentric cylinders.
In the latter, gas is burned under pres-
sure. The burnt gases give up heat
while passing through the water filling
the space between the middle and out-
er cylinders, and finally escape mixed
with the steam thus formed through
an outlet of the outer tank.
John Bourne in 1869
took out British patents for the pro-
duction of a gas-steam-air fluid under
high pressure for use in a turbine.
James Anderson in 1870
secured a British patent covering the
combustion of gas and air in the com-
bustion chamber of the turbine.
Before the year 1870 plans concern-
ing the gas turbine were entirely of a
speculative character and were not put
into actual operation. From 1870 up
to the present, matters changed decid-
edly and the gas turbine entered the
experimental stage. Higher grades of
steel and other materials of construc-
tion, improved machine shop methods
and, last but not least, the great pro-
gress and complete success of both the
internal combustion piston engine
and the steam turbine had a stimulat-
ing effect on the designing and on the
research activities of enthusiastic in-
ventors. It is true, much energy and
money have been spent, little, however
so far has been accomplished as far as
published results go. Not a single mar-
ketable gas turbine has been produced.
Even the basic forms have not yet
been established. So far we mav rec-

THE MICHIGAN TECIINIC
ognize three types: (I) The Fire or
Hot Air Turbine. (2) The Combus-
tion Turbine, and (3) The Explosion
Turbine.
The Fire or Hot Air Turbine.
The best known representative of
this first group is the hot air turbine of
Dr. Stoke,
of Charlottenburg, of which the fol-
lowing description is abstracted from
his German patents taken out in 1872.
Air is compressed by means of a heli-
coidal compressor to about 1.5 atmos-
pheres. Then the air is heated in a
separate furnace and afterwards ex-
panded in the blades of the turbine
wheels which are keyed to the same
shaft as the compressor. The general
outline of the Stolze turbine is shown
in Fig. 2. There is a compression sys-
tem B and an expansion system C on
the same shaft. The compressed air
is passed through a heating chamber
D and thus derives energy from the
heat of the fuel before passing into
the hot air chamber A and through
the power turbine C into the exhaust
pipe G.
The Combustion Turbine.
The combustion turbine works with
a combustion at constant pressure.
Separate pumps force gas and air into
receivers from where the charge flows
continuously through nozzles on the
blades of the rotor. Ignition may be
effected within the receivers or at
their outlets. While flowing through
the inlet nozzles and turbine blades
the gases expand to atmospheric pres-
sure or below. In the latter case an
exhauster must be used. Sometimes
special regenerating apparatus are pro-
vided. Almost all constant pressure
gas turbines use as receivers heat-tight
combustion chambers, into which
air and fuel are continuously forced
thus maintaining a constant combus-
tion at corresponding excess pressure.
The working fluid, the hot gases, may
then be utilized in the rotor either on
the strength of their pressure energy
or their velocity energy. Hence we

with Intercooi.er and Exhauster
have reaction and impulse gas tur-
bines. Both methods can be combined
and then we have the combination
type gas turbine. Practical reasons,
especially the limited strength of ma-
terials of construction and difficulties
in compressing the mixture, necessi-
tate avoiding high temperatures and


I4i
high pressures in the rotor. It is for
this reason, that the pressure energy
of the gases is usually converted into
velocity energy in the nozzles and in
this way, the internal energy instead
of the external energy of the gases
is utilized, resulting in a comparative-
ly low initial temperature. In other
types and makes, water is injected for
the same purpose, or the combination
chamber itself is cooled by surround-
ing it with a water or air jacket.
Instead of forcing the charge into
the combustion chamber by compres-
h h
only small amounts of air and gas are
to be handled. For larger outputs,
higher pressures are necessary for the
efficient moving of large quantities of
air and gas. The advantageous char-
acteristic of the combustion turbine in
utilizing great quantities of gas and
air at a large expansion ratio, itself
points to a splitting of the cyclic pro-
cess into two parts, one above and the
other below the atmospheric pressure,
as otherwise the control of the abso-
lute pressures would become too dif-
ficult. With the atmospheric and corn-
er m ius t/onOiam 2&gt;cr
/Ntercoo/er
Fig. 5. Combination Combustion Turbine with Separate Gas and Air
Compressors, Intercooler and Exhauster
sors as illustrated in Fig. 3, the at-
mospheric combustion turbine creates
a vacuum by means of inter-cooler
and exhauster, and air and gas enter
the combustion chamber under atmos-
pheric pressure, as it is shown in Fig.
4. Both methods combined form a
turbine as illustrated in Fig. 5.
From a thermodynamical point of
view it makes no difference if the cy-
cle takes place above or below atmos-
pheric pressure as long as the com-
pression and expansion ratios are kept
the same. For small outputs the at-
mospheric method seems the best as
bination type of turbine, part of the
heat contained in the exhaust gases
can be regained by using the new
charge as a cooling medium. Larger
turbines would require water cooling,
as otherwise the cooling surface of
the intercooler would assume too large
dimensions. In such cases the inter-
cooler may be designed as a steam gen-
erator and the steam thus produced
used as a working medium.
The design of this type of gas tur-
bine is still in an embryonic state. The
sporadic publications of what is going
on behind the closed doors of ambi-

tious inventors clearly show that re-
sults and aims are far apart. Reliable
and complete data of tests cannot be
found. And the experimental results
which are accessible at all, are certain-
ly not encouraging for the speedy de-
velopment of the combustion turbine.
Faithful adherents of the internal
combustion piston engine as well as of
the high power steam turbine may rest
assured that the knockout blow, so of-
ten heralded by overzealous inventors
of combustion turbines, is still a long,
long way off.
The best known combustion gas
turbine is the one of
ization was lost in the exhaust. Their
second model, illustrated in Fig. 6, re-
sembles the general form of the Curtis
steam turbine, and is designed to pro-
duce 400 to 800 horsepower, accord-
ing to the compressor capacity utiliz-
ed. The compressor, (see Fig. 7) a
special design of Prof. Rateau, is
about six times as large as the turbine
proper and necessarily bulky. It con-
sists of three sections and, when
properly cooled, is capable of deliver-
ing one cubic metre of air per second
at a pressure of 6 to 7 atmospheres
with an efficiency of 67%. It absorbs
about 50% of the total power develop-
Fig. 8. Combustion Chamber of Armengaud-Lemai.k Turbine
Armengaud and Lcmalc,
two French engineers. Their first
model was a 25 horsepower De Lavale
steam turbine rebuilt by the Societe
des Turbomoteurs of Paris in 1904,
and arranged to run on compressed
air instead of steam. The air-was fur-
nished by a high speed compressor the
efficiency of which was known, while
a long pipe connecting the compressor
with the turbine proper formed the
combustion chamber. The latter war
lined with refractory material as the
temperature reached about 1800° C.
In order to reduce the temperature to
about 4000 C, steam was introduced
into the combustion chamber. The
cooling method, while proving the pos-
sibility of the continuous operation of
combustion chamber, turbine wheel,
and fuel inlet valve, lowered the effic-
iency, because the latent heat of vapor-
ed by the gas turbine. The latter
when running about 4000 R. P. M. is
said to produce 300 horse power above
the negative work absorbed by the
compressor. The combustion cham-
ber of the turbine, shown in Fig. 8. is
pear-shaped and provided with an ex-
panding nozzle, H, through which a
uniform gas jet can be delivered up-
on the blades, K, of the wheel. In the
center of the air inlet canal, B, there
is inserted the fuel atomizing nozzle,
A, provided with an ignition-well at
point C. In addition to the refrac-
tory lining, G, it has been necessary to
surround the combustion chamber
with a water jacket in the form of a
pipe coil imbedded in the metal of the
chamber walls. The circulation of
the water in the coils aids in keeping
the temperature of the combustion
chamber walls within practical limits.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
After the water has circulated in the
jacket tube it is delivered through
small holes into the gases just before
they enter the nozzle. It is there con-
verted into steam thus acting both to
lower the temperature of the issuing
gases to a point where they will not
injure the blades of the turbine, and
by being itself discharged upon the
wheel with the gases it forms a part
of the jet, which is thus composed of
mingled gas, steam, and highly heated
air. It is interesting to compare com-
putations and test results for this type
of gas turbine. The inventors made
the following computations:
Assumptions:
Kerosene turbine of 200 indicated
horse-power with one compressor
to compress the air necessary for com-
bustion and one exhauster used to
draw off the inert gases from the in-
tercooler.
Diameter of turbine wheel 1000
m/m; its angular velocity 200 to 250
m/sec, at 4000 to 4500 R. P. M.

.125 atmos. in intercooler.
Maximum temperature of combus-
tion about 18000 C reduced to 740 to
7800 C by external cooling and water
spraying into the combustion chamber.
Temperature at end of expansion
500 to 6oo° C.
Computations:
Velocity of hot gases at nozzle out-
let 870 to 945 m/sec.
Power from 1 Kg gas-air mixture

Kerosene consumption 420-470-540
gram, at max. temperature 800-600-
500° C.
Water consumption in combustion
chamber and intercooler 200 litres
per indicated horse-power per hour.
Mechanical efficiency at friction
load 97%.

C (pyrometer).
Temperature at nozzle outlet 4200
C (pyrometer).
Pressure at nozzle inlet (in combin-
ation chamber) 3 atmos.

Cooling water consumption 1840
litres.
Kerosene consumption 178 Kg. (to-
tal).
Brake horse-power 30 H. P. (at 400
H. P. compressor work.)
Kerosene consumption 5.9 Kg. per
H. P./hour.
Over-all efficiency 1%. i. e.
the turbine could hardly furnish the
work required by its compressor.
It would be a mistake to judge gas
turbines merely by their fuel economy.
Today, there are fields where its prac-
tical advantages; namely light weight,
continuous flow of power, low initial
cost, outweigh by far thermal efficien-
cy. The submarine torpedo is a good
example. As a rule, its motive power
for the brief period which elapses be-
tween the discharge and the contact
with the target is derived from a
store of compressed air, and in some
torpedoes the compressed air acts up-
on a turbine wheel similar to the steam
turbine. This principle can now be
extended to the use of the combustion
gas turbine. The compressed air from
the reservoir passes through a combus-
tion chamber and the total products of
combustion together with the vapor
acts on the turbine. Its capacity, and
with it the radius of action of the tor-
pedo, is thus increased over that op-
erated by compressed air alone.
Combustion turbines made for this
purpose and actually installed in sub-
marine torpedoes develop 120 horse


145
power at a speed of 1000 R. P. M.,
and an expansion ratio 8.4. The
weight of the mere turbine is 1.3 lbs/
horse-power, that of the machine com-
plete, including fuel and cooling water
for a discharge lasting 80 seconds, is
5.5 lbs./horse power.
The Explosion Turbine.
This type of gas turbine, also called
the constant volume type, may work
with or without compression. The cy-
cle of operation of the latter is in prin-
ciple the same as that of the Lenoir
gas engine. It is however superior to
the latter, as its expansion ratio can be
decidedly more enhanced. This can
be achieved with fewer and consider-
ably simpler mechanical elements. On
the other hand, the ignition and explo-
sion of the charge of this gas turbine
is imperfect and unreliable, and heat
losses due to cooling are larger than in
the Lenoir engine. Hence its overall
efficiency is less than that of the lat-
ter.
De Karavodine
of Paris has developed a 2 horse pow-
er gas turbine of the above type. The
working fluid is produced in four com-
bustion chambers and then, by means
of four separate nozzles, is directed
upon a single De Lavale type turbine
wheel of 6" diameter and 10,000 R. P.
M. or 258 feet per second or 78.5
metres. Each nozzle is about three
metres long and 16 m/m bore. The
air consumption per hour runs up to
62.5 cubic metres and that of gasoline
to 6.5 litres, resulting in 2.1 indicated
and 1.6 effective horse-power. In oth-
er words there is a fuel consumption
of 2.24 Kg. per horse-power hour.
The absence of compressors, i. e.
low weight and cost gives this type
of turbine an advantage over the com-
bustion gas turbine.
The explosion turbine with com-
pression requires separate air and gas
compressors. On account of the high
angular velocities turbo compressors
only seem to be the proper machines.
They have however, a very expensive
and complicated construction and at
high compression pressure a very low
efficiency. Next to the discovery of
new heat and force resisting mater-
ials of construction, future improve-
ments of high compression turbo com-
pressors will have a deciding influence
on the coming development of the in-
ternal combustion turbine with com-
pression.
The only high power explosion gas
turbine so far systematically designed,
constructed, and tested is that of
Holzwarth, 1907,
Mannheim, Germany. Its compres-
sion is low, comparatively speaking,
hardly more than the quick charging
process necessarily requires. The
designer apparently did not strive for
a high compression of the mixture be-
fore ignition. The essential features
of the Holzwarth turbine may be seen
in Fig. 9. The engine is of the verti-
cal type. In the lower part there are
a number of combustion chambers, a,
uniformly arranged around the axis
of the turbine and jacketed by the gas
and air chambers, b and c respectively
on the outer side. At the upper end
of these combustion chambers are the
nozzles. The horizontal turbine
wheel, d, is keyed to the vertical hang-
ing shaft which it is driving. Through
the two twin inlet valves, e, air and
gas successively enter the combustion
chamber, a, thus freeing the latter of
its inert gases. The upper valve, f,
shown opened, closes the outlet of the
combustion chamber during the charg-
ing period. It allows, however, a free
flow of the gases during the expansion
period. The ignition of the mixture
is effected by means of spark plugs, g.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
The special turbine parts, such as gov-
ernor and magneto, are operated by
the side shaft, h, driven by means of
helical gears from the main shaft.
Governing is effected by the combina-
tion throttle—hit and miss method.
For reasons of safety the electric cur-
rent is automatically cut out at a maxi-
mum speed. All valves are hydraulic-
which has previously entered. The
nozzle valve, f, closes the nozzle outlet
during the charging event. Imme-
diately after ignition the explosion
pressure, forces valve, f, open.
In passing through the nozzle the
burnt gases attain a velocity corres-
ponding to the velocity energy ab-
stracted from the available pressure

ally operated. The nozzle valve, f, is
thrown open by the explosion pressure
and closed by oil pressure.
The working process is as follows:
By means of separate compressors, il-
lustrated in Fig. 10, gas and air are
constantly forced into the chambers b
and c respectively (see Fig. 9).
Through twin valve, e, air and gas
successively enter the combustion
chamber, a, whereby it is intended that
the whirling inflow of the gas will ef-
fect a thorough mixing with the air
energy contained in the exploded gas-
es. This velocity energy is utilized by
the turbowheel. The expanded gases
finally either escape into the atmos-
phere or enter into a special regener-
ator. The nozzle valve, f, begins then
to close slowly thus allowing the air
entering through valve, e, to scavenge
and cool the highly heated combus-
tion chamber nozzle and nozzle valve.
The turbine can also be operated
without compression, whereby the air
and gas compressors are eliminated


*47
and the exhaust of the inert gases as
well as the suction of air and gas is ef-
fected by a special exhaustor driven by
the main turbine shaft.
TEST RESULTS
The test turbine was designed for
an output of iooo horse-power. The
gas and air compressors were installed
on a separate foundation plate and
driven by an electric motor receiving
oil spray valve at an air pressure of
about 100 lbs./inch.2 The explosion
pressure showed an average value of
80 lbs./inch,- and a maximum value of
about 120 lbs. inch.'- The measured
mean temperatures of a cycle were
found to be 326° C for gasoline and
452 C for gas oil. In the exhaust
pipe the temperatures at maximum
load ran as high as 400' C. The tur-
bine could be started on gasoline and

its current from the main gas turbine
generator unit (see Fig. 10). Almost
all available gaseous and liquid fuels
as well as pulverized coal were tried
out. The operation on city and pro-
ducer gas did not offer any difficul-
ties. The light and heavy oils from
gasoline to tar oil could also be used
by forcing them into the combustion
chamber in an atomized state. This
was accomplished by an ordinary air-
benzol, while the most efficient temper-
atures were found to be 400° C for
kerosene, 440° for gas oil, and 375°
for tar oil. The oil fuel was not force-
ed into the combustion chamber in one
jet but in small jets during each cycle,
thus creating a stratified charge within
the combustion chamber. The time
for the complete combustion of the
charge was about .03 seconds.
Of the economy and usefulness of


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
this turbine Holzwarth has this to
say: "In spite of a most careful and
efficient arrangement of the oil operat-
ed control gear, it was found that the
combustion process was unstable, al-
though the method of control has
proved satisfactory and preferable to
the mechanical control, and even ap-
pears absolutely necessary for a prac-
tical gas turbine.
In February 1911 the turbine was
run on no load, with full excitation of
4000 volts, at 3000 R. P. M. consum-
ing only 250-300 cubic metres of gas
per hour with a heat content of 1179
calories. This corresponded to an ef-
analysis at 15° C and 1 absolute at-
mosphere of:
CO, 5.8%
H2 15.2%
CO 25.8%
The calorific value was 1179 calor-
ies, the capacity of the combustion
chamber 200 litres.
The efficiency N0 is the ratio of the
available heat of the cycle to the heat
content of the charge. The efficiency
Nt represents the ratio of the actual

tainly a satisfactory starting point.
Unfortunately, this was only transi-
tory."
What kind of efficiency this repre-
sents, is not stated by the inventor. It
is certainly not the overall efficiency.
The temperature-efficiency table
has been inserted below in order to
show to what results Holzwarth's
theoretical computations will lead
when based on his experiments with
regard to efficiencies under accentua-
tion of the temperature of the charge
before ignition. The gas turbine fuel
was producer gas, having a volumetric
or the ratio of the indicated work of
the turbine to the mechanical equiva-
lent of the heat of the charge. The in-
ventor believes that the influence of
charging and exhaust on the indicated
efficiency can be explained by stating
that: "the power consumption of the
auxiliaries may be assumed to be 12
to 15% of the gas turbine output, an
amount which may be reclaimed by a
regenerator." This is, of course, ac-
cording to actual practice not true, and
hence Holzwarth's efficiency figures
lose their value as a proof for the
economy of this turbine.

LANG GATES
DONALD C. MAY, '10, DESIGNING ENGINEER
HYDRAULIC gates of the bear
trap type have never come into
any very general use owing to their
relatively high cost and also to the
semi-obscurity surrounding their sat-
isfactory design and successful oper-
ation.
Most of the notable examples of
such gates have been constructed by
Government Engineers on the Ohio
River and elsewhere to a lesser ex-
tent—largely for navigation purposes.
Defects in design, resulting in lack of
dependability of operation and high
maintenance cost have rendered these
gates unsatisfactory. Also conditions
of navigation upon the Ohio River
have so changed that the completion
of the series of movable dams origin-
ally outlined is not now at least finan-
cially justifiable. These experiences
upon the Ohio River have not enhanc-
ed the reputation of bear gates and
have possibly in a degree prevented
their serious consideration for other
purposes than navigation.
Lang Gate Used as Log Gate.
Engineering News of August 2,
1917, described in some detail the in-
stallation of a Lang Gate (modified
bear trap) in connection with the Is-
land Lake Storage Dam of the Great
Northern Power Company, near Du-
luth, Minnesota. One of the require-
ments of this development was a log
sluice capable of sluicing within a per-
iod of two or three days the entire
output of a season's logging opera-
tions. After considerable study, a
Lang gate was decided upon as capa-
ble of satisfactory discharging the re-
quired volume of water necessary for
log sluicing operations under the vary-
ing conditions of pond water eleva-
tion. A photograph of this gate is
Island Lake Log Gate
shown upon the accompanying page.
No attempt was made to make the gate
absolutely water tight at its side edges
as a certain amount of leakage was
considered advisable to aid in prevent-
ing the accumulation of ice during the
winter months. The gate has a width
of 30 feet, length center to center of

crest level of 20 feet.
The downstream leaf is of cellular
steel construction consisting of 20"
plate and angle girders spaced 2'-oj4"
center to center with Y^" cover plates
top and bottom, making a practically
air tight steel enclosed chamber. The
upstream leaf consists of 18" plate
and angle girders spaced 2'-oJ/"
centers with space between girders
entirely filled with timbers bolted to
the girders making a solid continuous
leaf of steel and timber. The idler is
a timber leaf made up of 12" x 12"
timbers covered over with )/&amp;" skin
plates and having 8" diameter rollers
at its upstream end which move upon
the flanges of the upstream leaf gird-
ers. Each link is made up of two


151
3 x 3 x ffj angles riveted together with
bent plate link straps. Cross sections
showing the construction of the up-
stream and downstream leaves, and id-
ler are shown in Fig. 1.
Hinges of upstream and down-
stream leaves are of the ordinary
bridge pin type with bronze bushings
in pin bearing plates.
Curved plates attached to the gird-
ers near the hinges of curvature at
the center of the pin and passing in
close proximity to the curved surfaces
of pedestal castings for all positions
of the gate effectually prevent leakage
of any consequence at the hinges.
A timber side closure, shown in Fig.
I, prevents undue leakage at the sides
of the downstream leaf and the up-
stream leaf and idler timbers have a
small clearance at the wall for the
same purpose. The hinge connection
of the idler to the downstream leaf de-
pends for its water-tightness upon the
small clearance allowed between in-
dividual hinges. Such leakage as oc-
curs into the chamber of the down-
stream leaf itself drains out between
the girders through drain holes placed
between pedestal castings.
The operation of the gate is con-
trolled by the difference in head be-
tween the pond and the gate chamber,
no auxiliary power being required for
its operation under any conditions of
pond water elevation. A 24" cast
iron pipe connects the pond to the in-
ner chamber and a gate valve controls
the admission of water. The outlet
valve consists of a hollow cylindrical
steel tube of 30" internal diameter
with its bottom edge seating against a
casting in the valve well when the gate
is in the closed position. The top of
the cylinder in the closed position is
at the same elevation as the crest of
the gate in its up position so that in
case of the pond rising above this ele-
vation the water from the inner cham-
ber would discharge over the top of
the cylindrical tube and down through
its interior, thus automatically help-

ing to relieve additional stress in the
gate due to unusual floods. When the
outlet gate is open, the cylindrical tube
is raised from its seat against the con-

ed into the annular space between the
conduit walls and the bottom of the
tube. Fig. 2 shows a section through
the outlet valve.
When the gate is in its up position
the links connecting the upstream leaf
to the downstream leaf are practically
in straight tension and prevent the gate
from rising to a higher elevation re-
gardless of pond water elevation. In

Company, two Lang Gates have been
installed in lieu of the more usual
fainter gates or other waste gates.
These gates have a combined capacity
at high water of about 9000 cubic
feet per second, and each is 24 feet
wide, 30 feet long center to center of
pins and has an 11 foot variation in
crest level.
Their construction is similar in a
general way to that of the Island Lake
gate described above, although sizes

the downstream leaf rests upon the
recumbent upstream leaf, buffer
blocks attached to the downstream
leaf separating the two leaves.
Since its installation in 1914, this
gate has given satisfactory service and
shows little apparent signs of depre-
ciation. The gate responds readily to
the operation of the valves and a very
delicate degree of adjustment is ob-
tainable.

er, Michigan, at the newly completed

of members and spacing of girders
is necessarily different. Figure 3
shows a section through the upstream
and downstream leaves and the idler.
The upstream leaf has a timber deck-
ing rather than having the space be-
tween girders filled with timbers as
at Island Lake, and the closure at side-
walks is considerably different.
The idler has no rollers at its up-
stream end but a 6 x 6 x J&lt;J caP angle
which slides upon track plates on the
timber decking of the upstream leaf.
The downstream leaf in its normal
up position was made absolutely wa-
tertight at the side wall by the use of
belting engaging the back of a chan-


153
nel set into the wall with its down-
stream edge projecting out about l/2
inch from the wall face. The belting
is pressed tight against the channel
back as the gate rises to the up posi-
tion. Leakage at the downstream
hinge was prevented by calking with
lead wool, and filling with babbitt to

A 24" motor operated gate valve con-
trolled from the power house serves as
an outlet for the water in the gate
chamber.

this will not be necessary unless un-
foreseen conditions should occur.
Steam pipes have also been placed in
the sidewalls along the edges of the
downstream leaf in order that if the
gate should become frozen in place it
could be thawed out by the use of
steam.
The gate normally will not be af-
fected by minor fluctuations in the
pond, and will stand in its up position
until the pond has fallen 3 or 4 feet
below the crest elevation.
This gate has been successfully op-
erated through a period of about six
months and can be said to be absolute-
ly watertight.
The Design of Lang Gates.
The design of a Lang Gate presents
many interesting problems, but it is
not within the scone of this article to
attempt a general theoretical analysis.
In the up position of the gate (Fig. 4)
it will be apparent that the down-
stream leaf and links will be subject-
ed to the greatest stress, neglecting ice
conditions, as the full head of water in
the pond will be effective in holding
up the gate, by its pressure against
the downstream leaf.
The links and upstream leaf will be
practically in straight tension while
the idler will be subjected to little if
any stress. (The density of the up-
stream leaf with its timber decking—
and of the idler is approximately equal
to 1). When in the down position
(Fig'. 5) with water passing over it
the gate is raised by admitting water
to the inner chamber, thus making the
pressure head inside the chamber
equal to'that of the pond. The buoy-
ancy of the downstream leaf is ef-
fective in raising the gate and the con-
struction of the link is such that the
downstream leaf may rise by itself 4
or 5 feet before pulling upon the link
to raise the upstream leaf with it.
There will be a considerable fall in
the water surface through the waste-
way when the gate is down and dis-
charging water so that the admission
of water from the pond will actually
create a difference of head between
the inner chamber and the water over
the gate which will be of assistance in
raising the gate. In the down posi-
tion with no water in the gate cham-
ber and water passing over the gate,
Figs. 4, 5, 6
the idler and upstream leaf will be
subjected to considerable stress due to
bending.
As the gate moves from the up po-
sition to the down position, the angle
between the idler and the upstream
leaf increases from nearly o° to a
maximum of about 25° and then
gradually diminishes again. This an-
gle becomes a maximum at the posi-
tion known as the "critical position"
where the link makes an angle of 900
with the upstream leaf, and the gate
will not pass this point if the friction


155
angle of the idler at this point of con-
tact with the upstream leaf is too
great. (Fig. 6).
An analysis of the pressures exist-
ing for the different positions of the
Lang Gate may be found in an article
by W. A. Jones, on "Bear Trap
Weirs," appearing in the Journal of
the Association of Engineering Socie-
ties for June, 1896. Also in Volume
XXXIX of the Transaction of the
American Society of Civil Engineers,

cerning Lang Gates and other gates of
the Bear Trap type.

JOHN C. PARKER. PROFESSOR OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
MOST of the problems which fac-
ed society during the War, and
which still demand solution, are not
new—the War and consequent condi-
tions have merely intensified them.
For many years prior to the War we
had been growing in realization of the
fact that we are a spendthrift nation;
that blessed with abundant natural re-
sources we had been pursuing the easy
come, easy go policy, and this policy,
or lack of policy, had outlived the pio-
neer conditions in which it had its
origin. With an easy facility we had
attached to the efforts to remedy this
condition, a label, conservation, and
hackneyed though this name has be-
come, still the necessity for it remains
with us.
One of the worst mal-uses of our
resources was, and is, to be found in
the squandering of coal. Last winter
and this have brought our extrava-
gence pretty thoroughly to the light.
The processes of mining have pro-
gressed very far from the early days
when the economic factors involved
may perhaps have justified the leav-
ing of pillars representing sometimes
as much coal as that effectively drawn
from the mines.
Much has been done in the utiliza-
tion of low-grade fuels and under
pressure of expense quite a little has
been done in improving furnace, boil-
er, and heat engine conditions.
One outstanding, and very consider-
able source of wastage still persists as
a result of arbitrary legislative inter-
ference with economic process, viz.—
the small, inefficient, localized or "pri-
vate" power plant.
In all the larger centers there are
electricity supply corporations, oper-
ating by steam for the most part. In
most cases these corporations have
well designed and well managed gen-
erating plants which can turn out a
kilowatt hour by the use of something
in the neighborhood of two pounds of
coal. The same communities will be
found to have a large number of small,
privately owned plants in mercantile
and industrial establishments consum-
ing three or four times as much coal
in the production of each kilowatt
hour.
It is manifest that such a process of
power production as involves three to
four times the coal consumption does
not represent a genuine conservation.
On the other hand, it is equally mani-
fest that the individual power user
cannot be expected to pay more for
centrally produced power than the
price at which he believes he can pro-
duce power himself. Indeed, it would
not be true conservation were any in-
dividual to purchase a commodity at a
price greater than the cost of manu-
facturing it himself by any process
whatsoever.
Between the two pounds of coal in
the large central station, and the pos-
sible four, eight or ten pounds in the
small, private plant intervene costs
and charges, proper or improper as
the case may be, which make the price
at which central station power may be
laid down in any business establish-
ment greater than the price of pro-
ducing it on the premises.
Among the proper costs which may
easily enough interfere with the use of


157
centrally generated power, in lieu of
the inefficient small plant product, may
be found the legitimate interest, amor-
tization and tax burdens on the distri-
bution investment, together with the
cost of maintenance of such mains and
feeders as may be required.
Now it would be absurd that a de-
sire for the conservation of mere coal
should imply the use of efficiently pro-
duced power in a central station, were
the legitimate costs of delivery to more
than offset the extra costs of local pro-
duction. Such a process would, it is
true, represent a conservation of coal,
but would at the same time be any-
thing but conservative of copper, rub-
ber, tile duct, and human labor, all of
which have claims on our conserva-
tive efforts quite as great as has the
combustible material. Indeed, extrav-
agance in the utilization of trans-
mitted power for the purpose of econ-
omizing coal would, to a certain degree
at least, represent extravagance in tht
use of coal for the production of the
materials entering into the distribu-
tion system.
True conservation will quite evi-
dently justify coal saving through the
use of centrally generated power only
when the cost of power, as distributed
from a central plant, can compete with
the cost as privately produced. Sin-
cere conservation then goes hand in
hand with the self interest of the indi-
vidual power user. There should,
however, be no artificial and unnatural
barriers between the self interest of
the power user and genuine, economic
utilization of our coal resources. Such
barriers do exist.
The first of these is one which it is
comparatively easy to remove and
which the self interest of the electric-
ity supply corporations can, and does
overcome, to a large degree. Exper-
ience in power sales work among the
central station companies indicates
very clearly that in the vast majority
of cases the merchant and manufac-
turer, expert each in his peculiar busi-
ness, have but little time and less skill
in determining, either before or after
the fact, the cost of power production
by contemplated isolated or private
plants. Unfortunately, such users very
frequently are forced to depend for
the formation of their judgments on
commercial machinery salesmen and
on designing engineers, not always of
the highest skill. Much of the fault
in this lies with the business man him-
self. He is rather loath to pay a fee
to a consulting engineer who advises
him not to do anything in the way of
installing plant equipment, while he is
willing to pay a fee for the design and
installation of an objective and visible
plant.
Most of the larger central station
companies today maintain power sales
engineers whose . function is to at-
tempt the education of the merchant
and manufacturer, who makes his de-
cision as between the representatives
of the two interested and opposed
classes of the "salesmen—the central
station men on the one hand and the
machinery salesmen on the other.
It is the writer's conviction that in
due time there will develop a type of
consulting power engineer — already
ably represented by a few pioneer or-
ganizations which charge adequate and
fair fees for their services, and enjoy
a large enough clientelle so that they
can afford to do honest work soley for
the client's interest, indifferently rec-
ommending central station power or
private plant installation as the sheer
merit of the case may seem to war-
rant. The writer is persuaded that
the development of this type of engi-
neer is coming more rapidly in the fu-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
ture and that power engineering will
be more fully professionalized.
There are two more serious barriers
between the intelligent self interest of
the power user and the economic mer-
its of the utilization of the efficiently
generated central station power. These
barriers are in part the fault of the
central station companies themselves
and in part the fault of the general
public.
The first of these has to do with the
rate schedule. Rate schedules have in
general been constructed along the
lines of fairly sound economic princi-
ples. There are, however, some de-
viations from fundamental sanity and
many serious blunders in the detail of
execution.
Central station rate-making has pro-
gressed a long way from the early
day when one kilowatt hour was as-
sumed to cost just as much as anoth-
er. Following such an assumption, a
kilowatt hour which, could inherently
be produced cheaply was required to
carry the burden of the kilowatt hour
which was fundamentally expensive.
We have recovered from the error
involved in the assumption of a uni-
form cost per kilowatt hour, but we
are a long way from having gone far
enough. The natural and legitimate
burdens which central station power
has to carry lie in its relatively high
investment in distribution equipment.
Kilowatt for kilowatt, power plant in-
vestment, central station labor, and the
cost of coal. oil. repairs, and other
supplies are considerably lower in the
large central station than in the small,
isolated plant, while on the other hand,
the major portion of the central sta-
tion investment, running indeed to the
order of magnitude of 80%, lies in
the transmission, sub-station, distribu-
tion, and metering equipment. These
details of equipment together with the
expense involved in their maintenance
have no counterpart in the private
plant. It is almost self-evident that
this later and major portion of the
central station investment is expen-
sive, whether used for long hours or
for short hours, and that it should pro-
portionately appear in the rate sched-
ule as a relatively heavy demand
charge on the short hour or low load
factor customer, while the consumer
having a good load factor should be
able to dilute it with his low kilowatt
hour consumption.
A properly formed rate schedule
should then give a very much lower
average price per kilowatt hour to a
customer having a high load factor
and to the large consumer. This is
recognized in most central station
schedules, but in general the schedules
do not go far enough. Very decided
inducements should be offered to any
consumer who can utilize a central
station equipment off the peak of the
load. The on-peak consumer occa-
sions the power house and distribu-
tion investment. If the off peak cus-
tomer is relieved of charges occasion-
ed by such investment, and if the re-
lief from such charges can make pos-
sible an increase in the kilowatt hours
sold, surely the on-peak customer does
not suffer in the process. The central
station company benefits by the small
profit accumulated from the off-peak
customer and coal conservation is
furthered. Moreover, under a proper
rate schedule such profits as can be ac-
cumulated from the sale at a very low
rate of off-peak power would, in part,
be used to reduce the price charged for
on-peak power. From such schedule
arrangements four parties benefit. The
on-peak customer, the off-peak custo-
mer, the electricity supply corpora-
tion, and, through the process of coal
conservation, the general public.


159
This is not all that may be done in
the formulation of proper rates. It is
taken for granted in the first place
that the earnings of the electricity
supply corporation as a whole should
be limited by law, and in the public
interest, to merely a fair and adequate
return on the legitimate capitalization
of the corporation. What should be a
fair and adequate rate is foreign to
the subject of the present article, but
may briefly be stated as that earning
rate which will freely attract sufficient
capital to enable the corporation to
make all legitimate extensions for the
public served.
With this stipulation and provided
no general class of customer is served
at less than cost, it then becomes a
matter of indifference to the public as
a whole how the supply corporation
distributes its charges among differ-
ent classes of consumers. Self inter-
est, if intelligent, will actuate the sup-
ply corporation to make this distribu-
tion low where necessary, in order to
attract the maximum number of class-
es of possible consumers. With the
aggregate earnings limited by law,
and with the desire to reduce the rate
schedules close to the cost of produc-
tion at all points where business is
hard to secure, the corporation clearly
will not be serving any class of con-
sumer at the expense of any other
class, and will be gathering small and
limited profits at the maximum num-
ber of points.
It must be recognized that the an-
alysis of central station costs and their
distribution among the various influ-
ences affecting costs, is not a hard and
fast definitely scientific process. Cer-
tain very large elements of indeter-
minateness enter. Does a central sta-
tion company makes its conductors of
ample cross section in order to meet
the maximum demand, or in order to
save kilowatt hours, tangibly repre-
sented by the coal pile? Is a conden-
ser installed under a steam turbine in
order to double the maximum demand
the turbine can carry or to save coal?
Either function would justify entire-
ly, or in a large part, such refinements
in design and investment, and there-
fore such auxiliaries as condensers
and such investment as is represented
by larger conductors, may be deemed
a legitimate charge either against the
consumer's demand or against his en-
ergy utilization. When we have
frankly recognized the indeterminate-
ness of the allocation of such expense,
we recognize that the rates may with-
in a considerable range, be largely gov-
erned by zvhat the traffic will bear—.
always subject to the two qualifica-
tions that no individual class of con-
sumer may be served at less than cost,
and that the earnings of the corpora-
tion as a whole must be merely fair
and adequate.
In the formulation of its rate sched-
ule, then, the supply corporation is
justified, and indeed is obligated, to
make the rates so low for the most
closely competitive class of isolated
plant, as to represent merely the ex-
cess cost of serving that particular
type of business when added to other
types of business already supplied.
Here again, as in the case of the on-
peak power, a mutuality of interest
appears.
In general this process of making
the rates merely competitive within
broadly defined limits, involves
charges very much lower for the large,
high load factor consumer than pres-
ent practice realizes. Such a process
extends materially the field of useful-
ness of the electricity supply corpora-
tions as an agency for coal conserva-
tion; the corporation has extended its
opportunities for growth and made


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
possible a maximum of service to the
community.
There is a practical, though impro-
per, objection to such a process of fav-
oring the large, long hour consumer,
viz.—public prejudice. When a cen-
tral station company is required by law
to supply residential consumers at
eight, nine and ten cents per kilowatt
hour, invariably most of this business
will be carried at a loss by the central
station company. This loss must, if
the company is to remain solvent, be
transferred to such business as re-
mains—namely, the industrial consum-
ers. Similarly when a central station
company carries a municipal lighting
contract, the community may force an
improperly low charge for such ser-
vice and often fancies it is benefiting
thereby. The company perforce ac-
cepts such a contract in order to avoid
the destructive effects of municipal
competition, well realizing that a mu-
nicipally operated street lighting plant
is likely to branch out into the fields
of commercial power supply to the
impairment of the electricity supply
corporation's business, even though at
no ultimate benefit to the community.
Such losses as are involved in a street
lighting contract of this sort, or even
the loss of fair profits from such a
contract must be transferred to the in-
dividual power rates.
It is clearly understood that a prop-
erly high charge for domestic service
and for municipal street lighting is not
likely ever to be a popular thing;
nonetheless the industrial wellfare of a
community is not secured nor is na-
tional coal conservation advanced
through rates for industrial use so
high as to prevent the extension of
central station service as against iso-
lated plant installation.
Closely akin to this barrier is an
even more serious type of hinderance
to the extension of the industrial pow-
er utilization of a centralized plant.
It has been the fashion in many juris-
dictions to tax the public utilities be-
yond the normal property taxes car-
ried by other businesses. The writer
does not have reference to the fact
that an individual private plant in-
volved in an industrial establishment
does not generally appear on the as-
sessment rolls at its full value, while
the property of the electricity supply
corporation does on the tax rolls car-
ry its full assessment. This comes
about through the obligation placed on
the central station company to make a
matter of record of its total invest-
ment as a basis for rate regulation.
There is a further obligation in the
form of a franchise or gross earnings
tax often assessed against such cor-
porations. In addition thereto there
is a "tax in kind" represented some-
times by harassing restrictions on the
types of constructions that may be
employed—obligations to render free
service to public buildings and in
parks and so on. Now all of these
burdens are merely shifted by the
company to its consumers and appear
in the rate schedule. Political and
municipally competitive considerations
prevent placing such extraordinary
burdens on the charges for municipal
lighting and domestic service; and
they must of necessity therefore be
placed on railway and general indus-
trial supply. The railway supply is
usually sufficiently large so that the
railway corporations are in a position
to compete almost on even terms with
the electricity supply corporation, and
therefore these extra burdens by a
process of elimination must be carried
almost in toto by the industrial power
consumer.
A gross earnings tax amounting to
6 or 7% may easily enough represent


161
an increase of 20 to 25% in the rates
which it is necessary to charge to the
residual industrial consumer.
Among the industrial consumers,
however, those who represent the best
type of business which a central sta-
tion company can carry, and who by
the same token represent the largest
coal users, are not far removed com-
petitively from the central station
company at its best. The result is
that a very slight burden appearing in
the rate schedule for such consumers
prohibits them in large from becoming
consumers, with the result that they
are forced into expensive coal con-
sumption. We have here a cumula-
tive difficulty, a slight artificial tax
makes a relatively great burden on an
individual class of the company's con-
sumers. This in its turn forms a de-
terent to central station utilization by
a relatively very large number of the
largest coal consumers. The exces-
sive coal consumption per kilowatt
hour is again 'way out of proportion
to the difference between central sta-
tion rates—which include transmission
investment—and isolated plant cost,
which with its large coal consumption
has no distribution investment. The
wastage of the coal is thus many,
many, times more serious than the ap-
parently trifling artificial burdens
placed on the public utility corpora-
tion.
As means, then, to the better eco-
nomic service of the communities and
to the more complete utilization of our
national resources, the writer suggests,
first, detached and unbiased power
plant engineering; second, skillfully
formed rate schedules subject to pro-
per plant engineering; second, skill-
fully formed rate schedules subject to
proper public regulation, and without
undue favors to the residential con-
sumer or to the municipality itself,
and third, the removal of all abnormal
and artificial tax burdens from the
public service corporations. In the ul-
timate analysis these recommenda-
tions reduce to one, namely—that
such corporations be recognized in
fact, as well as in name, as public
service corporations, that on the one
hand they be not allowed to exploit
the community and on the other be not
treated as if their loss were the gain
of the community.


SANITARY CORPS
CAPT. H. G. RASCHBACHER, SANITARY CORPS, U. S. A.
PREVIOUS to the present war the
term, Engineer Officer, meant
an officer of the Corps of Engineers,
U. S. Army. The almost complete
change in methods of warfare, which
have become highly technical, and the
necessity for concentrating large bod-
ies of troops in more or less thickly
populated districts, both overseas and
at training camps in this country, has
complicated the requisites for proper
sanitation and has caused the organi-
zation of the Sanitary Corps, U. S. A.,
a part of the Medical Department; a
subdivision of the Sanitary Corps is
that of Sanitary Engineering whose
main object is the installation, opera-
tion and maintenance of the more
technical phases of sanitation. Such
descriptions as may be set forth by the
writer are based upon experiences in
that division of the Sanitary Corps
and have no connection with the Corps
of Engineers.
Sanitary Engineers in the army, us-
ually report to a medical officer as
their superior. In the usual canton-
ment the ranking medical officer is
the Division Surgeon and it is to him,
either directly or indirectly that the
sanitary engineer reports and from
him that he receives his general or-
ders regarding sanitation. Upon be-
ing commissioned from civil life, the.
sanitary engineer is usually sent to a
medical officers' training camp. On
arrival he doffs all insignia of rank
and leads the life of a private during
the course of training. He attends
lectures, covering medical, sanitary
and military topics, learns army paper
work and is bound by the same rigid
rules that govern the daily life of an
enlisted man. He has setting up ex-
ercises, drill, inspection, polices bar-
racks, polices latrines, scrubs floors,
brings in coal and wood, and loses in
a short time any preconceived notions
that he may have had that he is pro-
bably made of better clay than the
next man. As a consequence, upon
the completion of his course of train-
ing, he should have a fair idea of mil-
itary law and customs, a complete idea
of what constitutes fair treatment of
such enlisted men as he may command,
the knowledge that an order from a
superior is given to be obeyed and not
to be argued over, a fair idea of the
medical man's viewpoint of things, a
healthy body and a vastly increased
appetite.
After leaving trainig camp, the san-
itary engineer enters into a remarkably
diversified field of sanitation. When
one stops to note that training camps
are scattered over the country from
Canada to Mexico and from Califor-
nia to the Atlantic coast, covering all
possible variations of climate, eleva-
tion and nearness to densely populated
districts, it is easily realized that the
sanitary problems that confront those
responsible for proper supervision are
varied without end. While all camps
have the same general problems, their
relative importance and the means
for solving them will vary with the lo-
cal conditions. For example, the most
important problems at a camp in the


163
south, at which the writer was sta-
tioned, were mosquitas and flies. At
this camp the same problems are at
hand but climatic conditions prevent
them from becoming the big problems
they were in the south.
So far as the experiences of the
writer is concerned, a sanitary engi-
neer in the service must be able to
handle the following work; he must
be able to advise and supervise the op-
eration of sewers and sewage disposal
plants and water supply systems; he
must take proper means for insuring
a pure water for camp use; he must
supervise the collection and disposal
of wastes, in so far as they affect san-
itary conditions; he must take proper
means for the control of flies and mos-
quitos and for their eradication so far
as possible; camp vermin, sanitary
conditions of mess hall, latrines and
barracks, in general any and all of the
varieties of sanitary problems which
may directly or indirectly affect the
health of troops living in congested
areas, will at some time or other come
before the sanitary engineer for advice
or action.
I may be prejudiced on account of
not having served in any other branch
of the army but I believe that the op-
portunities for useful and active ser-
vice in the Sanitary Corps are not ex-
ceeded by any other branch. There'
seems to be little chance for the work
to become monotonous and the sud-
denness with which a variety of prob-
lems come up every day make it ne-
cessary for a man to be quick on his
feet mentally in order to keep up with
the game.
If I may say a word to those read-
ers of The Technic who may con-
template trying to enter this branch
of the service, the impressions I have
obtained during my present length of
time in the service might be stated as
follows; the average young officer,
usually only a short time out of col-
lege, is prone to look at the rest of the
service through the wrong end of his
field glasses. That is, his particular
field looms up as the most important
one. Unfortunately all the other of-
ficers in all other branches of the ser-
vice have usually a very complete day
filled with an endless variety of ne-
cessary duties. The big problem for
the sanitary engineer is to solve his
problems without disrupting the pro-
gramme of any unit or units in the
camp. It is the eternal question of
carrying on with the training without
interruption while improving the san-
itary conditions and maintaining them
at a high rate of efficiency that makes
the sanitary engineer show his tact and
resourcefulness. Upon leaving train-
ing camp, one of the instructors, a
major, asked me just what I had learn-
ed in the two months I had been there.
I told him that so far as I could figure
out the job ahead of me in the army,
it consisted in applying 99% common
sense and 1% technical knowledge to
any problem. The experiences since
leaving training camp have only con-
firmed that belief.


LICENSING OF ENGINEERS
"CWERY member of American As-
-■-J sociation of Engineers and ev-
ery engineer who reads this issue of
The Technic has an opportunity to
help if he will read carefully the pre-
liminary report on licensing of the
Committee on Legislation, A. A. E.,
and then add his thought for the com-
mittee's guidance. The subject will
be discussed and acted upon in the
chapters of the association. Talk it
over in detail with the engineer next
to you. Have your thoughts in con-
crete and constructive form, both to
help formulate your chapter report,
or write to the Committee on Legisla-
tion. Your individual ideas are want-
ed, as in that way alone can all the
principles be discovered and the best
law submitted.
The present status of licensing was
well summarized by Vice-President E.
S. Spencer of the Civil Engineers' So-
ciety of St. Paul when he said, "The
problem is to get a law that will be
generally accepted." In other words,
the decision after a prolonged debate
Editor's Note: We are fortunate
in being able to present to our read-
ers a discussion on national licensing
of engineers. The December "Mo-
nad" will contain this same discussion
and it is to this publication we are in-
debted for the folloit'ing article.
We also arc printing a brief com-
ment by Prof. C. T. Johnston who has
been actively interested in this ques-
tion for many years. We hope that
other engineers will write us their
views on the subject, for publication
in our next issue.
rests with the affimative—licensing is
desirable. So far as St. Paul Chapter
of A. A. E. is concerned, this decision
is apparently unanimous as all in at-
tendance at the recent chapter anni-
versary dinner stood up in affirmative
vote on the question "Are you in favor
of licensing?"
The problem is, therefore, to
draft the best possible law.
Shall licensing be by states or na-
tional in scope? If national, it would
doubtless apply only to federal work.
This is not the field where improve-
ment is most needed. All other public
work, city, county, and state, should
be performed by licensed engineers.
Another moot point is whether all
branches of engineering should be in-
cluded, civil, mechanical, electrical,
mining, and the score or more of oth-
er varieties—or only the civil. It must
be borne in mind that the line divid-
ing them in many phases of public
work is rather imaginary—for in-
stance, in the construction of a muni-
cipal waterworks and lighting plant.
The tendency is to increase public con-
trol and ownership of public utilities
so that it is fair to assume that more
and more of the engineer's work in the
future will be in public service.
It might be held in some quarters
that the mining engineer need not be
licensed if the principle underlying
the proposed legislation is to protect
the public. The safety of many lives
depends on the mining engineer, and
likewise the safety of millions of dol-
lars. It has been said by an experienc-
ed mining engineer that four out of
five mining ventures, in all of which


165
the public invests its good money,
would not have been undertaken had
they been reported upon by a compe-
tent mining engineer.
Reasoning from analogy, one may
ask the proponents of licensing one
branch of the profession, "Why aren't
doctors examined only in the specialty
they practice, instead of in medicine
and anatomy and the like?" "Why
aren't lawyers who will practice cor-
poration law examined in this branch
only, instead of on general principles
and practice of law?"
The proper course would seem to be
to examine all engineers in the funda-
mentals common to all branches, as
they come up to practice. Such might
make possible the drafting of a simple
law which would find general accep-
tance.
It would seem advisable for the
Committee on Legislation to make use
of a questionnaire before offering the
law for final adoption. After the law
is drawn it might be subjected to ref-
erendum vote by chapters, societies,
and individuals.
PRELIMINARY REPORT ON LICENSING
L. K. Sherman,
Chairman, Committee on Legislation, A. A. E.
The Legislative Committee of the
A. A. E. was directed on September 5
by the Executive Board to get together
information concerning existing state
engineering license laws, either pro-
posed or in operation, and to draw up
a standard license law for approval of
the Board.
The Committee has compiled the
following preliminary data and re-
quests prompt consideration, com-
ment, and criticism.
IS AN ENGINEERS' LICENSE LAW
DESIRABLE?
Most of the bills for engineers' li-
cense laws that have been introduced
into the state legislatures have failed
to pass. This has been due to lack of
support by the engineers themselves,
and this in turn has been due to (a)
indifference on the part of the engi-
neers; or (b) objections to the form
and details of the bill; or (c) lack of
organized support.
A review of the first agitation for li-
cense, about 1909, records marked op-
position on the part of many engin-
eers. The American Society of Civil
Engineers, the Boston Society of Civil
Engineers, and the Pennsylvania So-
ciety of Engineers, all passed resolu-
tions against the enactment of Engi-
neers' license laws. Among the argu-
ments against licensing were: Not nec-
essary, because the public is protected
against incompetence and mounte-
banks by employing only members of*
high-grade engineering -societies. A
license does not guarantee competen-
cy. Engineers are not employed by
the general public as individuals the
same as it employs doctors or lawyers.
Not practical to define any comprehen-
sive engineering work, must limit law
to one particular field or surveying,
etc.
The advocates for licensing have an-
swered the above objections in point-
ing out that society membership can-
not be reorganized by the public and
does not weed out incompetency. That
licensing does bar the most flagrant
cases. That the physicinas' and law-
yers' license do not prevent the appen-
dicitis patient from employing an eye
and ear specialist, or the applicant for
a divorce employing a corporation at-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
torney, and yet such licenses are of
recognized public service. The archi-
tects, doctors, lawyers, to say nothing
of the plumbers, engine men, and bar-
bers are licensed, and they have found
it desirable for themselves and have
demonstrated to the state legislature
and to the Supreme Court that it was
desirable for the public.
While there is no official record,
there appears to be a growing opinion
in favor of engineers' license laws,
more especially in the states where
such law exists.
It would be interesting at least, if
upon the submission of a proposed li-
cense law by this committee, the mat-
ter was referred to a referundum vote
of the Association.
In view of the increasing number of
states passing engineers' license laws,
it is highly desirable that some uni-
formity be established and reciprocal
action entered into.
Unquestionably, the chief cause for
the failure for passage of license acts
has been due, as was the case in Iowa
'in 1910, to the lack of support by a
strong executive and business organi-
zation. For the first time in the his-
tory of engineering societies the Am-
erican Association of Engineers now
furnishes that executive organization.
EXISTING LICENSE LAWS.
LOUISIANA. Passed'in 1908.
Provides for examination and license
of surveyors and civil enginers by
Board of Examiners appointed by the
Governor. Fee and registration, $12.-
00.
WYOMING. License engineers
and surveyors in matters relating to
water conservation and irrigation
work. Examining Board consists of
state engineer and two other engineers
appointed by the Governor. Fee, $5.00.
ILLINOIS. Passed in 1915. Pro-
vides for the licensing of all persons
practicing structural engineering. De-
fined as follows: "any person engaged
as principal in the designing and su-
pervision of construction of structures
designed solely for the generation of
electricity or for the handling of coal,
cement, sand, gravel, or similar ma-
terials, elevators, manufacturing
plants, docks, bridges, blast furnaces,
rolling mills, gas producers and res-
ervoirs, water tanks, sanitary works
as applied to the purification of water,
or plants for waste and sewage dis-
posal, roundhouses, railroad shops,
pumping stations, or power houses
shall be considered as structural engi-
neers."
Board of five examiners appointed
by the Governor. Plans to be stamped
with license seal of engineer. Reci-
procity (vrrangement with other state
licensed engineers. Fee and registra-
tion, $51.00. Annual fee, $10.00.
Although entitled "a structural en-
gineers' law" it really covers quite a
comprehensive field of civil engineer-
ing. The law was passed through the
efforts of an energetic and able com-
mittee of the Western Society of En-
gineers because they were barred from
the practice of their profession by an
.architects' license law which the engi-
neers permitted to be passed in 1897.
At that time the architects throughout
the country began to have such legisla-
tion effected.
FLORIDA. Passed in 1917. This
law covers the practice of civil engi-
neering. It is almost identical in form
with that suggested by the committee
of the American Society of Civil En-
gineers and which is outlined below.
Examination and registration fee,
$25.00. Annual fee, $5.00.
Other states and countries having


167
engineers' or surveyors' license laws
of various degrees of requirement are:
California, Idaho, South Dakota, Can-
ada, and City of Mexico.
PROPOSED laws.
NEW YORK. In i9ioor 1911 bills
were introduced in the New York leg-
islature by the Technical League for
licensing engineers. Objection to the
form and division of opinion among,
engineers defeated these measures.
The agitation led to the appointment in
1910 of a Committee on Legislation
by the American Society of Civil En-
gineers. The Board declaiming: "that
it was the sentiment of the Board that
the A. S. C. E. use its influence in the
proper formulation of legislation af-
fecting the practice of engineering."
The committee submitted a propos
ed form of law which was afterward,
in 1911, slightly altered by the Board,
who presented the same with the pre-
lude: "The Board of Direction of the
A. S. C. E. does not deem it necessary
or desirable that civil enginers be li-
censed in any state. If, notwithstand-
ing, any state legislature deems sta-
tutes covering the practice of civil en-
gineering desirable, the following
draft is recommended: (Synopsis of
this is given below and may be found
in detail in Transaction of A. S. C. E.
or Engineering News, January 26,
1911.)
PENNSYLVANIA. In 1909 a bill
for licensing was introduced in the
legislature. It was crude and ridicu-
lous, and deserved the defeat it receiv-
ed. In 1913 a commission of engi-
neers appointed to investigate reported
to the Governor on March 2, 1916.
"Does not recommend all engineers to
pass an examination and be registered.
Recommends regulation of practice in
state and municipal service." The
commission formulated a bill similar
to the A. S. C. E. form, covering very
comprehensively many specific lines of
engineering. The bill was not intro-
duced to our present knowledge.
IOWA. In 1916 a carefully drawn
bill for the registration of civil engi-
neers failed to pass for want of ener-
getic support of the engineers. The
bill contained some novel features but
which are worthy of serious consider-
ation.
OHIO. Introduced in 1910. Fail-
ed to pass.
COLORADO. A bill formulated
by the Colorado Secretary of Civil
Engineers is submitted to engineers
for suggestions to the committee by
W. L. Drager, 2381 Clermont St.,
Denver, Colo. (Copy on file with
Secretary of A. A. E., Chicago.)
MINNESOTA. The Minnesota
State Engineers' and Surveyors' So-
ciety has appointed a committee to re-
port upon the questions of the licens-
ing of engineers. Geo. L. Wilson, En-
gineer, M. of W., Minneapolis Street
Railway Company, is Chairman.
MICHIGAN. A bill has been for-
mulated for the registration of civil
engineers to go into effect, August,
1919. This bill has been discusssed at
length in previous issues of the Tech-
nic.
what class of engineering work
should be covered by a
license law?
No existing license law includes all
of the branches of engineering. Some
states include surveying, others civil
engineering. 11linois includes struc-
tural engineering. Other states license
the practice of hydraulic and irriga-
tion work and mining engineering. E-
lectrical and mechanical engineering
are not licensed to our knowledge, but


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
almost invariably the operator of a
steam or electric plant requires a li-
cense. The fact that steam boilers,
elevators, and electric wiring are sub-
ject to either state or municipal in-
spection probably accounts for this.
Inasmuch as there is no apparent de-
mand for license by the mechanical
engineers, and as works of the me-
chanical and electrical engineers can
be readily proven by actual tests,
which is not the case, in general, in
the works of the civil engineer, it is
here suggested that the committee con-
sider only a license law as applying to
civil engineering or specific branches
thereof. The views of members of
the Association and others upon this
point are invited.
THE ESSENTIALS OE AN ENGINEERS'
LICENSE LAW.
The desirability of a license law for
the engineer, architect, doctor or
plumber, individually, or as a class
does not furnish, in law, the slightest
basis for its existence. It is essential
to demonstrate to the legislature and
the court later, if necessary, that the
license law will serve for the conser-
vation and protection of life, health,
or property of the public at large.
Obvious as this principle appears, its
oversight has led to many faultily
drawn acts and to much wasted ener-
gy-
Protection for the public can be se-
cured not only by a state license to the
properly examined and qualified prac-
titioner, but it can also be secured by
the requirement for approval of plans
and by inspection by duly qualified
state officials. For example, the ap-
proval of plans and construction for
dams is required by state boards in
Connecticut, New York, and Pennsyl-
vania. Almost all states require ap-
proval of plans for sewage disposal
by the State Board of Health, and
many states make the same require-
ment for water supply. State and
municipal building codes furnish an
example. Massachusetts requires
state approval of plans for railway
bridges, and other state utility commis-
sions through their engineering staff
supervise engineering construction to
a greater or less degree. State super-
vision as just outlined is the more ob-
vious procedure to the public. Exam-
ination and licensing acts require ini-
tiation from the engineer.
The essentials for a satisfactory en-
gineers' license law, as set forth in
the form suggested by the American
Society of Civil Engineers and as in-
corporated in the Florida act, and to a
modified degree in all other existing
acts, are as follows:
1. An exact definition of civil engi-
neering as illustrated by a statement
of specific works covered.
2. The appointment of a Board of
Examiners, usually five, and made by
the Governor. Requirements for mem-
bership of the Board. Appointment of
a Secretary.
3. Minimum requirements from
candidates in qualifying for examina-
tion. Six years' experience, one of
which is in responsible charge. Two
years allowance for graduate of ap-
proved technical school. It has been
suggested that a minimum education-
al standard be a preliminary require-
ment.
4. Exemptions from examination.
Those in actual practice prior to the
act. (To avoid an ex post facto law.)
Those licensed in other states having
equal requirements. It is suggested
that no additional fee be required of
such parties other than a nominal reg-
istration fee. Consulting engineers
for licensed engineers. Also sufficient
time for engineers of other states to


169
permit them to register without inter-
ruption of work. (See Louisiana
Law.)
5. Reciprocity with other states.
6. Conditions and limitation of the
examination.
7. Penalty for violation of the act.
It has been suggested also that a li-
cense is required to qualify an expert
witness and that no legal collection for
engineering fees be granted unless li-
censed.
9. Required seal on plans.
10. Investigation and prosecutions.
The Board to be active and respon-
sible for this burden.
COMMENT ON NATIONAL LICENSING
Prof. C. T. Johnston
THE American Association of En-
gineers will doubtless chrystal-
ize sentiment in favor of some form of
registration law for engineers which
will be general in its application and
satisfactory to all branches of the pro-
fession.
In so far as the movement in Mich-
igan may be concerned the feasibility
of a general law, covering all kinds of
engineers, is open to question. It is
certain that such a law would have
general support if engineers could be
reached and informed as to the ob-
jects of the legislation. Only follow-
ing a study of four or five years have
the civil engineers of the state decided
that a registration law is desirable.
These engineers can be reached, in
part, through the Michigan Engineer-
ing Society. The Society indorses
this kind of legislation. We do not
know that a favorable sentiment, re-
lating to registration, exists among
other engineers. It is a question of
ultimate desirability that we must now
consider, but rather the prospect for
any legislation which may have an
educational value. Movements of this
kind are slow. Engineers are unable
to meet frequently and the quorum
necessary for a final decision may nev-
er assemble. It may be best for the
civil engineers of the state to go ahead
with legislation framed for their own
protection and thus furnish an early
object lesson for engineers in other
fields. The ideal policy or condition
is seldom attained and then only with
time.
The same discrimination between
the ideal and the possible must be
recognized in discussing the relative
merit of state and national legislation
for the registration of engineers. All
must admit that national legislation
would be most desirable. At the same
time, all must realize that the states
still control matters of this kind and
that no profession or trade has thus
far received much recognition by the
federal government.
The registration of engineers is not
an end in itself. It affords a founda-
tion which may support a profession.
It has been proven by experiment that
where good registration laws are en-
acted, and an intelligent administra-
tion afforded to carry legislation into
effect, the engineer has an opportunity
to grow. The measure that has been
indorsed by the Michigan Engineering
Society has been framed with this ob-
ject in view.

in the S. A. T. C. or the naval unit, pose, which, according to a letter from


171
the war department, was to allow col-
lege students to continue their scholas-
tic work and at the same time prepare
themselves along military lines, so that
they would be ready when needed by
the government, and to supply officer
material.
The last of these it did without
question, as many men had left for
officers' training camps and were do-
ing the work very creditably. Others
had already been chosen, in fact, were
all ready to leave for such camps,
when the armistice was signed. In
addition there were many who would
have been recommended for later
camps.
As to whether the men were able
to continue their scholastic work
there is some question. Undoubtedly,
at first men were compelled to miss
a large number of their classes, but
this was due more to the influenza
epidemic than to the military organiza-
tion. As the epidemic subsided and
arrangements to fit the new condi-
tions were made, the absences from
classes diminished and more time for
study was allowed. After influenza
disappeared, the work of the S. A. T.
C. had come to coincide well enough
with the academic so that it was sel-
dom necessary for a man to miss
classes more than once in 10 days, and
it was usually possible for him to
attend part of his classes even on that
day.
When the compulsory study rule
went into effect, men did not com-
plain of too little time to study, but
too much. Even for four or five weeks
before this the men had Sufficient
time during the day to themselves to
prepare their scholastic work if they
so chose.
It was even demonstrated by cer-
tain men in the S. A. T. C. it was
possible, if one had sufficient desire,
to keep up with college work and
not neglect military duties.
Now that the men are discharged
most of them agree that they are at
least glad to have gone through the
experience and will always look back
upon the time spent in the S. A. T. C.
with pleasant memories.
As a permanent institution, it is
clear that the S. A. T. C. idea is an
impossible one, but in an emergency
it served its purpose.—The Michigan
Daily.
BEGENT8 SQUELCH B. 0. T. C.
At a recent meeting the Regents de-
cided that the demobilization of the
S. A. T. C. should mark the end of
the Military at Michigan. The sug-
gested re-establishment of a unit of
the Reserve Officers' Training Corps
was turned down, and we are sure
that a large majority of the students
back this decision. A year of R. O.
T. C. and a term of S. A. T. C: have
ably demonstrated that if the military
work is not absolutely necessary, it
should be left out entirely. There are
ever continual and severe conflicts be-
tween the military and scolastic to
the detriment of both.

THE STUDENTS' ARMY TRAINING
CORPS
During the summer the students of the
University were all greatly perplexed con-
cerning their position in the draft. Upon
the passing of the 18 to 45 draft law in Au-
gust many of the students made up their
minds to enlist rather than be drafted.
The recent high school graduates were, for
the most part, going to postpone attending
college until after the war.
During September, however, organization
of the S. A. T. C. began to take shape.
Newspapers printed information concerning
the organization and the various universi-
ties sent out notices concerning the courses
and program of drill and studies. This
offered a good chance for the former stu-
dents to return to the universities, and for
high school graduates to enter. Consequent-
ly a heavy enrollment ensued during the
last week or so.
Any student of draft age in the Univer-
sity who was physically fit was eligible
for induction into the S. A. T. C. This in-
duction was purely voluntary on the part of
the student. Those students not eligible
or not desiring to enter the S. A. T. C.
could still continue their college course
without military training but would retain
their places in the draft.
A program for the Students' Army Train-
ing Corps was arranged by the War De-
partment as follows, "to consist of fifty-
five hours of work per week, which includes
periods devoted to study, drill and inspec-
tion. Thirteen hours are allotted to purely
military work, of this ten being devoted to
drill in five two-hour periods, while two
hours are devoted to theoretical military
instruction and one to inspection. The re-
maining forty-two hours are to be devoted
to the academic program which will make
possible an election of fourteen hours and
allow two hours of study in preparation
for each recitation, in addition to the mili-
tary program." One course is prescribed, a
three-hour course in War Aims, the remain-
der of the academic program may be a con-
tinuation of any professional course, or the
election of certain "allied subjects" by Lit-
erary College students. There is a very
wide choice, however, in the list of allied
subjects.
The official statement of the War De-
partment contains the following informa-
tion concerning "opportunity for commis-
sions." "The student soldiers, while re-
ceiving military instruction will be kept
under observation and tests, to determine
their qualifications as officer-candidates and

ists or Doctors. After a certain period, the
men will be selected according to their rec-
ords and assigned to military duty in one
of the following ways:
(a) They may be transferred to a cen-
tral Officers' Training Camp.
(b) They may be transferred to a Non-
commissioned Officers' Training School.
The Opening Exercises
On Tuesday October 1st, 2,570 men as-
sembled on the campus in front of the
Chemistry building to attend the induction
ceremonies which were to take them from
civilian life and place them in the Army or
Navy. Twenty-one hundred and fifty of
these men chose the army for their branch

. (c) They may be assigned to the school
where they arc enrolled for further inten-
sive work in a specified line for a limited
time.
(d) They may be assigned to the voca-
tional training section of the corps for tech-
nical training of military value.
(e) They may be transferred to a can-
tonment for duty with troops as privates.
It cannot be now definitely stated how
long a particular student will remain at
college. This will depend on the require-
ments of the mobilization and the age group
to which he belongs."
of the service, the remaining four hundred
and twenty placed their faith in the Navy.
The members of the former University of
Michigan Branch, U. S. N. A. Training De-
tachment, now Section B, of the S. A. T. C,
uniformed, and led by the battalion band
marched in review before Captain (now
Major) Ralph II. Durkee and his staff,
President Harry B. Hutchins and Dean
Mortimer E. Cooley. Following this, mes-
sages to the S. A. T. C. from President
Wilson, General March, chief of staff, and
Hon. Benedict Crowell, acting secretary of
war, were read. President Wilson's mes-
sage is well worth reading.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
"The step you have taken is a most sig-
nificant one. By it you have ceased to
be merely individuals, each seeking to per-
fect himself to win his own place in the
world, and have become comrades in the
common cause of making the world a better
place to live in. You have joined yourselves
with the entire manhood of the country
and pledged, as did your forefathers, 'your
lives, your fortunes and your sacred honor'
to the freedom of humanity.
"The enterprise upon which you have
embarked is a hazardous and difficult one.
This is not a war of words; this is not a
scholastic struggle. It is a war of ideals,
yet fought with all the devices of science
and with the power of machines. To suc-
ceed you must not only be inspired by the
ideals for which this country stands, but you
must also be masters of the technique with
which the battle is fought. You must not
only be thrilled with zeal for the common
welfare, but you must also be master of the
weapons of today.
"There can be no doubt of the issue. The
spirit that is revealed and the manner in
which America has responded to the call is
indomitable. I have no doubt that you too
will use your utmost strength to maintain
that spirit and to carry it forward to the
final victory that will certainly be ours."
The address by President Harry B.
Hutchins was reminiscent of the two for-
mer wars during the life of the University,
in which the ranks of the student body had
been sorely depleted by the rush of volun-
teers to take up arms in defense of their
country. "Today through the wisdom of
the War Department, you may remain here
and receive your training. May God bless
you, help you to do your duty and to make
your sacrifice, and God help you to be
brave." Following the messages and ad-
dresses, the oath of allegiance was adminis-
tered to the S. A. T. C. men by Captain
Durkee. Also, the order of the day calling
attention to the organization of the S. A. T.
C. was then read to them.
In the afternoon the men were assigned
to Companies and barracks and were given
their first work under the rule of the S. A.
T. C. The men cleaned up the barracks and
grounds and then started the installation of
cots and bedding. Of the latter there was
very little. Most of the men did not receive
any ticks and there was only one blanket al-
loted to each man. Most of the company
commanders allowed their men to sleep
away from the barracks while awaiting the
arrival of blankets and ticks. The men re-
ceived their first meal at the Mess Hall in
the_ evening of the same day. Although
there was no great variety that first night
the men all had good appetites and went to
it with a will.
The S. A. T. C. men had only been quar-
tered in barracks a few days when the epi-
demic of influenza broke out. The men
were quarantined in their barracks for a
time only marching to mess and back. The
fore part of the second week the Health
Service began to give the men a shot of
argarall in the nose each morning. The
men were confined to their barracks in the
mornings spending their time cleaning up
the barracks and policeing the grounds. In
the afternoon they were allowed to attend
classes and to drill. About the end of the
third week, the reign of the "face masks"
took place and lasted just about one week.
Courses of Study Pursued
A communication from the committee on
education and special training, War De-
partment, for the guidance of the S. A. T.
C. men in their choice of courses and sub-
jects have been received by President
Hutchins and the Commanding Officer of
the S. A. T. C. It is designed to give the
students information about the aims and
purpose of the S. A. T. C. This will enable
the student to elect courses of study which
will be of use to him in the branch of the
army to which he is transferred: The men
who were vo untarily inducted into the
corps will be given a chance to name the
branch of service which they prefer. This
does not mean that they are sure to be
transferred to that branch but their pref-
erence will be taken into consideration
along with their military value, ability, and
the needs of the service at the time of trans-
fer. Every consideration will be made to
place the men where it is thought they can


175
render the best service. Usually any man
or so dier will perform his duties best if
they are along a line that is interesting to
him.
"A plan is being formulated for rating
each student soldier with regard to several
distinct qualities, i. e., intelligence (academ-
ic work), ability to command men, physi-
que, business ability, character, honor or
scrupulousness, and other qualities."
"The proportion of calls upon the Stu-
dents' Army Training Corps for officer can-
didates during the next nine months is
expected to be about as follows:
To infantry (including machine gun bat-
talions), field artillery and heavy
(coast) artillery sixty per cent, of
which percentage approximately two-
thirds will require specia preparation
in mathematics.
To air service, twenty per cent.
To ordnance and quartermaster corps,
ten per cent.
To remaining corps including engineers
signal corps, chemical warfare service,
etc., ten per cent. These corps require
more special technical qualifications.
The quartermaster and ordnance corps
will require a considerable number of limit-
ed service officers."
This offers a very wide field of service
and everyone should be able to get in the
branch of the service which he prefers.
A daily schedule of classes and drill was
announced at the beginning of the work by
the S. A. T. C. During the first few
weeks, however, the carrying out of this
schedule was interrupted quite frequently.
Every day there were from eight to fifteen
men per company detailed for duty as
kitchen police. This necessitated absence
from classes. During the influenza epidem-
ic many men were detailed as orderlies at
the various hospitals. Also a large number
of students were sick which kept them from
their classes. Other details were constantly
being made, which further disrupted the
continuity of classes and study. Every two
or three weeks each company placed about
thirty men on guard duty. Although the
men went to classes the next day they
usually were far from 100% efficient.
However, the professors and instructors
have been most helpful in aiding the stu-
dents to make up their back work and have
shown a splendid attitude considering the
difficulties both the S. A. T. C. and Univer-
sity officials have been working under due
to the influenza epidemic. Non-academic
duties were cut to a minimum, so that a
student would be able to carry both military
and academic work successfully.
The daily schedule as announced is as
follows:—
6:15 First Call.
6:25 Reveille.
6:30 Assembly.
6:45 Mess.
7:30 School.
7:45 Sick Call.
11:45 Mess Formation.
11140 Mess.
12:30 School.
2:30 Drill.
2:35 Assembly.
4:30 Recall.
5:45 First Call for Retreat.
5:55 Assembly
6:00 Retreat—To the Colors.
6:15 Mess
7 :oo School.
9:00 Recall.
9:45 Call to Quarters.
10:00 Taps.
There were also formations for school
right after each mess. Saturday and Sun-
day the schedule was changed.
Barracks
The companies have been quartered in
many different houses and in many places.
Nearly every fraternity and club house in
the city has been taken over by the govern-
ment, the government paying the fraterni-
ties a rental of seven cents per day per
man quartered there. The houses were prac-
tically bare except for the cots, bedding and
suitcases of the men. Each man had ap-
proximately fifty square feet of floor space.
Nearly all of the barracks contained a
piano, rented and paid for out of the com-
pany fund.
The following houses were taken over
for use as barracks: Alpha Tau Ome-

Chi, Sigma Nu Sigma Phi, Trigon House,
Zeta Beta Tau, Zeta Psi, Eremite House,
The Hermitage, and Sackett Hall (Q. M.
C.) Also the Theta Delta Chi was taken
over for the University nurses.
Military Work
The military side of the program included
drills, inspections, formations, and march-
ing to mess and to and from classes.
The men had drill five days a week or, in
case of rain, study of the Infantry Drill
Regulation.
The program for Saturday and Sunday
differed from that for other days. Every
Saturday morning after mess the men were
marched back to their barracks, after which
they had about three hours to prepare for
bunk, rifle and personal inspection. The
rooms had to be spotless and not a speck of
dust on the floor or elsewhere. The bunks
had to be made up neatly and the blankets
must be folded in an "S" fold and laid at
the head of the bunk. The bunks were plac-
ed wth the head of one and the foot of
the other alternating along the aisle. Dur-
ing the inspection the men stand, at atten-
tion, at the head and to the right of their
bunks and facing the aisle. Men failing to
pass inspection were usually "S. O. L."
Entertainment
Everything possible was done to fur-
nish entertainment and to make the men
feel at home during their spare time. When
the men first arrived the "Y" did splendid
work in cooperating with the men and help-
ing them to secure temporary quarters.
They also maintained a check room free of
charge. The writing tables were much in
use; paper and envelope being furnished by
the Y. M. C. A., A great many men made
use of the privilege offered by the "Y" of
having their mail addressed there until they
obtained permanent quarters. The Y. M. C.
A. had quarters in Lane Hall, Newberry
Hall and, for a while, maintained a tent
next to Waterman's Gym.
The Alumni Memorial Hall was known
as Hostess House. Here the men could
meet their relatives or sweethearts and
friends who called to see them. The Hos-
tess in charge helped parents and others to
locate men in the Army and Navy and bring
them in touch with each other in the short-
est possible time. The building was fur-
nished with many chairs and cozy daven-
ports loaned from the furnishings of the
fraternity houses. A large assortment of
magazines, books and newspapers were al-
ways on hand as well as writing paper and
envelopes. Entertainment was afforded by
a piano, phonograph, and various games.
Of course the new Union was open for
the comfort and convenience of the men and
it is also performing the usual services in
aiding the men not in the S. A. T. C. to
find employment. It still is the melting pot
of the University.
The Army and Navy Canteen, and the
Knights of Columbus buildings were also
open to the S. A. T. C. men.
S. A. T. C. Doings
The day that was formerly known as
Columbus Day was this year observed as
Liberty Day. This day was set aside in
order that the discovery of America might
be celebrated. To the new student soldiers
it has a double significance as it was the
occasion of their first review before Captain
Durkee. The review was held in compliance
with the order of President Wilson that all
military organizations should observe Lib-
erty Day. Captain Durkee read President
Wilson's Proclamation. This was followed
by an address by Rev. Lloyd C. Douglas
who received a warm welcome.
Recently Captain Durkee was notified by
telegram of his promotion to the rank of
Major. Major Durkee well deserves his
promotion which is the result of the splen-
did work he has done in the last seven


177
months as Commander of the U. S. N. A.
Training Detachment here and in organiz-
ing the S. A. T. C. at Michigan.
The first hike of the S. A. T. C. has tak-
en place. Both Section A and B participat-
ed. The battalions in order and headed by
Major Durkee marched around the Boule-
vard going down Observatory St. and onto
the Old Boulevard past "The Island" and
coming out on Broadway, thence marching
through the down town section and back to
the Campus where the battalions were dis-
missed. All the men enjoyed the hike im-
mensely. The distance 'covered was about
four and one-half miles.
Demobilization
Early this month orders for the demobili-
zation of the local unit of the S. A. T. C.
were received. The necessary paper work
was rapidly gotten under way and in a
short time companies of Section B had had
their phyiscal examinations and were ready
'to be discharged. The men in Section B
were discharged first so that they might
return to their civilian employment at the
earliest possible date.
Cotton uniforms were turned in and the
new wool O. D.'s were issued. Most of the
men were equipped with a uniform, over-
coat, hat. shoes, underwear, sox, a shirt
and a belt before being discharged.
The men of Section A were demobilized
at the rate of about three companies a day,
the demobilization being complete, with the
exception of company 17, by Dec. 14. All
men who were sick or disabled, or who
were retained as clerks, etc., were placed in
this company. About seventy Engineer
Reserve men found themselves in this com-
pany because their service records and
serial numbers were missing. It fell to the
lot of these men to clean up after all the
other companies, doing guard duty, load-
ing Q. M. supplies onto trucks, and from
trucks into freight cars, and such other
general fatigue work. They claim the un-
challenged right to put the letters S. O. L.
after their signatures.
Although these men were kept for more
than a week after most of the rest had
been discharged, still they were able to get
out of the army in time to get home for
Christmas, as they were discharged Dec. 21,
about 10 p. m., along with the rest of the
17th. after spending a delightful evening
loading blankets in the pouring rain.
With little regret on the part of the
faculty or students we bid farewell to the
military regime at Mchigan.
THE PRE-FESTIVAL CONCERTS
This year as in former years the Univer-
sity School of Music has arranged a series
of Pre-Festival Concerts. Five concerts
have been arranged for, every one of which
will be a stellar attraction. The first of
these was to have been by Enrico Caruso on
October 19th. Twice however it has had to
be postponed on account of the influenza
quarantine. His managers, however, have
stated that he will appear at a later date
after the quarantine has ben lifted.
Anna Case appeared here on November
16. She was well received as she is con-
sidered among the greatest of women sing-
ers, and has won the hearts of all who have
heard her sing.
In December, Leopold Godowsky, a dis-
tinguished Russian pianist, will appear here.
He is considered to be one of the greatest
pianists of the present day.
Joseph Bonnet, the French Organist, who
appeared here at the last May Festival is
to be heard again in January.
Toscha Seidel, a Russian Violinist, al-
though little known in America has made
a splendid reputation for himself in Europe.
He will be heard on February 8th in the
last of the Pre-Festival Concerts.
THE IMPOSSIBLE HAS HAPPENED—
ENGINEERS INHABIT LAW
BUILDING
The old enmity between the Engineers
and Laws has been temporarily patched up.
Not from choice on either side to be sure
but by Faculty action which has caused the
installation of drafting tables on the first
floor of the Law building. Last June, such
an event as Engineers taking courses in
drafting within the sanctum of the hated


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Laws would have been considered impossi-
ble. The war god has forced a truce to be
declared. Permanent? Never! shout the
Laws and Engineers in unison.
S. A. T. C. TERM SYSTEM REPLACED
BT OLD SEMESTERS
In accordance with instruction issued to
all colleges and universities having an S. A.
T. C, the University adopted the term
system. Under this system the year is di-
vided into four terms of twelve weeks
each. The dates fixed by the government
for each terms are as follows; First term,
October I to December 21; second term
December 30 to March 21; third term
March 30 to June 21; fourth term June 30
to September 21. Term credit will be given
in place of the old semester hours. Three
term hours will be equal to the one old se-
mester hour. Having the four terms will
allow a larger number and variety bf
courses to be taken. A good many of the
courses have been condensed so as to be
given in one term instead of one semester.
While this term system was in force up
to Dec. 20, now that the S. A. T. C. is ds-
banded the Regents, after considering evi-
dence set before them by the faculties, de-
cided to return to the old semester system
for the present. The present "term" will
thus be lengthened into a regular semester,
and the second semester will begin early in
February as usual.
UNITED STATES SIGNAL CORPS
School for Telephone Engineers
During the past summer, the government
established a school for Signal Corps men
at the University.
Remarks made by three army officials re-
cently in Ann Arbor are to the effect that
signal corps courses, equipment and prac-
tical work here were among the best in the
United States.
A building of the cantonment type 192
feet long and 75 feet wide was erected
alongside of the medical building and was
used by the signal corps men for "study."
i. e., practice. The right side of the build-
ing housed the course in practical line
work, consisting of splicing cables and
was devoted to practcal field work. On
the left side there were small rooms used by
the instructors for the purpose of giving
"quizzes."
The ground between the Signal Corps
building and the Medical building has been
used for practical work, such as; climbing
telegraph poles, building trench communica-
tion lines and repairing telegraph lines. A
larger field was laid out in Observatory
Hollow, where trenches and all communi-
cation lines have been constructed. These
trenches are a duplication of the battle line
ten miles behind the front line trenches.
A building similar to the one on the cam-
pus was also erected in the Hollow.
The old wooden surveying building was
turned over to the signal corps men for
use as class rooms. It has been remod-
eled and now contains rooms for men in
buzzer work, switch board construction, tel-
ephone and telegraph communication work
and theoretical work.
LOSE DEAN M. E. COOLEY
Dean M. E. Cooley was appointed region-
al director of the S. A. T. C. for the
states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Indiana.
He had charge of the educational part of
the S. A. T. C. program in these three
states. In his absence Professor Gram has
taken his place as Dean of the Engineering
College.
"SECTION B" OF THE STUDENTS'
ARMY TRAINING CORPS
Since the advent of the army mechanics,
the campus has taken on a more commer-
cial appearance. Carefully groomed lawns
have given way to numerous wooden struc-
tures. Behind the engineering shops now
stands the general automobile repair build-
ing. To the west of the Old Engineering
building lies a similar structure in which
is housed the ignition and engine repair de-
partment. Just south of the Medical build-
ing is the telephone equipment building.
All of the structures are of the cantonment
type and while not most pleasing to the


179
eye, nevertheless symbolize the speed and
efficiency so highly essential in war times.
The work of construction was left to the
carpentry students. This introduced them
at the first blow to the practical phase of
their work. Just how well they succeeded
is evidenced by their completion of a mess-
hall addition to the new Michigan Union
building, in a single day. Starting at eight-
fifteen in the morning, an army of workers
supplemented by characteristic American
enthusiasm had the building completed by
sundown. A ioo by 200 feet structure
seating 1960 men.
The army mechanics are now included in
what is known as Section B of the S. A. T.
C. Section A constitutes those students
who are enrolled in regular academic work.
Section B consists of men taking short vo-
cational courses.
There have been two detachments here
.during the summer—one beginning on June
15 and closing on August 13. The group
which arrived August 15 left about the mid-
dle of October, a new quota arriving the
next day.
Throughout the course special stress is
laid on the practical side of the work. This
is an absolute necessity when it is consider-
ed that all these men are to be stationed
overseas where every bit of training they
have ever had will be invaluable. The au-
tomobile, or better, automotive mechanics
are given instruction in assembling and dis-
assembling, construction, design, and espec-
ially repair of all automotive machinery,
worn out engines and automobiles as well
as the Liberty aviation and truck motors
are used for practical instruction. It is be-
liev ed that if the mechanics can make these
derelict automobiles run, they can without
a doubt make almost anything run—even
the hun.
Gunsmiths are given training inmaking
repair parts for all the latest weapons and
are able to discover any trouble and rem-
edy it in short order. Blacksmiths are
learning how to transform cold stock into
finished forgings almost while you wait,
while student machinists are taught to ma-

CAMP DAVIS, 1918
E. C. L. MATTHEWS,'19
Several weeks before Michigan's 1918
surveying camp opened all the prospective
camp men got together and perfected the
customary self-governing organization.
"Bill" McWilliams "pulled" the big job.
He was elected "mayor" or "camp manag-
er." The other members of the Camp
Council were:—
"Ray" Jeffs, Editor in Chief of the "Black
Fly."
Ralph Dunn, Camp Auditor.
"Bill" Jaeger, Gen. Mgr. Information Bu-
reau.
"Tasco" Wotaszak, Banker.
"Bob" Glenn, Athletic Director.
Camp is several hundred miles from Ann
Arbor, and the men usually migrate in
groups. The personell of the information
bureau, Mr. "Bill" Jaeger, accordingly
planned a boat trip for all who cared to go
that way. He wasn't up to the minute on
labor conditions though, and when the boys
were in Detroit all ready for the boat they
were informed that a strike was on and so
had to go by rail.
Upon arriving the men found two paral-
lel rows of steel houses stretching part way
around the south end of Douglas Lake. Be-


THE MICHIGAN TECH NIC
tween the two rows of houses—there arc
over thirty of the "shacks" in all—is a new-
ly gravelled road at the east end of which
is a small harbor for row-boats. Further
back from the lake and a half way up the
hill are mess hall and kitchen. On top of
the hill is a small plateau which affords a
suitable place for a flag pole and a base-
ball field. That is Camp Davis as seen by
one approaching from the lake. It is the
place where Michigan's Civil Engineers and
Foresters live during the eight weeks they
are surveying the thousands of acres of
On that particular Sunday it rained stead-
ily all day, and Kaufman got real wet. Prof.
King entered in a Universal taxicab from
Pellston. Next day "Tommy" Garrett drove
in from Cheboygan with half his baggage.
He had lost the other half. A few minutes
later in came "Baldy" Gabriel, "Eddie" Fel-
lers and Wotaszak in "Baldy's" chariot.
This made our camp complete except for
Brigadier Draper and staff, who could not
be spared from Ft. Sheridan till later. When
finally they did come, which was during the
first week they arrived in Pellston in the

land owned by the University and sur-
rounding camp on all sides but the north.
During that time each man helps make the
surveys for imaginary railways, canals, tun-
nels, bridges, and helps to make maps of
the surrounding country.
Every one was due in camp on Sunday,
and most of us got there. Some even came
during the previous week Kaufman walk-
ed from Bryant's after a short discussion
with the pilot of "Bug Camp's" launch
during which said pilot refused to take a
passenger to Camp Davis, and predicted
casualties in case anyone insisted on a ride.
evening, and were given a ride most of the
way to Bryant's. By that time it was late
and very dark, so as a military measure
they pitched camp in the back seat of some-
body's car which was standing out for the
night. All would have been well had the
Brigadier not been attacked by a severe
chill. Despite the advice of Chief of Staff
"Whitey" Rankin and Adjutant Jeffs to the
contrary, the Brigadier ordered that the
company march on, and march on they did
till about six-fifteen A. M. when they ar-
rived in camp tired, and wet with mud and
rain. Dunn, the other military man, arriv-
ed at the end of the week.


1S1
Work, which was supposed to begin on
Monday was put off on account of rain.
Tuesday parties were assigned to such work
as dredging the harbor, stretching canvas,
fixing and flagging triangulation stations,
and some were assigned surveying work.
The others were given surveys within the'
next day.
It was then that the regular camp life
began. Field work all day—; fishing,
swimming, rowing, writing letters, swap-
ping stories and "prayer meetings" all ev-
ening, sleeping all night—that was the gen-
eral life. We had a more definite program
though which was something like this:—
6:00 A. M. Metz rang the first gong.
6:18A. M. Metz disturbed us again.
6:20 A. M. Roll Call—Some were dressed,
and some not quite.
6:30 A. M. Mess—Breakfast.
7:30 A. M. Work began.
11.30 A. M. Mess—Dinner.
12:30 P.M. Afternoon work began.
5 :30 P. M. Mess—Supper.
9:30 P.M. Lights out and all quiet.(?)
Many fellows were out with the first
gong, and into the lake for the morning
plunge. Some never heeded the first get-
up bell, but waited for the second gong.
Then if clothes were not in their proper
place there was at least one missing num-
ber at roll that morning.
After breakfast, beds were made, shacks
were swept and put in order; note books
and instruments were gotten ready for the
day; axes were sharpened and water bottles
filled. Then off they marched in parties of
four and eight over the sandy trails to the
day's task. Some returned for lunch, others
carried it with them. A little before five
the first parties returned from the field, and
shortly after five most of the men were in
the lake for a swim.
Swimming afforded much pleasure, and
a little excitement. There was a spring-
board on the end of dock in front of tent 43,
and it was there that the new stunts were
tried and most of the diving done. Besides
there was the tower in front of the Union
with a spring-board about eight feet above
water, and two higher platforms. One was
up about fourteen feet and the other about
twenty-five. Due to the steep slope of the
lake bottom there was plenty of deep water
for diving within sixty feet of shore.
About eight of the men learned to swim
during the summer; several improving their
diving and everyone had a good time. An
even dozen dived from the top of the tower
—not a bad showing out of thirty-four stu-
dents.
Camp had several activities which added
to our good times.
The "Bug League," an out of door soft
ball organization, was under the direction
of "Bob Glenn." It was composed of five
teams namely:—"Crickets," "Black Flies,"
"Cockroaches," "Grass Hoppers" and "Mus-
quitoes." The championship never was fi-
nally settled, but there Was considerable
discussion as to which team would have
been victorious had the deciding game been
staged. Anyway we had a lot of fun
swinging at the ball, runnning through sand
that was knee-deep and sliding bases head
first into a pair of big shoes and a pile of
dirt
Every week we had a sing. Everyone sat
in a big circle at the Michigan Union and
sang popular Camp Davis songs under the
direction of "Doc" Stouffer and with the
accompaniment of the camp orchestra. It
must have been good for the Bug Campers
invariably rowed over to listen as did also
some of the nearby cottagers. Tacke Bei-
boer was usually on deck in the evening
with a concertina recital.
The "Black Fly" was the official camp
paper. It was published every week in
blue-print by "Ray" Jeffs who was editor-
in-chief and "Bill" Dorrance the business
manager. If the mail-service was especial-
ly good the sheet came out on Saturday at
noon. Our weekly told all the news and all
that was interesting and funny about camp,
and seldom lacked drawings of the Bud
Fisher type. The most popular number was
the one containing "Steve" Collier's femin-
ine creation. There was a stampede when
the extras were put on sale.
There were two factors in camp which
contributed much to the general welfare of


THE MICHIGAN TBCHNIC
the men. They were "Doc" and "Henry."
"Doc" was always on hand when anyone
needed fixing up physically or mentally.
He was director of the camp hospital; dis-
penser of notions, chocolates and "smoked"
peanuts; camp postmaster and musical di-
rector. Henry was High-muck-a-muck of
the kitchen and general good fellow. Tf
anyone left the mess tent with an empty
stomach it was his own fault, for Henry
worked from daylight till dark and a little
more to keep us fed up. Every fellow
agreed that Henry was some cook.
The camp men enjoyed the presence of
the visitors who came at different times
during the summer.
Prof, and Mrs. J. B. Davis came for a
stay of a few days. Prof. Davis is the
founder of Michigan's Engineering Camp.
The 1919 civils were mighty glad to get ac-
quainted with this grand old Michigan nun.
Prof. Riggs and Mr. John Reid of Detroit
stayed with us for a week. That was the
first time Prof. Riggs found it possible to
stay more than a day at a time. We were
glad to have him with us and liked the
The Gang. Camp Davis, 1918
The social season was quite a successful
one. It began with the little trip to Cheboy-
gan by the delegation from shack 43 on
the 4th of July. One of the boys ran away
with the hundred yard dash, and then the
ladies were not at all backward about get-
ting acquainted. They actually invited the
boys to the dance at the Armory. Then
events followed thick and fast. A dance
was staged in Cheboygan, one at Ingleside
and finally a farewell party across the lake
for the camp men. All this besides several
little private parties at the Island, Bryant's
and Ingleside. We considered that quite a
social season for a place so far from civili-
zation with no modern means for transpor-
tation.
talks he gave us, as we sat around the cam;&gt;
fire. Prof. Roth also made us a short visit.
Our other visitors were Rev. Douglas of
Ann Arbor, Mr. W. W. Seymour and son
of Chicago, C. Y. Dixon of Detroit, Frank
Bacon of Ann Arbor, R. B. Palmer of Sag-
inaw, and H. H. Sceley of Ann Arbor.
Seldom did a visitor ever escape without
giving us a talk at the Union.
Early in August Professors Brodie, Mer-
rick and Carey left camp for work in Chi-
na. All three of these men have been in-
structors in camp for several years, and
knew every part of camp and the surround-
ing country. Their absence was felt very
much for the remainder of the summer. As
is customary we had a big bonfire and war-


183
dance (sing) to do honor to the occasion
of their departure.
The red-letter day on the camp calender
was Saturday, August 17th. That was Vis-
itors' Day, an annual camp event. A few
weeks before the appointed day "Mac" Mc-
Williams appointed a committee to arrange
for the big affair. The committee consist-
ed of:—
Roy Elliot—Entertainment.
"Freddie" Hendershot — Property and
Construction.
"Matty" Matthews—Publicity.
The whole camp got behind the work and
everybody who could add to the entertain-
ment agreed to do so. Posters were put in
all nearby places and everyone was invited.
When the seventeenth finally came all was
in readiness. About one hundred and fifty
visitors came to spend the day. They came
from all the nearby villages and resorts.
They were all there for a good time and
had it.
There was something doing every minute.
From 9:30 A. M. to 5:00 P. M. There
were boat races, swimming races, diving
contests, a base ball game, chariot race,
mess race and a real vaudeville. Some of
the interesting characters of the day were:
"Baldy" Gabriel, our farmer clown; "Kid"
Huntley, the cop; Roy Elliott, the red
skirted dancer; and "Buck" Wheat in his
'"Scottish Skit." Nor will "Oh Boy" Peli-
kas and his Greek songs be soon forgotten.
Then we sang our camp songs and bade
our guests adieu.
We had just begun to have dreams of
little to do with a smaller faculty when
along came Profs. Gram and Cissel who
had no such thoughts of idleness. So work
continued as originally planned.
As parties completed their required work
each took up the construction work for a
day or two. This year we built a good ce-
ment sidewalk four feet wide all along the
North side of State St.
Parties numbers four and eight were de-
tailed to extend the camp meridian and lay
out a polaris line. A few days' effort
brought this work to a successful conclu-
sion. Camp Davis now has a well defined
line nearly a mile in length the exact azi-
muth of which is known. The line is de-
termined by a mark in a brass plate set in
concrete at either end.
Then came the last day when the canvas
was all taken in; the diving tower and docks
were all torn apart; the boats were all put
in the sheds; and camp was put in orderly
shape. Then all the good-bye's were said
and the 1018 camp came to a close.
MICHIGAN MEN GO TO CHINA
In the far-off land of China, the land
where the chop-suey and other high priced
Chinese restaurant dishes were invented,
flows the Yellow River. The fertile valley
of the Yellow River, also known as the
Hoang-ho River, is covered with rice fields.
Not only is it important to the Chinese
that these fields should yield their utmost,
but to Japan this territory means the dif-
ference between starvation and plenty. Rice
grown here is shipped down the River
through the Grand Canal in square rigged
junks and other sailing vessels, to the large
sea ports of Japan, Koho, Shimonosaki, Na-
gasaki and Yokahama. From thence it
is distributed to the interior. In the Russo-
Japanese war. Czar Nicholas made an effort
to cut off this source of food from Japan,
but the attempt failed because the Russian
fleet was blown up. However, since His-
tory began, the Yellow River has been sub-
ject to violent floods, causing countless
deaths and immeasurable property loss. At
the present time, the River is also greatly
in need of improvement to make it safe for
navigation on a larger scale. That it should
fall the lot of Michigan men to take the
first steps towards its permanent improve-
ment, is quite fortunate.
Japan recently received the contract to
start the improvement work on the Yellow
River and to reconstruct the Grand Canal.
The Japanese Government interested Am-
erican capitalists, who selected Mr. Joseph
Ripley, '76, to take charge of the work. Mr.
Ripley was the designer of the Panama Ca-
nal locks and consulting Engineer of the


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
New York State Barge Canal. For the re-
mainder of the staff, Mr. Ripley selected
Associate Professor H. O. Merrick, '98, As-
sistant Professors C. O. Carey, '06 and
Hugh Brodie, '07, from the Engineering
College Faculty, Ralph Goodrich, '03, city
Engineer of Lansing, and three other Mich-
igan graduates. They left for the East
toward the end of August, and when last
heard from, had safely landed in Japan
from which country they were to proceed
to the scene of their work. They will make
a survey of the Yellow River and the Grand
Canal and prepare plans for flood preven-
tion and improvement of navigation.
It will require at least two years to com-
plete the work. Rodmen and other party
helpers will have to be trained in China,
and no doubt the Michigan men will return
with many interesting tales of their exper-
iences with the Chinese as such. Through-
out the region to be surveyed, are scattered
American Missions, Missionary hospitals
and Chinese Government Colleges manned
by American teachers.
RESEARCH
CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
Little research was done in the depart-
ment this summer. Prof. Badger carried
on considerable work in the evaporator
laboratory, largely consisting in a general
try-out of the apparatus and a survey of
the methods of measurement and the accu-
racy to be expected. A series of tests was
run to determine the effect on the rate of
heat transmission in the evaporator as the
level of liquor being was evaporated. The
tests showed that the maximum rate of
evaporation was obtained when the heat-
ing surfaces were submerged to only about
one-third of their depth. As the level of
the liquor was raised above this point the
rate of heat transmission fell off very rapid-
ly. The point of maximum capacity indi-
cates the level where the splashing of the
boiler liquor is just sufficient to wet the
tubes to the top. Further increase of the
depth of the liquor merely serves to increase
the hydrostatic head on the lower layers
and consequently to increase their boiling
point; hence the decrease in capacity.
Professor Smart and Mr. Zimmcrli spent
the summer in the employ of the inspection
branch of the Signal Corps, in work on
special problems connected with the inspec-
tion of the Liberty motor and other aero-
plane parts. They have brought back a
very large amount of material illustrating
various metallurgical problems, and sever-
al important questions to be made the sub-
ject of research during the coming year.
The staff of the department has been in-
creased this fall by two men. Mr. A. F.
Wcndler has been made Instructor, in
charge of the work in Gas Analysis. Mr.
E. M. Baker has also been made Instructor,
with work mainly in connection with the
Evaporator laboratory. Mr. Wendler grad-
uated from Chemical Engineering in Feb-
ruary, 1918, and has since been a student in.
the Graduate School. Mr. Baker graduated
from the course in Electrochemical Engi-
neering at Pennsylvania State College in
1916, and has since been with the Hooker
Electrochemical Co. in the manufacture of
momochlorbenzcne and picric acid.

On the morning of June 25, 1918, nine of
the sixteen Engineers who received their
diplomas in '68, assembled at the Engineer-
ing Arch to assist in the dedication of a
bronze tablet erected there to the memory
of Professor De Volson Wood who was
at the head of the work in Engineering
throughout their college course. The prin-
cipal address was given by one of their
members, Professor Joseph Baker Davis,
for many years a distinguished member of
the Engineering Faculty.
Through the generous hospitality of
Brother Joe Steere and Mrs. Steere and
of Brother Joe Davis and Mrs. Davis it

STIFF REMARKS
A little Irishman was being examined for
admission to the S.A.T.C. He seemed all-
right with one exception. The doctor said,
"You're a little stiff." Quickly the Irish
blood mounted as the applicant retorted,
"And you're a big stiff!"
FIFTH LIBERTY LOAN
Banker—"Liberty Bond, sir? What de-
nomination?"
He—"BAPTIST."
A CHANGE RECOMMENDED IN
THE S.A.T.C.
Sergeant—You've fallen out of line not
less than five times. You should not be
in this company at all.
S.A.T.C. Recruit—Where should I be?
Sergeant—In the flying corps, and you'd
only have to fall out once.
THE AMERICAN HABIT
Harry — Listen, Bill! Sounds like ole
Fritz comin' over in the mud—squish,
squash, squish, squash.
Bill—That's orl right—That's only the
Americans further up a-chcwin' their gum
rations.
MILITARY DIGNITY
"May we have the pleasure of your com-
pany this evening, Colonel?"
"Company, madam? I command a reg-
iment."

PRACTICAL HOSPITALITY FOOD CONSERVATION

NOT FRIGHTENED
Private Jones was doing his first guard

SENIOR THOUGHTS
A Freshman is a green, rough-shod, in-
competent, funnel-headed, weak-kneed fel-
low, who eats and sleeps near a Univer-
sity and is exposed to an education.
A Sophorome is a long, lean, lanky, ca-
daverous, half-starved son of a sap-sucker,
who carries bundles of books to and from
class. A sort of intellectual pall-bearer.
A Junior is a vain, conceited, egotistical,
opinionated, self-sufficient prig who thinks
he knows as much as a senior.
A Senior is a learned, amiable, witty,
good-looking, modest, unassuming student
whom all adore and love for the beautiful
qualities of mind and soul he possesses.
A professor is a morose, crabbed, peev-
ish, petulant, perverse, ill-natured, fossil-
ized, freakish fellow with corns on his in-
tellect. (See Indigestion and Lumbago.)—.
Notre Dame Scholastic.
"My kingdom for a beer," he cried,
And as she slapped him on the ear,
The moon was floating in the sea,
And then his pipe went out.
Oh, see the dainty engineer!
His pants are blue and pink:
The cow was eating doughnuts;
She loves me, I don't think.
"Why should we labor hard each day?
Sloe gin for mine is right."
The barkeep filled his glass again;
The boy was getting tight.
I guess this is about enough
Of this misguided junk;
It's only filling space, you see.
That's why it is so punk.


20I
JOHNNIE KNOWS
Teacher—"Do you know, Johnnie, where
shingles were first used?"
Johnnie (modestly)—"I'd rather not
tell."
She—Do you think it possible for a man
to love two women at once?
S.A.T.C. Freshman—Yes, twenty at once,
if they were all like you.
Some are born nutty,
Some achieve nuttiness,
Others have the nut thrust upon them.
And speaking about war, a couple walked
up to the scoundrel behind the marriage
license window and said, "Is this the re-
cruiting office? We want to enlist for
war."
"I didn't raise my beard to be an eyelash."
It's all wrong, Von Hindenberg; it's all
wrong.
Prof.—"Do you think you have proven
the proposition, Mr. Weissnix?"
Stude.—"Proven is rather a strong word,
P'fessor. But I think I have rendered it
highly probable."
SPEED
"Did you know that all aeroplane pro-
pellors were made in Russia?"
"No, how's that?"
"Because they make 2,000 revolutions per
minute."
First stude (having just received his
mentor card)—"After all we come to
school to study."
Second stude—"Yes, after all."
A DEEP ONE
He who Mrs. a chance to take a kiss has
Mr. thing he should not Miss.
Bing—"What are they taking those wires
down for?"
Ding—"That is a human act."
Bing—"How is that?"
Ding—"They are on the committee for
relief of the Poles."
George—"Forty miles an hour, are you
brave?"
Georgette—"Sure, I'm full of grit."
IS IT POSSIBLE?
He—"Isn't the horse a peculiar animal?"
Another He—"In what way?"
He—"Why, he can always eat best when
he hasn't a bit in his mouth."
He—Will you go to the dance with me?
She—I'm sorry, I can't; but I'll intro-
duce you to a very handsome and clever
girl whom you can take.
He I don't want a handsome and clever
girl; I want you.
He (after a dance)—"Your feet are very
attractive."
She—"Yes, by the looks of my pumps
they are regular magnets."
ANOTHER MRS. MALAPROP
"Is she clever?"
"She can sit at the piano for hours and
compromise her own music."
Captain—See that German officer on the
deck of that submarine?
Gunner-—Yes, sir.
Captain—Put a sixteen inch shell in his
eye.
Gunner—Which eye, sir?"—Punch Bowl.
What kind of horses are they using in
the army, Algernon?
Draft horses, I believe, Cclestine.
—Purple Cow.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
A BOY'S BAD BREAK
A rather dignified lady got a little shock
the other afternoon. She called at the
house of a new acquaintance, and the little
fellow who answered the door said that his
mother was out. The dignified lady took
out a card to leave, and in doing so let the
tissue sheet flutter to the ground. The
boy glanced at it.
'"Please'm," he sa.id, "you dropped one
of your cigarette papers."—Transeript.
Bess (after the houseparty)—"It's funny
how the good looking fellows usually have
the poorest girls, isn't it, dear?"
Tess—"I was just going to say that you
had the perfectly handsomest man!"
•—Jack o'Lantem.
CANNY
He (cautiously)—"If I should propose,
would you say 'Yes'?"
She (still more cautiously)—"If you
knew I would say 'Yes,' would you pro-
pose?"
HERE COMES THE BRIDE
A certain rector called to the vestibule
just before a service was to meet a couple
who wanted to be married. He explained
that there was not time for the ceremony
then, but said that if they would remain
until the close of the ceremonies he would
give them a chance to come forward at
that time.
The couple agreed and at the proper mo-
ment the minister said: "Will those who
wish to be united in the holy bonds of mat-
rimony please come forward."
Whereupon thirteen women and one man
proceeded to the altar.
Drug Clerk—"Now what kind of a tooth-

The «y" and the WAR
Wheh an officer said to Elsie Janis at the close of an entertain-
ment in a Y. M. C. A. Hut: "You have kept my men from think-
ing of tomorrow's battle; they will fight better because of tonight,"
he expressed the big, underlying purpose of the Y. M. C. A. work.
In other words, the
Y. M. C. A. is Helping Win the War
The Y. M. C. A. of wartime is
vastly different from the Y. M. C. A.
as most people know it. Its work
has assumed tremendous propor-
tions and achieved tremendous re-
sults. It is supplying a vital need—
one that is not supplied in any
other way. Its work is as important
as that of any other organization
which the war has developed.
Those of us who are bearing the
lighter part of this great war bur-
den must realize that it is not
enough to raise and train an army. It Is not
enough to feed and clothe our men. It is not
enough to care for those who are wounded.
Soldiers are people, not machines. They
must be kept mentally fit to make them
efficient.
It has been demonstrated—is being demon-
strated all the time—that the nation gives
freely for the building of ships, for the manu-
facture of munitions, for the housing, cloth-
ing and feeding of our fighting men and for
providing medical aid to those who are
wounded. It will give just as freely when it
understands that without the games, stores,
reading, educational courses and home com-
forts which the **Y'' provides,
this other giving will be futile.

Consider yourself in relation to
your work. Suppose you were taken
from your job, removed to another
town and put to work. Suppose at
the end of each day's work you ate
your supper, went to bed, got up
in the morning, had your breakfast,
went to work and kept this up for
weeks and months—nowhere to go
in your idle time; nothing to do; no
friends who cared about you. How
long could you keep it up? How long could
you do your work? That would be the
soldier's life without the "Y."
Somebody said, "beware of the army that
sings." Armies do not sing in response to
orders. They do not sing because of the joy
of fighting. They sing because their spirits
are high, because they are mentally, morally
and physically fit; and it is this condition of
mind and body, this building up and main-
taining of the morale of our men, which is
the deciding factor between a victorious and
a defeated army.
Four allied activities, all endorsed by the Government, ore combined in the
United War Work Campaign "with the budgets distributed as follows:
Y. M. C. A., $100,000,000; Y. W. C. A., $15,000,000; War Com-
munity Service, $15,000,000; American Library Association, $3,500,000.

CHARGING THE FURNACE
The modern method of charging the open-hearth
furnace is by means of the machine shown above,
which inserts a bucket full of pig iron and scrap,
turns it over and deposits it in the furnace.
This is one of the first steps in the production of
steel castings, of which we have an annual capacity
of over 300,000 tons.

Glass breakage in skylights is usually due to deflection of
the supporting bar. A bar that was strong originally loses its
strength due to rust and corrosion, and deflects, causing glass
breakage.
Aspronet Glazing Construction not only provides a bar of
known strength, but provides the proper factor of Safety. More-
over, this strength is made permanent by protecting the bar
with the APM rnst-proof envelope.
Leakage cannot occur at the joints—the impervious cushion
and cap filler of asphaltic composition absolutely exclude water
and dirt.
Aspromet Glazing practically eliminates maintenance cost—
It docs not even require painting. Bulletin 55J gives complete
details.

Every electrical engineering and manufacturing facility of this com-
pany has been applied "without stint or limit" to the vital business of
winning the war.
When Steel faced the crisis, Electric Power was ready to aid
Some day, when there is time to tell the his-
tory of America's industrial mobilization, the
romantic story of steel will be a source of
pride to every American.
For a decade or more, wise men of business
were certain that steel in America had reached
top production.
But, when the war call came for "a bridge of
ships," thousands of guns, and an endless sup-
ply of munitions—steel did the impossible.
With furnaces flaming with patriotism, steel
gave every ounce of energy to the cause. In
1917, tonnage reached forty millions—an out-
put exceeding that of all other nations.
When steel faced the tremendous tasks im-
posed upon it, plant managers and production
engineers turned to the General Electric Com-
pany. They found G-E industrial power
specialists prepared to render this additional
service, and G-E manufacturing facilities
ample to supply their needs in record time.
In unloading ore, charging open hearth fur-
naces, operating blast furnace blowers, rolling
mills and giant cranes, electric motors and
control apparatus have become indispensable.
And yet, steel is only one of the many war
industries dependent on electric power. G-E
engineers, located throughout the country,
with the company's plants behind them, are
also energetically engaged with the electrifica-
tion of other expanded industries—food, tex-
tiles, coal, oil, chemicals, mines, metals; ships,
aeroplanes, automobiles, munitions, central
power plants, lighting and transportation sys-
tems—all essential to victory.
