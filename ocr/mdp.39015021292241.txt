During the coming year you will have anppportunity to look at
fraternities as a social outlet and as a place to live.Fraternities have
many advantages. They offer lifelong friendships,a chance to develop
leadership skills and a home within a large University.These, and other
benefits are offered by Triangle.
Triangle restricts its membership to engineers, architects and
scientists (physics, chemistry, mathematics, computer science). In our
louse this helps a great dealbecause there will always be someone else
iere to help you with your studies.We have most branches of engineering
represented here, along with architecture and the sciences.
We think fraternity life has much to offer a student,
and that Triangle is one house that you should look at
closely. We offer the same things as other houses, and yet a
little more. Come on over an give us a try!

The Michigan Technic Corporation is a
non-profit engineering and scientific re-
search company geared towards aiding and
informing the university community and
the general public. Though students of the
University of Michigan work for The Mich-
igan Technic Corporation, there is no
affiliation with or financial support (exclu-
sive of office space) with The University of
Michigan. The Michigan Technic Corpora-
tion governs the operations of its divisions
Amerotech Engineering and Research and
Michigan Technic magazine. Though The
Michigan Technic Corporation will
continue the name and the fine tradition of
The Michigan Technic, this corporation
and its divisions has no legal ties with the
publication The Michigan Technic.
The Michigan Technic Magazine, a divi-
sion of The Michigan Technic Corporation,
is the student magazine of the College of
Engineering at the University of Michigan
and the University at large. It is published
on or about the first day of classes in
September, and on or about the first class
day of October, December, February and
April, and is distributed free of charge to
the students, faculty, staff and administra-
tion of the University of Michigan and the
nation at Large. The Michigan Technic
magazine, a division of The Michigan
Technic Corporation, is a non-profit or-
ganization operated by the students of the
University of Michigan and the staff of The
Michigan Technic Corporation. However,
'there is no affiliation with (exclusive of

Your Future: The New Technologies
By Andrew Santangelo
Technology, according to Webster's dic-
tionary is defined as "[an] applied science...
a technical method of achieving a practical
purpose...a totality of the means em-
ployed to provide objects necessary for
human sustenance and comfort." In today's
world with the problems of inflation and
high energy costs we human's are facing an
ever more restrictive lifestyle. So where do
the solutions to the problem lie? One solu-
tion is in the new technologies. Note the
latter phrase from Webster's dictionary:
"[Technology is] a totality of the means em-
ployed to provide objects necessary to
human sustenance and comfort." Essen-
tially speaking, all of us from engineering
and science to business must perpetuate
ever newer forms of high technology to re-
move the restrictions of today's broad
problems. These new technologies should
be molded to meet and complement our
lifestyles —not create problems as past tech-
nological advancements have. Yet to do this
we need highly educated people. People
prepared to make changes in life. All of us
here at the University of Michigan 1 feel
have this in mind. The English major who
reads and writes of Utopian societies; the
scientist who tests these theories of better
lifestyles; the engineer and businessman
who design and create that world of perfect
life. We are all working here for a better
life. Though many don't realize it. Some
even just follow along and watch modern
technology advance, and ignore the part
they might play in life. However all this is
wrong thinking. In general everyone mustn't
sit back and follow along with today's
complex technological advances to make
life better. You should prepare yourself and
be a part of the New Technologies. Be on
the forefront of technology and make this
world a better place to live in.
Admittedly this is a strong statement, but
it is meant to be. Though you may be ask-
ing yourself "what if I design something to
make this world great, but a company or
person will give me a million dollars not to
market it." This is a problem some (or
many) will face as time goes on with no
simple answer. Essentially speaking one has
two options—take the million and live
happily ever after or market your idea and
take a chance. I will admit in creating an
idea or object we are set partially on making
money, and if given a million dollars life
would be much easier. But is this right? As
stated in the science-fiction flick Star
Trek-The Wrath of Kahn "The needs of
the many outweigh the needs of the few."
True this is a statement from an "enter-
tainment film", but 1 feel it is a quote worth
following; so, 1 would say market your
idea. Though the party in question who was
to give you the million not to market the
idea may give you trouble, do what is best
for all of us —and you in turn may prosper.
The major question here at hand though
is "how do / get involved? How can / learn
to be able to play a part in the 'New Tech-
nologies.'" The first step if you are in
school is to augment your college education
with practical experience. This can be done
by working on research projects, working
with corporations in a University assisted
co-op program or even by applying your
hobbies to your education. From here,
either by yourself or working with a group,
create, develop and bring out those ideas
for bettering this world. Besides this, you or
your group should ally with others. This
could prove practical in that by working to-
gether and sharing information technology
could advance even faster and further. In
essence experience, persistance and cooper-
ation are keys in aiding you with advancing
technology forwards.
Many examples exist of people and or-
ganizations playing a part in advancing
technology forwards. By just turning to the
Research and Development section of thi^
magazine one can easily ascertain the im-
portant role the College of Engineering and
University as a whole is playing in the ad-
vancement of Bioengineering. The United
States newest effort in the advancement of
space technology, the Space Shuttle, will
provide for the engineering and scientific
community a new path in the exploration
and investigation of the Earth, the Solar
System, and the general realms of space. In
creating The Michigan Technic Corpora-
tion I hope to have students complemeni
their education by working in projects on
going at the Corporation. Understand thai
the options are always open to you.
Thus, in concluding, you the people ot
The University of Michigan and the nation
if you apply yourselves can in applying
technology make life better. There are nc
ifs, ands or buts —you can be a part of the
"New Technologies". Just remember exper-
ience, persistance and cooperation are the
keys in aiding you with advancing technol-
ogy forwards.
Thank you.

"Welcome Back" Remarks
by Dean J. J. Duderstadt
Fall on campus is always a time of excite-
ment and renewal. Upperclass students re-
turn to their familiar old haunts, ready to
make a fresh start. First year students face a
more confusing and bewildering scene as
they struggle through the maze thrown up
by registration and beginning classes.
But this fall, all of the students and
faculty of the College will face a new scene.
For over the summer, the College began the
long-awaited move to the North Campus.
In late July, the new Dow Building was
completed, and the Departments of Chemi-
cal Engineering and Materials and Metal-
lurgical Engineering have already pro-
ceeded to move into it. In August, the
central offices of the Deans and their staffs
moved out of West Engineering into the
Chrysler Center. In late October, the of-
fices of students services (including Dean
Quackenbush and his staff, the Records
Office, and the Minority Programs Office)
will move into a newly configured building
on the corner of Bonisteel Drive and Beal
Street (next to the Computer Center).
If construction and renovation stay on
schedule, the Department of Mechanical
Engineering and Applied Mechanics will
begin to move those of its faculty remaining
on Central Campus into renovated sections
of G. G. Brown Laboratory and the Lay
(Automotive) Laboratory in January. The
Department of Industrial and Operations
Engineering will be next to move in summer
of 1983 into the renovated Research Ad-
ministration Building. The Department of
Civil Engineering will then move into a re-
configured section of G. G. Brown Labora-
tory in Fall of 1983.
The last department to move will be Elec-
:rical and Computer Engineering. Because
sf the size of this department, the College
will require an entirely new facility on the
North Campus to house ECE. At the pres-
ent time, the State of Michigan intends to
start construction on this $25 million labor-
atory in 1983 with a schedule completion
date of 1985. This facility will also house a
variety of other units such as engineering
administration and the Department of
Humanities.
It should be evident that the next year or
two will be rather confusing, as one depart-
ment after another moves out to and ad-
justs to the North Campus environment.
The massive construction surrounding the
Hospital Replacement Project along Fuller
Road will pose an additional complication.
The logistics of moving a College with 5500
students, 300 faculty, 600 staff, and almost
one million square feet of laboratory space
will be a major challenge to all of us.
But we are convinced that the benefits of
finally being consolidated on one campus in
modern facilities will far outweigh the tem-
porary inconvenience posed by the moves.
The North Campus complex will allow us to
bring many of our laboratories into the
modern world, to implement new technol-
ogies such as computer aided engineering
and telecommunications networks, and to
integrate together our teaching and research
programs. But beyond that, it will establish
a clear identity for the College of Engineer-
ing for faculty and students. It will repre-
sent a dramatic leap forward in the quality
of education we can offer you as students
and in the quality of research we can per-
form for our State and our nation.
Thus Fall of 1982 will be a time of un-
usual excitement for the College as it pro-
ceeds to complete its move to the North
Campus. We would ask for your coopera-
tion and patience during this difficult yet
important period.

In the past summer the financially
distressed Michigan Technic magazine
with the publication of the spring
1982 issue has financially collapsed
and dissolved. The Michigan Technic
was doomed never to be published
again.
In order to save the 100 year Uni-
versity of Michigan tradition, this
company was organized to not only
continue the magazine, but also to aid
students and researchers towards as-
piring technological goals.
The Michigan Technic Corporation
and its divisions, Amerotech Engi-

Night time at the Dow
The Dow Building
by Doug Smith
Among the many new faces that will
descend on the campus this fall is the re-
cently completed Dow Building located on
North Campus next to the G. G. Brown
Laboratory. The Dow Building, which will
house Materials and Metallurgical Engi-
neering and Chemical Engineering, is an
integral part of the College of Engineering's
eventual move onto North Campus.
A Bit of History
The roots of the Dow Building span three
decades when several laboratory facilities
were constructed on North Campus, begin-
ning in the 1950's.
In the early 1970's a plan was developed
for building an "Engineering Complex" on
North Campus, and in the mid-1970's an
outline was completed by Swanson &amp; Asso-
ciates in which a series of four buildings
would be constructed to augment the exist-
ing laboratories. In this plan the largest of
these four buildings, Engineering Building
I, would house Mechanical Engineering and
Applied Mechanics, Civil Engineering, In-
dustrial and Operations Engineering,
Humanities, the Instructional Television
System, and the College Administration.
Engineering Building II, which has since be-
come the Dow Building would contain
Chemical Engineering and Materials and
Metallurgical Engineering. Engineering
Building III would be for ECE, CICE and
Nuclear Engineering and Engineering
Building IV for Naval Architecture and
Marine Engineering.
In 1977 the State Legislature formally
accepted this plan and passed a resolution
which essentially committed the State to
funding 60% of the entire project with the
University making up the remainder.
The College went on a nationwide cam-
paign to raise $21 million of which approxi-
mately $10-12 million would be used as the
University's contribution of 40%.
Around the time the College had finished
raising these funds the State came back and
said that due to the worsening economic
Michigan Technic


The finished product—
conditions, they could no longer meet their
commitment to fund the "Engineering
Complex". This left the College to decide
what to do with the money that had been
collected — money that was quickly being
gobbled up by inflation. They decided to
begin construction on Engineering Building
II but with one major revision.
College administrators knew that they
would eventually need larger facilities and a
study was done by the University which
showed that expanding the basement would
be the most cost effective way to create the
necessary space.
The Dow Building, nee Engineering
Building II, was completed in July and will
"come on line" this fall. Construction was
funded entirely by private funds with the
Dow family being the major contributor.
A Guided Tour
The first floor basement will be used ex-
clusively as an instructional area and a great
deal of attention has been paid to creating a
facility that will be adaptable to the Col-
continued on top of next page

—of a well-designed research facility.
A TOUR OF THE DOW
by INagihcim Cinhcet
Last April our roving Super Snoop and
spy Nagihcim Cinhcet took the liberty to
inspect the newest building on campus the
Dow Building. The Michigan Technic
doesn't approve of Nagihmic Cinhcet inves-
tigative techniques, but his reporting is
good enough to warrant some readers. Here
is his story.
It was a rainy Thursday night. I took a
bus from Central Campus up to North
Campus to see some Aerospace movies. A
Bursley-Baits bus was the first one by so I
got off at the Commons. It was raining, but
it was such a warm night that I decided to
walk. On passing the Dow building, the
newest building on North Campus, I looked
at my watch and noticed I was 20 minutes
sarly. Just enough time for a quick look-
tee. This is what I saw.
I was surprised that the doors were un-
ocked but they were. I walked into a small
rntrance room. Ahead of me was more
loors leading into the building and to the
ight was a stair case. The room was like the
&gt;ne in East Engineering, but bigger. This I
igure, will flood every winter when the
nows come, just like the one in East
Engineering.
What a better place to start than the first
loor. It being dark outside I knew I
couldn't turn on any lights besides the ones
already on that were scattered throughout
the building. 1 turned down the first hall
and saw small rooms in the hall perpendicu-
lar to the one at the exit. Down this hall I
walked looking in every door. A bathroom
here, a janitor's closet there. I walked in
one room and turned on the light and there
it was, what every student detests: a big lec-
ture hall. There was a thermostat on the
wall. It was set at 68 degrees. The hall was
all cement. It doesn't look bad really. It
looks something like an outdoor Greek
Theatre. I can picture people sitting on the
cement teared rows. The room wasn't as big
as 1210 Chem, but it will hold more people
than the ones who want to be there.
I entered another door into a huge room.
This must be where they are going to put all
those machines in East Engineering. The
walls weren't painted and the poles were
bare. I walked through the big opening
wondering how they are going to get the
machines in here. At the other end was one
of the staircases at the four corners of the
Dow Building. At the top of these stairways
was a skylight. It will enable the engineer to
actually get some sunlight. It is a revolu-
tionary idea, I think. The second and third
floors have four hallways making a square.
On the inside of the hall you can tell Dow
Chemical donated it. Each room has Chem-
ical Engineering equipment in it. The
Chemical Engineer is going to spend a lot of
time in this building. It will be home. On
the outside was the ever present offices. The
offices are as big as offices go, but too small
for my liking. The corner office, from
which you can see the Chrysler Center is my
kind of office, with two other offices, one
to each side. This could be well used.
On down the hall I doscovered a room
with a spiral staircase that goes up to the
third floor. I believe this is just an orna-
ment.
Across the hall is a classroom. A typical
classroom with a typical flaw. The flaw I
can't believe still exists in classroom's across
the country (college wide that is.) The flaw
is that it has a blackboard spanning the
whole of two walls. Two walls I said. When
will people learn. I will be surprised if one
of the walls of the blackboard will ever be
used. I feel it safe to say that 95% of T.A.'s
and Professors don't use two walls in one
lecture or discussion. Why people still build
classrooms with two walls of blackboard I'll
never know?
At the other end of the hallway from the
office I like was another office similar to it.
I still feel my first choice was best, but this
will do in a jam. Down the next hallway
were more small offices, and across from
them was more of Chemical Engineering
heaven.
The third floor looks much like the
second but without the neat offices.
And so goes a tour of the Dow.
September, 1982

the basement is devoted entirely to class-
rooms and features an auditorium designed
to seat approximately 165 people plus
several other large classrooms. They are all
well-done, attractive and will help ease the
current overcrowding.
The College has some particularly excit-
ing plans for the expanded, as of now un-
finished, section of the basement. (At press
time, they are tentative.) It has been
designed to accept a mezzanine level which
means there will be a second story covering
one-half to two-thirds of this portion of the
first floor. Part of this area will be used for
standard classrooms. It will also house the
Instructional Television System and the
new freshman computer course which will
utilize IBM personal computers exclusively.
The second and third floors contain fa-
culty offices, some staff and graduate stu-
dent offices, and research and teaching
laboratories. One of these labs is being
equipped with a spectrometer and an im-
pressive array of laser spectroscopy devices.
Another lab has been outfitted with some
interesting bioengineering equipment.
The second floor is primarily for Materi-
als &amp; Metallurgy and the third floor will be
used almost solely by Chemical Engineering.
Future
As mentioned earlier, the goal is to have
the College of Engineering based on North
Campus and the Dow Building is a major
part of this. As we go to press there is a
proposal before the State Legislature to ap-
propriate funds for the construction of En-
gineering Building I, and plans are being
made to move the remaining departments
to North Campus. Projections are for the
entire move to be completed in five years, li
will be exciting to watch the College of En-
gineering prepare to meet the challenges of
the future.

neering. He enjoys reading, swimming ana
sailing.
WHO ARE THE CLASS OF 1986?
by Nadine-Marie Pokorski
Every university, from the days of Aris-
totle and Socrates to the present, have al-
ways boasted of their brilliant students in
order to give them a better edge over com-
petitive institutions. This situation still
exists today as students, faculty and con-
cerned others question the truth of these
statements. The most popular reason to
find the truth of the matter is that in order
to be admitted into any particular institu-
tion one must exhibit worthiness through
mostly scholastic abilities. Some of the
most common questions asked today con-
cern high school class rank and test scores
for entering students. University of Michi-
gan students, particularly in engineering
and sciences all seem to have been in the top
of their high school class with exceptional
test scores. But how true are these generali-
zations and exactly what did it take for us
to be admitted in to this particular institu-
tion.
The first idea that came to mind was
High School Class Standing
writing a letter to the Dean of Engineering
asking for the statistics of this year's enter-
ing freshmen. When then referred to Dean
Quackenbush, the Assistant Dean of Engi-
neering, in regards to the issue at hand, he
explained that the data for the class of 1985
would not be available until the end of Sep-
tember. The Assistant Dean then proceeded
by saying, "The class of 1986 are, for all
practical purposes, about the same as the
class of 1985."
The last referral lead us to the Admis-
sions Office and Mr. R. Selser, who ex-
amines each class of entering freshmen. His
"profile" of the freshmen of 1980 and 1981
revealed mostly similarities in class ranks
and test scores therefore upholding Dean
Quackenbush's statement that this year's en-
tering freshmen would appear similar.
These profiles show that Michigan is in-
deed very selective when considering fresh-
ment applications. This is especially true for
instate students as shown in Figure 1. Out-
state students ranked somewhat lower in
ENROLLED FRESHMEN
FALL 1981
class rank than did instate students. The
same was also true for the Freshman enter-
ing in 1980 as shown in Figure 2. But overall
this does also show that for both years the
majority of freshmen were in the top 10rt
of their class or better.
When examining College Board Scholas-
tic Aptitude Test Scores it seems that the
lower high school class rank of outstate stu-
dents is compensated for by higher test
scores in both 1980 and 1981 freshmen
classes. It is also interesting to note that for
engineers the median mathematics score?
are more than 100 points higher than the
median verbal scores, except for those of
instate students where the median is only 10
points higher.
Overall it is plain to see that the Univer-
sity of Michigan Engineering students ad-

How to Survive in the Engineering College
by Andrew Santangelo
Welcome to one of the best engineering
colleges in the country. Michigan has been
recognized by many corporations and re-
search institutions as "one of the very few
giant universities that has achieved both
quality and quantity education." What does
this mean to you, the new Michigan Engi-
neering student? It means that you can get
an excellent education here, but that you
must use the facilities available here to
make the most of your stay here. This is
especially true for engineering students.
One of the first things you'll find out is
that instructors love to assign volumes of
homework. This really is necessary, because
engineering is the sort of field that requires
a "learn by doing" approach —you can't
learn to apply the theory unless you actually
apply it. However, you may find yourself
bogged down by the load. One of the best
solutions to this problem is to eat a good
meal, then head for one of the many librar-
ies on campus. Any one of these libraries
offers a place (or places) specifically for the
purpose of studying, with the appropriate
quiet atmosphere. There, you'll be able to
get comfortable (but not so comfortable so
as to fall asleep, though many do), and start
grinding away at that homework. And, be-
lieve me, if you value your grades, you'll get

all your homework done, and on time, even
if it means missing that "big party" down
the hall. You're here to learn, not party —
you should make it a rule to go to parties
only after you have gotten your homework
done (or at least a substantial part of it).
There will always be parties to attend, even
if you miss one, but most instructors won't
let you make up missed homework. If I
sound like your parents, it's for good
reason. Chances are, they went to college
and made the same mistakes you will —they
know what they're talking about. At a
tough, competitive school like Michigan,
you either make the grades or drop out —
and that would be a serious waste of time
and money. So get that homework done. If
you don't get right down to it, you'll find
yourself "pulling all-nighters" just to pass.
All right, so now you say "I went to the
library to study, but I just couldn't under-
stand the stuff—what a big waste of time."
Many new students experience this, and
they approach the problem in one of two
ways: 1) Go buy a six-pack and forget it.
Unfortunately, this usually results in failing
grades and expulsion. 2) Get help. Find
someone else in your class to do homework
with. It's a good way to make friends, and
two heads are always better than one. If
you can't find another student, or don't
make friends that easily, go to the instruc-
tor—that's why he/she holds office hours,
so go ahead and make good use of them.
But before going in for help, make sure
you've really given it a go —make certain
you really know where the problem is. In-
structors can't do much if you go in and
say, "I don't understand anything." You
have to tell them what you don't under-
stand. Besides, making friends with an in-
structor can't hurt. You may get some hints
that weren't presented in class, or you may
find out something about the next test. You
may even find out about some fascinating
research your instructor is doing.
No matter what else you do, use the facil-
ities at Michigan and get all your work
done, even if it costs you some sleep.
Now you've gotten your homework done
and have some free time. What should you
do? If you like to party and have a grand
ole time, Ann Arbor is your town. With
bars and nightspots surrounding the cam-
pus on nearly every side and all those dorm
parties, there's no reason to be bored. Then

your thing. There are myriads of pizzerias
and pinball joints to go to with a group of
friends for your evening/weekend enter-
tainment.
If you prefer more productive goings-on,
you still have the plethora of opportunities
around Michigan's campus. For example,
there are many professional societies for
those who would like to become more in-
volved in a particular field of interest (see
the appropriate engineering department for
more details). You could also try to join an
honor society, participate in the engineering
council, help publish the Michigan Technic,
or get involved with some professor or
graduate student on a research project.
Whether you're after social stimulus or
intellectual stimulus, it's here at Michigan,
if you're willing to go find it. There is, as I
said already, absolutely no reason to be
bored here.
Now we come to the most important
question. What field should you go into?
There is no simple answer to this question.
You should never go into a field which
doesn't interest you. Engineering isn't easy,
and it's much worse if you dislike what
you're doing. Regardless of which field you
choose, your salary will climb as you be-
come better at whatever it is you do, and
that happens much faster if you enjoy it.
For a given degree level (Bachelors, Mas-
ters, Doctorate), salaries for the various
fields are very close, with a few exceptions
(see Table 1), so starting salary should not
be the basis of your decision. Only if you
have strong interests in several fields should
you let salary influence your decision. And
don't forget to weigh in such factors as how
many employers there are in need of this
kind of engineer, how much room for ad-
vancement there is, or how easy (or dif-
ficult) it would be if you decide to change
your field at a later date. For more details
on these and other aspects of the employ-
ment picture, go to the Engineering Place-
ment office, room 128 West Engineering.
For more details on starting salaries, see
the table at the end of this article. Once
again, let me emphasize that after being in
the field several years, your salary depends
more on how well you perform, rather than
which field you choose, or even what degree
level you've attained. In fact, during the
time it takes to get an advanced degree, you
may be promoted so much that you'll be
earning more than you would had you
started later with the more advanced
degree. So don't go for a higher degree
unless it's because of a sincere interest in the
field.
Still don't know how to choose? The
engineering college sponsors information
sessions in the winter and early spring. Go
to these, they help a lot, and there will be
people present who can answer your many
questions. You should go to at least three of
these sessions, and I recommend that you

Bioengineering Research at the University of Michigan
Stories compiled and written by Greg
Thomas
Well, you were told it was coming. You
sat around all summer wondering what it
would be like. Now, it's here. The new look
Michigan Technic. (How do you like it so
far?) You were promised, among other
things, an inside look at the research going
on here at the University of Michigan, and I
don't break my promises.
My name is Greg Thomas and I occupy a
new position here at the Technic, Research
Manager. It's my responsibility to see that
research here at the University of Michigan
is not kept in the closet until you read about
it in the Wall Street Journal. I feel every
student should know what is being done
with our ever increasing tuition money and
how it can help us personally.
The faculty here at the College of Engi-
neering were hired as high level, high quali-
ty teachers to benefit the community by
helping its young people learn a profession,
but more important, they have the ability to
discover new ideas. They do this by investi-
gating new fields. This insures that the high
standard of learning here at the University
of Michigan is maintained.
However, many undergraduate students
feel that they never benefit from this re-
search. It's possible that they don't realize
how valuable a degree from the University
of Michigan is.
One way for these students to benefit
from this research is to learn from these
professors (in the classroom and the labora-
tory). Learn from them by doing your part
in class and by going to them and forcing
them (if you have to) to help you. Do this
because without the student these profes-
sors wouldn't have a job. Without them, we
wouldn't have an education. It is up to us to
take advantage of our time spent here at the
University of Michigan and learn. Many
polls of college deans put the University of
Michigan in the top ten of the universities in
the United States in the quality of the edu-
cation. We got there by doing research. If
someone does not get this high quality edu-
cation then he/she didn't take advantage of
the faculty and facilities here. All you have
to do is know where to go.
It is on this basis that the Technic will
start devoting its R and D section to a cer-
tain graduate program or laboratory here at
the University of Michigan. This' issue will
be devoted to the Bioengineering graduate
program. I would like to thank Professor
Dan Green, Professor and Chairman of the
Bioengineering graduate program, David
Anderson, and Professor Kensall Wise for
their cooperation in my first endeavor with
the Michigan Technic.
A Multichannel Intracortical Depth Probe
The following is produced from the sec-
ond and third quarterly reports of this
project presented to Neural Prosthesis Pro-
gram, National Institute of Neurological
and Communicative Diseases and Stroke by
K. D. Wise.
Some years ago scientists began studying
brain function and the electrical impulses
which are used to communicate between
nerve cells. They set out to record the im-
pulses and hopefully learn more about our
nervous system and how information is
transmitted and processed. Logically, any
engineer would tell you that to get a true

representation of these signals, you should
have an array of sites where you can gather
data over a long period of time. Twenty
years ago this was not possible. At best,
they could only record a group of signals
from many cells at a time for only short
periods of time. This was helpful in their
understanding of the brain, but it was not
as detailed and precise as is needed for a full
understanding. In the last several years,
however, solid-state process technology has
been developed to the point where the de-
velopment of the needed probes is feasible.
These probes will allow multiple simulta-
neous recordings from single cells and sepa-
rated groups of cells in brain tissue for long
periods.
Due to the efforts of principle investiga-
tor K.D. Wise and co-investigators D.J.
Anderson and S.L. BeMent, all professors
here at the University of Michigan, the ori-
ginal engineers' ideas are truly becoming a
reality. The device currently being devel-
oped is called a Multichannel Multiplexed
Intracortical Recording Array. The remain-
der of this article is an attempt to describe
the state-of-the-art technology that is cur-
rently being developed in the Electron
Physics Laboratory in the College of Engi-
neering. The Multichannel Multiplexed In-
tracortical Recording Arrays consists of a
probe with 10 or 11 electrodes on it capable
of recording the small impulses from single
neurons in the brain for long periods of
time (about a year) without damaging the
brain cells.
The probe itself is a small silicon sub-
strate 4.2mm long overall with a shank
width of 100 microns (see figure 1). This sil-
icon has been strength tested (Remember it
must be strong enough to penetrate the pro-
tective layers over the brain but delicate
enough not to damage the cells, (see figure
2) and is surprisingly plyable. The use of sil-
icon has yielded several advantages: first of
all it is biocompatable with tissue, as op-
posed to other possible metals that might
have been used had the silicon not been
strong enough; second, it is compatable
with on-chip circuitry: and finally, it is pos-
sible to use impurity sensitive silicon micro-
machining to form the chip.
Even more amazing is that on this deli-
cate piece of silicon goes a network of high-
ly sophisticated state-of-the-art circuitry
(see figure 3). The signal processing will
eventually be done on the depth probe it-
self. The on-chip electronics consist of elev-
en preamplifiers and a twelfth synchroniza-
tion channel which drives a twelve-channel
analog multiplexer and a high-speed output
buffer. An on-chip clock and shift register
for multiplexer control are also present but
not shown. The power dissipation for this
circuitry has an upper limit of only 5 milli-
watts, representing a considerable design
challenge. Initial passive probe studies indi-
cate a very satisfying power dissipation of
only 2.6 milliwatts.

Three-electrode Pattern for a passive Probe. An actual probe will have a number of
passive recording electrodes (initially ten) that are supported on a substrate and are
inter-connected to active on-chip electronics via lithographically-defined thin-film
electrodes. (Probe substrates are mounted on a penny)

The tests include receiving an output signal
from each of the cells that a probe is in con-
tact with by supplying a controlled stimulus
to the brain (i.e. a flash of light or a loud
short tone of varying frequencies) This will
enable scientists to map out more precisely
the portions of the brain that are used dur-
ing certain types of stimulation. The probes
will also be used (due to the fact that they
can remain in the tissue for long periods of
time) to observe how natural behavioral
changes effect the electrical impulses in our
brain. Finally, after many years of develop-
ment, scientists and engineers will be able to
orobe. as precisely as they wish, into the
intricacies of the human brain

Vestibulo — Spinal Reflex Mechanisms
by M. F. Reschke
Data and observations from previous
manned space flights, particularly the Sky-
lab missions, suggest that significant altera-
tions occur in vestibular, neuromuscular,
and related sensory functions upon expo-
sure to weightlessness. Of particular interest
has been the observation of changes related
to otolith input and vestibulo-spinal re-
sponses observed postflight. However,
aside from the limited behavioral indica-
tions obtained during flight and immediate-
ly postflight, little is known about postural
reflex behavior during sustained weightless-
ness. M. F. Reschke of NASA/Johnson
Space Center (principle investigator) and D.
J. Anderson chairman of the Bioengineer-
ing Graduate Program and Professor of
Electrical and Computer Engineering here
at the University of Michigan (Co-principle
investigator) have been chosen to yield in-
formation about this process.
This investigation has three basic objec-
tives. The first is to investigate, during
prolonged weightlessness with complex (H-

September, 1982
18


spinal reflexes associated with vestibular
(otolith) responses evoked during an applied
linear acceleration. This objective includes
not only an evaluation of otolith-induced
changes in a major postural muscle, but also
an investigation with this technique of the
adaptive process of the vestibular system
and spinal reflex mechanisms to this unique
environment. The second objective is to re-
late space motion sickness to the results of
this investigation. This does not imply that
any attempt will be made to induce motion
sickness symptoms during the experiment.
However, the observed relationship be-
tween evoked vestibulo-spinal reflexes and
any incidental occurrences of motion sick-
ness during any part of the mission would
supply valuable information. Third, it is the
intention of this experiment to investigate a
return of the vestibulo-spinal and postural
reflexes to normal values following the
flight. The data gathered in all phases of the
experiment will be compared with data ob-
tained in a normal laboratory environment
and during parabolic flight where short
periods of weightlessness are experienced.
The objective also is to compare the crew's
flight data with the vestibulo-spinal re-
sponses of normal and labyrinthine defec-
tive subjects.
The flight experiment involves activation
of nerve tissue with electrical shock and the
recording of resulting muscle activity with
surface electrodes. The experiment will uti-
lize a small package of rack-mounted, low-
power electronic equipment to elicit and
record the response. This equipment will in-
clude an experiment control panel, a stimu-
lus isolation unit, physiological amplifiers,
monitoring equipment, and a dedicated mi-
croprocessor. Vestibular stimulation (linear
acceleration) will be obtained with short
(150 to 200 milliseconds) "falls" using a
"hop and drop" apparatus.
Experiment control will be accomplished
with the microprocessor system which has
been programmed to sequence the stimuli
necessary to elicit the response, drop the
subject on command, collect data obtained
from the soleus muscle, and store the re-
sponses while they had been arranged or
analyzed prior to downlink through the on-
board telemetry system.
In the execution of the experimental pro-
tocol, the crewmen will grasp an overhead
handle with both hands; the handle can be
released upon computer command. The
drop or fall is provided by bungie cords at-
tached between a body harness and the deck
of the Spacelab. During each drop the
crewmen will be shocked three separate
times in a controlled sequence to evoke a re-
sponse. The shock sequence will consist of a
condition, a control, and a test shock. The
condition shock is presented first to prepare
the neural tissue for the shocks which fol-
low. Three seconds following the condition
shock, the control shock will be delivered.
Then 3 to 5 seconds later the test shock will
be delivered during the drop. The test shock
to the tibial nerve will be delayed with re-
spect to the time of release or fall. Delay
time of 0,10,20,30,40,50,60, or 70 milli-
seconds will be used. The response to the
test shock will be normalized with respect to
the response from the control shock and
presented as a percent change in amplitude.
Preparation for this experiment is already
underway. However, the actual in flight ex-
periments won't be conducted until the 1983
flights of the Space Shuttle.
The Graduate Program in Bioengineering
It is our objective here at the Michigan
Technic to devote each issue to a certain
graduate program or a topic covered by a
few graduate programs. In this first issue of
the 1982-83 academic year, we are concen-
trating on the Graduate Program in Bio-
engineering.
The Graduate Program in Bioengineering
at the University of Michigan is within the
Horace H. Rackam School of Graduate
studies and grants the M.S. and Ph.D.
degrees in Bioengineering. The program is
jointly supported by the College of Engi-
neering and the School of Medicine. Under
the guidance and counsel of faculty associ-
ated with the program, a student may plan
a course of study in a wide variety of areas.
The educational experience can be broadly
or narrowly directed and is limited only by
the range of teaching and research activity
conducted by the university unit support-
ing the program.
The research interest of the faculty in-
clude everything from the intricate impulses
of the nervous system to the in depth study
of the biomechanics involved in pushing or
pulling a cart. Diagnostic 3-dimensional
imaging of the body and the physiology of
senses like vision and hearing are also given
high priority here at the University. Other
research (much of it state-of-the-art) also
includes joint prostheses, surgical machin-
ing of bone, computerized electrocario-
graphy, cardiology, biostatistics, muscle
transplants, pain behavior in cats and squir-
rel monkeys, ultrasound tomography,
morphometrics (quantitative analysis of
biological shape and shape change), extra-
corporeal circulation (heart/lung substitu-
tion) artificial organs, physiology of work,
human postural control, signal processing
of brain cells, neuromuscular disorders,
and neurology and muscle physiology. This
research is conducted by many professors in
the College of Engineering and the School
of Medicine. The following is a list of all
professors who have expressed an interest in
working with Bioengineering students and
would be happy to discuss his or her re-
search with prospective, new, or continuing

How Many Years Ago?
by David N. Haupt
One of the normal features of each issue
of The Michigan Technic is an article en-
titled 100, 75, 50 and 25 Years Ago (in The
Michigan Technic). However, The Michi-
gan Technic rarely publishes a September
issue (we've given you quite a treat this
year), and that includes the years 1906,
1931, 1956, and 1981. So since we find our-
selves (the magazine, not the staff) coming
up on a very special anniversary—the
100th — we've decided to give you some of
the Michigan Technic's history.
Let's get one thing straight right now.
Just how old is this magazine? Well, of
course, the one you're holding in your
hands is not likely to be more than a few
weeks old. Okay, then, more succinctly, for
how long has the idea of the magazine's
existence been around? Ah, my friend, that
is easy to answer.
The first printed word concerning the
magazine was in 1882, in an abstract titled
'Constitution and By-laws of the University
of Michigan, together with A List of the
Officers for the First Semester, 1882-83,
and The Engineering Faculty. Quite a hefty
title, isn't it? In this piece, we find the
words indicating the creation of the Technic:
"... it has been proposed by some of the
engineering students..., to form a society
for discussing topics pertaining to their pro-
fession. The utility of such an organization
was at once recognized, but nothing defi-
nite was done until toward the close of the
last scholastic year. (This would be the
winter term, of the school year 1881-82 —
ed.) At that time...the proposition to
organize such a society was considered and
approved, and a committee of four
appointed to draft a plan of organiza-
tion ... The objects of the Engineering Soci-
ety. . .are manifold. Chief among these is
the attainment of a more practical knowl-
edge of matters relating to our profes-
sion. . .(we desire to avail ourselves), while
here, of the practical experience each one of
us may have had, and also (to seek) a closer
alliance with our Alumni. Some of our
professors and Alumni already have volun-
teered to address us or to prepare papers to
be read before the Society... part of the
proceedings will be published, and it is
hoped that the matter contained in these
publications may be of such interest as
partly to repay the expense of printing."
So, although nothing was printed until
the following year, we see the creation of
the magazine, but it was not called The
Michigan Technic then. Thus, the organiza-
tion's conception occurred during the
school year 100 years prior to the current
school year. The first printed work carried
the date of September, 1882.
You will note that the current issue car-
ries the volume number 101. This is in spite
of the fact that there have not been 101
volumes published. The original series of
volume numbering would have this as the
100th volume. But the series has changed a
few times. The original numbering system
began with the 1882-1883 issue (there was
only one per year then), which was not
numbered, but was referred to in the second
series as the first series. The 1883-1884
school year's issue was labeled the second
series (of selected papers read before the
Engineering Society...) This numbering
system continued until the 1889-90 school
year. In this year, the magazine carried two
series numbers. One was called the old
series, and one was called the new series, to
commemorate the fact that the name had
been changed to The Technic in 1888-89
school year. In 1898, the old series designa-
tion was dropped, and the new series re-
mained the only volume number on the title
page. In 1920, the publishing year was
changed from September through May to
January through December, and this
caused a bit of a mixup in the volume num-
bers for some years to come. In the 1937-38
publication year, the numbering system
currently in use was begun, to indicate the
fact that the Technic had begun its 56th
year on campus.
The name, as I've already mentioned,
was at first a very long one. In the 1887-88
issue, the editorial contained a brief com-
ment on the change.
"The Technic has heretofore been published
as a Series of Selected Papers read before
the Engineering Society of the University of
Michigan. This legend seemed to cumber-
some; the previous Series have placed our
publication upon a plane where it needs no
excuse for existence, and the Board deemed
it well worthy of a name. Its papers are cer-
tainly of a technic nature, and so we have
christened it The Technic."
In case you don't have your Funk and
Wagnalls' handy, 'technic' is an old, rarely
used synonym for 'technical.' In 1903 came
the final name change, with the explanation:
"The name of this paper has been changed
from The Technic to The Michigan Tech-
nic, with a view of associating the locality in
which the paper is published with the name
of the paper. We feel that this change will
meet with the approval of all, as it has with
those with whom we consulted about the
matter. The suggestion was made by Mr.
George H. Gibson, of the B.F. Sturdevant
Co., and adopted by the present Board of
Editors."
And that's how the magazine was begun.
One final subject concerning the mechanics
of the magazine should be mentioned. The
early issues did not carry a cover, except for
a sheet which indicated what the paper was,
which had the table of contents on it. The
first cover per se, which had merely the
title, but no sketch or other artwork, was
the 1888-89 issue.
ine omces oi tne tecnnic were moveu
about many times, and records are not clear
at indicating what the various locations
were. We had occupied a very hot office in
the basement of East Engineering Building.
Prior to this we were in room 3077 of the
same building. This I know for a fact; the
change was made after I became a staff
member. Prior to that, it appears that the
magazine's offices were shuffled about
quite a lot, but were always in East Engi-
neering (called the Engineering Laboratory
in the early years) or West Engineering
(called the West Engineering Annex, or
simply the Engineering Annex in days gone
by).
I wish there were room in this article to
elucidate on the articles that have appeared
in the magazine since its inception, but alas,
that is what the regular feature '100, 75, 50
and 25' is for. There are copies of all issues
of the magazine in the office, and we'd like
to invite anyone interested to come in and

the very gentlemen after whom our various
buildings were named. You will find articles
by such names as Cooley, Ziwet, Taft, Per-
ry, and Denison (that's right, only one 'n'
ever appeared in the name Denison, even
though many current publications use two).
Reading the publication gives you the idea
that it was Cooley who suggested the idea
of producing the publication and forming
the society, although it is never actually
stated as such. It would be interesting to
find a copy of Dean Cooley's will, and see if
there was a mention of his work with the
magazine.
I wonder if any of the current staff mem-
bers will make as great an impact on the en-
gineering profession as those of the early
days. Only time will tell.
Here is an ad from the Good 'ol days.
This ad is from the 1882-83 issue of
"Selected Papers Read Before the
Engineering Society of the University
of Michigan" (in simpler terms, the
Michigan Technic).

TEKTRONIX INTRODUCES THE FIRST COLOR LOGIC ANALYZER
Beaverton, Ore. —The Design Automa-
tion Division of Tektronix, Inc. today in-
troduced the color version of its DAS 9100
Family of Digital Analysis Systems that fea-
tures a color CRT display. The addition of
color to the friendly, keyboard-controlled
menus establishes a new level of ease-of-use
in logic analysis instruments, increasing
operator efficiency and accuracy.
The DAS 9120 Series of color logic analy-
zers, like the entire DAS 9100 Family, is a
modular digital analysis system housing
both data acquisition and pattern genera-
tion card modules in the same mainframe.
Offered in a variety of data widths and
speeds, these modules are combined in the
mainframe to match the user's application
needs. Data acquisition widths of up to 104
channels and speeds to 660-MHz give state
of the art performance, and the interactive
pattern generator allows simultaneous
stimulation and acquisition from a device
under test.
The DAS 9120 Series represents the first
use of a color display in test and measure-
ment instrumentation. Studies conducted
by the Technology Group, the research arm
of Tektronix, show that color significantly
enhances the interface between the operator
and the logic analyzer. When compared
with other forms of information coding,
color can reduce human response errors by
80 percent. Color also offers a decided ad-
vantage when applied to tasks such as glitch
detection and cursor-based measurements
of timing information. In general, color
means quicker instrument setup and faster
interpretation of acquired data.
Although new to test and measurement,
color has a long and successful history in
many different types of display environ-
ments. Since the human brain is naturally
equipped to process color information,
color is a logical choice for encoding com-
plex displays, such as those found in logic
analyzers. The aesthetic appeal of color also
acts as a deterrent to boredom and fatigue
produced by interacting with a monochro-
matic display.
Three colors —red, yellow, and green —
were picked for the CRT display as dictated
by basic color research at Tektronix and
other institutions. The spectral spacing be-
tween these colors makes them easy to iden-
tify and separate with the human eye. Each
color has been applied to specific informa-
tion on the DAS 9120 Series display.
For quick analysis of displayed data,
"background" information, such as line la-
beling, is separated from "foreground" in-
formation, such as timing diagram. Pro-
grammable menu fields are color-separated
from other fixed fields, improving operator
setup times for data acquisition and pattern
generation. Menu prompts and cursors are
color-coded in red for faster recognition
and interpretation.
All acquired state and timing data are
displayed in yellow, with supporting back-
ground information in green. Items that re-
quire focused attention, such as cursors and
error messages, are presented in red.
Glitches on the acquired data highlighted in
green.
The DAS 9120 Series also incorporates
other new ease-of-use features which are
available for the entire DAS 9100 Family.
"Delta-time" automatically calculates time
intervals between selected sample points. In
addition, mnemonic tables support popular
microprocessors and communications
formats.
"Delta-time" provides greater speed and
accuracy in measuring the time between
selected events. After the cursors are posi-
tioned at two selected events on the timing
diagram, the difference can be read directly
in the "delta-time" display field. The display
indicates the appropriate time units, such as
milliseconds, microseconds and nano-
seconds.
The new mnemonic tables are available
on DC-100 tape cartridges for the DAS
9100's optional tape drive and use the sys-
tem's user-definable mnemonics capability.
Mnemonics for the Z80, 1802, 6800, 6802
and 8085 are available as well as communi-
cations formats for ASCII, EBCDIC and
GPIB.
Available in May 1982, the DAS 9129
color mainframe is priced at $7850 U.S.
Modules, priced from $3,500 U.S., and
selected for their specific data acquisition
and pattern generation capabilities, are in
the form of cards that plug into the six
available slots of the mainframe. Four stan-
dard system configurations priced from
$15,000 to $30,000 U.S. are also available.
For data acquisition, three modules are
currently available to meet specific design
requirements. The 32-channel module pro-
vides 25-MHz sampling both synchronously
and asynchronously with 512 bits per chan-
nel memory and two clock qualifiers. The
8-channel module provides 100-MHz
sampling both synchronously and asyn-
chronously with 512 bits per channel mem-
ory, separate acquisition and glitch memo-
ries, and one clock qualifier. The 4-channel
module provides 330-MHz sampling both
synchronously and asynchronously with
2048 bits per channel memory. A special
high resolution mode provides 660-MHz
(1.5 ns resolution) on 2 channels with 40%
bits per channel memory.
These modules can be intermixed to sup-
port a variety of applications. Up to 104
channels of data acquisition are available at
25-MHz, up to 32 channels at 100-MHz, up
to 16 channels at 330-MHz, and up to 8
channels at 660-MHz (1.5 ns resolution).
A unique trigger arming mode allows
high speed data acquisition modules moni-
toring hardware activity to be triggered
from slower speed modules tracking soft-
ware flow, with acquired data time-aligned
in both timing and state table displays.
For pattern generation, there is a module
with 16 data output channels at 25-MHz,
plus two independent programmable
strobes. This can be extended to 48 or 80
channels of pattern generation with up to
10 programmable strobes by adding one or
two 32-channel expander modules. The pat-
tern generator also has several external con-
trol inputs, including branch on interrupt,
that allow extensive interaction with the sys-
tem under test.
Pattern generation can be used inter-
actively with data acquisition —a consider-
able asset, especially during the early stages
of digital hardward design before software
becomes available. Various test programs
can be created using the pattern generator's
powerful instruction set, which includes
counting, looping, and nested subroutin-
ing. These programs can then be used to
stimulate the hardware circuitry while the
data acquisition cards are used to capture
the results.

CASSETTE BACK UP FOR FLOPPY DISC
Magnetic Information Systems has been
working on a development project with
M.F.E. in order to develop a four track cas-
sette with 450" of high density cassette tape.
This cassette format is intended as a back
up for the Winchester Disc.
Out of this project emerged the Micro-
Comp 450 Digital Cassette which is gaining
acceptance as a back up for Floppy Disc by
personal computer users, educators and
small businesses. The standard two track
800 BPI yields storage capacity on the
Micro-comp 450 in excess of eight million
bits. Thus providing a economical separate
back up system, which is safely stored and
eliminates the temptation of erasing the
back up disc when the user finds himself in
need of additional storage capacity.
This cassette is priced to retail at five dol-
lars ($5.00) and is available through M.I.S.
Dealers.

XEROX INTRODUCES UNIQUE ENGINEERING PRINTER/COPIER
ROCHESTER, N.Y. July 26-A unique,
all-purpose engineering printer which pro-
vides a broad range of reproduction capa-
bilities was introduced today by Xerox
Corporation.
The Xerox 2020 engineering copier offers
size-for-size printing, half-size reproduc-
tions and 63 percent reduction that will pro-
vide 14- by 22-inch prints from 22- by 34-
inch originals. The 2020 will sell for $17,750
and rent for as low as $335 a month.
The Xerox 2020 has been designed to sat-
isfy the total copying needs of the low to
medium volume engineering reproduction
environment in a single system, said Robert
F. Pavelka, president of the Xerox Special
Businesses Division.
"We identified the reprographic needs of
such businesses as engineering, architectural
and construction firms, manufacturing
offices and utilities and developed the 2020
to meet them," Pavelka said.
The engineering printer handles any doc-
ument up to 24 by 36 inches. Engineering
and architectural drawings, electrical dia-
grams, schematics, flow charts, graphs,
computer printouts and opaque or transu-
cent materials can be manually fed into this
document handler and printed individually
at a rate of eight per minute.
Size-for-size engineering prints as large as
14 by 25 inches can be created by using a
touch-sensitive control panel. For originals
over 14 by 25, reduction modes of 63 per-
cent and 50 percent are used to provide
prints from 8'/2 by 11 inches to 14 by 25
inches.
The Xerox 2020 also can provide for
copying of standard size specification
sheets, technical reference sheets, materials
lists —even if they are in bound volumes —
with excellent copy quality. In this applica-
tion it produces 20 copies a minute with the
first copy ready in 12 seconds. The operator
can select to make from one to 99 copies at
a time.
The engineering copier has touch-sensi-
tive control panels, including "copy lighter"
and "copy darker" contrast buttons.
The Xerox 2020 will be offered initially in
the San Francisco/Oakland/San Jose area
and will be available nationally and in
Canada in May 1983

Two Ways To Save Energy
Offered By Bieffe's
Technus Drafting Table
The newly developed Technus drafting
table fro Bieffe is now being offered to
draftsmen, engineers and architects as the
intelligent alternative to the electric tables
now on the market. According to Hughes
Blanson, Vice President of Bieffe, USA,
the Technus saves the draftsman's energy
thanks to its extremely smooth and respon-
sive gas piston operation. And it saves the
energy you buy from the utility company
because it is non-electric. "Furthermore,1'
says Mr. Blanson, "the Technus requires no
expensive installation or special wiring.
Thus it offers more flexibility in the draft-
ing room layout." The Technus is very
stable, rotates 360° and tilts at 80°. Because
of its versatility, it is one of the most popu-
lar professional pedastal tables in the Bieffe
line which is now warehoused in the U.S.A.
and available for fast delivery anywhere in
the country. Contact: Hughes Blanson

New Books on The Market
Philadelphia, PA-In September, ISI
Press will publish How to Write and Pub-
lish Engineering Papers and Reports by
Herbert B. Michaelson, of IBM. This new
book is a practical detailed guide for writing
engineering papers for journals and semi-
nars, reports for engineering organizations,
and theses for academe. The emphasis is on
the problems experienced by engineering
authors in planning and writing effective
manuscripts. Rather than the usual treat-
ments of grammar and exposition, the
author explains how to deal with critics,
how to choose illustrations for important
content, how to increase writing productiv-
ity, and how to avoid semantic traps. Writ-
ing from his own editorial experience, he
offers many practical methods of strength-
ening the character and effectiveness of
written manuscripts and orally presented
papers.
This is an essential work for engineering
students, engineering technologists, and
practicing engineers in every discipline.

Expand the mind
of the microchip.
Remember when electronic
calculators were considered
a luxury? Well, consider this
sign seen recently outside a
gasoline station in Schenec-
tady, New York: "Free calcu-
lator with an oil change."
That's just one sign of the
enormous impact micro-
chips have had on the way
we do everything - from
banking to game-playing.
But how will we use micro-
chips that are smarter,
faster, more reliable, and
less expensive to design?
How will these new micro-
chips be used to improve
systems, products, and pro-
cesses? As one GE engi-
neer puts it, "The sky's the
limit!"
That sky is replete with a
number of integrated circuit
concepts that GE is apply-
ing right now.
There's the custom IC, a
chip that performs highly
specialized functions. Tradi-
tionally, creating this chip
has been an expensive,
time-consuming job. So
we're working on ways to
cut design time and cost.
We're using computer-
aided design (CAD) to
design and simulate chips
right on computer screens.
We're also developing
gate arrays, a system that
allows you to build inexpen-
sive prototype chips that
can be "played" in systems
before the final design is
fixed.
Another area that GE is
developing is VLSI (Very
Large Scale Integrated)
circuits. These ICs will
eventually squeeze one
million transistors onto a
single chip.
Where will all this super
electronic power be
applied? GE engineering
manager Don Paterson
sees it this way:
"At GE you can innovate
from the system down to the
chip to create . whatever
ignites your imagination."
In other words, you can
dream it.. .and do it.

COVER STORIES-
Science in Engineering:
Inside the Space Telescope, written by Janice S. Bohrer, gives a fascinating
view of the space telescope and the universe it will work in. This story won the
first George M. Landes Prize for technical communication at the University of
Michigan. The prize is to be given annually to a U —M engineering student in
the freshman, sophomore or junior levels, who demonstrates an unusual
ability in the presentation of a technical article, design report, piece of
technical journalism involvin writing or other communication media, or any
other presentation of technical work. Story on Page 13
Synthetic Fuels in Perspective. With world oil consumption exceeding the
rate of discovery of new reserves, a large synthetic-fuels industry is an impor-
tant option for reducing our dependence on oil imports. In the United States,
coal and oil shale constitute about 95% of the fossil-energy resources but only
20% of current production, all of which is coal. New technology is expected to
play a key role in the development of a synthetic-fuels industry based on coal
and oil shale. Exxon's current efforts are directed toward new, thermally
efficient processes such as catalytic coal gasification and direct coal liquefac-
tion, development of commercial ventures such as the Colony Shale-Oil
Project, and upgrading of synthetics to meet market needs. These efforts
involve many scientific areas, engineering disciplines, and management skills.

The Michigan Technic Corporation is a
non-profit engineering and scientific re-
search company geared towards aiding and
informing the university community and
the general public. Though students of the
University of Michigan work for The Mich-
igan Technic Corporation, there is no
affiliation with or financial support (exclu-
sive of office space) with The University of
Michigan. The Michigan Technic Corpora-
tion governs the operations of its divisions
Amerotech Engineering and Research and
Michigan Technic magazine. Though The
Michigan Technic Corporation will
continue the name and the fine tradition of
The Michigan Technic, this corporation
and its divisions has no legal ties with the
publication The Michigan Technic.
The Michigan Technic Magazine, a divi-
sion of The Michigan Technic Corporation,
is the student magazine of the College of
Engineering at the University of Michigan
and the University at large. It is published
on or about the first day of classes in
September, and on or about the first class
day of October, December, February and
April, and is distributed free of charge to
the students, faculty, staff and administra-
tion of the University of Michigan and the
nation at Large. The Michigan Technic
magazine, a division of The Michigan
Technic Corporation, is a non-profit or-
ganization operated by the students of the
University of Michigan and the staff of The
Michigan Technic Corporation. However,
there is no affiliation with (exclusive of
office space) from the University. The views

Working Together
As you the reader pick-up this issue and
may have seen in the last issue, one of the
major changes you may have noticed is that
there are more stories and features in the
Michigan Technic pertaining to the industry
— it's latest developments and dates of
student-recruitments. By doing this we
hope to not only aid the student in his/her
search for the company he may want to
work for, but also to enlighten both the
university community and the public of the
continuing research and development done
by the industry. 1 hope you the reader enjoy
this change to positive communication
between the University community and the
industry.
One new section in the magazine is a fea-
ture entitled "Company Interviewing
Dates". In many instances, students going
for job interviews find it sometimes trouble-
some going back and forth to the placement
office to learn when a company is planning
on interviewing. In creating this section all
the student has to do is pick-up the maga-
zine to find out the interviewing date, which
for many saves a trip to the placement of-
fice. Save the magazine or at least cut out
and save the section. It is a "calendar"
worth keeping.
Another feature new to the Michigan
Technic is the section Future World in
Today's World. Working in cooperation
with the business community, the Michigan
Technic is opening its pages to new and
innovative products developed by industry.
As a result, not only does it provide free
publicity to an industry for its products, but
it also serves as a means to inform profes-
sors, researchers and businessmen on the
new products. This section even presents
products from books to computer aids use-
ful to the student in his studies and hobbies.
As one can deduce, we are trying to provide
you, the reader, with stories and features
that are both useful and informative.
In furthering our policy of working
together with the business community, the
Michigan Technic in this issue presents a
story written by W. Robert Epperly of the
Exxon Corporation, who puts synthetic
fuels in perspective. Mr. Epperly, General
Manager of the Synthetic Fuels Department
of Exxon Research and Engineering Com-
pany, points out in his story the need for
synthetic fuels, and Exxon's current efforts
in creating practical methods of producing
synthetic fuels. 1 would again like to thank
Mr. Epperly for providing us his story and
the Exxon Corporation for its cooperation.
In today's world of high technology it is
important that researchers, universities,
industry and others work together. It is
hoped that features like Company Inter-
viewing Dates, Future World in Today's
World and the story by W. Robert Epperly
aid in not only tightening the alliance
between the business community and the
Michigan Technic, but also aid the Univer-
sity community in building up their alliance
with the industry.
Thank you and good reading.

The Makings of an Engineer
by Dean J. J. Duderstadt
The role of engineers in society and their
responsibility for applying technology to
meet human needs have not changed since
the beginnings of the profession. However
the nature of the problems faced by our
society is continually changing, becoming
ever more complex and affecting greater
numbers of people. Engineering students
must prepare for such challenges.
In a world of change and diverse oppor-
tunity, the key to success in engineering is a
broad, liberal education based on funda-
mental scientific concepts, coupled with the
development of a disciplined approach to
problem solving that is characteristic of the
engineering profession. But this is not
enough. The technological and social
aspects of the challenges faced by modern
society have become closely intertwined. It
is absolutely essential that an engineer's
education also include studies in the arts,
humanities, and social sciences. Let me be
more specific.
At the foundation of an engineering edu-
cation are courses in basic sciences and
mathematics. Mathematics is the language
of engineers. It provides them with a com-
pactness and accuracy of expression far
beyond that of conversational language.
Furthermore, the rules of mathematics aid
tremendously in structuring a logical
approach to problem solving.
Science courses will also play an impor-
tant role in the early years of an engineering
education. Although the primary focus will
be on courses in chemistry and physics,
many fields of engineering also require
coursework in the biological and earth
sciences.
The engineering program builds on this
foundation of science and mathematics
with a sequence of courses referred to as
engineering sciences. These include courses
in solid and fluid mechanics, thermody-
namics, materials science, and electricity
and magnetism that are common to all engi-
neering disciplines. Although such courses
have strong roots in basic science and
mathematics, they provide the bridge
between these fundamental disciplines and
engineering application.
During the later years of an engineering
education, coursework in engineering
design is introduced. These courses serve to
orient the student toward engineering prac-
tice. In particular, they introduce the
student to methods of engineering design,
including the solution of open-ended
(vaguely-defined) problems under realistic
constraints such as economic factors,
safety, environmental impact, and social
impact.
Another technical area of great impor-
tance involves modern computing methods.
Students may acquire knowledge in this
area either by taking formal courses in
computer programming and numerical
analysis or by acquiring on-the-job experi-
ence in other courses that utilize computers.
Students should not only learn how to
effectively utilize large mainframe com-
puter systems, but they should also keep
abreast of the rapid developments in micro-
computers and computer aided engineering
(CAD&amp;CAM).
Of comparable importance is the devel-
opment of skills to communicate effectively
through written, spoken, or graphical
means. Engineers cannot be successful
without an ability to communicate the
results of their labors, their ideas.
Despite the focus of engineering educa-
tion on technical courses, on science and
mathematics, the engineering student must
never lose sight of the importance of a
broad education including courses in the
arts, humanities, and social sciences. Tradi-
tional subjects in these areas include litera-
ture, history, philosophy, fine arts, eco-
nomics, sociology, and psychology. Nol
only do such courses complete the educa-
tion of an engineer, but they provide a
point of contact with the rest of society
(and with students from other disciplines).
They help the engineering student under-
stand and develop an appreciation for the
potential impact of engineering on society
and its natural environment.
Indeed, since Michigan engineers gener-
ally move rapidly into positions of leader-
ship in industry, government, and academe,
a broad and liberal education becomes of
particular importance to students in the
College. Despite the rivalry that sometimes
exists between the College of Literature,
Science, and Arts and the College of Engi-
neering, it nevertheless must be recognized
and appreciated that LSA is one of the truly
great institutions of learning, scholarship,
and teaching in the world. In a recent sur-
vey conducted in 1980, the University of
Michigan ranked third in the nation (behind
only Harvard and Princeton) in the general
quality of its undergraduate programs—to
a very large degree because of the strength
of the programs in arts and humanities
offered by LSA. These programs provide
the Michigan engineering student with a
unique rare opportunity to learn from
scholars of international reputation, to
mingle with students from other disciplines,
and to broaden their education in a way
that will better prepare them to meet the
challenges of the future.
As engineering students, I would
encourage you to prepare yourselves for an
environment of change. You must seek an
education with solid foundations in science
and mathematics. But, of equal
importance, you should strive to broaden
your studies into the arts and humanities, to
acquire the truly liberal education that will
be essential if you are to respond to the
challenges facing modern society.

Dr. Harold Rosen of Hughes has been given the prestigious Alexander Graham Bell
Medal by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers. Rosen is cred-
ited with conceiving the first practical geostationary communications satellite,
which orbits 22,300 miles high and covers over a third of the globe. Early
satellites orbited lower and would have required a large fleet and complicated
tracking procedures if continuous communications were to be provided.
Computers are being called upon to help create the "super chips" that will give
military electronics systems a tenfold increase in data processing capability.
Hughes is using computer-aided design programs to develop Very High Speed
Integrated Circuits (VHSIC) and the systems in which these chips will be used.
Computer help is essential because VHSIC chips are as complex as 100 Los Angeles
street maps printed on a thumb tack, and they themselves are mere components of
larger, more complex systems. Computer programs will help engineers design, lay
out, and test a chip. They describe an entire system at many levels of detail
simultaneously to predict performance under various operating conditions.
Landsat 4, the new second-generation Earth-watching satellite, is studying crops
and other resources in greater detail than ever before possible. The spacecraft
carries two primary instruments. One is a multispectral scanner like the ones
on previous Landsat missions. The other is a thematic mapper, whose remote-
sensing capabilities are a considerable improvement over the scanner's. The new

More than 4,500 men and women have furthered their professional careers through
the Hughes Fellowship Programs since 1949. Those who qualify are given the
opportunity to earn advanced degrees in scientific and engineering disciplines.
Under full-study programs, employees study at selected schools and work at a
company facility during the summer. Under work-study programs, employees work
part-time and carry about one-half of a full academic load at nearby schools.
More than 100 fellowships are awarded annually.
Scientists have tracked the ash plume from the Mexican volcano El Cinchon using
a weather satellite. Daylight and infrared pictures from GOES-5 (Geostationary
Operational Environmental Satellite) clearly showed the April 4 eruptions even
from 22,300 miles in space. Subsequent images revealed the plume rising high
into the stratosphere and across the Yucatan peninsula. GOES-5 was built by
Hughes and is operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Hughes needs graduates with degrees in EE, computer science, physics, ME, and
math. To learn how you can become involved in any one of 1,500 high-technology

Inside the Space Telescope
By Janice S. Bohrer
For many years, astronomers have been
saying "bigger is better" when referring to
the size of telescopes, but with the develop-
ment of the Space Telescope, this old adage
may become extinct. The advantages of
having a telescope in space have been
known for about half a century. Until re-
cently, with the introduction of the Space
Shuttle program, such a telescope was not
feasible. The launching of the Space Tele-
scope will probably be the beginning of a
new era in astronomy.
The Space Telescope is planned to be a
multi-purpose instrument equipped with a
large mirror for collection photons at
optical wavelengths and an assortment of
scientific instruments which will be used for
imaging at different wavelengths and for
determining positions in the sky. It will be
carried into space by the Space Shuttle and
placed in orbit approximately 500 kilo-
meters above the Earth.' Periodic mainte-
nance and instrumentation changes will be
made in orbit, and every five years or so the
Space Telescope will be returned to Earth,
using the Space Shuttle, for overhaul and
reinstrumentation. The expected orbital life
of the Space Telescope is 15 to 20 years.
Milestones in the development of the Space
Telescope are shown in table 1.

• Launch
Ground-based astronomy is often limited
by our atmosphere which, while allowing
human life to continue, filters out a large
majority of the electromagnetic spectrum.
Thus, a large percentage of the material
being emitted by celestial objects is inacces-
sible to ground-based astronomers. Also,
because of distortion by heat in the earth's
atmosphere and the problems caused by
overcast skies, astronomical viewing can be
difficult if not impossible. Once the Space
Telescope has been placed in orbit, it will be
able to perform its many tasks without the
worries of atmospheric filtering, haze,
twinkling, and light pollution.2 Therefore,
most of the Space Telescope's time in orbit
can be used for observation because there
will not be any atmospheric or weather limi-
tations.
"The Space Telescope will have ten limes
better resolution than ground-based tele-
scopes; it will be able to see objects that are
fifty times fainter and seven times farther
away than those we now observe. These im-
provements open up an immense new vol-
ume of space to observation."5 According
to Dr. Arthur Code of the University of
Wisconsin "... to achieve the same spatial
resolution from a ground-based telescope
that is obtainable by the Space Telescope in

a single orbit would require 2.5 x 10'' indi-

The concept of a large optical telescope
in space is not new, in fact, the National
Academy of Sciences first organized a com-
mittee to study the feasibility of a large
space telescope in 1965. The Large Space
Telescope, as the project was originally
called, was to have an aperture of three
meters but as research and development
continued, the aperture size was reduced to
2.4 meters in order to reduce the Moment
of Inertia. A number of engineering stud-
ies, sponsored by NASA, resulted in the
preliminary design for the Space Telescope.
This design based on the 2.4 meter mirror
and six scientific instruments, was approved
by the United States Congress in September
1977.
The Space Telescope vehicle can be di-
vided into four separate components: the
Optical Telescope Assembly (OTA), the
Support Systems Module (SSM), the Scien-
tific Instruments, and the Solar Array.5 The
OTA for the Space Telescope, as designed
by the Perkin-Elmer Corporation, will con-
FIGURE 1.
tain the primary and secondary mirrors, the
structure that maintains the relative posi-
tion of the two mirrors, the fine guidance
sensors, and the light baffling system, and
is pictured in figure 1. A Ritchey-Cretien
Cassegrain focusing system has been em-
ployed so that all the scientific instruments
can be accommodated at the focal plane,
which is located behind the primary mirror,
as shown in figure 2.
Two hyperboliodal reflecting surfaces
will be used to implement the focusing sys-
tem: a 2.4 meter concave mirror and a
smaller 0.31 meter convex secondary mirror
mounted on the SSM about 5 meters in
front of the primary. Incoming light is re-
flected from the primary to the secondary
mirror, where it is then directed through a
hole at the center of the large mirror and
focused a meter and a half behind the
primary mirror. This is the focal plane at
which the pick-off mirrors for the scientific
instruments will be located.7
The SSM consists of all the parts of the
Space Telescope, besides the OTA and the
Scientific Instruments, which make possible
the operation of the telescope. These func-
tions include communications, data proces-
sing, and thermal and environmental con-
trols. The telescope will carry an on-board
computer that will be responsible for the
operation of the observatory and handle the
flow of data between the telescope and the
ground. Communication with the telescope
will take place through the NASA Tracking
and Data Relay Satellite System. Informa-
tion transmitted to Earth from the telescope
will be sent to Goddard Space Flight Center
in Greenbelt, Maryland. Once received, the
data will be analyzed by the scientists at the
Space Telescope Science Institute.'
The SSM also operates the light shield as-
sembly and the combined aperture door
and sunshield that surrounds the focal
plane and scientific instruments. In addi-
tion, the SSM will operate the Solar Array,
which will be provided by the European
Space Agency and will provide the Space
Telescope with electrical power.
There will be six scientific instruments
aboard when the Space Shuttle takes off to
put the Space Telescope into orbit. The
four modular Axial Bays will contain the
faint object camera, the high resolution

Fine Guidance Sensors operate in the stigmatic field from 9 arc-min to 14 arc-min in radius.

graph, and the High Speed Photometer.
The four bays will view an unvignetted field
at distances of 3 arc-min or greater off
axis.10 Also, the Wide Field/Planetary
Camera will be a radially positioned instru-
ment using a pick-off mirror to gather in-
formation. Furthermore, the Fine Guid-
ance System can be used for astrometric
observations.
The Faint Object camera, provided by
the European Space Agency, and the Wide
Field/Planetary Camera are important for
their fields of view, spatial resolution and
wavelengths. Both cameras will cover the
ultraviolet and blue regions of the spec-
trum, and the Wide Field/Planetary Cam-
era will cover the red and near-infrared re-
gions as well. Characteristics of these two
important cameras may be found in tables 2
and 3.
The wide Field/Planetary Camera can be
operated in two modes: as a wide field
camera or as a high resolution planetary
mode, the camera is suitable for observing
planetary, galactic, and extragalactic ob-
jects. In the wide field mode, the camera
will provide a field of view large enough to
study planetary nebulas, galaxies, and clus-
ters of galaxies. The camera will be used, in
both modes, to study nearby stars in order
to determine whethery they have planetary
companions. The Faint Object camera will
challenge the full optical power of the
Space Telescope. It will record the faintest
objects visible to the telescope (28th magni-
tude). One task proposed for the Faint Ob-
ject camera will be the study of globular
clusters for the presence of white dwarf
stars. These studies will be useful in testing
the theoretical models of stellar evolution.''
The High Resolution and Faint Object
Spectrographs (tables 4 and 5) will both
record ultraviolet radiation, and the Faint
Object Spectrograph will also cover the
visible and red regions of the spectrum.
The spectrographs will break the incoming
light into separate beams according to wave-
length. The Faint Object Spectrograph will
be able to observe stellar objects having
bandwidths as small as 1/lOOOth of the
wavelength of the incoming light (a reso-
lution of 1.000). When higher spectral
resolution is required, the High Resolution
Spectrograph will be utilized. This will
allow narrow spectral features, which might
be overlooked by the Faint Object Spectro-
graph . to be detected. Additionally, the High
Resolution Spectrograph will be equipped
with six interchangeable diffraction gratings
which will disperse light of different wave-
lengths in different directions."
The High Speed Photometer (table 6) will
be used to measure rapid brightness vari-
ability over short time intervals, ultraviolet

This instrument can operate at two different focal ratios: f/12.88 or f/30.
In the first mode, the instrument is refefred to as the Wide Field Camera
(WFC) and, in the second mode, as the Planetary Camera (PC). Pictures
can be taken, in either mode, with any one of a wide variety of spectral fil-
ters or transmission gratings.

ments. It is designed to make extremely ac-
curate measurements of the intensity of
light from astronomical sources over a wide
range of wavelengths. The photometer, be-
cause of its ability to distinguish events
separated by intervals of only ten micro-
seconds, will be valuable in determining the
possible locations of black holes, and in
identifying faint objects previously ob-
served at radio and x-ray wavelengths.'3
The Fine Guidance System will provide the
last two scientific instruments (table 7). The
first, the guidance system, will be used for
pointing the telescope, and then for main-
taining the proper alignment required for
observation tasks. The guidance system will
also provide an astrometer, which will be
used to measure angular distance between
the stars. The astrometer will be able to ac-
curately determine the position of visual
stars up to 17th magnitude, and to measure
the positions of ten stars in ten minutes. Be-
cause the accuracy of stellar parallax mea-
sured from the earth's surface is limited by
the atmosphere, the apparent diameter of
stellar images is increased to at least one
arc-second. On the Space Telescope the
images will have a diameter of about 0.1
arc-second. Thus, parallax measurements
from the Space Telescope will have 10 times
the precision possible from the ground.14
Proposed projects for the Fine Guidance
Sensors and the Astrometer include: gather-
ing positional information of the natural
satellites of the outer planets; unseen com-
panions; and establishing an inertia! frame
of reference relative to quasars and selected
radio sources."
Once the Space Telescope is placed in or-
bit, the Space Telescope Science Institute
will be responsible for the operation of the
telescope. The responsibilities of the Science
Institute will include observer selection,
scheduling, observations, data handling,
and data archiving. The Association of
Universities for Research in Astronomy
(AURA) will be coordinating the observing
program, and will be responsible for the
Science Institute. It will be located on the
campus of Johns Hopkins University, and
will support a permanent staff of 150, in-
cluding 40 astronomers. NASA will support
the Science Institute throughout the lifetime
of the Space Telescope."
The potential of the Space Telescope is so
great that not only do astronomers see un-
limited possibilities for new and improved
knowledge, but most of the world scientific
community sees the first few years of the
Space Telescope's observations to be the be-
ginning of a new era of scientific discover-
ies. With this in mind, many exciting and
new research programs will be carried out
using the extended range of the Space Tele-
scope's instruments. Among the planned
subjects to be studied is the study of
celestial objects which exist under condi-

Scientists and astronomers are looking
forward to the proposed launch date (1985)

that it will begin a new era of discovery

placed on ground-based astronomy by the
earth's atmosphere and weather will not
hamper the operation of the Space Tele-

jects, phenomena, and processes will prove
that space is indeed the final frontier.

A recent finding at the General Motors Research
Laboratories has changed scientific thinking about
the behavior of electrons in metal surfaces. This discovery
provides a greater understanding of the fundamental
physical processes involved in such surface events as
adhesion, corrosion and catalysis.

Figure I: Energy distribution of electrons in
outermost atomic layer. Shaded area indicates
electrons in surface states.
Figure 2: Two electron density contour maps of
the cross section of a Cu{ 100) surface. One map
shows a clean copper surface (It. gray), the other
showsa nitrogen covered copper surface (dk. gray).
CONVENTIONAL scientific-
thought treats virtually all
of the valence electrons found in
the surface atomic layer of a
metal as if they are free to roam
throughout the metal's interior.
The work of three physicists at
the General Motors Research Lab-
oratories suggests otherwise.
Through calculations confirmed
by experimental data, the
theorists have shown that more
than a quarter of the valence elec-
trons in the top atomic layer of
some metals are effectively
trapped in the surface. The pres-
ence of so many "surface state"
electrons must be considered
when analyzing physical and
chemical surface phenomena, in-
cluding such surface events as ox-
idation leading to corrosion.

Drs. John Smith. Jack Gay
and Frank Arlinghaus applied
their theoretical analysis to the
(100) surface of five metals: cop-
per, nickel, silver, rhodium and
palladium. They made bold predic-
tions concerning the percentage
of electrons in the surface atomic
layer to be found in surface states:
Cu(36%), Ni(23ft), Ag(23U
Rh(23^) and Pd(19cr).The ratio of
the shaded area to the hatched
area of figure 1 gives the percent-
age for copper.
Electrons in surface states
are not only abundant, but also
highly localized on the surface.
Chemisorption on a metal is also
confined to the surface region.
Figure 2 shows what happens in
the case of nitrogen chemisorbed
on copper. The two contour maps
coincide except in the surface
layer, where the interaction is
largely exhibited. Localization of
the interaction holds for the chemi-
sorption of other gases, including
oxygen in the initial stage of
metal oxidation. These observa-
tions led the physicists to conclude
that surface states are important
in chemisorption.
One way to probe electrons
in surfaces is to chemisorb atoms
on a clean metal surface and look
for changes in photoemission
spectra. Such an experiment was
performed at GM for fractional
monolayers of nitrogen, oxygen
and sulfur on Cu(lOO). The domi-
nant change in the photoemission
spectrum was the disappearance
of a large peak whose shape and


of the chemisorbed atom. It was of
special interest that the shape and
energy location of this peak was
nearly identical to the envelope
around the surface state peaks in
figure 1. This suggests that sur-
face state electrons play a major
role in the chemisorption process.
T
I HE THEORETICAL ad-
A vance at the heart of the dis-
covery is the "Self-Consistent
Local Orbital (SCLO) Method" for
solving the Schrodinger equation.
This new mathematical method
was devised by the GM theorists
to handle the classic dilemma
posed by the self-consistency re-
quirement. The characterization of
electron behavior used to com-
plete the equation must be consis-
tent with the behavior predicted
by the equation. In other words,
one almost needs to know the an-
swer in order to make the calcula-
tion.
Self-consistent solution of
the equation for a metal surface is
made exceedingly difficult by the
three-dimensional nature of the
electron density distribution. The
theorists dealt with this challenge
successfully by dividing the elec-
tron density distribution into two
parts-the first part due to over-
lapping atomic density distribu-
tions; the second part equaling the
difference between this atomic
contribution and the exact density
distribution.
One of the more stringent
tests of the accuracy of the SCLO
method was an angular photo-
emission experiment conducted
by Heimann et al., at the Univer-
sity of Munich subsequent to pub-
lication of the GM research. The
German research team confirmed
a prominent surface state band
predicted by the three GM physi-
cists. This was the first time a
surface state band on a solid had
been calculated prior to its being
seen experimentally. The SCLO
method makes possible something
that could not be done before—ac-
curate prediction of the actual be-
havior of electrons whirling
around nuclei at the surface of a
metal.
"The large body of surface
states we found on metal sur-
faces," says Dr. Smith, "may be a
controlling factor in many physi-
cal and chemical surface phenom-
ena. By replacing conjecture with
calculation, the new surface theo-
retical methods give us the means
to make major steps forward in
the analysis of surface and inter
face properties."

The future of transportation is here


By W. R. Epperly
The development of synthetic fuels offers
multiple challenges to the technical com-
munity. In this paper I shall describe the
potential that exists for synthetic fuels in
both the United States and the rest of the
world, the wide variety of synthetic-fuel
technologies with which Exxon is involved,
and the technical resources required for a
synthetic-fuels industry.
The Potential for Synthetic Fuels
A look at oil reserves and production in-
dicates that in the future we will need addi-
tional sources of hydrocarbon liquids.
Worldwide, the rate of discover of oil re-
serves increased from about 1945 to 1965,
as shown in Figure 1, due in part to sub-
stantial discoveries in the Middle East.
However, the rate of discovery dropped
sharply in this 1970s, actually falling below
the rate of production. This trend —de-
creasing reserves and increasing production
— is predicted to continue through the rest
of this century, resulting ultimately in a
shortage of oil. Furthermore, increased ex-
ploration and discovery, the logical re-
sponses to dwindling supply, are expected
to be more difficult in the future because of
more difficult geological and, in some
cases, political environments. These diffi-
culties most likely will raise both explora-
tion costs and the costs of final products.

The rate of gas discoveries underwent
similar increases through 1970 and then
started to decline, as shown in Figure 2.
However, gas differs from oil in that the
rates of discovery are projected to exceed
production for the rest of this century.
Oil and gas captured 65% of the growth
in energy use during the 1970s, as shown in
Figure 3, although the rate of discovery was
decreasing and two worldwide supply dis-
ruptions occurred during the decade. By
comparison, oil and gas captured 87% of
the growth in energy during the 1960s.
The United States presents no exception
to a world that is relying more heavily on oil

and gas. Much of the increasing demand in
the United States is projected to be met by
unsecured sources (Figure 4), which are
defined as new discoveries, imports, and
synthetics. (By a similar definition, the
secured sources comprise domestic produc-
tion from existing reserves.) By the year
2000, the total requirement for oil and gas
from unsecured sources is expected to ap-
proach 16 million barrels per day.
The opportunities to minimize imports
rest with new discoveries, synthetics, and
additional conservation. By our outlook,
U.S. production of synthetic fuels is ex-
pected to be roughly 2.5 million barrels per
day by the year 2000, but this forecast is un-
certain. The actual amount will depend on
the economics of specific projects and on
the availability of capital and personnel.
In the future, the United States could
emerge as the leader in the production of
synthetic fuels because of its large coal and
oil-shale resources and its need to reduce
long-term dependence on oil imports. A
comparison of fossil-energy resources with
current production (Figure 5) indicates that
coal and oil shale are relatively abundant in
the United States. Although oil and gas ac-
count for 80% of our fossil-energy produc-
tion today, they constitute only 5% of our
fossil resources. In contrast, coal accounts
for about 20% of our fossil-energy produc-
tion today, but, together with oil shale, it
constitutes 95% of our resources.

reasonable alternative resource—which, in
addition to supply and economics, needs to
be considered in managing our energy fu-
ture. The statistics emphasize the impor-
tance of developing new technologies cap-
able of converting that alternative resource
(coal and oil shale) to liquid and gaseous
hydrocarbon fuels as efficiently as possible.
's Experience with Synthetic Fuels
Our experience indicates that the devel-
opment of new technologies for energy pro-
duction requires several technical steps and,
as a result, extensive lead time. Figure 6 is a
hypothetical example of the activities that
might be required in developing a synthetic-
fuels technology, assuming an adequate
economic incentive. Advancing in tech-
nology through the normal stages of devel-
opment, from R&amp;D through a large pilot
plant to a first commercial (or "pioneer")
plant, and then to multiple commercial
plants, may require 20 to 25 years. Some
five years of development would precede
the design and construction of the large
pilot plant that would demonstrate the feas-
ibility of a synthetic-fuels technology; de-
sign and construction of this large pilot
plant would require three to four years. If it
»ere then operated for one year before be-
ginning the design of a commercial plant, a
minimum of nine to ten years would have
elapsed from the time that an idea comes
from exploratory research to the time when
ii is possible to begin the design of the pio-
neer commercial plant.
Exxon is engaged in four important syn-
detic-fuels programs that cover the range
ol development from R&amp;D to commercial
plants (Figure 7). These are the Catalytic
Coal Gasification (CCG) Program, which is
in the R&amp;D stage; the Exxon Donor Solvent
'EDS) coal-liquefaction program, which is
in the large pilot-plant stage; the Colony
oil-shale retorting project, which is in the
pioneer-plant stage; and the East Texas syn-
thetics project, which uses coal-conversion
technology that has been demonstrated
commercially. All of these projects except
&lt;he last will be described in the technical
Papers in this volume. Studies to define the
facilities and cost of the East Texas project
are underway; we will use them in deciding
*hether to proceed with construction.

Companies that participate in commer-
cializing synthetic-fuels plants will need
many more engineers. The U.S. Depart-
ment of Energy has recently studied the
engineering requirements for designing,
constructing, and operating an entire syn-
thetic-fuels industry that would produce
three million barrels per day by the year
2000. (This, you will note, is somewhat
higher than Exxon's estimate of 2.5 million
barrels per day.) The study estimated that
the number of engineers required would be
7,000 by 1990 and 11,000 by 2000, depend-
ing on the maturity of the technology and
the number of operating plants. Although
these totals appear manageable, they repre-
sent increases over an already large poten-
tial demand for engineers. Thus, the devel-
oping synthetic-fuels industry could pose
additional challenges to colleges and univer-
sities to supply engineering graduates,
especially those with critical engineering
skills.
At ER&amp;E, we will experience similar re-
quirements for engineers in developing our
synthetic-fuels projects. As Mr. Rohr has
mentioned, the current Exxon Engineering
population consists of chemical, mechani-
cal, electrical, and civil engineers, with a
small percentage of engineers in the materi-
als, environmental industrial, and minerals
disciplines. In general, our work in capital
projects can be divided into three phases:
planning, basic design, and project man-
agement. Capital projects include large
pilot plants as well as commercial activities.
In the planning phase, which includes pro-
cess selection, site selection, and definition
of offsite facilities, we rely heavily on
chemical engineers, with some participation
of mechanical and civil engineers. In the
basic-design phase, chemical and mechani-
cal engineers are heavily involved in onsite
process design and in specifications for off-
site facilities. In the project-management
phase, we depend primarily on mechanical
and civil engineers, with some support from
electrical and chemical engineers, to select
contractors and then to work with them to
advance the project optimally. In all three
phases, environmental engineers and mate-
rials and minerals specialists are involved in
various ways.
We realize, of course, that the synthetic-
fuels technologies may require engineering
and management skills beyond those devel-
oped in the past. Additional challenges,
then, will be to identify and to develop
these new skills and techniques and to inte-
grate them into the technologies being
developed.
Conclusions
In summary, the world energy outlook
indicates a need for alternative sources of
energy, including synthetic fuels. Exxon
Engineering, with diverse engineering skills,
is pursuing programs to develop technolo-
gies capable of providing a wide range of
synthetic fuels. This volume provides an
overview of some of these activities.

Learning by Doing in the
Department of Aerospace Engineering
by Greg Thomas
In this issue of the Michigan Technic we
would like to introduce you to the Depart-
ment of Aerospace Engineering here at the
University of Michigan. The department,
one of the finest in the nation, consists of
the technical areas of gas dynamics, flight
mechanics and control, structural mechan-
ics, and an interdepartmental program in
Computer Information and Control Engi-
neering. The major research facilities
include a 5 foot x 7 foot wind tunnel which
generates test velocities up to 170 mph. It
provides low turbulence air flow and a long
test section for representative earth-surface
boundary layers. Besides testing airplanes
and road vehicles, the tunnel has been used
to investigate airflow around buildings and
oil tankers. The problems associated with
high wind velocities at the base of tall build-
ings and the recirculation of exhaust stack
gases are two examples of air flow problems
that can be analyzed with wind tunnel tests.
There is also a supersonic wind tunnel cap-
able of velocities around Mach 5 (five times
the speed of sound). A major part of the
departmental research is conducted in the
Gas Dynamics Laboratories on problems
which relate to turbulence, combustion, ex-
plosions, and propulsion.
An aim of the department is to get the
students some experience along with the
fundamental background they receive in the
classroom. They are doing this by offering
hands on experience to students at a lower
level. This research is sponsored by both the
federal government and by private indus-
tries. Some research is under an indepen-
dent study program. The experimental
background for research is given in the re-
quired undergraduate courses, Aero 301
and 302. It is this cooperation between
school, students, and industry that enable
the students to graduate with an excellent
education and some research experience
that will be of value to both industry and
government.
In future issues of the Technic, we will
report on the progress of another student
research project, offered in the form of a
class, called the "getaway special". The class
develops an experiment for use in the
payload bay of the Space Shuttle which is to
be launched next year.
Explosions and Flame Propagation Studies
One field of study at the University of
Michigan in the Department of Aerospace
Engineering is the field of combustion. The
topic of combustion has wide application
and pertains to turbine engines, rocket
motors, reciprocation engines, mixing of
fuel and air in preparing for combustion,
atomization of fuel (regulation of the
amount and the droplet size), and explo-
sions. The field of combustion is studied in
the Gas Dynamics Laboratories, which are
headed by Professor J. A. Nicholls. I spoke
with him to find out what research they are
currently doing in the labs. Something I
found interesting was that a great deal of
the research did not include propulsion of
airplanes and rockets. Actually it involved
the study of grain elevator explosions and
coal mine explosions.
As you well know, these types of explo-
sions kill many people, injure many more,
and cause millions of dollars worth of pro-
perty damage each year. In grain elevators,
the dust collects on walls and equipment
inside the elevators and some is dispersed
into the air. This is caused by the constant
motion and handling of the grain as it is put
into storage or recalled for external distri-
bution. Ignition may occur by a spark, a
cigarette, contact with a piece of hot metal
or a hot belt, or by many other means.
Rapid burning of the dust may cause a tre-
mendous pressure wave out in front of the
flame front. This wave causes much of the
damage.
The research in the Department includes
a study of how fast the flame propagates
and the turbulence associated with the
flame. These investigations are also useful
in learning more about turbulent flow in
turbine and rocket engines. Work is being
done to learn more about this turbulent
flow in hopes of developing a mathematical
model of how fuel is mixed and how it be-
haves when being burned. The mixing of
the fuel in a combustion jet engine has some

in a grain elevator. By studying the proper-
ties of the fuel/air or grain/air mixture a
great deal can be learned to help promote
the combustion (in the case of propulsion)
or prohibit the combustion (in the case of
grain elevators and coal mines). Some grad-
uate students have developed a unique
spherical apparatus that enables the re-
searcher to have a uniformly distributed
dust/air mixture throughout the sphere. Ig-
nition of the mixture at the center then
allows the outward propagating turbulent
flame to be studied. The pherical bomb is
shown in figure 1.
The ultimate purpose of these grain dust
-tudies is to make the grain elevators more
afer. Installation of vacuum systems at
locations around the elevators where a
majority of the dust collects, in order to
remove the dust, is a step in the right
direction. But then it is desireable to return
:he dust (after all, it is still grain) to the
grain, but only at a safe location. Also,
some common sense rules help keep the in-
cidences of grain elevator explosions down
to a minimum. One is to keep the area clean
and swept out. Also avoid anything that
could ignite the material such as sparks,
cigarettes, or friction that would form
enough heat for ignition.
Other research in the gas dynamics labs is
involved with turbo jet engines. They study
the effects of varying the fuel mixture by
controlling the atomization characteristics
(droplet size of the fuel) to optimize propul-
sion and emmissions. They are also devel-
oping a spray distribution analyzer by using
a holographic process which involves using
laser light interference with particles and
putting this image in 3 dimensions on a
photo plate.
It is obvious that the department of
Aerospace Engineering works on more than
just airplanes and Space Shuttles. You can
see why its graduate and undergraduate
programs are ranked among the top univer-
sities in the nation.

study of the propagation of flames.
A Student/Staff Research Project
in the Wind Tunnel
In these times of energy conscious con-
sumers, many people are trying to find new
ways to conserve energy in all aspects of our
life. Here at the Department of Aerospace
Engineering, a program has been developed
10 give more students the opportunity to re-
ceive experience in the engineering field by
doing meaningful research. This program is
called the Industry/University Cooperative
Research Program. Roger Van Gunst is su-
pervising the research conducted by stu-
dents in this program who are working with
the 5 x 7 foot wind tunnel to develop a low
drag cargo plane configuration. Their task
is to reduce the afterbody drag of a typical
design of the aircraft to improve on their
;uel consumption. Roger Van Gunst is us-
ing a variety of ideas to tackle this problem.
These ideas include the use of devices to
eliminate the vortices formed over the fuse-
lage afterbody or to reduce their adverse ef-
fects on the afterbody flow field.
To test these configurations a model had
10 be developed for use in the 5 x 7 foot
*ind tunnel. A 0.030 scale model was built
from a rough-cut mahogany fuselage and
*'ing provided by the Lockheed-Georgia
Company. The initial phase of this drag re-
duction study was devoted to examining the
flow field characteristics associated with the
model afterbody region. This test was done
by using an oil smear. The oil smear is a
mixture of motor oil and fluorescent green
dye. With the air flowing around the
model, areas of separated flow are indi-
cted on the surface by an accumulation of
October, 1982
the oil mixture. When used in conjunction
with ultraviolet light, the photographed dye
pattern provides a map of the surface flow
characteristics. When the photograph
shows the mixture to be thin or "blown
off, this indicates that the flow is attached
to the surface. The object is to obtain a
configuration which has well attached flow-
over the entire surface. The flow field over
such a surface would sweep the oil mixture
off the surface indicating a high energy
boundary layer and a low form drag design.
Aerodynamic surfaces called strakes and
air in injection are being investigated as
possible means of eliminating the flow field
vortices. The strakes are short wings
mounted on one end to the model surface.
They are placed at various locations and
orientations to study their effects on the
vortices. Air injection involves injecting air
into the vortex flow field to determine its
disruptive effects on the vortices.
To minimize the adverse effects of the
vortices, a device was used in order to main-

layer near the surface. Professor A. M.
Kuethe has developed and patented this
device called a wave element. A semi-
circular cross-section was used for the two
element legs which are joined together at
one end on a V-shaped configuration (see
figure 2). The angle between this conjunc-
tion and the length of the two element legs
are varied in the study to identify an opti-
mum configuration. Care must be taken in
placing the wave elements at the best loca-
tion, because the wrong location could pro-
duce more drag than it reduces. It would do
so by placing it in an already high energy
location.
This cooperative research program, spon-
sored by the Lockheed-Georgia Company,
will not only serve the airline industry, but
it also enhances the students' education.
The objective of this program is to provide
staff-supervised student participation in re-
search projects identified and supported by
industry. The program provides quality re-
search and the application of classroom
concepts to meaningful research projects by
the engineering students. The cooperative
research program would provide the engi-
neering student with the opportunity to
learn current engineering practices con-
comitantly with the classroom theory. Sci-
entific equipment, methods and concepts
are combined in performing research tasks.
Student participation would typically
evolve through an increasingly technical
role in the research effort. This participa-
tion would enhance the appreciation for
concepts taught in the classroom and pro-
vide the experience and skills to be an
effective member of a research team. This
program would serve as an opportunity for
employment or an alternative to the
employment unrelated to engineering now
held by a number of students. Thus student
engineering capability would be enhanced
with a minimal increase in student work-
load.
Combine this program with the Univer-
sity facilities (e.g., libraries, model shop,
wind tunnels) and the outstanding faculty,
and there exists a tremendous opportunity
for the Aerospace department to soar (par-
don the pun) into the unexplored realms in
the field of Aerospace.

New on the Market
This section presents news releases of
products on the market. Section compiled
by Anne Mazurek.
Cadlinc Introduces Multi-Window Unix™ Extension
To Its Graphic Computer Series
ELK GROVE VILLAGE, 111. (August
20, 1982)-CADLINC. Inc. announced to-
day it has introduced new operating system
software that permits operator interaction
with up to 16 processes simultaneously on a
single display.
The CADLINC multi-window operating
system is another major innovation in the
company's program to develop and market
user-friendly, mechanical CAD/CAM
workstation systems.
The new operating system is an extension
of the UNIX™ V7 operating system, fea-
tured in the CADLINC Graphic Computer
series. The extension supports up to 16 si-
multaneous windows, each having full
UNIX facilities access as would be the case
with as many seperate terminal devices.
"The multi-window design was executed
to insure that programs written to run
under UNIX V7 are compatible to our ex-
tended version of the operating system,"
said Dr. Martin Newell, CADLINC direc-
tor of research and development. "The
effect to the user is like having 16 terminals,
all presented on a single display and each
having full access to the UNIX
environment."
Developed at CADLINC's research and
development facility in Palo Alto, Calif.,
the multi-window operating system is avail-
able as part of the CADLINC Graphic
Computer series of distributed CAD/CAM
workstations, and to OEM's on a licensing
basis. Major applications of the new system
are in engineering, graphics, computer-
aided design (CAD) and computer-aided
manufacturing (CAM), Dr. Newell said.
Citing a typical application of multiple
windows in CAD/CAM, he said a designer
might need to view a sub-assembly while
creating a detailed assembly drawing.
Rather than exiting the drafting package,
the designer can now simply produce
another display window on the same screen
and use it to view a new area of the graphic
database.
"The new multi-window operating system
vastly increases efficiency over traditional
systems by providing faster access to data-
bases and enabling the user to view more
than one display at a time on the same
screen," Dr. Newell concluded.
The CADLINC Graphic Computer series
is based on the MULTIBUS™ system using
a 68000™ CPU. Software tools include
UNIX V7 and Fortran 77 and C compilers.
In addition to memory and I/O expansion,
the system offers floating point and disk
expansion with ETHERNET™ networking
capability.
CADLINC, Inc. developes, manufac-
tures and markets CAD/CAM and
graphics-related computer systems, and is
headquartered at 1872 Brummel Ave., Elk
Grove Village, III. 60007, telephone (312)
228-7300. Research and development cen-
ters are located in Palo Alto, Calif., and
Troy, Mich. Sales, and service and applica-
tions support facilities are located in Chica-
go, Los Angeles, Boston and Detroit.

Michigan Technic


100, 75, 50, 25 years ago
By Doug Smith
100 Years Ago
A century ago the Technic was an annual
publication and the articles were reprints of
papers that had been read before the Engi-
neering Society. One such article, titled
"The Care and Management of Steam
Boilers," was a pertinent topic for an era
powered almost exclusively by steam.
Young engineers were informed,
...in the practice of your profession, you
will continually meet with circumstances
requiring the use of steam and often you will
be called upon to exercise your judgement in
the selection and purchase of steam machin-
ery, and in the care and management of such
machinery when in operation.
The article covered such points as
selection and purchase of boilers, boiler
corrosion, cleaning fires and the rather sala-
cious matter of getting up steam.
75 Years Ago
In 1907 a University wide telephone
system was completed. Planning and instal-
lation were done by the Michigan State
Telephone Company, which was a precur-
sor to Michigan Bell.
Because the Regents wanted a system that
could be used by senior classes in telephone
engineering, the Bell engineers designed a
skeletal phone circuit showing all the
operations and signals necessary to connect
*0 telephones. In addition, equipment was
provided to find breaks in wires, crosses
between wires, grounds, etc.
The switchboard, located in the Electrical
Department of the New Engineering Build-
ing (West Engineering), consisted of sixty-
six phone lines and five trunk lines but had
the capacity for 300 phones and 10 trunk
lines. Current was supplied by an 11 cell, 24
volt battery with 60 ampere-hours of
capacity which was sufficient to provide
phone service for several days. The battery
would then be recharged by a mercury arc
rectifier which was rated at 10 amperes and
changed the city's alternating current to
direct current.
50 Years Ago
In October 1932 an advertisement gave a
schedule of lectures to be given by such
notables as the adventurer Lowell Thomas;
the great educator Will Durant; and Wil-
liam Butler Yeats.
A section called "Transit Slants" gave
some of the current jokes (?).
Mrs. Housewife: I'd like to buy a wrench.
Hardware clerk: A monkey wrench?
Mrs. Housewife: Er, no, I think my hus-
band wants the big baboon size.
"Why do you go out on the front porch
whenever I sing? Don't you like to hear
me?"
"It isn't that. I want the neighbors to see
that I am not beating my wife."
Miss Punk: I'll never trust any man in
the dark.
Mr. Funk: It's a cinch you have nothing to
fear in the daytime.
Maxine: What kind of fellow is Ralph?
Lucile: Well, when we were together
last night the lights went out and he
spent the rest of the evening repairing
the fuse.
25 Years Ago
Engineers were in great demand just as
they are today and students were being en-
couraged to enter the field. An article
appearing in the Technic told these budding
engineers what to expect in their first job.
Newly hired engineers would spend many
hours in the drafting room working with
blueprints, sketches, etc. The article also
suggested that they should acquire a
thorough understanding of the technical
aspects of their company's product before
moving into sales or management.
A column entitled "Technic Spotlights
Progress" reported on the recent develop-
ments in fuel cell technology. Scientists
working at the Research Laboratories of
National Carbon Company, a division of
Union Carbide, had developed the first fuel
cell to economically generate thousands of
watts of power. This major breakthrough
was due to the development of advanced
porous electrodes through which the gases
entered the cell. These chemically treated,
carbon electrodes also conducted the elec-
tricity produced by the cell.
The new fuel cell, operating at ambient
temperature and atmospheric pressure, had
an efficiency of 65-80%. Prior to this, fuel
cells could only be operated at high temper-
atures or pressures. Voltage across the
electrodes was approximately one volt, and
it was simply a matter of connecting several
fuel cells to satisfy a given voltage require-
ment. The cell's performance was more
than adequate considering several cells had
been running in the lab 8 hours a day, 5
days a week for close to a year.
An article titled "Computers" traced the
history of modern computers from Bab-
bage's Analytical Engine to the then state of
the art Univac, IBM 650, 705, 709 and
RCA's Bizmac. Both digital and analog
computers were discussed and their ancil-
lary equipment, input and output devices.
Also included was a short section on com-
puter logic and arithmetic. According to the
article, the future would see computers used
in foreign language translation, weather
prediction, and automation. Hey, what
about playing Pac Man on your Atari!!

Electronics at Kodak*
Putting good things

Kodak popularized
amateur photog-
raphy when
we mass-
produced
photo-
graphic dry
plates, leading
to the develop-
ment of cameras
that could be held
in your hand. More
recently, we intro-
duced the Kodak disc
camera—a camera in
which integrated circuits make the deci-
sions, automatically, at the touch of the
shutter release.
Today, integrated electronic components de-
signed and fabricated at Kodak are built into
a wide variety of our cameras. But it takes
more than the electronics in our cameras to
place us among the nation's top companies in
sales of electronics-related equipment.
It takes innovative engineers working on
projects
that use a
microcom-
puter-based
software devel-
opment system
to debug applica-
tion programs for
Kodak Ektaprint
copier-duplicators.
And the development
of ongoing product im-
provements in the Kodak Komstar 300 micro-
image processor, a computer peripheral which
uses pulsed laser beams to convert digital
data to alphanumeric images on microfilm, at
speeds up to 20 times faster than many ink-
jet paper printers.

factory
The world wants long-lasting,
high quality products, now.
And robots fit perfectly into this
scheme of things: They can
make those products - quickly,
easily and accurately
What kinds of robots? There
is GE's Allegro,'- for one.
It can position a part to within
1/1000th of an inch-or about Va
the thickness of the paper this
article is printed on. Or there's
GP132 (shown here). This
loader, unloader, packer,
stacker and welder - can lift
and maneuver 132 pounds with
no trouble at all.
So what's left for me to teach
robots? You might ask. Consid-
er this glimpse into the future
by Dr. Roland W. Schmitt, head
of GE corporate research and
development:
"One of the big frontiers
ahead of us is putting the
robot's nervous system
together with some senses -
like vision, or touch, or the abil-
ity to sense heat or cold That
can give you an adaptive robot,
one that can sense how well it's
doing its job and make the
adjustments needed to do that
job better."
That's a tall order. And one
we'll be expecting you to fill.
With foresight, talent, imagina-
tion-all the things that robots
have yet to learn.
